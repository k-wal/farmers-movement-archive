Already its public hospitals are nearly overwhelmed.The speech by the U.N. chief took aim at the vast inequality of wealth — “The 26 richest people in the world hold as much wealth as half the global population,” Guterres said — and other inequalities involving race, gender, class and place of birth.These, he said, are seen in the world’s fragmented response to the pandemic as governments, businesses and even individuals are accused of hoarding badly needed testing, medical and other supplies for themselves.The legacy of colonialism still reverberates, Guterres added, and it shows in global power relations.Developing countries, and especially African nations, are under-represented at the levels of power including at financial institutions like the World Bank and political ones like the U.N. Security Council, whose five most powerful members — the U.S., Britain, France, Russia and China — date from the 1940s when the world body was created.“Inequality starts at the top: in global institutions. Addressing inequality must start by reforming them,” Guterres said, offering some solutions.A new generation of social protection is needed, including universal health coverage and perhaps maybe even a universal basic income he said, adding “individuals and corporations must pay their fair share.”Education spending in low and middle-income countries should more than double by 2030 to $3 trillion a year, he said. And in the face of enormous shifts due to climate change, governments should tax carbon instead of people.Answering questions after his speech, Guterres called for “massive support” for the developing world including debt write-offs. He said the suspension of debt payments until the end of this year, which was agreed upon by the G-20, the world’s 20 major economic powers, “is clearly not enough.”And he noted, without naming names, that “leadership and power are not always aligned.”“Let’s face facts,” Guterres said in his address. “The global political and economic system is not delivering on critical global public goods: public health, climate action, sustainable development, peace.”The U.N. chief called for a new model of global governance with inclusive and equal participation.“We see the beginnings of a new movement,” he said, adding it’s time to right the wrongs of the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-at-the-breaking-point-due-to-inequalities-says-un-chief/story-J39RgXi0cbsKCO7gUXaCxJ.html
18-07-2020||World||Russia is trying to beat the west to a Covid-19 vaccine||A top Russian official said his country could roll out a vaccine against Covid-19 as soon as September, while denying accusations that hackers working for the country’s intelligence agency tried to steal sensitive data from rival researchers in the U.K., U.S. and Canada.“Russia may be one of the first to produce a vaccine against the backdrop of the billions that are being invested in the U.S. and all the pharma companies working on it,” said Kirill Dmitriev, the chief executive of the government-backed Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which is financing one of the the country’s efforts to devise a vaccine. “It’s a little bit of a shocking story.”President Vladimir Putin has made finding a vaccine a top priority. Russia has recorded more than 750,000 Covid-19 cases, making it the fourth most-affected country in the world. In Russia’s race to be the first to find a vaccine against Covid-19, it’s taking an approach that would be shunned in other countries, claiming it will know in just three months of trials whether its leading candidate works. If Russia proclaims success in the hunt for a vaccine before other candidates, it could create a world of duelling vaccines and geopolitical battles over who gets supplies. Dmitriev’s comments came after the U.K., U.S. and Canada said hackers working with the group APT29, part of Russian military intelligence, had used malware to try to seize vaccine research. Dmitriev said Russia had no need to steal information from rival vaccine developers because it had already signed a deal with AstraZeneca Plc to manufacture the University of Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine at R-Pharm, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in Russia. He said AstraZeneca is transferring the entire technological process and all ingredients for the full reproduction of the vaccine in Russia.“Everything that is needed to produce the British vaccine has already been transferred to R-Pharm,” he said. “AstraZeneca has already signed commitments to transfer all production of the British vaccine to R-Pharm.’AstraZeneca didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. It isn’t clear whether AstraZeneca would transfer all the technology needed for Russia to produce the vaccine or if the agreement involves the British pharma giant sending the vaccine seed stock to manufacturers needed to begin production.Some Western experts remain skeptical that Russia has the expertise to produce its own vaccine by September. “We don’t think that’s realistic,” said Peter Shapiro, a pharmaceutical analyst at the research firm GlobalData, cautioning that Russia, like other countries, could approve the vaccine for political reasons. “The regulatory hurdles in Russia are low.”Nor is it likely that such a vaccine, if indeed approved in Russia, would find favor in the West, Shaprio said. “We don’t see a history of innovative vaccines being developed in Russia that win approval” in major markets like the U.S., Japan and Western Europe, he said. “Russia is not a major producer of export quality drugs or biologics.”Global BattleThe U.S., Western Europe and China have all set up research programs and supply chains for Covid-19 vaccine production. While the negotiations with AstraZeneca offer Russia the chance for doses of the Oxford vaccine if it proves successful, the global battle to secure supplies could leave Russia struggling to access other potentially successful vaccines, increasing pressure to advance its own program.Dmitriev said he’s so confident in Russia’s leading vaccine candidate that he’s taken it himself and had his whole family vaccinated, including his parents,  who are in their seventies. The vaccine, financed by RDIF and developed by the state-backed Gamaleya Institute in Moscow, has completed a phase 1 trial in 50 people, all of whom are members of the Russian military. The institute hasn’t published results.The vaccine is one of 26 experimental shots in development in Russia, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova said on July 15.  Gamaleya’s candidate is a viral vector vaccine based on a human adenovirus — a common cold virus — fused with the spike protein of SARS CoV-2 to stimulate an immune response. It is similar to a vaccine China’s CanSino Biologics intends to move into trials in Canada, one of the countries targeted by Russian hackers. Initial results from CanSino’s trial showed the vaccine had a diminished effect in some people who had a pre-existing immunity to the adenovirus. Dmitriev said researchers in Russia are testing two different types of adenovirus vectors in order to reduce the chances of pre-existing immunity reducing the vaccine’s effectiveness. That vaccine will start phase 3 trials in thousands of people on Aug. 3 in Russia as well as in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Dmitriev said. Russia could make 30 million doses domestically in 2020, and 170 million abroad, with five countries expressing interest in producing the vaccine and others willing to produce it, he said.Besides manufacturing vaccines for AstraZeneca, R-Pharm will make the country’s own vaccine at its production sites in Russia. Alium Pharmaceutical Holding, based in Moscow and owned by billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov’s Sistema PJFSC, has also agreed to manufacture doses of Russia’s leading vaccine candidate, Dmitriev said.Unusual MoveRussia’s rapid approach to vaccine development differs from Western Europe and the U.S., where researchers typically run phase 3 trials for months to show safety and effectiveness. In another unusual move, Dmitriev said the vaccine has been given to “a significant” number of volunteers, both as part of and outside the formal trial. The director of the Gamaleya Institute said he and some of his staff tried the vaccine on themselves before the official trials started, RIA Novosti reported in May. Analysts have questioned Russia’s rushed unorthodox approach.“The current situation with the vaccine looks like a race and sufficient clinic testing hasn’t been done,” said Sergey Shulyak, chief executive officer at Moscow-based consulting company DSM Group.Russia, however, does have a track record developing vaccines using adenoviruses. It devised an Ebola vaccine using similar technology which is licensed in Russia for emergency use and which is expected to be deployes soon in the Congo. And Russia has been increasingly active in promoting its vaccine-making expertise in Africa. The Russian government together with United Company RUSAL opened the Russian-Guinean Research Center for Epidemiology and Prevention of Infectious Diseases in 2014 in Guinea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-is-trying-to-beat-the-west-to-a-covid-19-vaccine/story-9FlO5eWXpZl3HJJQxAjfxJ.html
18-07-2020||World||Breathtaking coronavirus numbers show normal life still far away||South Africa was poised Saturday to join the top five countries most affected by the coronavirus pandemic, while breathtaking infection numbers around the world were a reminder that a return to normal life is still far from sight.The country’s 337,000 cases make up roughly half of all confirmed infections on the African continent and its struggles are a sign of trouble to come for nations with fewer health care resources. South Africa was on track to join the U.S., Brazil, India and Russia as current trends show it will surpass Peru.“The simple fact is that many South Africans are sitting ducks because they cannot comply with World Health Organization protocols on improved hygiene and social distancing,” the foundation of former South African archbishop and Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu and his wife, Leah, warned in a statement.The development comes a day after the World Health Organization reported a single-day record of new infections at over 237,000. Daily death tolls have been reaching new highs in several U.S. states and India’s infections are over 1 million. Experts believe the true numbers around the world are higher because of testing shortages and data collection issues in some nations.The world on Saturday marked Mandela Day, remembering Nelson Mandela, South Africa’s first Black president — another Nobel Peace Prize winner — and his legacy of fighting inequality. The country, however, remains the world’s most unequal, and health officials have warned that the pandemic will lay that bare.South Africa’s new coronavirus epicenter, Gauteng province, hosts the cities of Johannesburg and Pretoria and one-quarter of the country’s population, with many poor people living in crowded conditions in the middle of a frosty Southern Hemisphere winter.Mandela’s message is “more relevant than ever,” WHO Africa chief Matshidiso Moeti said, calling for equitable access to care.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who delivered the Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture, said “Covid-19 has been likened to an X-ray, revealing fractures in the fragile skeleton of the societies we have built,” adding that developed countries have “failed to deliver the support needed to help the developing world through these dangerous times.”Confirmed virus cases worldwide have topped 14.1 million and deaths are nearing 600,000, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Infections are soaring in U.S. states like Florida, Texas, Arizona, fueled by the haphazard lifting of coronavirus lockdowns and the resistance of some Americans to wearing masks.In the U.S., teams of military medics have been deployed in Texas and California to help hospitals deluged by patients. The two most populous states each reported roughly 10,000 new cases a day and some of their highest death counts. The surge of infections means that millions of American children are unlikely to return to classrooms full time in the fall.In India, a surge of 34,884 new cases was reported as local governments continue to re-impose focused lockdowns in several parts of the country.In Iran, the president made the startling announcement that as many as 25 million Iranians could have been infected, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. Hassan Rouhani cited a new Health Ministry study that has not been made public. Iran has the Middle East’s worst outbreak with more than 270,000 confirmed cases.In Bangladesh, confirmed cases surpassed 200,000 but experts say the number is much higher as the country lacks adequate labs for testing. Most people in rural areas have stopped wearing masks and are thronging shopping centers ahead of the Islamic festival Eid al-Adha this month.Scientists, meanwhile, poured cold water on British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s hope that the country may return to normal by Christmas.A world where people can “go to work normally, travel on the buses and trains, go on holiday without restrictions, meet friends, shake hands, hug each other and so on -- that’s a long way off, unfortunately,” without a vaccine, said epidemiologist John Edmunds, a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies.Britain has registered more than 45,300 Covid-19 deaths, the highest toll in Europe. But the government said it will halt issuing daily updates to that toll while authorities investigate the way the statistics are compiled.Academics said England’s tally includes anyone who has tested positive for Covid-19 and later died, meaning some may have died of other causes. Other areas in the U.K. — Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — all have cutoff dates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/breathtaking-coronavirus-numbers-show-normal-life-still-far-away/story-rCqzRnyY2LbZ2io6P54v0I.html
18-07-2020||World||Coronavirus patients swamp emergency rooms in some US states||A fast-rising rising tide of new coronavirus cases is flooding emergency rooms in parts of the United States, with some patients moved into hallways and nurses working extra shifts to keep up with the surge.Patients struggling to breathe are being placed on ventilators in emergency wards since intensive care units are full, officials say, and the near-constant care they require is overtaxing workers who also are treating more typical ER cases like chest pains, infections, and fractures.In Texas, Dr. Alison Haddock of the Baylor College of Medicine said the current situation is worse than after Hurricane Harvey, which swamped Houston with floodwaters in 2017. The state reported a new daily record for virus deaths Friday and more than 10,000 confirmed cases for the fourth consecutive day.“I’ve never seen anything like this COVID surge,” said Haddock, who has worked in emergency rooms since 2007. “We’re doing our best, but we’re not an ICU.”Patients are waiting “hours and hours” to get admitted, she said, and the least sick people are lying in beds in halls to make room for most seriously ill.Around Seattle, which was the nation’s first hot spot for the virus that causes Covid-19, a new wave of patients is showing up at emergency departments, said nurse Mike Hastings.“What’s really frustrating from my side of it is when a patient comes into the emergency department, and is not really having symptoms of COVID, but they feel like they need that testing,” said Hastings, who works at an area hospital and is president of the Emergency Nurses Association. “Sometimes we’re not able to test them because we don’t have enough test supplies, so we’re only testing a certain set of patients.”Confirmed coronavirus cases around the world have surpassed 14 million, and deaths neared 600,000, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. On Friday, the World Health Organization reported a single-day record of new infections at over 237,000. The true toll of the pandemic is thought to be higher, in part because of shortages in testing and shortcomings in data collection.The United States, Brazil and India top the list of cases. South Africa — with 337,000 cases, roughly half of all confirmed infections in Africa — was poised to join the top five countries most affected by the pandemic.In the United States, where infections are soaring in many Sunbelt states, Megan Jehn, associate professor of epidemiology at Arizona State Universtiy in Tempe, said it’s important to monitor emergency room visits since increases there can signal that the virus is spreading more rapidly.But it’s difficult to get a complete picture of how emergency rooms are faring in many places. In Arizona, one of the few states that reports data on visits to the emergency room by people with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 symptoms, numbers started to spike in early June and peaked earlier this month. More than 2,000 people went to an ER with coronavirus symptoms on a single day, July 7.Dr. Robert Hancock, who works at multiple hospitals in Texas and Oklahoma and serves as president of the Texas College of Emergency Physicians, said some Texas emergency rooms are facing backups of patients awaiting ICU beds. And many of them are on ventilators, meaning they require more attention than other patients.“Unfortunately, because of the increased demand for personnel, there typically isn’t anybody free to come down to the ER to help a lot of times from a nursing standpoint,” he said.Burnout could await these health workers, as it did some in New York City, when it was the epicenter of the nation’s outbreak in the spring.Emergency rooms doctors and nurses were caught off guard by the relentless stream of severely sick patients during shifts that often lasted 12 hours, said Dr. Bernard P. Chang of New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center.“You were on high alert the whole shift,” Chang said. “It was a brutal, sustained battle.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-patients-swamp-emergency-rooms-in-some-us-states/story-1vizOca8koIHLGwZQqj45O.html
18-07-2020||World||‘People think Covid-19 is political scheme or conspiracy theory’: Doctor who survived virus bewildered by public disregard||Dr. Michael Saag spends much of his time treating patients fighting for their lives and working with colleagues who are overwhelmed and exhausted by the relentless battle against the Covid-19 pandemic.But he enters a different world when he walks out the door of his Alabama clinic: one where many don’t wear masks, keep their distance from others or even seem aware of the intense struggle being waged against a virus that has cost about 140,000 lives nationwide and made so many — including the doctor — seriously ill.The disconnect is devastating.“It’s a mixture of emotions, from anger to being demoralized to bewilderment to frustration,” Saag said.Confirmed cases of Covid-19 have increased an average of more than 1,500 a day over the past week in Alabama, bringing the total to more than 62,100 since the pandemic began in March. At least 1,230 people have died and health officials say fewer than 15% of the state’s intensive care beds are available for new patients. Some hospitals are completely out of room.It’s not just an Alabama problem. About 250 miles (400 kilometers) from Birmingham, Dr. Chad Dowell warns that his hospital in tiny Indianola, Mississippi, is filling up and so are others, making it difficult to locate beds for the sickest patients even as people debate on social media whether the pandemic is real.Inside the hospital at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, doctors and nurses in protective gear rush from one emergency to another. They struggle to comfort heartbroken visitors forced to say goodbye to dying relatives long distance via cellphone, Saag said, all while coping with the stress of whether they’ll be infected next.The sharp increase in confirmed virus cases in Alabama has coincided with the reopening of restaurants, bars, theaters, gyms, sports leagues and churches that were all closed down when the virus first hit. Although most have opened at a diminished capacity and with restrictions in place, many patrons haven’t been following recommended precautions.In metro Birmingham, where Saag lives, it has been common to see fewer than half the people inside stores wearing masks. The doctor said he got particularly dispirited recently after stopping by a restaurant on the way home from work to pick up a takeout order of sushi. There were as many as 60 people inside, he said.“Myself and one other person were the only two people wearing masks. And everybody else, not only were they not wearing masks, they were congregating together,” he said. “And they look at me like I’m some sort of pariah wearing a mask.”In response, Gov. Kay Ivey this week ordered all Alabama residents 6 and older to wear masks when in public and within 6 feet (2 meters) of someone who is not a relative. Cast against a pandemic that has become increasingly political, the move drew both praise as a potentially life-saving step and harsh criticism from those who called it an unnecessary affront to freedom.Saag said he hopes the order helps, but it all depends on compliance. Ivey herself said the rule will be hard to enforce, and some police and sheriff’s offices have said they won’t even try.During the initial outbreak, doctors and nurses were hailed as heroes in the fight against Covid-19. Some say they now feel more like cannon fodder in a war that has become increasingly divisive.“People continue to regard the virus as a political scheme or conspiracy theory. People continue to ignore recommended guidelines on how to help slow the virus’ spread. People continue to complain about wearing a mask. We’ve got to do better as a community,” Dowell, the Mississippi doctor, wrote in a Facebook message released by South Sunflower County hospital.For Saag, the fight is personal. In early March, both he and his adult son came down with the virus after a trip to Manhattan when the epidemic was raging there. First came a cough, followed by fever, a headache, body aches and what Saag called “fuzzy thinking,” or an inability to concentrate.“The mornings I’d feel fine, thought I was done with it. And then every night it would come right back as if it was just starting all over again,” he said. “The hardest part of the night was that feeling of shortness of breath and not knowing if it’s going to get worse.”During eight suffocating nights, Saag wasn’t sure whether he’d survive without a ventilator. It never came to that. He is now fully recovered and feels closer than ever to the people he treats.“When I talk to a patient and I say, ‘Hey, I’ve had it too,’ it’s like we’re connected in a way that I really, honestly haven’t felt with patients ever before — and I’ve been doing this 40 years,” Saag said.Outside the examination room, Saag has participated in news conferences and done media interviews to encourage basic public health practices, but he knows many people just aren’t listening.He said it is disheartening to see a widespread disregard for safety measures and worries about Alabama’s future at a time when the virus is posing more of a threat than ever.“I’m just thinking, `Oh, my goodness. We’re going to be in trouble very soon,’” Saag said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/people-think-covid-19-is-political-scheme-or-conspiracy-theory-doctor-who-survived-virus-bewildered-by-public-disregard/story-Nv6CyUSuFIMrYu5pRmN9aO.html
18-07-2020||World||Back to the wall, Nepal PM Oli goes for broke. Now wants a party convention||A four-hour-long meeting of the Nepal Communist Party secretariat ended inconclusively on Saturday evening after Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli tried to block attempts to get him to step down, demanding that NCP convene a party convention to decide the next steps for the ruling NCP.Saturday’s marathon meeting came against the backdrop of PM Oli’s rivals in the party stepping up pressure on the prime minister to quit the himalayan nation’s top executive post. The meeting was wrapped up late on Saturday evening after PM Oli abruptly called it a day and went to meet President Bidhya Devi Bhandari.Pushpa Kumar Dahal, better known by nom de guerre Prachanda, left the meeting soon after and also headed to meet President Bhandari at her official residence Shital Niwas, people familiar with the development told Hindustan Times.An NCP leader said PM Oli came up with a counter-offer to sabotage the push for an early decision on the prime minister’s future. PM Oli suggested that this decision should be left to a convention of party workers that could be convened later this year.“This would be a non-starter,” the NCP leader said.Also Read: Nepal PM Oli changes tack after pressure to quit, asks who will replace meThe ruling NCP was formally set up in February 2018 with the merger of the CPN (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and CPN (Maoist Centre) that had contested the election in an alliance and received overwhelming support from the people.“But the assimilation of the cadre of the two parties that merged in 2018 never took place on the ground,” he said, pointing that PM Oli’s new tactic appeared to be designed to keep the leadership issue hanging in balance for months.The only thing that the nine-member NCP secretariat appeared to have agreed on is that the next steps for the party and government’s leadership should be decided on the basis of consensus.The senior leaders agreed to resolve the issues through consensus, party spokesperson Narayankaji Shrestha told media persons after the meeting.A tweet by PM Oli’s press adviser Surya Thapa did not claim that there was any consensus or agreement at the meeting either.Saturday’s NCP secretariat meeting - a smaller body than the 44-member standing committee that is scheduled to meet on Sunday - was expected to arrive at a decision on PM Oli’s future that could be put before the standing committee. This plan could have been upended by PM Oli with his push for a party convention.There have already been demands that the party convene the meeting of a 445-member central committee, an exercise that would also take some time to organise.PM Oli has been able to hold on to the prime minister’s chair - he is also the co-chairman of the party - with some intervention from China that made it clear that it did not want the merged communist party to split. PM Oli leveraged Beijing’s interest in a united communist party in Nepal to his advantage, putting out a word that the party would fall apart if he is forced to step down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/back-to-the-wall-nepal-pm-oli-goes-for-broke-now-wants-a-party-convention/story-ZLzzxbNXk45pGXPwVHrYgJ.html
18-07-2020||World||China ‘crushing’ Hong Kong, wants to control global communications, says US||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday accused China of trying to dominate the global communications networks and systems and slammed it, once again, for “crushing” freedom in Hong Kong and forcing “mass abortions and sterilization” among Uighur muslims in Xinjiang.The departments of state and treasury also designated five Chinese nationals and two entities for alleged involvement in trafficking of synthetic opioids.“The Chinese Communist Party is crushing freedom in Hong Kong,” Pompeo said at the annual summit of the Family Leader, a conservative group, in Iowa state. “It’s threatening a free Taiwan. It’s trying to dominate world communications networks, including those right here in places like Iowa.”The secretary of state was referring to the Chinese telecommunications firms Huawei and ZTE that have designated national security threats by the US and telecom companies are barred from receiving federal subsidies for buying their equipment, popular in rural America including Iowa.The Trump administration has also pushed other countries to bar these Chinese companies. And it welcomed this week the decision of the United Kingdom to bar Huawei from participating in the roll out of the 5G network.India, which banned 56 Chinese apps in retaliation for the Galwan clashes, could also bar Huawei from its 5G network, according to reports.The United States has escalated attacks on China in recent weeks, followed by punitive measures in many instances, over an entire range of issues — including the new national security law for Hong Kong, mistreatment of Uighur muslims.President Donald Trump signed into law earlier this week a legislations that empowers his administration to announce sanctions against China for the Hong Kong security law. He also signed an executive order the same day that preferential treatment for Hong Kong, which, though an earlier directive, will be denied high-tech exports.The administration is also reported to be considering visa bans on officials of the ruling Chinese Communist Party and their relatives, and throw out those already in the US. The ban could extend to officials of the People’s Liberation Army, according t reports. Or could be narrowed and just pick the 25 member so the politburo.The Trump administration announced sanctions against several Chinese officials last week for human rights abuses against Uighur muslims, including a member of the CCP — Chen Quanguo, who is a member of China’s 25-member ruling politburo and party secretary of the Xinjiang region.“A few weeks back I read a report about the Chinese Communist Party forcing mass abortions and sterilization on Chinese Muslims in Western China.,” Pompeo said Friday about the mistreatment of Uighurs. “These are some of the most gross human rights violations we have seen and I’ve referred to it as the stain of the century.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-crushing-hong-kong-wants-to-control-global-communications-says-us/story-nCBUEjuyU9NgfXSjLR1HmL.html
18-07-2020||World||UN chief to world leaders: ‘Inequality starts at the top’||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Saturday accused world powers of ignoring inequality in global institutions, but said the coronavirus pandemic has created a “generational opportunity” to build a more equal, sustainable world.Delivering the annual lecture for the Nelson Mandela Foundation via internet, Guterres pushed for a so-called New Global Deal to ensure power, wealth and opportunity are shared more broadly and fairly at the international level.“The nations that came out on top more than seven decades ago have refused to contemplate the reforms needed to change power relations in international institutions,” Guterres said. “The composition and voting rights in the United Nations Security Council and the boards of the Bretton Woods system are a case in point.”“Inequality starts at the top: in global institutions. Addressing inequality must start by reforming them,” he added. The Bretton Woods system includes the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.  He said the pandemic has revealed, like an x-ray, “fractures in the fragile skeleton of the societies we have built.” “It is exposing fallacies and falsehoods everywhere: the lie that free markets can deliver healthcare for all; the fiction that unpaid care work is not work; the delusion that we live in a post-racist world; the myth that we are all in the same boat,” said Guterres during the virtual lecture. “Because while we are all floating on the same sea, it’s clear that some are in superyachts while others are clinging to the floating debris,” said Guterres, a former Socialist prime minister of Portugal.  The coronavirus has infected more than 14 million people and there have been nearly 600,000 known deaths worldwide, according to a Reuters tally. The UN has appealed for $10.3 billion to help poor states, but has received only $1.7 billion. Guterres said rich countries have “failed to deliver the support needed to help the developing world” and that the pandemic has “brought home the tragic disconnect between self-interest and the common interest; and the huge gaps in governance structures and ethical frameworks.”He said a changing world needs new social protection policies with safety nets including universal health coverage and the possibility of a universal basic income.Guterres concluded: “Now is the time for global leaders to decide: Will we succumb to chaos, division and inequality? Or will we right the wrongs of the past and move forward together, for the good of all?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-to-world-leaders-inequality-starts-at-the-top/story-yTgDmsbd06SlpcVoEcsn6O.html
18-07-2020||World||Nepal’s communist party’s key meeting ends with no breakthrough to end Oli-Prachanda infighting||Nepal’s ruling communist party’s top decision-making body on Saturday failed to achieve a breakthrough to end the tussle for power between Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli and former premier Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ despite four hours of marathon discussions. No conclusion was reached during the meeting of the Nepal Communist Party’s (NCP) nine-member Central Secretariat though the party leaders discussed agenda to be presented during Sunday’s Standing Committee meeting, according to senior party leader Ganesh Shah. During the meeting, senior leaders of the party agreed to resolve the issues through consensus, party spokesperson Narayankaji Shrestha told media persons after the meeting. The NCP called a secretariat meeting after the two top leaders agreed to call a conclave of the highest body of the party ahead of the 45-member Standing Committee meeting on Sunday in a bid to strike a power-sharing deal by sorting out their differences. The Standing Committee meeting of the party is scheduled to take place at 3 pm on Sunday. The Standing Committee meeting was postponed until Sunday to give more time to Oli and the rival faction led by Prachanda, the executive chairman of the NCP to have more talks to end the intra-party infighting. During previous meetings, Oli has refused to resign or give up his position as chairman of the NCP as demanded by the faction led by Prachanda. Sunday’s Standing Committee meeting is expected to fix the date for the CWC meeting, which will ultimately decide the future of Prime Minister Oli, Ganesh Shah, a Standing Committee member, said. Oli and Prachanda have held at least eight meetings in recent weeks to sort out the differences between them. But, as the Prime Minister did not accept the condition of a one-man-one-post, the talks failed, party sources said. Top NCP leaders, including ‘Prachanda’, have been demanding Prime Minister Oli’s resignation, saying his recent anti-India remarks were “neither politically correct nor diplomatically appropriate.” They are also against Oli’s autocratic style of functioning. The differences grew further after Oli alleged that some of the ruling party leaders are aligning with the southern neighbour to remove him from power after his government issued a new political map incorporating three Indian territories of Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura. The differences between the two factions of the NCP, one led by Oli and the other led by Prachanda on the issue of power-sharing, intensified after the prime minister unilaterally decided to prorogue the budget session of Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-s-communist-party-s-key-meeting-ends-with-no-breakthrough-to-end-oli-prachanda-infighting/story-qvOEvIpVq18CeupThwPkVO.html

The monument was cordoned off with signs reading: “No entry without permission. Maintenance in progress.”Public opposition to Prayuth’s rule has been growing in recent months.Since last year’s election, a court has dissolved the second-largest opposition party, giving Prayuth’s ruling coalition firmer control in parliament.Prayuth also saw several cabinet members resign https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-thailand-economy/thai-finance-minister-resigns-amid-economic-team-shake-up-idUKKCN24H0J9 on Thursday over internal disputes.Prayuth’s Palang Pracharat Party campaigned on a vision of traditional Thai culture and loyalty to King Maha Vajiralongkorn.Thailand is officially a constitutional monarchy, but insulting the king is punishable by up to 15 years in prison, and many conservatives view the monarchy as sacrosanct.Some signs at Saturday’s protest made reference to the monarchy, including one banner reading “The People’s Party isn’t Dead” - a reference to the political party whose revolution ended absolute royal rule in 1932.Democracy Monument is the most prominent memorial to that revolution, but others have been removed or renamed since King Vajiralongkorn assumed the throne after the 2016 death of his father, who had reigned for 70 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hundreds-of-protesters-take-to-streets-in-bangkok-demand-thai-govt-s-resignation/story-1y0w4YQf8qEj4JK9qE951J.html

Our Surgeon General – terrific guy – said don’t wear a mask. Everybody who is saying don’t wear a mask – all of sudden everybody’s got to wear a mask, and as you know masks cause problems, too.” Trump, who has been seen wearing a face mask only once, said, I’m a believer in masks. I think masks are good.” But Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said social distancing, an important factor in blunting the spread of the coronavirus, can be difficult with more people going out.“When you’re living your life and trying to open up the country, you are going to come into contact with people. And for that reason, we know that masks are really important, and we should be using them everywhere,” he said during a US Chamber of Commerce virtual event.Americans are actually slowing down the re-opening the country by not wearing a mask, CNN quoted Fauci as saying during a US Chamber of Commerce event.“If we could get more people to understand that, hopefully we’ll get more people who’d be willing to wear masks,” he said.He said he would “urge the leaders -- the local political and other leaders -- in states and cities and towns to be as forceful as possible in getting your citizenry to wear masks.” The country needs to concentrate on the problems at hand and not worry about a second wave, he said.“When you’re having up to 70,000 new infections ... that’s something you need to focus on right now, as opposed to looking at what’s going to happen in September or October,” he said.There were 77,255 new cases reported on Thursday, crossing a previous record set two days ago, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-don-t-agree-trump-says-he-won-t-order-americans-to-wear-masks/story-j5u9KukMvJ1mBLkMWIi3sM.html

Excavated in 1836 for the first time, archaeologists have dug out hundreds of relics made of clay, stucco, and terracotta in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unislamic-buddha-statue-discovered-in-pakistan-s-mardan-vandalised-by-workers/story-ZEW9aiZlFZg2anU2K59PXJ.html

More than 20,000 people had been evacuated and 1,031 homes destroyed.Three landslides in Dunhao town in a mountainous part of Chongqing left six dead, the city’s Emergency Management Bureau said. The bodies had been found by Friday evening after more than 200 people were dispatched for a search and rescue operation. Rainfall in the town of Dunhao totaled 39 centimeters (15 inches), the bureau said.Three more people died in neighboring Hubei province, the emergency management department said in a social media post.State broadcaster CCTV showed people cleaning up still wet, muddy streets and shops in the city of Enshi after severe flooding Friday. Rescue workers used inflatable rafts to rescue more than 1,900 people trapped in their homes and other buildings.Downriver, firefighters and others finished filling in a 188-meter (620-foot) break in a dike on Poyang Lake, China’s largest freshwater lake, Xinhua said.The dike gave way nine days ago, flooding 15 villages and agricultural fields in Jiangxi province, the news agency said. More than 14,000 people were evacuated.The incoming waters were expected to peak Saturday behind the Three Gorges Dam, but more water is forecast to arrive around Tuesday, Xinhua said. The hydropower dam is used to mitigate catastrophic flooding.Seasonal flooding strikes large parts of China annually, especially in its central and southern regions, but the rainfall has been unusually high this year.About 1.8 million people have been evacuated and direct losses attributed to flooding are estimated at more than 49 billion yuan ($7 billion), according to the Ministry of Emergency Management.Major cities have been spared so far, but concern has risen over Wuhan and other downstream metropolises that are home to tens of millions of people.China’s worst floods in recent years were in 1998, when more than 2,000 people died and almost 3 million homes were destroyed, mostly along the Yangtze.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/floods-kill-14-in-china-as-water-peaks-at-three-gorges-dam/story-ce5QbvNHd8sskXGGBfjbZM.html

18-07-2020||World||China’s restive Xinjiang province reports Covid-19 cluster with 16 new cases||China’s Xinjiang reported 16 new locally-transmitted Covid-19 cases on Friday, health authorities said Saturday as the country readies to battle a new front against the outbreak in the remote northwestern region.The jump in cases on Friday followed one new case, and eight more asymptomatic ones, which were reported on Thursday.All the cases have been reported from the regional capital Urumqi, and at least 269 people in the city have been put under medical observation.Authorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) have reacted to the new outbreak by cancelling nearly all domestic flights from the capital, limiting city transport systems, closing off a handful of residential communities and restricting people from leaving the city.The new restrictions will add to the existing ones imposed by Beijing on the province to tackle, what it calls, Islamic radicalisation. Rights group say Beijing has implemented harsh policies in the region to gradually wipe out the distinct culture of the Muslim Uyghur community.Local media reports said a 24-year-old woman tested positive on Thursday after displaying symptoms – the first such case to be reported from the province in months.State-run Global Times reported that since Friday, Xinjiang “conducted intense screening to identify infected and asymptomatic people and their close contacts. Nearly 90 percent of Urumqi flights were cancelled on Friday after new Covid-19 cases were reported.”The Xinjiang outbreak comes weeks after Beijing saw a localised spike in Covid-19 cases in June after not reporting a single case for nearly two months. It indicates the difficulty in fully eradicating the coronavirus despite China having brought the pandemic under control even as it rages globally.Chinese epidemic prevention expert Tao Lina told state media that it was necessary to compare the genetic sequencing results of the novel coronavirus from Beijing and Urumqi to determine whether the cases were related.“But because Xinjiang has a much smaller population density than Beijing, it should be relatively easy to control,” Tao told state media.The new Covid-19 cases in Xinjiang are likely to be tracked and monitored closely by rights groups in the backdrop of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Uyghurs being interred in controversial camps to be de-radicalised.Earlier this year, China had said that all inmates of what it calls “vocational training institutes” had “graduated” but did not offer any evidence to support the claim.International rights groups had earlier expressed fear of the virus getting into one of the camps – as it has done in prisons in China – and triggering widespread infections among the inmates.Until Friday, China’s confirmed infections stand at 83,622, with deaths at 4,634.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-restive-xinjiang-province-reports-covid-19-cluster-with-16-new-cases/story-bFcUurca0qeaCEu5AGZaNN.html
18-07-2020||World||European Union leaders resume ‘grumpy’ summit on budget, coronavirus fund||European Union leaders were hunting for compromises Saturday as a summit to reach a deal on an unprecedented 1.85 trillion euro ($2.1 trillion) EU budget and coronavirus recovery fund entered its second day with tensions running high.A full day and night of discussions by the 27 leaders on Friday only added to the irritations over how the huge sums should be spent and what strings should be attached.The atmosphere “was grumpier this evening than this afternoon,” Dutch Prime Minister Rutte told Dutch reporters after Friday’s marathon talks. “This is going to take a while, I think.” The EU executive has proposed a 750-billion euro fund, partly based on common borrowing, to be sent as loans and grants to the most needy countries. That comes on top of the seven-year 1-trillion-euro EU budget that leaders were fighting over when Covid-19 slammed their continent.A European diplomat said overnight that the talks had hit a “difficult moment” and were blocked on the issue of how to monitor the recovery funds, and that it was unclear whether there would be a way out. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the content of the closed-door negotiations.Rutte is seen as a leader of “frugal” nations that want conditions such as economic reforms attached to EU handouts to help countries recover from the hammer blow of the coronavirus.The pandemic sent the EU into a tailspin with 27-nation bloc’s economy contracting by 8.3% this year, according to the latest predictions. Around 135,000 of its citizens have died from Covid-19.As leaders met in person for the first time since February, they wore face masks, bumped elbows and sat in a cavernous meeting hall so they could maintain social distancing. Many of their negotiating positions were further apart than their chairs.After two fruitless sessions Friday, summit host and European Council President Charles Michel met key players - Rutte, French President Emmanuel Macron and Hungary’s Viktor Orban - in an attempt to narrow the gaps between them.Orban does not want strings attached to EU funds, Rutte does and Macron is arguing that Europe must show solidarity to claw its way out of the crisis.Macron and Rutte were among early arrivals at the summit venue on Saturday morning.Michel is expected to present leaders with possible compromises when the summit resumes, though it remains to be seen if they can reach agreement or will have to schedule another meeting.Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis was pessimistic after the first day.“I don’t have the impression that we are getting close to an agreement,” he said.Rutte, however, said that despite the mounting acrimony, the talks were creeping forward.“You make a bit of progress during the day,” he said. “For a start, it helps if you better understand each other’s positions, then you can search for possible compromises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-leaders-resume-grumpy-summit-on-budget-coronavirus-fund/story-KlF0YlMUVHFQ5fRqYGSLFM.html
18-07-2020||World||Beijing’s nationalist push to build support for CCP has stoked tensions with Washington||Beijing’s nationalist push to shore up support for the ruling Chinese Communist Party has stoked tensions with Washington, Jessica Chen Weiss has said.In an article in Foreign Affairs, Weiss said: “Although the main objective of Beijing’s nationalist push has been to build domestic support for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), it has also stoked tensions with Washington, as each side tries to outdo the other in shifting blame and avoiding accountability for its handling of Covid-19.”“The tit-for-tat rhetoric has already accelerated a race to the bottom in US-Chinese relations and hindered cooperation in fighting the pandemic. For the United States, this more nationalistic Chinese approach will present even greater challenges going forward, hindering US leverage and deterrence in ways that will constrain US policy options,” she added.Relations between the US and China have worsened in recent times over a range of issues including the handling of coronavirus pandemic.But over the long term, she stated that nationalism will prove even more of a hindrance to Beijing’s ambitions since it undermines Chinese efforts to attract international support and show global leadership.“Wolf warrior diplomacy might appease Chinese nationalists at home, but it will limit China’s appeal abroad. And xenophobia and repression in the name of national stability--whether toward African migrants in Guangzhou, Central Asian minorities in Xinjiang, or ethnic Chinese in Hong Kong--have given the lie to Chinese efforts to project a benevolent and magnanimous image,” she said.China has faced criticism for massive abuse of human rights of Uighurs in Xinjiang province.“Even if Beijing recognizes these problems, it will be costly--although not impossible--for the Chinese leadership to constrain the nationalism it has unleashed,” said Weiss.She noted that to some extent, Beijing has already tempered its most aggressive nationalist rhetoric in the face of domestic and international pushback in recent weeks.“Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian has denied that China is trying to export its coronavirus response model. Leading military hawks have cautioned Chinese nationalists against using force to reunify with Taiwan,” she said.“Censors have shuttered social media accounts promoting “fabricated and misleading” claims about India, Kazakhstan, and Vietnam. But despite this modest tamping down of nationalist rhetoric, even China’s internal reporting suggests that global anti-Chinese sentiment is at its highest point since the 1989 crackdown at Tiananmen Square,” she added.In recent times, China has tried to bully smaller neighbouring countries, aggravating tensions in the region.Still, she said, more assertive nationalism is likely to remain a feature of Beijing’s rhetoric and diplomacy, with significant implications for US policy.“The more the CCP prioritizes nationalism and public stability relative to economic growth as sources of domestic legitimacy, the less leverage the United States and other outside powers have, particularly on issues of central importance to China’s leaders, such as territorial integrity,” the article read.Citing the example of Hong Kong where China has imposed draconian national security law to crush dissent, she said: “Take Hong Kong, where Beijing has feared both democratic contagion and a separatist threat to national sovereignty. Threats of economic sanctions have been ineffective at deterring Beijing from pushing through new national security legislation that effectively ends Hong Kong’s autonomy.”She highlighted that once mobilized, nationalism creates pressure for the government to talk tough and placate domestic audiences, increasing the costs of restraint.Cautioning that US policymakers aiming to shape the trajectory of China’s behaviour and influence must consider both the short- and long-term effects of nationalism on Chinese politics and policy, she said policies to force near-term Chinese restraint may also make medium- or long-term belligerence more likely by hardening the overall opinion climate inside China.“In crafting strategies to deter or punish Beijing, policymakers may end up increasing domestic Chinese demands for tough retaliation, including countermeasures against the range of foreign interests that benefit from access to China--whether scientific, journalistic, or corporate,” she said while adding that the more the CCP leans on nationalism, the less worried the United States should be about China as a rival for global leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-s-nationalist-push-to-build-support-for-ccp-has-stoked-tensions-with-washington/story-4WgTov372DDEAlBkn3XV7O.html

Speaking to reporters about the arrest, Harrison would not say when police believe Saleh was killed, nor would he discuss other details about the case or take questions.Investigators initially believed that the cousin who went to check on Saleh may have interrupted the attack and that the assailant fled out a back exit. The medical examiner ruled the death a homicide after an autopsy found the cause of death was multiple stab wounds to the body.Saleh was the chief executive officer of ride-hailing motorcycle startup Gokada that started operating in Nigeria in 2018.Saleh’s LinkedIn biography described him as a self-taught businessman who founded Gokada, building on his experience of first “seeing an opportunity in his parent’s native country of Bangladesh” and starting that country’s largest ride-sharing company. It said he also invested in a similar venture in Colombia.“The headlines talk about a crime we still cannot fathom,” Saleh’s family said in a statement after his death. “Fahim is more than what you are reading. He is so much more. His brilliant and innovative mind took everyone who was a part of his world on a journey and he made sure never to leave anyone behind.”Apartments in the 10-story building where Saleh’s remains were found sell for more than $2 million. The building was completed in 2017 as part of a wave of gentrification in the neighborhood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/personal-assistant-charged-in-dismembered-tech-ceo-s-killing-in-luxury-ny-condo/story-TTTngTvtoVodXZa8M9reaJ.html

Its roof took more than 13 years to repair.Another religious building in Nantes -- the Basilica of St Donatian and St Rogatian -- was struck by a fire in 2015 that destroyed three-quarters of its roof.In April last year, a fire engulfed Paris’s 13th century Notre-Dame Cathedral, causing its steeple to collapse and sending billowing fumes containing toxic molten lead into the air.

18-07-2020||World||After intel briefings, Biden warns of election interference||Joe Biden said Friday night that he’s begun receiving intelligence briefings as he warned that Russia, China and other adversaries were attempting to undermine the upcoming US election in November.The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee wasn’t specific and offered no evidence while addressing a virtual fundraiser with more than 200 attendees. But, in the process, he confirmed receiving classified briefings after saying as recently as late last month that he wasn’t getting them but might request one about reports of Russian bounties being offered on US troops in Afghanistan.“We know from before, and I guarantee you I know now because now I get briefings again. The Russians are still engaged, trying to de-legitimize our electoral process. Fact,” Biden said Friday. “China and others are engaged as well in activities designed for us to lose confidence in the outcome.”The White House and National Security Council didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on Biden’s statement. Reached by phone, a Biden spokesperson did not immediately provide further details.US intelligence agencies say Russia meddled in the 2016 election with the goal of swaying the contest toward Donald Trump, and officials have warned that there remains a threat of foreign interference in the 2020 contest.Throughout his presidency, Trump has questioned the intelligence community’s findings about the 2016 Russian interference and called investigations into whether his campaign had any connection to the meddling a “hoax.”Biden received intelligence briefings while vice president but told reporters he wasn’t getting them as of June 30. He said then that President Donald Trump’s administration had not offered classified briefings, even though they are traditionally provided to major-party nominees once they win the primary. Biden won’t formally become the Democratic presidential nominee until the party’s convention next month.Biden has previously suggested that President Donald Trump could hold up emergency funding to help the Postal Service continue normal operations during the coronavirus, which has devastated the agency’s finances and contributed to a huge drop in mail volumes.Trump has repeatedly said he opposes expanding mail-in balloting during the pandemic, suggesting without evidence that doing so could lead to widespread fraud — even though there is equally no evidence the president or White House will use Postal Service funding to do what Biden is suggesting.Biden lobbed similar charges on Friday, saying Trump may try to “defund the post office so they can’t deliver mail-in ballots.”“Frankly, this is the thing that keeps me up most at night,” Biden added. “Making sure everyone who wants to vote can vote, making sure that the vote is counted, making sure we’re all trusting in the integrity of the results of the election.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-intel-briefings-biden-warns-of-election-interference/story-kivVK24UxGKz5qs7XJAAGP.html
18-07-2020||World||How coronavirus evades host cell defense decoded||Scientists have determined how the novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, inhibits the synthesis of proteins in infected cells, and have shown that it effectively disarms a part of the immune system, findings that may aid in the development of novel therapeutics against the deadly disease. The study, published in the journal Science, demonstrated that nonstructural Protein 1 (Nsp1) made by the novel coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 can have a devastating effect on host cells. According to the researchers, including those from the University of Munich in Germany, Nsp1 is one of the central weapons used by the virus to ensure its own replication and propagation in human hosts. They said Nsp1 was identified as a disease contributing factor following the outbreak of the related 2002-03 SARS pandemic virus. Scientists who studied the SARS virus had shown that it inhibited protein synthesis in infected cells. “Although SARS-CoV-2 features additional inhibitors of host innate immune defenses, targeting the interaction of this protein, Nsp1, with the host may be an important therapeutic strategy,” the researchers noted. Upon infection, they said SARS-CoV-2 suppressed protein production in the host, including that of proteins active in cellular anti-viral defense mechanisms. The virus did this by binding to the cell’s protein production machinery, the ribosome, the study noted. According to the scientists, targeting the specific part of the ribosome that Nsp1 binds to could be an important potential therapeutic strategy. In the research, the scientists structurally characterised the Nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 bound to the ribosome. They tested the ability of a modified version form of Nsp1, known as mt-Nsp1, to affect protein production related to host immune response. According to the study, the mutant version did not bind in the same way and did not shut down host cell protein production. The scientists also demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 almost completely prevented production of various immune molecules that fight viral infection, such as interferons. “Our data establish that one of the major immune evasion factors of SARS-CoV-2, Nsp1, efficiently interferes with the cellular translation machinery resulting in a shut-down of host protein production,” the study noted.  According to the scientists, the findings may provide a starting point for rational structure-based drug design, targeting the interaction between Nsp1 and the ribosome.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-coronavirus-evades-host-cell-defense-decoded/story-2DFk7Wqox2UyQnKP23nGJK.html

Also going into state custody will be Guosheng Securities Co., New Times Securities Co. and Guosheng Futures Co., the securities regulator said in a separate statement.All nine are linked to Tomorrow Group, the investment conglomerate owned by Xiao Jianhua. The firms are among more than 40 financial institutions identified by New Fortune Magazine in a 2017 article as being part of Xiao’s network.Chinese authorities are stepping up their bid to maintain financial stability as Covid-19 proves ruinous for economic growth and soured loans pile up. Beijing seized control of Baoshang Bank Co. -- another company linked to Xiao -- in May last year citing its “serious” credit risks.Last month, regulators were said to be mulling increased oversight of Huaxia Life, including sending a group of executives from state-owned China Life Insurance Group Co. to assist. Insurers’ earnings have been under pressure, and the coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated that.Bad Apples“This is certainly a move in the right direction” in terms of containing financial risk and warning peers of wrongdoing, said Steven Lam, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “The authorities are also being more transparent by telling the market, ‘We know there are bad apples, and we’re taking care of them’.”Tomorrow Group questioned regulators’ decision in a statement Saturday on its official social media account. The company said its subsidiaries haven’t seen any defaults and don’t have much liquidity risk. It added that requests from units to use around 2 billion yuan ($286 million) on Tomorrow’s balance sheet to repay wealth management products were denied.Tomorrow’s online statement was later deleted after several hundred thousand views.The CBIRC said in its statement on Friday that authorities will seek market-oriented restructurings for the six insurance and trust firms and the bottom line is to avoid any systematic financial risks.The three broking and futures entities were seized for hiding the identity of their ultimate owner or their real holdings, as well as poor corporate governance, the securities regulator said.The moves echo the treatment of Anbang Insurance Group Co. Authorities are in the process of finding strategic investors for Dajia Insurance Group Co., the company that took over the operations of once-acquisitive Anbang after a two-year period of state custody.Anbang’s former Chairman Wu Xiaohui was convicted of fraud and the CBIRC was tasked with selling many of the assets Anbang had accumulated during an overseas buying binge.Four SeasonsXiao has been missing since early 2017 when he was taken from his room at the Four Seasons in Hong Kong. Xiao had been staying there for several years after fleeing China, where he is still pending trial. It’s as yet unclear what charges may be laid against him.Tomorrow Group invested primarily in financial services and used shell companies to control many of its assets. Before his disappearance, the Hurun Report of China’s richest people said Xiao, a student leader at the time of 1989 pro-democracy protests, is part of a fortune estimated at almost $6 billion.In 2018, China’s central bank identified Tomorrow as one of several “financial holding companies” that need to be scrutinized in their ownership structure, related transactions and source of funding.“Some financial holding companies, mainly those formed by investments of non-financial enterprises, have been expanding blindly into the financial industry,” the People’s Bank of China said at the time. “There has been a regulatory vacuum, and risks are accumulating and being exposed continuously.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-takes-over-companies-linked-to-disappeared-financier/story-siplTuoi7dYwqekdjHlFkM.html

NASA has awarded nearly $8 billion combined to SpaceX and Boeing for development of their rival rockets.Behnken is gearing up for his final spacewalk on July 21 ahead of prepping with Hurley to depart the space station, NASA has said. Mission planners on Earth will be watching weather forecasts to calculate the precise time and location of Crew Dragon’s splashdown, the NASA spokesman said, adding the date could slip.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-capsule-carrying-nasa-astronauts-slated-for-aug-2-return/story-6dBG08ANyCwnoG3CbzlsoJ.html

All are required to wear face masks at all times.The gazette notification came days after the election commission urged the government to legalise the health guidelines, saying that the political leaders were not adhering to the health measures while campaigning, jeopardising the lives of the people attending the campaign.“It will be extremely difficult to conduct the election unless the legal effect is given to the health guidelines,” Mahinda Deshapriya, the chief of Sri Lanka’s Election Commission, said on Wednesday.The guidelines for conducting the elections were announced on June 2 but they were not been legalised through a gazette notification.However, sources in the opposition accused the ruling party of watering down the guidelines to make way for a more relaxed campaigning despite a spike in the cases. Campaigning for the elections, which will continue till August 2, has been low key due to the pandemic and the sudden spike of over 500 cases reported from the north central region last week has led to fears of the spread of the virus.According to Johns Hopkins university data, the country has 2,697 coronavirus cases with 11 deaths.The role of the public health inspectors (PHI) has been excluded from the guidelines.The PHIs had on Friday said they were withdrawing from Covid-19 related activities due to the government’s reluctance to provide them with legal cover for their work.The parliamentary polls were initially to be held on April 25, but had to be postponed due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic which prompted the authorities to announce a nationwide lockdown from March 20.Later, the election commission shifted the date to June 20. It was again deemed not suitable in view of the raging pandemic. Finally, August 5 has been selected for the poll process.With the latest spike, it was feared that the election would be further put off and the country might return to the lockdown phase. The country was earlier under lockdown from March 20-June 13.The election commission has declined the opposition’s call to postpone the elections amid a surge in the number of cases.Over 16 million voters are eligible to vote to elect a 225-member parliament for a five-year term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-sri-lanka-issues-strict-health-guidelines-for-election-campaigning/story-tqsjzUqbciK8u4LZebApGO.html

This despite the fact that the Chinese ambassador to Nepal seems to be the master puppeteer of the Himalayan kingdom.The political situation in Nepal seems to be fluid as none of the three principal contenders—Oli, Dahal or Madhav Nepal—want to be seen as the breakers of the NCP’s unity. This works to the advantage of Oli as this ensures that neither Dahal nor Nepal will precipitate the matters and hence the change in the power structure of Nepal will be slow.However, as numbers count in political parties more than words or slogans, Oli is a minority in the secretariat, standing committee and the central committee as of now.It is widely expected that the secretariat will make a decision on Oli’s continuation as the prime minister or co-chair of the NCP or both but the final decision will come through elaborate party processes.The China model of Nepal is that the NCP remains united and individuals can be dealt with pelf and power at a later stage. The Indian model for Nepal is the people-to-people relationship with a working relationship with whosoever is in power. Oli has done his best to break the working relationship.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/political-options-run-out-for-oli-in-nepal-cliff-hanger/story-uRe6KisUV7tV2EWKm3bFNO.html

Armed with gas canisters and nightsticks, the troopers were flanked by horse-riding members of the sheriff’s posse. A crowd of whites milled around nearby.Lewis, who died Friday at age 80, was just 25 at the time. He had been leading voting rights demonstrations for months in the notoriously racist town, and he and the others were trying to take a message of freedom to segregationist Gov. George C. Wallace in Montgomery.So, rather than stopping, Lewis put another foot forward.That seminal step propelled him on to a global stage as a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement. The ensuing confrontation helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act.With fellow civil rights activist Hosea Williams at his side, Lewis finally stopped a few feet away from the phalanx of troopers commanded by Maj. John Cloud of the Alabama Department of Public Safety. Other marchers stopped behind them, shifting their feet uncomfortably on the bridge shoulder.Williams asked Cloud whether they could talk. There would be none of that, said Cloud. Acting on Wallace’s order, he said the march was illegal and gave the group two minutes to leave. Seconds later, Cloud unleashed a spasm of state-sanctioned violence that shocked the nation for its sheer brutality.“Troopers, here, advance toward the group. See that they disperse,” he said through a bullhorn. Lewis stood motionless with his hands in the pockets of his raincoat, a knapsack on his back.Archival film footage and photos show a line of roughly two dozen troopers wearing gas masks as they approach the long, peaceful line led by Lewis. A trooper jabbed the butt of a nightstick toward Lewis and officers quickly pushed into the group. Feet became tangled and bodies hit both the grass roadside and the asphalt road. Screams rang out.Lewis, in sworn court testimony five days later before U.S. District Judge Frank M. Johnson Jr., recalled being knocked to the ground. A state trooper standing upright hit him once in the head with a nightstick; Lewis shielded his head with a hand. The trooper hit Lewis again as he tried to get up. The officer was never publicly identified; Lewis testified he didn’t know who it was, and a gas mask shielded the man’s identity.Others were beaten even worse as whites cheered from nearby. Amelia Boynton Robinson, who was in the line behind Lewis, was tear-gassed and beaten so badly she had to be carried away unconscious. Others were clubbed by the sheriff’s posse members on horseback.Lewis testified he never lost consciousness, but he also didn’t remember how he got back to a church where he was taken before being admitted to a hospital. He got out in time for a hearing before Johnson, who overturned Wallace’s order and ruled demonstrators could march to Montgomery.Lewis was just a few feet away from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at the front of more than 3,000 marchers when they left Selma on March 21, 1965, for the epic 52-mile walk to Montgomery. Wallace, who had vowed “segregation forever” during his 1963 inaugural and served four terms as governor, refused to meet with them.Lewis outlived other key players in what came to be known as Bloody Sunday by many years. He addressed a throng atop the bridge in March, after his cancer diagnosis, to mark the 55th commemoration of the day.“Speak up, speak out, get in the way,” said Lewis, who appeared frail but spoke in a strong voice. “Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America.”Wallace died in 1998, five years after Cloud, and Judge Johnson died in 1999. Hosea Williams, the other march leader who was beside Lewis that day on the bridge, died in 2000.Robinson, who recovered from her injuries and crossed the Selma bridge with Lewis and then-President Barack Obama during the 50th anniversary commemoration, died in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/john-lewis-legacy-shaped-in-1965-on-bloody-sunday/story-U42dkGzljn5vvuKm13IFkO.html

It added that the hackers manipulated a small number of employees and used their credentials to access Twitter’s internal systems through two-factor protections. Twitter said the hackers seem to have targetted some 130 accounts and were able to log in, send tweets and reset the password on some of them. “As of now, we know that they accessed tools only available to our internal support teams to target 130 Twitter accounts. For 45 of those accounts, the attackers were able to initiate a password reset, login to the account, and send tweets,” it stated. “For up to eight of the Twitter accounts involved, the attackers took the additional step of downloading the account’s information through our “Your Twitter Data” tool. We are reaching out directly to any account owner where we know this to be true,” a post tweeted by Twitter Support read. As of now, we know that they accessed tools only available to our internal support teams to target 130 Twitter accounts. For 45 of those accounts, the attackers were able to initiate a password reset, login to the account, and send Tweets.The company added that there exists a lot speculation about the identity of these 8 accounts and said it will “only disclose this to the impacted accounts, however to address some of the speculation: none of the eight were Verified accounts”.The New York Times, in a report, stated that the hackers were young pals with no links to state or organized crime, news agency AFP reported. The attack started with a playful message between hackers on the platform Discord, a chat service popular with gamers, according to the Times.The massive hack involved high-profile users from Elon Musk to Joe Biden. Posts trying to dupe people into sending hackers the virtual currency bitcoin were tweeted by the official accounts of Apple, Uber, Kanye West, Bill Gates, Barack Obama and many others on Wednesday.Fraudulent posts, which were largely deleted, said people had 30 minutes to send $1,000 in cryptocurrency bitcoin, promising they would receive twice as much in return.More than $100,000 worth of bitcoin was sent to email addresses mentioned in the tweets, according to Blockchain.com, which monitors crypto transactions.(With inputs from AFP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-hack-company-says-attackers-manipulated-employees-credentials-to-access-internal-systems/story-G3Pwm92EswatdW97oUzw5N.html

It quoted Lavrov as saying that Russia opposed unilateralism in international affairs.The remarks come as tensions between the United States and China have increased over China’s imposition of its national security law in Hong Kong, an ongoing trade war between the two economies and their handling of the coronavirus outbreak, among other diplomatic rifts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/foreign-ministers-of-china-russia-oppose-us-unilateralism-in-phone-call-report/story-wYVU0f9gm7vOG5qboX6G0K.html

Now is not the time to do that,” he said.The United States marked a record number of coronavirus cases for the third consecutive day Friday, notching more than 77,600 new infections in 24 hours, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.Lockdowns have been imposed on millions of people in India, where more than 600 are dying every day. India’s hotspots had previously been the megacities of Mumbai and New Delhi, but smaller cities and rural areas -- where 70 percent of Indians live -- have recently begun to raise the alarm.With per capita spending on health care among the lowest in the world, India’s hospitals are reeling.“It’s not going to go away till a vaccine comes... I have to keep fighting and trying to save every single life,” Showkat Nazir Wani, a doctor in an intensive care unit outside the capital New Delhi, told AFP.New restrictions Despite fears of a second wave, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his country could expect to return to “significant normality” by Christmas, as a study revealed that Europe’s hardest-hit nation may be overestimating its death toll.However, Israel said stores, markets and other public spaces would be closed on weekends as its number of cases surges.In China -- where Covid-19 first emerged late last year -- flights were curtailed and public transport shut down in Urumqi, the capital of the far-western Xinjiang region, after new infections were detected.Authorities in Australia’s second-biggest city Melbourne meanwhile warned that its lockdown could become even tougher after a record 423 new cases were registered there on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-tells-millions-stay-home-as-eu-meets-on-covid-19-cases-rise/story-WDTJSlOJT2BSaHiilvXeaM.html

The Trump administration said in June it wanted “to restore a level playing field for US airlines” under the US-India Air Transport Agreement. The Indian government had banned all scheduled services and failed to approve US carriers for charter operations, it added.The US government said in June that Air India had been operating “repatriation” charter flights between India and the United States in both directions since May 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-passenger-flights-to-india-can-resume-july-23/story-qrsUPUJIKLW34wnWdAEyVO.html
18-07-2020||World||United States carries out third federal execution in four days||The US Justice Department on Friday (local time) carried out its third federal execution in four days after the punishment was revived by the Trump administration following a 17-year hiatus.Officials executed Dustin Lee Honken at a federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, on Friday afternoon. He was pronounced dead at 4:36 p.m. (local time), prison officials informed The Washington Post.Honken was convicted of killing five people, including two young children, and sentenced to death. In 1993, Honken was indicted on federal drug-trafficking charges, after which he and his girlfriend kidnapped and murdered a federal witness, the witness’s girlfriend and the girlfriend’s daughters, a 6-year-old and a 10-year-old, as per court records. Months later, they also murdered another potential witness.Before the execution began, Honken briefly spoke, according to a pool report from a media witness. He did not address the victims’ relatives bearing witness. His last words were, “Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for me.”Honken’s lethal injection came on the heels of federal officials carrying out two other executions in Indiana.On Tuesday morning, the federal government executed Daniel Lewis Lee, convicted for his role in killing a family of three. Two days later, it executed Wesley Purkey, convicted of raping and murdering 16-year-old Jennifer Long.The death penalty has declined significantly in recent years, with fewer death sentences and executions. There were 22 executions in 2019, down from 98 in 1999.Since the last federal execution, several states have moved away from the death penalty, including New Hampshire, which last year became the 21st state to abolish capital punishment.The Justice Department had initially planned to restart executions last year along a similarly busy timeline. Attorney General William P Barr announced last summer that it would begin carrying out executions again with a new lethal-injection protocol -- using only the drug pentobarbital -- and scheduled three executions over five days in December.But those plans were scuttled by legal challenges to the protocol, which was eventually upheld in court. Then this week, with the scheduled executions looming, they were repeatedly put on hold, then given the green light through numerous legal battles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-carries-out-third-federal-execution-in-four-days/story-QsTkzGK77PB78ae4PooaHM.html
18-07-2020||World||For first time, world records 1 million coronavirus cases in 100 hours||Global coronavirus infections passed 14 million on Friday, according to a Reuters tally, marking the first time there has been a surge of 1 million cases in under 100 hours.The first case was reported in China in early January and it took three months to reach 1 million cases. It has taken just four days to climb to 14 million cases from 13 million recorded on July 13.The United States, with more than 3.6 million confirmed cases, is still seeing huge daily jumps in its first wave of Covid-19 infections. The United States reported a daily global record of more than 77,000 new infections on Thursday, while Sweden has reported 77,281 total cases since the pandemic began.Despite the surging cases, a cultural divide is growing in the country over wearing masks to slow the spread of the virus, a precaution routinely taken in many other nations. US President Donald Trump and his followers have resisted a full-throated endorsement of masks and have been calling for a return to normal economic activity and reopening schools despite the surging cases.Other hard-hit countries have “flattened the curve” and are easing lockdowns put in place to slow the spread of the novel virus while others, such as the cities of Barcelona and Melbourne, are implementing a second round of local shutdowns.The number of cases globally is around triple that of severe influenza illnesses recorded annually, according to the World Health Organization.The pandemic has now killed more than 590,000 people in almost seven months, edging towards the upper range of yearly influenza deaths reported worldwide. The first death was reported on Jan. 10 in Wuhan, China before infections and fatalities then surged in Europe and later in the United States.The Reuters tally, which is based on government reports, shows the disease is accelerating the fastest in the Americas, which account for more than half the world’s infections and half its deaths.In Brazil, more than 2 million people have tested positive including President Jair Bolsonaro, and more than 76,000 people have died.India, the only other country with more than 1 million cases, has been grappling with an average of almost 30,000 new infections each day for the last week.Those countries were the main drivers behind the World Health Organization on Friday reporting a record one-day increase in global coronavirus cases of 237,743.In countries with limited testing capacity, case numbers reflect only a proportion of total infections. Experts say official data likely under-represents both infections and deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-first-time-world-records-1-million-coronavirus-cases-in-100-hours/story-w6OA8DwFy4E5ZSsNTSaPyK.html

We would need to call on Indian sides to resolve on the problem created on by the dams constructed on their side by calling on the meeting of JCIFM. Start preparations for it,” the Minister said.Nepal and India have been holding on the meeting of JCIFM annually on November but the Ministry has started on preparations to inform the Indian side with immediate effect after receiving a direct order from the Minister.“Annual meeting is held in the month of November but this time we have got the direct order from Minister so we will be informing the Indian side with immediate effect,” said Rabindrathan Shrestha, Secretary at the ministry.The Joint Commission formed by India and Nepal to discuss on the issue will be led by Director General of Nepal’s Irrigation Department Madhukar Prasad Rajbhandari.Earlier this week, Nepal’s Minister for Home Affairs had blamed India for the inundation of Terai region during the annual monsoon season.Earlier this week, Nepal Home Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa blamed India for constructing structures along the border, which he claimed blocked the flow of water and resulted in inundation of various places of the country.Bihar Water Resources Minister had said last month that Nepal had stopped all repair work of river embankments in Bihar on the India-Nepal border by erecting barriers and effectively putting a stop to work done by India to prevent flooding of its low-lying areas.Thapa had said some diplomatic steps undertaken by the Nepal government in order to solve but said it did not work out well.“Agreements over it were signed at the time of Indian Prime Minister’s visit to Nepal but all of them are yet to be implemented,” he saidAt least 60 people have died while 41 have gone missing in floods and landslides in the last four days in various parts of Nepal.Myagdi district of Western Nepal is the worst affected with 27 deaths.

It is threatening a free Taiwan and trying to dominate the world communications networks,” Pompeo said during a visit to Iowa on Friday (local time).“A few weeks back, I read a report about the Chinese Communist Party forcing mass abortions and sterilisation on Chinese Muslims in Western China. These are some of the most gross human rights violations we have seen and I have referred to it as the stain of the century,” he added.On Friday, Washington booked five Chinese foreign nationals and two Chinese entities under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act. It also imposed visa sanctions on certain employees of Chinese technology companies including Huawei that provide material support to regimes engaging in human rights abuses globally.In a statement on Wednesday, Pompeo had announced the restrictions and said: “Telecommunications companies around the world should consider themselves on notice: If they are doing business with Huawei, they are doing business with human rights abusers.”Pompeo had said that Huawei is an arm of the CCP’s surveillance state that censors political dissidents and enables mass internment camps in Xinjiang and the indentured servitude of its population shipped all over China.The US action comes a day after the UK announced its decision to ban British companies from buying Huawei-produced equipment for 5G networks from the end of the year.US President Donald Trump called Chinese technology “untrustworthy”.“We confronted untrustworthy Chinese technology and telecom providers. We convinced many countries not to use Huawei because it’s a big security risk. Just today, the UK announced that they are not going to be using it,” Trump had said on Wednesday.The United States had designated Chinese telecom companies Huawei and ZTE Corp as national security threats, saying they have close ties with the Chinese Communist Party and China’s military apparatus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-communist-party-trying-to-dominate-global-communication-networks-pompeo/story-bP3p50bRQz4Le2IdZgnM1J.html

18-07-2020||World||In Cochabamba, people buy fake - and toxic - virus cure||Long lines form every morning in one of the Bolivian cities hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic as desperate people wait to buy small bottles of chlorine dioxide, a toxic bleaching agent that has been falsely touted as a cure for Covid-19 and myriad other diseases. The rush in the city of Cochabamba to buy a disinfectant known to cause harm to those who ingest it comes even after the Bolivian Health Ministry warned of its dangers and said at least five people were poisoned after taking chlorine dioxide in La Paz, the capital. Dr. Antonio Viruez, who is treating the five at a hospital, said one incorrectly believed he had Covid-19 and developed pneumonitis, an inflammation of lung tissue, after taking chlorine dioxide and a medication used to treat parasite infestations. The other patients are improving, he said. “The Health Ministry cannot risk recommending something that doesn’t have a scientific basis,” said Miguel Ángel Delgado, a senior ministry official. However, Bolivia’s opposition-controlled congress is promoting the use of chlorine dioxide. Last week, the Senate approved a bill authorizing the emergency “manufacture, marketing, supply and use of chlorine dioxide solution for the prevention and treatment of coronavirus.” The bill would require the approval of interim President Jeanine Áñez, who is in quarantine after testing positive for the new coronavirus. She has sparred with opposition lawmakers loyal to Evo Morales, the former leader who was forced to resign last year after an election marred by irregularities. Many fearful residents in Cochabamba, where opposition support is strong, are giving chlorine dioxide a try. Cochabamba has reported about 440 deaths from Covid-19, or one-quarter of the total number of reported deaths in Bolivia. The real toll is believed to be higher. “I am afraid. I have to try it,” said Andrés Poma, a 34-year-old teacher who is skeptical that beleaguered health services can help him if he gets sick. “What am I going to do? Wait to die at the door of the hospital or at the door of my house?” Federico Anza, who sells chlorine dioxide at his Cochabamba store, said thousands of people have bought it, consuming it in drops. “My wife and I took it and nothing happened to us,” he said. He said his clients had not fallen ill after taking the agent, though provincial health authorities reported 10 cases of poisoning from chlorine dioxide in the past week. The governor of Cochabamba state, Esther Soria, said she supports a plan for a state law authorizing the use of chlorine dioxide and traditional medicine to treat Covid-19. Cochabamba’s mayor, José María Leyes, said he favors the free distribution of the bleaching agent to treat patients. But Fernando Rengel, president of the Cochabamba’s scientific association, said there are old beliefs that the toxic substance is “miraculous” and cures cancer, AIDS, malaria and other diseases, “but there is no scientific study that proves that it cures any disease.” Chlorine dioxide is one of a number of fake cures that have been promoted, often by fringe groups online, since the pandemic began. In April, a federal judge in South Florida ordered a Colombia-based group, the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing, to stop selling a related product, Miracle Mineral Solution, in the US Prosecutors said Genesis marketed the solution as a treatment for Covid-19, autism and other ailments. The US Food and Drug Administration has previously issued public warnings that MMS can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and severe dehydration. In April, US President Donald Trump mused about whether disinfectants could be injected or ingested to fight Covid-19, prompting intense blowback from doctors and other health officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-bolivian-city-people-buy-fake-and-toxic-virus-cure/story-GL7RSbmYd6UDgwbuXQLtGO.html

Speaking in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, MPA Ravi Kumar said the minorities were enjoying equal rights and living in peaceful coexistence with the majority community in Pakistan. The Pakistan government has approved Rs 10 crore for the Krishna temple, the first temple in Islamabad which will come upon a 20,000-square feet plot in the H-9 administrative division. “We would welcome the decision of the government as it would be according to law and the Constitution of the country. The minorities are enjoying equal rights and living in peaceful coexistence with the majority in Pakistan,” he said. He said action should be taken against those who are trying to wedge differences between Muslims and Hindus. Kumar submitted a resolution in the provincial assembly secretariat this week condemning the alleged derogatory remarks against the Hindu deities on social media on the issue of the construction of the temple. “This negative propaganda against Hindu religion has hurt the feelings of the Hindu community not only in Pakistan but all over the world,” the resolution stated. Anti-state elements were damaging inter-faith harmony and promoting hatred among the various sects, it said. On July 8, a Pakistani court dismissed three identical petitions challenging the construction of the first Hindu temple in Islamabad. A single bench of the Islamabad High Court delivered the judgment, making it clear that there was no bar on the Institute of Hindu Panchayat from building the temple on the land allotted to it by using its own funds. Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan. According to official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan. However, according to the community, over 90 lakh Hindus are living in the country. The majority of Pakistan’s Hindu population is settled in Sindh province where they share culture, traditions, and language with Muslims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hindu-community-will-welcome-construction-of-temple-in-islamabad-lawmaker/story-ksAZLviSKB24XOgewyu0aM.html
18-07-2020||World||Donald Trump offers all possible help to India, China||US President Donald Trump loves the people of India and China and wants to do “everything possible” to bring peace for them, according to his spokesperson.Over the past several weeks, the senior members of the Trump administration has come out in strong support of India against China’s aggression along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.“He (Trump) said I love the people of India and I love the people of China and I want to do everything possible to keep the peace for the people,” White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters at a news conference here on Thursday.She was responding to a question on Trump’s message to India, which recently had a violent standoff with China in eastern Ladakh along the LAC in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed. The Chinese military also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details. Welcoming the White House statement, Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, said that unlike his predecessor, President Trump has come out openly in support of India.“Most of the Indian-Americans have observed that every earlier president - be it a Democrat or Republican, like Bill Clinton or Bush Senior or Bush Jr or Barack Obama have been very scared to side with India openly, for fear of hurting China.“Only President Trump has had the courage to say that… I love India, America respects India… US stands with India - and that also, to over one billion Indians in India at the Namaste Trump rally held in India… and that too… near India’s neighbour China,” Mason said in a statement. “And he is consistent in his love for India and Indian-Americans,” he added. Earlier on Thursday, White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow described India as a great ally, saying President Trump is a great friend of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-offers-all-possible-help-to-india-china/story-MWJ6Ke7UrZMbLTFmK6ZAiK.html
18-07-2020||World||UK Indian doctors join legal challenge on Covid-19 guidance||The British Association for Physicians of Indian Origin (Bapio) on Friday said it has joined a legal challenge by two doctors against Britain’s health authorities for allegedly inadequate provision and guidance on personal protection equipment in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic.The challenge has been brought by doctor-couple Nishant Joshi and Meenal Viz. A high court judge will decide whether to grant permission for a judicial review. The legal papers also include a witness statement by Bapio president Ramesh Mehta.Over 300 health and social care workers have died due to the virus. The review is sought to challenge the lawfulness of the PPE guidance published by the Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England, which the petitioners say exposed the workers to the virus.Mehta said: “This case by Joshi and Viz is vital in establishing the obligation of government and its official bodies in the protection of health and social care workers against a second wave of Covid-19 and future pandemics”.Bapio said that as the largest organisation representing doctors, nurses and other care workers from the non-white communities, who have suffered disproportionately in terms of infections and fatalities, it commissioned and published several surveys on their experience.Mehta said it was the first medical organisation to write to the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, expressing concern about the disproportionate deaths of non-white doctors. Fatalities include several doctors and nurses of Indian heritage.Joshi and Viz, who have applied to the high court for permission to bring judicial review proceedings, have named Bapio as an interested party. The PPE guidance in focus allegedly included advice to use plastic aprons in hospitals, if gowns run out.Hospitals across the UK faced a severe shortage of PPE in the initial stages of the pandemic, until the Boris Johnson government imported large quantities, including some from India, besides making procurement from within the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-indian-doctors-join-legal-challenge-on-covid-19-guidance/story-HsYLr6PZfbnPtN4d5Eh2kN.html
