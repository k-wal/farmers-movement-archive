Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe bleak milestone comes amid signs that the nation’s outbreak is beginning to stabilise in the Sun Belt but heating up in the Midwest, fuelled largely by young adults who are hitting bars, restaurants and gyms again.The Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker put the nation’s confirmed infections at nearly 4.4 million, also the highest in the world.The current surge in the number of people infected and killed by the disease has been accompanied by a burgeoning outbreak of misinformation and conspiracy theories about supposed cures and the effectiveness of masks.People with travel links to China, Iran, and Italy accounted for nearly two-thirds of the initial cases outside mainland China in the pre-pandemic period between December 31, 2019 and March 10 this year, a study published in the medical journal Lancet says.The study says one in four of the first cases originated in Italy, and one in five in China. It also found four large clusters and outbreaks triggered in different countries to be linked with “transmission in faith-based settings”.Scientists have been researching how the coronavirus rapidly spread outside China since March when the World Health Organization declared the disease a pandemic.Meanwhile, the Emmy Awards show, slated for this September, may go virtual due to the pandemic, with celebrities having to appear online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/150-000-fatalities-america-crosses-bleak-milestone/story-1V8sdHEE5EF4XCV9t6y4PK.html

As per reports, Pakistan is planning to hold protests and reach out to several countries against India’s decision to scrap Article 370 that extended special status to Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-indulging-in-activities-to-deflect-attention-from-support-to-terror-india/story-9Rafm5HAQJK7aslGSaho3H.html
30-07-2020||World||Donald Trump kicks up storm with suggestion to delay polls||President Donald Trump kicked up a new storm Thursday with a suggestion to delay November 3 elections until people can vote “properly, securely and safely” in view of the Covid-19 epidemic, which has killed more than 150,000 Americans, including a former presidential candidate Herman Cain.Trump’s suggestion was part of his ongoing opposition to broadening the use of mail-in voting that is being actively discussed to encourage people to cast their votes in the polls. He has alleged it could lead to large-scale fraud, despite the fact he himself and many of his aides have voted by mail in the past.“With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???,” President Trump wrote in one of the many tweets he went out Thursday morning.The push back from critics was instantaneous. “Never in American history—not even during the Civil War and World War II--has there been a successful move to “Delay the Election” for President,” wrote Michael Beschloss, an expert on US presidential history.Ellen L Weintraub, a member of the Federal Election Commission, questioned a president’s authority and power to do change the election date. “No, Mr. President. No. You don’t have the power to move the election. Nor should it be moved. States and localities are asking you and Congress for funds so they can properly run the safe and secure elections all Americans want. Why don’t you work on that?”Republican leaders have also disputed the president and one of them told a reporter elections dates are set in stone.Other critics suggested President Trump’s suggestion was another of his attempts to distract attention from the rising death toll and infections from the Covid-19 epidemic, which is raging through the souther and western parts of the country in a resurgence partly triggered by lapses in mitigation efforts.Herman Cain, a restauranteur who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 (lost it to Mitt Romney), fell to Covid-19 related complications after weeks in hospital.“Herman Cain – our boss, our friend, like a father to so many of us – has passed away,” said an announcement on his website. “We all prayed so hard every day. We knew the time would come when the Lord would call him home, but we really liked having him here with us, and we held out hope he’d have a full recovery.”Dan Calabrese, the writer of that, post confirmed to the Washington Post that Cain had died of Covid-19.Though it was not known where and how he was infected, less than two weeks before his diagnosis, Cain had attended Trump’s election rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where many on the president’s campaign staff had tested positive for the infection.“Herman Cain embodied the American Dream and represented the very best of the American spirit,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany wrote in a tweet. “Our hearts grieve for his loved ones, and they will remain in our prayers at this time. We will never forget his legacy of grace, patriotism, and faith.”By Thursday morning, 150,765 American had been killed by the coronavirus and more than 4.43 million been infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-kicks-up-storm-with-suggestion-to-delay-polls/story-57iWXAEmeV9ZuaYT8un2QN.html
30-07-2020||World||Pompeo tells US senators ‘tide is turning’ against China, cites India’s actions||Secretary of State Michael R Pompeo on Thursday said US efforts to lead an “international awakening” against the Chinese government is working and the “tide is turning” as a result. He went on to cite Indian ban on Chinese apps as a manifestation of it along with the closer interactions of the Quad, and separate actions by other countries.Testifying at a US senate hearing on the 2021 budget for the state department, Pompeo also said he is not yet certain about the shape or form of the “new grouping of like-minded nations — an alliance of democracies” that he recently mooted to confront the global threat from China in a major policy speech from a California library named after President Richard Nixon, whose 1972 visit let to the thaw in US-China relations. Pompeo had then called for a global compact, arguing US policy of “bling engagement” with China had failed.The top US diplomat was pressed repeatedly by both Republican and Democratic senators on China, more than on any other foreign issues, reflecting the urgency felt among American policy makers on the issue.Calling the Chinese Communist Party — US officials insist on treating the Chinese government as an entity separate from the people — “the central threat of our times” as he has before, Pompeo told senators, the “incursion” against India and the “real-estate claim” against Bhutan and other conflicts around the world were indicative of Chinese intentions to expand their reach and to bring “socialism with Chinese characteristics” to the world.“Our vigorous diplomacy has helped lead an international awakening to the threat of the CCP,” he said, adding, “Senators, the tide is turning.”The secretary of state listed some of the global developments, he said, were the result of the American lead on international awakening against China: the growing ostracism of Chinese firms from the rollout of 5G networks, increasing rejection of Chinese claims in the disputed South China Sea, and the condemnation of the new laws in Hong Kong.“We’re proud to have stepped up maritime maneuvers in that body of water (the South China Sea) alongside friends like Australia, India, Japan, and the UK,” Pompeo said in his full and prepared remarks, which were different from the brief summary he read out as his opening statement.He added: “India has banned 106 Chinese apps, including TikTok, that threatened its citizens’ privacy and security.” The secretary of state had earlier indicated the United States had played an “assist” role in the first round of bans of 59 apps, without providing details. The US has since said it was considering a ban on TikTok and other Chinese apps and devices and companies threaten the security of the country.Pompeo said the US, Australia, India, and Japan have “reinvigorated” the “Quad” as part of an effort to confront China through multilateral bodies. He went on to say this “grouping is stronger than it has ever been and maybe we were gifted by General Secretary Xi (Jinping).”“He took actions that caused each of the leaders of those countries to recognize the value of this group,” he added. The secretary of answering a question about India’s invitation to Australia to join the upcoming military exercises with the United States and Japan.The top US diplomat went on to specify the many actions the Trump administration has taken against China in recent months: sanctions against Chinese officials for the mistreatment of Uighur muslims in Xinjiang; imposition of export controls on companies supporting it; termination of trade benefits for Hong Kong and the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston, which, he said, had become a “den of spies”.As further indication of the Trump administration’s intentions for the region, Pompeo said the state department was seeking $1.49 billion for foreign assistance to the Indo-Pacific region, a 20% increase from the FY 2020 request. “We want that part of the world to be free, open, and prosperous,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-tells-us-senators-tide-is-turning-against-china-cites-india-s-actions/story-CySZyPu9gyzNxnoScG1byN.html

It had been a long-running project for him. Lewis first introduced the bill in October 2011, two yeas after he led a congressional delegation to India to commemorate the 50th anniversary of King’s 1959 visit to India..“As the world’s oldest and largest democracies, the United States and India have long traditions of upholding these shared values championed by figures like Gandhi, King, and Congressman Lewis,” Ami Bera, the Indian American congressman who co-sponsored the legislation said in a statement. “But they are increasingly under threat in both countries. This legislation will help ensure those values endure and remind us that by holding true to them, we embody and live up to the best of our two nations.”The bill seeks to authorise the state department to set up, in cooperation with the Indian government, an educational forum for scholars from the two countries focussed on studying Gandhi and King. It also seeks the development of a professional development training initiative on conflict resolution based on the principles of non-violence, and the establishment of a foundation to address social, environmental, and health priorities in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-panel-passes-bill-to-promote-legacies-of-mahatma-gandhi-martin-luther-king-jr/story-4xonkFd770lI0QvZ6uKddJ.html

It cannot be changed without an act of Congress, which would be difficult to pass in the Democratic-controlled House.Trump trails Democratic nominee Joe Biden by 8 percentage points in the Real Clear Politics average of polls, as well as in averages of polls in the battleground states of Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-suggests-delaying-us-presidential-election-amid-claims-of-voting-fraud/story-uwYqen4Wu8pnQNczZnqK3H.html
30-07-2020||World||1.4 million seek jobless aid as coronavirus keeps forcing layoffs||More than 1.4 million laid-off Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, further evidence of the devastation the coronavirus outbreak has unleashed on the U.S. economy.The continuing wave of job cuts is occurring against the backdrop of a spike in virus cases that has led many states to halt plans to reopen businesses and has caused millions of consumers to delay any return to traveling, shopping and other normal economic activity. Those trends have forced many businesses to cut jobs or at least delay hiring.The Labor Department’s report Thursday marked the 19th straight week that more than 1 million people have applied for unemployment benefits. Before the coronavirus hit hard in March, the number of Americans seeking unemployment checks had never exceeded 700,000 in any one week, even during the Great Recession.The number of new applicants was up by 12,000 from the week before, the second straight increaseAll told, 17 million people are collecting traditional jobless benefits, a sign that unemployment checks are keeping many American families afloat financially at a time of big job losses and agonizing economic uncertainty.The pain could soon intensify: An supplemental $600 in weekly federal unemployment benefits is expiring, and Congress is squabbling about extending the aid, which would probably be done at a reduced level.A resurgence of cases in the South and the West has forced many many bars, restaurants, beauty salons and other businesses to close again or reduce occupancy. Between June 21 and July 19, for example, the percentage of Texas bars that were closed shot up from 25% to 73%; likewise, 75% of California beauty shops were shuttered July 19, up from 40% just a week earlier; according to the data firm Womply.And many states have imposed restrictions on visitors from states that have reported high level of virus cases, thereby hurting hotels, airlines and other industries that depend on travel.The virus and the lockdowns meant to contain it have hammered the American economy: Employers slashed a record 20.8 million jobs in April, restoring about 7.5 million of them in May and June as many states began to reopen their economies.Last week, an additional 830,000 million people applied for jobless aid under a new program that extends eligibility for the first time to self-employed and gig workers. That figure isn’t adjusted for seasonal trends, so it’s reported separately.Altogether, the Labor Department said that 30.2 million people are receiving some form of unemployment benefits, though the figure may be inflated by double-counting by states.Since she was laid off by a tech industry nonprofit May 15, Miranda Meyerson, 38, has been trying to find another job and to sign up for unemployment benefits. ”It’s just incredibly frustrating and demoralizing,’’ she said. Potential employers seem to be delaying hiring decisions. “Nobody gets back to you,’’ she said. “You feel like there’s only so long you can submit (applications) into a void.’’Meyerson and her partner moved from New York to Oakland, California, in March, just as the virus began to spread rapidly across the United States. The move to a new state has complicated her so far futile efforts to collect benefits from a swamped California unemployment benefits system. ”They’re obviously totally overwhelmed,” she said. “You can’t even get on the phone to talk to anybody.’’Allegra Troiano, 64, was stunned when the Milwaukee English language learning center she ran was closed in May. “They got through SARS. They got through the Ebola scare,’’ she said. “Nobody ever thought it would get to the point where we were shutting down.’’The extra $600 in unemployment pay has been a lifeline as she contends with a $2,200 mortgage and $600 in monthly health insurance expenses. “It means surviving,” she said.Laid off from his job as a bank security guard in March, James Adams, 53, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, said that “losing that $600 a week would be devastating. I have been having a hard time sleeping.’’A Trump voter, Adams has a message for Republican senators reluctant to spend more money on unemployment aid: “I know they want to be fiscal hawks, but swallow the bitter pill and help out the people who need this help.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-4-million-seek-jobless-aid-as-coronavirus-keeps-forcing-layoffs/story-BvwR5nsrPgsQ5xFnEllQEO.html

The US embassy in Islamabad said in a statement that the shipment was handed over to Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority as a symbol of “working together to fight Covid-19”. The ventilators, provided through the US Agency for International Development, arrived in Islamabad on July 28 and will be deployed in hospitals across Pakistan, it said. “The arrival of these ventilators delivers on President Donald Trump’s promise to Prime Minister Imran Khan to stand with the people of Pakistan and bring additional critically needed supplies and support to Pakistan’s urgent response to the pandemic,” the embassy said. The first batch of 100 ventilators had arrived on July 3 and have already been delivered to hospitals and healthcare facilities throughout Pakistan. “The United States is a proud partner with the Government of Pakistan to help stem the tide of this deadly pandemic and these ventilators will help with that fight,” US Ambassador to Pakistan Paul W Jones said. The ventilators can also be used to provide non-invasive respiratory therapy for patients before they become critically ill and help avoid the need for more extreme care. They can help treat a number of other respiratory ailments outside of the Covid-19 virus, including pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Through a specialised training programme developed with the National Disaster Management Authority and the Federal and Provincial Ministries of Health, and with funding from USAID, Pakistan will have a stronger arsenal with which to fight Covid-19 and other respiratory illnesses, said the embassy. It said that the US-Pakistan partnership in the health sector was strengthening the country’s ability to fight coronavirus by improving and expanding laboratory testing, disease monitoring, case tracking, infection prevention and control, and patient care. The United States is contributing more than USD 28 million in new funding so far for Covid-19 response to this vital partnership that is growing every day, the embassy said. A ventilator takes over the body’s breathing process when disease has caused the lungs to fail. This gives the patient time to fight off the infection and recover. Pakistan’s coronavirus tally reached 277,402 with the detection of 1,114 new cases, with the nationwide death toll standing at 5,924, the Ministry of National Health Services said on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-donates-100-ventilators-to-pakistan-to-combat-covid-19-pandemic/story-XOyDInYcj4yY5Slhb4CykN.html
30-07-2020||World||Oxford vaccine shows protection against Covid-19 in monkeys: Study||A Covid-19 vaccine candidate developed by the University of Oxford in the UK elicits an immune response and reduces the viral load in monkeys exposed to SARS-CoV-2 virus, according to a study published in the journal Nature on Thursday. The researchers from National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the US and the Oxford University found that the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine protects the macaques from Covid-19 pneumonia -- a complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection in which the lungs become inflamed and may fill with fluid. Preliminary results from this research were used to facilitate the start of clinical trials of the vaccine in humans, the researchers noted. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is made from a weakened chimpanzee adenovirus -- a group of viruses that can cause a range of illnesses, including the common cold -- that expresses the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a structure that enables the coronavirus to enter human cells. The researchers show that a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, given to six macaques 28 days before exposure to SARS-CoV-2, is effective in preventing damage to lungs and drastically reduces the viral load, when compared with six control animals. A further six macaques were given a booster course of two doses of the vaccine, at 56 and 28 days before challenge, which increased the immune response, the team found. The vaccinated animals showed no evidence of immune-enhanced inflammatory disease, which has been observed in some preclinical studies of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, according to the researchers. They noted that there was no difference in viral shedding from the nose between vaccinated and control animals. This finding indicates that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 may not prevent infection or transmission, but may reduce illness, the researchers noted. The study has led to clinical trials of the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine, which have enrolled more than 8,000 volunteers as of the beginning of July 2020, they said. Another study on 52 adult rhesus macaques published in the journal Nature on Thursday found that a single dose of a vaccine made from an adenovirus, a group of viruses that are linked to illnesses such as the mild cold, protected the animals against SARS-CoV-2. The optimal version of the vaccine is currently being evaluated in clinical trials, said the researchers of this study from Harvard Medical School in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-vaccine-shows-protection-against-covid-19-in-monkeys-study/story-BxPWAZQVJYh63j2WDkOM5J.html
30-07-2020||World||China’s PLA holds exercises in Tibet, flies jet bombers over South China Sea||China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has held “long-range precision” strike drills on the Tibetan plateau bordering India and flown latest jet bombers over the South China Sea (SCS) amid ongoing border friction with New Delhi and rising tension with the US over disputes with littoral countries in SCS region, the Chinese defence ministry said on Thursday.The Tibet military region, which borders India and is under the western theatre command in-charge of the boundary with India, has taken part in drills testing the PLA troops’ and armaments’ “long-range precision strikes”, defence ministry spokesperson, Ren Guoqiang said at the ministry briefing on Thursday.The exercise tested PLA’s artillery both at day and night, Ren said, according to reports on the briefing published in state media.“Recently, the Tibet Military Region has organised multiple types of artillery, day and night fire strike drills and artillery fire assault drills in high altitude areas, mainly to test the troops’ long-range precision strikes and fire assault capabilities in a plateau environment,” Ren said.“The above exercises are part of the annual training plan and are not targeted at any specific country,” Ren added without elaborating.The drills were held amid the ongoing border tension with India along the line of actual control (LAC) in Ladakh even as both sides are involved in intensive negotiation to disengage troops and ease the situation.Several rounds of diplomatic and military talks have been held between the two countries but the disengagement is yet to be completed.Separately, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin on Thursday sidestepped a question on Indian defence minister Rajnath Singh’s statement that those who want to threaten India’s territorial integrity should be worried about new Rafale fighter jets bought by India from France.When asked to comment on it, Wang said: “We hope the Indian side’s relevant remarks will be conducive to regional peace and stability”.Ren, the defence ministry spokesperson, also said Thursday that the PLA’s naval aviation unit of the Southern Theatre Command conducted “high-intensity exercises” in the SCS with new bombers to improve pilots’ combat techniques and overall all-weather fighting capability of the units.The units trained planes such as H-6G and H-6J bombers, as well as other new war planes, Ren saidThe “high-intensity exercises” featured drills such as taking off during day and night settings, long distance assault, and attacking maritime surface targets, he said.China claims almost all of the energy-rich SCS, which is also a major trade route. The Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan have overlapping claims.The US wants to portray itself as “referee” over the SCS issue but is actually the one that disturbs regional peace, destroys regional cooperation and sows discord among regional countries, Ren said, in response to a US State Department release that accused China of causing instability in the region by conducting military drills in the Xisha Islands. The US according to a Chinese academic has conducted six Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) so far this year, compared with four times in 2017, six times in 2018 and eight times in 2019.In addition, the U.S. military has conducted nearly 2,000 close-in reconnaissance operations on China from the air this year.”According to the think tank, US air force E-8C surveillance planes have come within 185km or less of the southeast coast of Guangdong province on four separate occasions in the past week.Last Sunday, an US anti-submarine warplane came within 100 km from Shanghai in eastern China, the closest that an American fighter aircraft has come close to the Chinese east coast shoreline in recent years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-pla-exercises-in-tibet-over-south-china-sea-sends-message-to-india-the-us/story-Kumxspy9Amfd0lIrX7xDdL.html

30-07-2020||World||China, India got lot richer but refused to take on any more responsibilities: Top US Senator||Countries like China and India have got a lot richer over the last two decades but they have refused to take on any more responsibilities, a top US Senator has claimed, as he applauded President Donald Trump for taking on this “imbalance” to make the World Trade Organization (WTO) relevant.Senator Chuck Grassley, Chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, made the comments during a Congressional hearing on WTO on Wednesday.“No one expected the Uruguay Round to be the last global trading round. Over the last two decades, countries like China and India got a lot richer, but they’ve refused to take on any more responsibilities,” he claimed.“In fact, they claim they are entitled to special treatment in any future negotiations because they are developing countries,” he said.The Senator said that the notion that China and India should get the same consideration as a country like Cameroon is ridiculous. “So I applaud the President for taking on this imbalance, and pushing to make the WTO relevant.” As part of reforms at the WTO, the US wants formulation of some guidelines that countries with high economic growth are prevented from taking benefits of special and differential treatment (S&DT), which is meant for developing and poor nations.The S&DT allows developing countries to enjoy certain benefits including taking longer time periods for implementing agreements and binding commitments, and measures to increase trading opportunities for them. Currently, any WTO member can designate itself as a developing country and avail these benefits.The US has submitted its suggestions to the WTO which states that self-declaration puts the WTO on a path to failed negotiations and it is also a path to institutional irrelevance.India is of the view that the matter needs to be negotiated comprehensively in the WTO and a consensus-based decision needs to be taken on S&DT. The country has also maintained that this is an essential principle of the WTO and the WTO reform process should not dilute this principle.Trump last year asked the WTO to define how it designates developing-country status, a move that was apparently aimed at singling out countries like China, Turkey and India which are getting lenient treatment under global trade rules.In a memorandum, Trump empowered the US Trade Representative (USTR) to start taking punitive actions if any country, advanced economies, are inappropriately taking benefits of the WTO loopholes.“The WTO is now 25 years old, but we have yet to see any major outcomes liberalising trade. The President has said we need dramatic change at the WTO. He’s emphasised to me that other countries’ tariffs and barriers are too high. He’s right,” Grassley said.Observing that when the WTO works right, Americans benefit, he said WTO rules allow the US to reap the rewards of that leadership.“When India refused to provide patent protection for American pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical products, we took them to the WTO - and won. You often hear about how important the ‘global box office’ is for Hollywood. It’s become lucrative because the WTO requires our trading partners to provide copyright protection and market access for US films,” he said.Grassley said that the WTO needs to be an effective forum for negotiating agreements again. That means not only concluding the fisheries negotiations, but also new agreements, including an ambitious agreement on e-commerce.When Congress ratified the WTO Agreements, there was no digital economy. Today, it accounts for nearly USD 2 trillion of the US economy. Again, this is an area of US leadership where we need rules to make sure we get a fair share from its trading partners, he added.“Second, we have to fix dispute settlement. I absolutely believe that we need enforceable rules. It’s much better to solve our trade disputes over legal briefs than through tariffs,” he said.“However, WTO dispute settlement has been breaking down for years. Fifteen years ago, I warned at a hearing like this one that the WTO Appellate Body wasn’t enforcing rules; it was legislating new ones. I don’t like that history proved me right,” he added.Calling for WTO reforms, Ranking Member Senator Ron Wyden said that the rules that underpin the WTO were crafted more than two decades ago, when China was an economic middleweight.At that time, many hoped and predicted that joining the WTO would drive China further away from abusive, one-party control of government, economy and society. That obviously did not happen, he said.“Under (Chinese) President Xi (Jinping), the government tightened its grip on power. The Chinese government identifies weaknesses in the WTO system, and other multilateral fora, and it seizes on them to further its own self interests.“Fixing the WTO is also going to require addressing its Appellate Body, which hampers the application of US trade enforcement laws to the detriment of American workers. There is a broad bipartisan view that WTO Dispute Settlement must be fixed to clamp down on judicial overreach,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-india-got-lot-richer-but-refused-to-take-on-any-more-responsibilities-top-us-senator/story-bwEUCAu05CBfiIpoPpNmCN.html

Trump, in his address on energy and the Permian Basin in Midland, Texas on Wednesday, said that by imposing these punishing restrictions -- and beyond restrictions – “the Washington radical-left, crazy Democrats” would also send countless American jobs, factories, industries to China and to other foreign polluting states. “They want us to take care of our air, but China doesn’t take care of its air. In all fairness, India doesn’t take care of its air. Russia doesn’t take care of its air. But we do. Not on my watch, it’s not going to happen -- I can tell you that. Because as long as I’m President, we will always put America first. It’s very simple,” he said. “For years and years, we put other countries first, and we now put America first. As we have seen in cities and towns across our nation, it’s not just Texas oil that the radical Democrats want to destroy; they want to destroy our country,” he said. Such radical Democrats, he alleged, do not love the country in any way, shape or form. “There’s no respect for the American way of life. There is no way of life ever in history that’s been like the great American way of life. There is no respect, but there is by you, and there is by 95 per cent of our people. Our people love our country, and our people love our anthem and they love our flag,” he said. Trump said that under the last administration, America’s energy industry was under relentless and unceasing attack. “But the day I took the oath of office, we ended the war on American energy and we stopped the far-left assault on American energy workers,” he said. Observing that he withdrew from the one-sided, energy-destroying Paris climate accord, he said this was a disaster and cost the US billions of dollars. The US in November last year formally notified the UN of its withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, a global agreement in which President Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama had played a key role. Although Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the historic pact on June 1, 2017, the process began last year with the formal notification and the US will be out of the pact on November 4, 2020. “It (Paris climate accord) would have made us a non-competitive nation. We cancelled the Obama administration’s job-crushing clean power plan,” he said as he listed some of the steps being taken by his administration. “For the first time in nearly 70 years, we have become a net energy exporter. And the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on the face of the Earth. To ensure we maintain this dominant position long into the future, my administration is announcing today that export authorisations for American liquefied natural gas can now be extended through the year 2050,” Trump added. India is the fourth highest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, accounting for 7 per cent of global emissions in 2017, according to the projection by the Global Carbon Project published in December, 2018. The top four emitters in 2017, which covered 58 per cent of global emissions, were China (27 per cent), the US (15 per cent), the European Union (10 per cent) and India (7 per cent), it said. In January 2019, the Indian government launched the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) to combat the rising level of air pollution. The NCAP, a five-year action plan, focuses on 102 polluted Indian cities and aims to reduce PM2.5 levels by 20-30 per cent over the next five years. It also aims to build a pan-India air quality monitoring network and improve citizen awareness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-india-china-and-russia-don-t-take-care-of-their-air/story-TGR4WdMIOUUPvOl1kscR4N.html
30-07-2020||World||UK worried about second wave of coronavirus in Europe, more quarantine measures possible||The British authorities are worried about a second wave of coronavirus infections in Europe and will not hesitate to bring back more quarantine measures, possibly within the next few days, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Thursday.Britain last week re-imposed a 14-day quarantine period on people arriving from Spain, a move that caused havoc to plans to reopen the continent for tourism in the summer high season.Hancock stopped short of naming other European countries that might also end up back on the UK quarantine list, but cited France as an example of one where infections have lately risen.“I am worried about a second wave. I think you can see a second wave starting to roll across Europe, and we’ve got to do everything we can to prevent it from reaching these shores, and to tackle it,” Hancock said during an interview on Sky News.“We have significant concerns about the second wave that is coming across Europe. And it’s not just Spain ... but there are other countries too where the number of cases is rising. And we are absolutely determined to do everything that we can to keep this country safe,” he said.When asked whether Britons should be prepared for more measures to be announced within the next few days, he said yes.“The number of cases have gone up sharply in some countries in Europe ... France now has more cases than we do, per day, and in Spain we saw the numbers shoot up which is why we had to take the rapid action that we did,” he said on Talk Radio.France reported almost 1,400 new cases on Wednesday, the highest daily increase in more than a month.Hancock said the British authorities were working on possible ways to shorten the quarantine period for people coming from Spain, but no change was imminent.“We are working on whether by testing people during that quarantine it is safe to then be able to release them earlier ... But we are not imminently making an announcement on it,” he said in a BBC television interview.He said that in Britain, the number of cases had stopped falling and was at best flat, which was a result of increased social contact as lockdown measures have gradually been eased. He urged people to keep following social distancing guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-worried-about-second-wave-of-coronavirus-in-europe-more-quarantine-measures-possible/story-xhz0FdfMbm3maloez3tlWK.html
30-07-2020||World||Scientists map how coronavirus spreads indoor via aerosol||Scientists have simulated how the novel coronavirus spreads indoors via aerosols as infected people speak or exhale, and have found the features of good ventilation that can filter virus particles out of the air, information that may help businesses and schools reduce Covid-19 transmission when they reopen. The researchers, including Jiarong Hong from the University of Minnesota in the US, modelled indoor airborne virus transmission via aerosols, which are tiny droplets ejected from people’s mouths when they exhale, speak, or cough. According to the yet-to-be peer reviewed study, published in the preprint server arXiv, when an infected person does this, the virus particles hitch a ride on the aerosols as they land on nearby surfaces, or are inhaled by another person. Using precise experimental measurements of aerosols released by eight asymptomatic individuals with Covid-19, the scientists numerically modelled the external flow of the virus through the air in three interior spaces -- an elevator, a classroom, and a supermarket. They then compared the virus transmission among different levels of ventilation, and with different spacing among the rooms’ occupants. “This is the first quantitative risk assessment of the spatial variation of risks in indoor environments. You see a lot of people talking about what the risks are of staying in confined spaces, but nobody gives a quantitative number,” Hong said. “I think the major contribution we’ve made is combining very accurate measurements and computational fluid dynamics simulation to provide a very quantitative estimate of the risks,” he added. Based on their experiments, the researchers found that in indoor spaces, good ventilation will filter some of the virus out of the air, but may leave more viral particles on surfaces. “Our results show that the design of ventilation is critical for reducing risk of particle encounters. Inappropriate design can significantly limit the efficiency of particle removal, create local hot spots with orders of magnitude higher risks, and enhance particle deposition causing surface contamination,” they wrote in the study. In the classroom setting, after running a 50-minute simulation with an asymptomatic teacher consistently talking, only 10 per cent of the aerosols were filtered out, the scientists said. The majority of the particles were instead deposited on the walls, they added. “Because this is very strong ventilation, we thought it would ventilate out a lot of aerosols. But 10 per cent is really a small number,” said Suo Yang, another co-author of the study. “The ventilation forms several circulation zones called vortexes, and the aerosols keep rotating in this vortex. When they collide with the wall, they attach to the wall,” Yang explained. However, the mechanical engineer said it’s very hard for the aerosols to reach the vent and actually go out since “they are basically trapped in this vortex.” In each scenario, the scientists mapped the air flow to find locations of virus “hot spots” in the indoor environment, or where the aerosols congregated. With the right combination of ventilation and interior organisation, they said it could be possible to mitigate the disease spread and avoid these hot zones. Citing the example of a classroom setting, the scientists said the virus aerosols spread significantly less throughout the room when the teacher, who is likely doing the most talking, was placed directly under an air vent. The researchers believe the findings could inform how classrooms are arranged and disinfected, and also help places like movie theatres and concert venues reopen with the proper precautions. “If you do a good job, if you have good ventilation at the right location, and if you scatter the seating of the audience properly, it could be much safer,” Yang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-map-how-coronavirus-spreads-indoor-via-aerosol/story-XwL7WD7oKYD9LEpxbAJ61L.html
30-07-2020||World||US, Australia reaffirm commitment to Quad consultations with Japan, India||The US and Australia have reaffirmed their commitment to Quad consultations with India and Japan, stressing that they are working side-by-side with other partners to maintain a secure, prosperous and rules-based Indo-Pacific, amidst China flexing its muscles in the region.The top ministers from the two countries on Tuesday reaffirmed that the Indo-Pacific is the focus of the alliance and that the US and Australia are working side-by-side, including with ASEAN, India, Japan, South Korea, and Five Eyes partners, to strengthen their networked structure of alliances and partnerships to maintain a region that is secure, prosperous, inclusive and rules-based.Quad or quadrilateral coalition represents four countries - India, Japan, Australia and the US. It was set up with an aim to ensure peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific and check China’s increasing efforts to expand military influence in the region.“I’m confident that our partners all across Europe and, frankly, democratic friends all across the world, whether that’s in India or Japan or South Korea - our Australian partners are here today - understand that the challenge of our times is to make sure that those nations that do value freedom and do want economic prosperity based on the rule of law will join together to deliver that for our people,” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a joint news conference.Pompeo was accompanied by US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne and Australian Defence Minister Linda Reynolds.The leaders committed to continue to work together with Indo-Pacific partner countries to mitigate any impacts of Covid-19 on exacerbating the regional terrorist threat and to support regional counter-terrorism partner countries in addressing these threats, including any potential movement of foreign terrorist fighters within the region.Pompeo commended Australia for publicly condemning China’s disinformation campaign and insisting on an independent review into the origin of the coronavirus.Pompeo said he talked at length at the meeting about the Chinese Communist Party’s malign activity in the Indo-Pacific region, and indeed all around the world.“The United States commends the (Scott) Morrison government for standing up for democratic values and the rule of law, despite intense, continued, coercive pressure from the Chinese Communist Party to bow to Beijing’s wishes,” Pompeo said.“It is unacceptable for Beijing to use exports or student fees as a cudgel against Australia. We stand with our Australian friends,” he said.In a joint statement issued after the Australia-US Ministerial Consultations, the two countries affirmed that China cannot assert maritime claims in the South China Sea based on the “nine-dash line,” “historic rights,” or entire South China Sea island groups, which are incompatible with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).China claims almost all of the South China Sea as its sovereign territory. It has been building military bases on artificial islands in the region also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.“They noted that the 2016 Arbitral Award is final and binding on both parties and emphasised that all claims in the South China Sea must be made and resolved in accordance with international law. They also expressed their support for the rights of claimants to lawfully exploit offshore resources, including in relation to long-standing oil and gas projects as well as fisheries in the South China Sea, free from harassment and coercion,” the statement said.“They welcomed the recent ASEAN Leaders statement that a South China Sea Code of Conduct should be consistent with UNCLOS, and emphasised that any Code should not prejudice the rights or interests of States under international law or undermine existing regional architecture, and should strengthen the commitment of parties not to engage in actions that complicate or escalate disputes, notably militarisation of disputed features,” the statement said.Payne said Australia and the US are deeply committed to strengthening health security efforts in the Indo-Pacific to help states combat Covid-19 and to prevent the emergence of future pandemics.“The rules-based global order is a constant, notwithstanding or perhaps even more so given the impact of the pandemic. We reiterate our commitment to holding states to account when they breach international norms and laws, as we have done and will continue to do so in relation to China’s erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong,” he said.“Together we share a common vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific where all nations, big and small, can enjoy the benefits of sovereignty; where free, fair, and reciprocal trade are the norm; where states adhere to international rules and norms; and where international disputes are resolved peacefully,” Esper said.During the meeting, they discussed a range of issues regarding the future of the region, including the impact of the global pandemic as well as the security situation in the South China Sea specifically and the Indo-Pacific more generally, the statement said.“We appreciate Australia’s significant contributions to Covid-19 response efforts, and we spoke in detail about the Chinese Communist Party’s destabilising activities and the fact that Beijing is increasingly resorting to coercion and intimidation to advance its strategic objectives at the expense of other nations,” Esper said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-australia-reaffirm-commitment-to-quad-consultations-with-japan-india/story-qb2tpqGJagQ4d6v3nDhdKO.html

Tahir Ahmad Naseem, from the minority Ahmadi community, was shot dead in a courtroom in Peshawar on Wednesday. He was on trial for blasphemy for allegedly claiming to be a prophet.“Condolences to family of Tahir Naseem, an American citizen who was killed today inside a courtroom in Pakistan. We urge Pak to take immediate action and pursue reforms that will prevent such a shameful tragedy from happening again,” tweeted Bureau of South & Central Asian Affairs, US State Department.Naseem, who was arrested in 2018, was accused of having violated Pakistan’s blasphemy laws that carry the death penalty for certain offences. He was shot in the courtroom by the person who had filed charges against him.In a related development, a member of Sindh assembly from the ruling PTI party has changed his DP on his social media page to display a picture of the murderer to pay tribute for his action. Ahmadis, a four million-strong minority group in Pakistan, have faced death, threats, intimidation and a sustained hate campaign for decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pursue-reforms-us-to-pak-after-man-killed-in-court-during-blasphemy-trial/story-s82PW4O7nPb2WLH12glqiL.html
30-07-2020||World||A new nuclear model could upend how countries count bombs||Nuclear analysts from the US and Russia settled on a new method to account for atomic weapons that may shrink estimates on the size of North Korea’s arsenal and could be used to aid future disarmament.Accounting for nuclear material stockpiled by countries is at the heart of the global arms-control system and plays a central role in verifying disarmament agreements. Publication of the new model in a forthcoming edition of Janes Intelligence Review comes as diplomats from the two countries with the biggest nuclear stockpiles convene in Vienna to discuss an extension of a treaty to limit the number of deployed weapons.“You cannot agree to get rid of something unless you know how many there are,” said Robert Kelley, a former nuclear-weapons engineer at the Department of Energy, who helped create the new accounting method with Vitaly Fedchenko, a Russian nuclear physicist who works at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.While figuring out the number of warheads in the arsenals of nuclear states has long been the focus of intelligence and military-planning officials, it’s also increasingly become an important number for researchers and diplomats promoting new approaches to eliminating atomic weapons.“Accounting for weapons-fissile material is one important piece of the puzzle,” said Alicia Sanders-Zakre, who coordinates research around the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. That document is gaining traction, requiring ratification from only 10 more countries for it to come into force.“This sets up an international framework for the elimination of nuclear weapons and technical research on weapons material accounting helps fill out that framework,” said Sanders-Zakre from the Geneva-based headquarters of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, which won the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize.The new model challenges public nuclear stockpile figures that “generally estimate the size and proliferant stockpiles by using simple models, largely ignoring thermonuclear stages and competing demands for nuclear materials and tritium,” wrote Kelley and Fedchenko in their paper, which was reviewed by U.K. defense and security officials to ensure classified information wasn’t divulged.Using North Korea as a case study, the researchers deconstructed the plutonium and highly-enriched uranium requirements for a two-stage thermonuclear weapon, which differ dramatically from simple single-stage devices modeled in most current studies. Countries with thermonuclear devices -- the likes of which Kim Jong Un is now widely suspected to possess -- have greater challenges when it comes to managing the material demands of plutonium, uranium and tritium in their weapons, according to the authors.The new model may prompt security experts to reassess their figures.“Janes concludes that North Korea’s nuclear arsenal is most likely to be in the range of 10-20 weapons if Pyongyang committed its highly-enriched uranium to thermonuclear weapons production,” the article said, which will appear in the IHS Markit Ltd. publication this week. That figure is at least two-thirds lower than the 60 nuclear-warhead estimate formulated by the Defense Intelligence Agency and published July 14 by the Congressional Research Service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-new-nuclear-model-could-upend-how-countries-count-bombs/story-i9pHohvE25gWEqLbVEzqhN.html

Prominent community leader and President of the American India Public Affairs Committee Jagdish Sewhani on Wednesday said that arrangements are being made to celebrate the historic moment in New York on August 5, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to lay the foundation stone for construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Sewhani told PTI that among the prominent billboards that are being leased for the occasion are the giant Nasdaq screen and the 17,000-square-foot wrap-around LED display screen, considered among the largest continuous exterior displays in the world and the highest-resolution exterior LED screen in Times Square. Beginning from 8 AM on August 5 till 10 PM, images of the words ‘Jai Shri Ram’ in Hindi and English, Lord Ram’s portraits and videos, 3D portraits of the temple’s design and architecture as well as pictures of the laying of the foundation stone by Modi will be displayed across several billboards, which are among the most striking and popular features of Times Square, one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. Sewhani said that members of the Indian community will also gather at Times Square on August 5 to mark the celebration and distribute sweets. “This is not a once in a lifetime or a once in a century event. This is an event that comes once in the life of mankind. We had to give it a befitting celebration and what better place than the iconic Times Square to commemorate the ‘Ram Janma Bhoomi shilanyas’ (groundbreaking ceremony). “Under Prime Minister Modi, the construction of the Ram Temple is a dream come true for Hindus all over the world. Till six years back, we never thought that this day will come soon but due to Modi’s leadership, this day has come and we want to celebrate it in a befitting way,” he said, adding that on August 5, images of Lord Ram will flood Times Square. Sewhani said that the Times Square commemoration is being made possible with the help and support of the community and sponsors. Prime Minister Modi had announced the formation of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust in February. The Trust has invited Modi to lay the foundation stone of the grand Ram Temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lord-ram-s-images-to-be-displayed-in-times-square-on-ram-temple-groundbreaking-day/story-EseELoxhtNSB0tRsAIZnzJ.html

The study also found four large clusters and outbreaks triggered in different countries to be linked with “transmission in faith-based settings”.The novel coronavirus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei province late last year before spreading within China and then triggering the worst global pandemic in recent histories. Scientists have been researching how the virus rapidly spread outside China March onwards when the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared it a pandemic.Also read: China logs another 105 Covid-19 cases in new surge, silent about virus link in XinjiangThe new study published on Wednesday in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal compiled publicly available information from the pre-pandemic period until March 10, the day before when the WHO declared it a pandemic.“Of the first confirmed Covid-19 case in each affected country outside mainland China, almost two-thirds had travel links to Italy, China, or Iran. Study suggests 1 in 4 of these first cases originated in Italy, and 1 in 5 in China,” the researchers found.The study said that many small clusters of household transmission were reported among early cases but clusters in occupational and community settings tended to be larger—supporting the role of physical distancing to slow the spread of Covid-19. The researchers went through available data from 99 countries including India.As much as three-quarters or 75 countries outside mainland reported the first Covid-19 case in people who had “…recently travelled to an affected country—with almost two-thirds of these first cases linked to travel to Italy (27%), China (22%), or Iran (11%),” according to the new research. Incidentally, in January, the first two confirmed cases of Covid-19 – then only known as an unidentified strain of coronavirus – were reported in South Korea and Thailand, both with travel history to Wuhan in central China.In India, the first three Covid-19 cases were diagnosed in three students who had returned from Wuhan in the first evacuation flight launched by New Delhi.“Our findings suggest that travel from just a few countries with substantial SARS-CoV-2 transmission may have seeded additional outbreaks around the world before the characterisation of Covid-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020,” says Dr Fatimah Dawood from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC), who co-led the research.“In this study, researchers examined publicly available online reports from national ministries of health and other government agency websites, social media feeds, and press releases on a daily basis to identify newly confirmed cases of Covid-19 reported between December 31, 2019, and March 10, 2020 (ie, during the pre-pandemic period, corresponding to weeks 1-11 of the outbreak).”During the first 11 weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak, 32,459 Covid-19 cases were identified from 99 countries and locations outside mainland China.“Travel to Italy was linked with half (3/6 cases) of the first-reported cases in Africa, and over a third (36%, 16/45) in Europe and the Americas (38%, 5/13). Travel to mainland China accounted for 83% (10/12) of the first reported cases in the Western Pacific and over half (57%, 4/7) in Southeast Asia.”Seven or 44% of the first reported cases in the Eastern Mediterranean region had a history of travel to Iran. Analysing the data, the researchers found that household transmission was reported in three-quarters (76/101) of clusters, with an average of 2.6 cases in each cluster.“By contrast, the 11 clusters related to community gatherings (ie, tour groups, faith-based groups, and dinner parties; average 14.2 cases per cluster), and the 14 clusters reported in non-health-care occupational settings (average 4.3 cases per cluster), tended to be larger—supporting a possible role for physical distancing in slowing the spread of Covid-19,” researchers said.One of the authors suggested the importance of coordinating with religious groups in preventing cluster infections.“Four large clusters in our analysis, and large outbreaks reported elsewhere, have been linked with the transmission in faith-based settings, highlighting the need to partner with faith-based organisations when designing and implementing community mitigation efforts,” said co-author Dr Philip Ricks from the US CDC.Limitations of the study include the fact that the first confirmed case in each country might not have been the first true case of infection in some countries, since early case detection efforts varied substantially.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pre-pandemic-covid-19-cases-linked-to-china-italy-iran-report/story-NFg1TGfFNSgLZT4mUEpvsI.html

Most cases in XUAR, which now has 418, have been detected in the provincial capital, Urumqi, where widespread nucleic acid testing has been ordered and some residential communities isolated.In the northeastern city of Dalian, a 58-year-old man working with a local seafood company was the first to be diagnosed with Covid-19 in the latest outbreak.The city has now logged 57 locally transmitted cases most of whom were either employees of Dalian Kaiyan World Seafood company or their family members, state media reported.So far, cases related to Dalian have been found in other cities of Liaoning, and in other provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Fujian, as well as in Beijing.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage All the 344 people working at the company have been quarantined.“A total of 17,595 medics have been mobilised to conduct nucleic acid tests at 2,698 testing sites across the city, with nearly 3.53 million samples collected by midnight Tuesday,” Zhao Lian, deputy director of the municipal health commission, told state media.Meanwhile, one of China’s top epidemiologist has said the Covid-19 outbreaks in the central Chinese city of Wuhan – where the coronavirus first emerged in late 2019 -- Beijing and Dalian share certain similarities “…as they all took place in the cold contaminated environment of seafood markets, and the virus may have infected people through aerosols.”In an interview with Chinese media on Wednesday, Wu Zunyou, the chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said their humid and low-temperature environment is more conducive for the coronavirus to survive. Wu told Chinese media that an experiment carried out in Beijing’s Xinfadi market, which was linked to the June outbreak in the capital, in which a fluorescent powder was used to simulate the virus, showed that if the environment was contaminated, the virus could infect people through aerosols. Workers could then pollute the environment after becoming infected, forming a mixed transmission mode, Wu added.The Chinese media reports did not mention if Wu shed any light on the source of the new outbreak in Xinjiang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-logs-another-105-covid-19-cases-in-new-surge-silent-about-virus-link-in-xinjiang/story-urh9MMWvnq1rO9cR8thmiP.html

Strict adherence to the plan allowed the country to claim victory over the virus this spring, stamping out clusters.Faced with a resurgence that has similarly confounded Japan, Hong Kong and Australia, Vietnamese authorities are moving to contain a fresh cluster that has led to 36 new cases in the past week, for a total of 459 cases as of Thursday morning. Officials imposed strict quarantines on thousands of people who may have been exposed in the coastal city of Danang, reimposed stay-at-home measures and tightened border and immigration controls to prevent illegal entry. The government is now warning the virus could spread to other regions, including Ho Chi Minh City and the capital of Hanoi, where officials are suspending large gatherings such as religious activities and ordering bars to close.“The CDC has been working with us and helped us build up a plan that put in place steps to fight against pandemics,” said Tran Dac Phu, senior adviser at the Public Health Emergency Operations Center under the nation’s Ministry of Health. “The government is now very concerned about a second wave. We continue to work with the CDC and World Health Organization on this.”Key to the government’s success so far has been its ability to move quickly to test patients, isolate those who are sick, aggressively trace contacts and quarantine for 14 days those who come in contact with positive cases. It’s also been essential to have consistent and transparent communication with the public, said Dr. Matthew Moore, director of the CDC’s Global Health Security Program in Vietnam.The agency, which has been in Vietnam for 20 years and has a staff of 58 in the country including eight Americans, works with the government on testing protocols, guidelines to prevent transmission in health-care settings and training in epidemiology.“Time and time again they have shut down chains of transmission,” he said.Laser-Like FocusVietnam, a country whose 96 million citizens had a gross domestic product per capita of $2,715 last year, has been able to control the outbreak because of the government’s laser-like anti-virus focus, a one-party political system and a population that didn’t need convincing as a result of past disease outbreaks. The U.S., with a gross domestic product per capita of $65,280 in 2019, has not.Vietnam’s success has been globally lauded. The U.S., meanwhile, has surpassed 4.3 million cases and 149,000 deaths while President Donald Trump has consistently downplayed the spread of the virus. Rather than following the advice of the experts, in July he retweeted a post claiming the CDC was lying about the virus.There have been dramatic differences between how Vietnam and U.S. approached the contagion crisis. Within weeks of Vietnam’s first reported cases in late January, the government closed schools. The Trump administration continues to resist school shutdowns, and has even threatened to withhold federal funding from schools that don’t bring back students.Hanoi quickly deploys tests to anyone suspected of exposure to the virus, while the U.S. continues to face testing shortcomings. Danang’s authorities shut down two hospitals where two victims visited and ordered patients, medical staff, caregivers and family members -- about 8,800 people in total -- to be quarantined for 14 days at centralized bases, hospitals and homes, according to the city’s health department. A third hospital also was closed.Vietnam has some key advantages the U.S. doesn’t in combating the virus. The Communist Party-controlled government dominates a society with a culture of collectivism, and its tough measures, like willingness to put in place lockdowns when needed, has been met with little resistance from the population.This comes despite the fact that its quarantine regime is uncompromising and one of the strictest in the region. The government has placed Vietnamese and even foreigners seen at high risk of infection into isolation, sometimes at remote military camps.Still, an edge Vietnam has over the U.S. is the consistent message it has sent to the public about combating the virus, said Dr. Todd Pollack, an infectious disease specialist with the Harvard Medical School Partnership for Health Advancement in Vietnam.The government’s communications campaign includes posters in residential and office complexes, text messages, an app to help Vietnamese trace cases near them, regular updates on the Ministry of Health’s website and even a pop song encouraging hand-washing and social distancing.Past EpidemicsHelping the country fight the virus has been the memory of past epidemics. The SARS outbreak in 2003 during killed five people in Vietnam and the bird flu led to 52 deaths in repeated outbreaks between 2004 and 2008. The country is also currently coping with a diphtheria outbreak that has caused three deaths, leading the government to isolate 700 people in a village in the coffee-growing Central Highlands province of Dak Lak.Vietnam’s aggressive anti-virus measures have come at a cost: Almost 31 million workers have experienced job losses or pay cuts amid the restrictions. Vietnam’s economy could grow 3% to 4% this year -- half the official target of 6.8%, according to a government advisory council.Meanwhile, the government is getting pushback from some overseas-based companies as it strives to maintain its second-wave vigilance. Companies from South Korea, Vietnam’s second-largest foreign investor, are pressuring the government to lift mandatory two-week quarantines of their workers traveling to Vietnam, local media outlet VnExpress reported.Yet the country’s decisive actions may have burnished its reputation among companies seeking to diversify supply chains away from China. Some Japanese companies, with financial incentives from their government, are looking to relocate operations to Vietnam. Taiwanese company Inventec Corp., Apple Inc.’s assembly partner for AirPods, is preparing to establish a unit in Vietnam and other suppliers of the Cupertino, California-based company may follow.Now the government’s all-hands-on-deck counterattack is kicking in again. “We are improving our quarantine facilities to be able to isolate more people when needed,” the Ministry of Health’s Phu said.(Updates with more virus cases in the fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-advice-ignored-by-trump-helps-vietnam-fight-virus/story-tZskuBfTTazioJ8YtLM8GJ.html

Mauritius has benefited from a special economic package of $353 million, with one of the key projects – the new Supreme Court building – set to be inaugurated by the prime ministers of the two countries during a virtual event on Thursday. The other infrastructure projects that were part of the package are the Metro Express project worth $275 million, the first phase of which has been completed, a $14-million ENT Hospital, which has been completed, and a social housing project with nearly 1,000 units. India is the largest development partner for Mauritius, for which it has provided lines of credit worth $600 million at concessional terms, with the focus on developmental projects. India is assisting in the building of healthcare facilities such as a renal unit, four medical clinics and two health centres, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. Mauritius is also one of the largest beneficiaries of the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) programme, with 210 civilian and 169 defence training slots being offered to the country during fiscal 2018-19. India has revitalised its relationship with the Maldives over the past 18 months after President Ibrahim Solih came to power, and the two sides have signed 18 agreements and MoUs, and new areas of cooperation include the judiciary, customs and healthcare, the people said. A financial aid package of $1.4 billion announced during Solih’s visit to India in December 2018 has been fully activated, and includes budgetary support, investment in the Maldives Monetary Authority’s treasury bills, a currency swap agreement and a new line of credit for $800 million, they said. Several big ticket infrastructure projects, such as an international cricket stadium, expansion of Hanimadhoo airport and the Gulhuifalhu port project, are part of this line of credit. India is also assisting in modernising the Maldives’ defence sector and gifted a fast interceptor vessel last December, the people said. India has also undertaken several developmental, connectivity and capacity-building projects in Sri Lanka, where the total development assistance portfolio exceeds $3.45 billion, including $560 million in grant assistance. The Indian Housing Project to build 50,000 houses is the flagship grant assistance project, and more than 48,600 houses have been built so far. Another 10,000 houses will be built for Indian-origin Tamils in the upcountry region, the people said. India also played a key role in improving connectivity in Sri Lanka by restoring railway lines that were damaged by the 2004 tsunami and by reconnecting the northern region with the rest of Sri Lanka by establishing railway signalling systems and supplying rolling stocks, the people said. All three Indian Ocean countries also benefited from India’s assistance to counter the Covid-19 pandemic. India was the first country to send a medical consignment to Mauritius, which included hydrocloroquine tablets and other medicines. An Indian medical assistance team was also deployed to Mauritius. The Maldives was the biggest beneficiary of India’s Covid-19-related aid among neighbouring countries, and received two consignments of medicines, 600 tonnes of food supplies and a 14-member medical rapid response team. Sri Lanka received four consignments of Covid-19-related essential medicines and equipment in April and May, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-mauritius-development-package-india-aims-to-bring-indian-ocean-states-closer/story-TmzrrnJOGsNgswWow8QLSM.html
30-07-2020||World||CSIR experts lead effort to prove unique mutation of Sars-Cov-2||Researchers from the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) are trying to establish the prevalence of a unique mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 that was discovered in samples of patients a couple of months ago.The researchers from the CSIR’s Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) and Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology sequenced about 64 genomes and found the unique variant called Clade I/A3i. A virus variant is defined as an isolate (or a set of isolates) whose genomic sequence differs from that of the reference virus. It is also termed as a genetic mutation in the original virus.Hospital-based clinical data is being used to determine the prevalence of Covid-19 infections due to the variant discovered, and to also establish whether the mutation found is functionally silent or has some virulence. In some cases, mutations of disease-causing viruses causes a decline in virulence, but that is yet to established in the case of this mutation. “More research is needed to get a prevalence of this particular variant among cases of Covid-19 in India, and also (to find out) how virulent is the strain. It can happen only through analysing data from hospitals. Initially, we picked up 30 odd samples but we would need at least five times more samples,” said CCMB director Dr Rakesh Mishra. The datasets of Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data till May 25 were used for the analysis. “What we have managed to sense so far is that this particular variant is dying down and other strains are infecting (people) more but this needs to be scientifically established.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/csir-experts-lead-effort-to-prove-unique-mutation-of-sars-cov-2/story-KgRSWKnpz76osjxzYpaAhL.html
30-07-2020||World||4 arrested under new Hong Kong security law for online posts||Hong Kong police have signaled their intent to enforce a new Chinese national security law strictly, arresting four youths Wednesday on suspicion of inciting secession through social media posts.Three males and one female, aged 16 to 21, were detained, a police official said at an 11 p.m. news conference. All are believed to be students.“Our investigation showed that a group has recently announced on social media that they have set up an organization for Hong Kong independence,” said Li Kwai-wah, senior superintendent of a newly formed unit to enforce the security law.The 1-month-old law has chilled pro-democracy protesting as activists along with academics and others wonder if their activities could be targeted.The central government in Beijing imposed the national security law on the semi-autonomous Chinese territory after city leaders were unable to get one passed locally. The move has raised fears that Hong Kong’s freedoms and local autonomy are being taken away.Police did not identify the suspects or their group. An organization called Studentlocalism — which announced it was disbanding just before the law took effect — said on Facebook that four former members had been arrested on secession charges, including ex-leader Tony Chung.The police action appeared to target the Initiative Independence Party, which says on its Facebook page that it consists of former Studentlocalism members who have completed their studies and are overseas.The party, which also posted the news of Wednesday’s arrests, advocates for independence because it believes full democracy for Hong Kong is impossible under Chinese rule, its Facebook page says.Li said only that the group in question had set up recently and that the posts were made after the law took effect late on June 30.“They said they want to establish a Hong Kong republic, and that they will unreservedly fight for it,” he said. “They also said they want to unite all pro-independence groups in Hong Kong for this purpose.”He warned anyone who thinks they can carry out such crimes online to think twice.Police have made a handful of other arrests under the new law, all of people taking part in protests and chanting slogans or waving flags deemed to violate the law.China promised Hong Kong would have its own governing and legal systems under a “one country, two systems” principle until 2047, or 50 years after Britain handed back its former colony in 1997.China, in justifying the new law, says issues such as separatism are a national security concern and, as such, fall under its purview.The latest arrests came one day after a leading figure in Hong Kong’s political opposition was fired from his university post.Hong Kong University’s council voted 18-2 to oust Benny Tai from his position as an associate law professor, local media reported.Tai has been out on bail since being sentenced to 16 months in prison in April 2019 as one of nine leaders put on trial for their part in 2014 protests for greater democracy known as the Umbrella Movement.In a posting Wednesday on his Facebook account, Tai said he intended to continue writing and lecturing on legal issues and asked for public support.“If we continue in our persistence, we will definitely see the revival of the rule of law in Hong Kong one day,” Tai wrote.While the 2014 movement failed in its bid to expand democracy, protests returned last year over a legislative proposal that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to face trial in mainland China.Although the legislation was eventually shelved, protester demands expanded to include calls for democratic change and an investigation into alleged police abuses. They grew increasingly violent in the second half of the year.In a statement issued after the vote to remove Tai, the Chinese government’s liaison office in Hong Kong said it was “a punishment for evil doing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4-arrested-under-new-hong-kong-security-law-for-online-posts/story-PSEKqQuF8hHbEYlYWBWuwM.html
30-07-2020||World||In underground ballistic missiles launch drill, Iran fires at fake US Nimitz carriers||Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard launched underground ballistic missiles Wednesday as part of an exercise involving a mock-up American aircraft carrier in the Strait of Hormuz, highlighting its network of subterranean missile sites.Although state television documentaries have focused on operations at underground bases, all have avoided showing geographic details revealing their locations. Wednesday’s launch from what appears to be central Iran’s desert plateau may have changed that amid heightened tensions between Tehran and the US over its tattered nuclear deal with world powers and as economic pressures grow.“We have carried out the launch of ballistic missiles from the depths of the earth for the first time,” Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the Guard’s aerospace division, told state TV. “That means without utilizing conventional launchpads, the buried missiles suddenly rip out of the earth and hit their targets precisely.”Drone footage captured by the Guard showed two missiles blasting out from covered positions in the desert early Wednesday morning, with debris flying up into the air in their wake. The Guard did not identify the location of the launch, nor the missiles involved.The launch, six months after the Guard shot down a Ukrainian jetliner and killed all 176 people on board, appeared geared toward demonstrating the strength of its missile program to a domestic audience, missile expert Melissa Hanham said. The above-ground footage shown on state television, coupled with investigative techniques, make it possible to locate the site, she said.“Once you find the silo, it’s really not a safe place to keep your missile anymore,” said Hanham, who works as the deputy director of an Austria-based group called the Open Nuclear Network.Since its bloody 1980s war with Iraq, which saw both nations fire missiles on cities, Iran has developed its ballistic missile program as a deterrent, especially as a UN arms embargo prevents it from buying high-tech weapons systems. The underground tunnels help protect those weapons, including liquid-fueled missiles that can only be fueled for short periods of time, Hanham said.“What they’re trying to do is increase the survivability of their missile forces,” she said. “They feel that their missile forces are exposed and that they could be taken out preemptively. By building this elaborate tunnel scheme, they’re trying to increase the survivability.”Iran also could have used missiles buried in hermetically sealed canisters for the launches without the need for a major underground base, said Michael Elleman, a missile expert and the director of the nonproliferation and nuclear policy program at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Solid-fuel propellant could allow such missiles to be buried for years, he said.“Presumably, these missiles can be launched remotely, without a launch crew on site,” Elleman said. “Perhaps the launch crew is nearby, and has operational control of several to a handful of missiles.”However, he said he suspected the US likely knew where the missiles were buried.“Maybe not all of them, but a large percentage,” Elleman said. “If so, they are vulnerable to pre-launch strikes during a crisis.”The drill, called “Great Prophet 14,” also sends a message to the United States. Iran has been firing at a fake aircraft carrier resembling America’s Nimitz-class carriers towed out to the strait by a tugboat. Adm. Ali Reza Tangsiri, the Guard’s naval chief, said its armed drones attacked the bridge of the fake carrier Wednesday, the semiofficial Tasnim news agency reported.During Wednesday’s drills, footage showed a missile striking a target resembling an American missile defense system known as a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD.Tasnim published a graphic overnight that altered the image of an American carrier into the shape of a casket with a set of crosshairs on it, with a caption quoting Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei pledging to seek revenge for the U.S. drone strike that killed a top Iranian general in January.The drill — and the American response to it — underline the lingering threat of military conflict between Iran and the U.S. after a series of escalating incidents last year led to the January drone strike. Tehran responded to that strike by firing ballistic missiles that wounded dozens of American forces in Iraq.While the coronavirus pandemic has engulfed both Iran and the US for months, there has been a growing confrontation as America argues to extend the yearslong UN weapons embargo on Tehran that is due to expire in October. A recent incident over Syria involving an American jet fighter approaching an Iranian passenger plane also has renewed tensions.Economic pressure from the collapse of the nuclear deal, caused by President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrawing America from the accord, has seen Iran’s rial currency drastically drop in value. At the time of the deal in 2015, $1 cost 32,000 rial. Today, $1 is worth some 235,000 rials.Ballistic missile fire detected from the drill Tuesday resulted in American troops being put on alert at Al-Dhafra Air Base in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates and Al-Udeid Air Base, the forward headquarters of the US military’s Central Command in Qatar, the military said. Troops briefly sought cover during that time.Both bases are hundreds of kilometers (miles) away from where Iran placed the replica aircraft carrier in the strait, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all oil traded passes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-underground-ballistic-missiles-launch-drill-iran-fires-at-fake-us-nimitz-carriers/story-caZ7IKdA0aUukkadgtvYsL.html

Lam said, “We are on the verge of a large-scale community outbreak, which may lead to a collapse of our hospital system and cost lives. I appeal to you to strictly follow social distancing measures and stay at home.”In China, 89 cases were reported from Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, in a record single-day spike. It took the total number of infections in the province to more than 320.Also on Wednesday, the BBC reported that US attorney general William Barr will undergo a Covid-19 test since he had recently come into contact with Texan Republican congressman Louie Gohmert, who has tested positive. Barr had reportedly met Gohmert while testifying before the House judiciary panel on Tuesday.Coronavirus deaths in the US rose by more than 1,200 on Tuesday, the biggest one-day increase since May. California and Florida reported a one-day record spike in deaths on Tuesday, together accounting for 362 of the 1,227 new fatalities.US President Donald Trump issued a stout defence of the antimalarial drug HCQ as treatment for Covid-19, hours after social media companies took down videos promoting its use as misinformation.

30-07-2020||World||Australia sets Covid-19 record as Melbourne lockdown struggles||Australia has suffered its worst day of coronavirus infections with Victoria state recording 723 new cases, dashing hopes that a lockdown in the city of Melbourne was bringing the outbreak under control.Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters that 13 more people had died, bringing the state’s death toll to 105. Infections had gradually decreased earlier this week, with the state recording 295 new cases on Wednesday, raising hopes the six-week lockdown of the city of 5 million people was working.“Most of today’s cases are in metro areas,” Andrews said in a statement. “But we have seen a significant jump in regional communities. It’s vital we stop this virus further seeping into regional Victoria.”He said mask-wearing would be mandatory across the state, extending the order from just Melbourne. Residents in several regional centers, including Geelong, would not be allowed to have visitors in their homes from midnight.There are mounting concerns that the stay-at-home order in Melbourne, begun three weeks ago, will need to be extended, inflicting further damage on the economy. Health authorities are also concerned the virus is spreading to other states and territories, most of which have gone weeks without recording community transmissions.The Australian dollar fell 0.2% to 71.72 US cents as investors sold the currency on the spike in cases.New South Wales state on Thursday reported 18 new cases in the past 24 hours.Queensland, which has closed its border to Victoria and the Greater Sydney area, is ramping up testing after two women who visited Melbourne didn’t self-isolate on their return and instead went to schools, restaurants and shopping centers for eight days unchecked before returning a positive result.The resurgence in Victoria is taking a heavy toll on residents of age-care homes and is placing the health-care system under stress. The state said Tuesday it will suspend all but the most urgent elective surgeries in Melbourne as it seeks to free up hospital beds and nurses to fight a spike of cases in such facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-sets-covid-19-record-as-melbourne-lockdown-struggles/story-pXseRWwgSRC2oeKQYTOCiM.html

It is yet to show action on 13 out of 27 items of its FATF Action Plan. This is despite all the deadlines of completing the action expired long ago,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said.“The continued Greylisting of Pakistan vindicates our position that Pakistan has not taken appropriate action against terror financing and safe havens which exist in that country,” he added.This came after Pakistan received another extension on the Grey List during the FATF plenary session.Pakistan will likely remain in the Grey List till February 2021 even if it completes all its action plan items by October 2020 as an on-site visit by the FATF team would have to be held to confirm completion of the plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fatf-related-legislation-will-move-pakistan-from-grey-list-to-white-list-claims-minister/story-KXGG9PYoa8urgzFlPwzv2N.html
30-07-2020||World||Ghislaine Maxwell seeks appeal of judge’s order to unseal documents||A US judge rejected Ghislaine Maxwell’s request to delay or reconsider her order unsealing the British socialite’s 2016 testimony in a defamation lawsuit, calling the request “extraordinary” and saying it came at the “eleventh-hour.”US District Judge Loretta Preska dismissed Maxwell’s arguments that disclosing the British socialite’s sworn testimony, along with other sealed evidence in the civil case, could harm her right to a fair trial on sex-trafficking charges and “inappropriately influence potential witnesses or victims.”Maxwell’s lawyer Laura Menninger immediately notified Preska that she will ask the federal appeals court in Manhattan to review the decision. Preska’s ruling late Wednesday came almost a week after she ordered the documents unsealed -- including portions of Maxwell’s deposition and emails the socialite exchanged with Epstein.Earlier Wednesday, Maxwell again argued against the release of the material, prompting Preska to respond that the socialite’s arguments were going over “plowed ground.”In her four-page ruling, Preska ordered that some evidence collected in the lawsuit can be released as early as Thursday. The judge said the sworn testimony Maxwell gave in 2016, as well as the account of an alleged victim identified only as “Doe 1,” could be unsealed Aug. 3.Maxwell, 58, is in a federal jail in Brooklyn, New York, after having pleaded not guilty to sex-trafficking charges tied to her former boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein. She is charged with trafficking girls as young as 14 to be sexually abused by Epstein and also accused of sometimes participating in the abuse.Her sworn testimony and other evidence were collected as part of a defamation suit filed by Virginia Guiffre, who claims Maxwell and Epstein lured her into becoming the financier’s sex slave when she was 16. She sued Maxwell for calling her account “obvious lies.” The lawsuit was settled out of court.Maxwell will now take her challenge to the same appeals court that last August ordered the unsealing of at least 2,000 pages of documents filed in the case. Epstein was found dead of an apparent suicide in his Manhattan jail cell a day after the ruling was handed down.Maxwell earlier argued against further disclosure of the materials, saying one document pertained to Giuffre’s efforts “to compel Ms. Maxwell to answer intrusive questions about her sex life” during her deposition.Perjury ChargesThe socialite’s testimony in the lawsuit became a crucial matter for the government, which used some of it as the basis for two perjury charges in the new criminal case. Prosecutors say the socialite was lying when she denied having any knowledge about Epstein’s sexual interactions with underage girls or being present when they occurred.The testimony in the civil case -- which was ordered sealed by a judge under a settlement agreement -- should never have been given to prosecutors, Maxwell’s lawyers argued. They questioned how the government got its hands on the information.The defense team accused Guiffre’s lawyers of having leaked or “caused someone to leak the evidence” to prosecutors and argued the government and Guiffre set a “perjury trap,” for the socialite.If not for the promise of confidentiality for her testimony, Maxwell would have invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during the deposition, her lawyers said.Jim Margolin, a spokesman for acting Manhattan US Attorney Audrey Strauss, didn’t have an immediate comment. Evan Ezray, a spokesman for Guiffre’s lawyers, Sigrid MacCawley and David Boies, didn’t immediately return an email seeking comment.The civil case is Guiffre v. Maxwell, 15-CV-07433, US District Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan); The criminal case is US v. Maxwell, 20-CR-330, US District Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ghislaine-maxwell-seeks-appeal-of-judge-s-order-to-unseal-documents/story-DAeW29NQll91Y3lJoMbCCI.html
30-07-2020||World||Brazil hits record 69,000 daily coronavirus cases as restrictions eased||Brazil set daily records on Wednesday for new Covid-19 cases and related fatalities, as the world’s second-worst outbreak hurtles toward the milestone of 100,000 dead amid easing lockdowns.Brazil is the country worst hit by Covid-19 outside of the United States in both its death toll and case count. The 69,074 new confirmed cases and 1,595 additional deaths reported by the Health Ministry pushed the country past 2.5 million infections and 90,000 killed.President Jair Bolsonaro has fought against restrictions on economic activity, and the disease has advanced as governors and mayors have yielded to the pressure. In some cases, Brazilians have packed into bars and crowded public squares without masks, often in defiance of local rules.Last week, Brazil recorded 7,677 deaths from Covid-19, the most fatalities in any week since the pandemic began, defying repeated predictions that the outbreak had peaked.“Brazil is experiencing the worst phase of the pandemic,” said Alexandre Naime, head of the department of infectious diseases at Sao Paulo State University. “Paradoxically, public policy and personal behavior are going in the opposite direction, as if we are not living through a daily tragedy,” he added.Bolsonaro’s government announced Wednesday that it will lift a ban on foreign travelers flying into the country that has been in place since March, so long as they have health insurance coverage for their trip.Easing restrictions come as new hotspots within Brazil are gaining steam daily.Sao Paulo, Brazil’s most populous and hardest-hit state, has been working through a backlog of previously unregistered cases, reporting more than 26,000 cases on Wednesday alone.While Sao Paulo and neighboring Rio de Janeiro were hit first by the virus, health officials have expressed rising concern over outbreaks in the center-west and far south of the country, where the arrival of winter favors contagion.“We present national data but it’s like we have (multiple) Covid-19 pandemics with different regions of the country behaving differently,” health vigilance secretary Arnaldo Correia de Medeiros said in a televised press briefing.Those conditions have turned Brazil into a global testing ground for drug companies to test potential vaccines.A Brazilian research institute on Wednesday said it had reached an agreement with China’s Sinopharm to start what would be the fourth major trial of a potential vaccine in the country.Bolsonaro himself has flouted social distancing guidelines by joining supporters at rallies around Brasilia, the capital, in recent months.

30-07-2020||World||US Congress ask Bezos if small firms are forced to rely on Amazon||Big Tech executives faced an onslaught of criticism from US lawmakers Wednesday at a high-stakes antitrust hearing which could lay the groundwork for tougher regulation and legal actions against the major internet platforms.CEOs Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google were grilled for more than five hours in the unprecedented joint appearance -- by video -- before a House of Representatives panel investigating market dominance.While the hearing was called to focus on whether the companies have abused their dominant positions in the market, it veered quickly into other topics including political bias, privacy, dealings with China and how platforms deal with misinformation.“Simply put, they have too much power,” said Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island who chairs the panel conducting a year-long investigation into the business practices of the four companies.Cicilline said the hearing made clear that the firms “have monopoly power -- some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable.”Congress has no formal role in antitrust enforcement, but several lawmakers appeared intent on revising US laws to deal with the extraordinary market power and dominance of large technology firms.Pandemic strengthCicilline said the coronavirus outbreak has strengthened the economic clout of the four, saying: “They are likely to emerge (from the pandemic) stronger and more powerful than ever before.”A few comments from lawmakers sought to play down the competitive harms of the companies, which have also won praise for innovating and introducing new technologies and offering lifelines during the virus lockdowns.“Being big is not inherently bad,” said Jim Sensenbrenner, a Republican from Wisconsin. “Quite the opposite, in America you should be rewarded for success.Abusing platforms?Some lawmakers sought to highlight problems with tech companies operating platforms while competing with rivals on those systems.Democrat Pramila Jayapal of Washington state question Pichai on how Google operates its ad platform, claiming that this hurts other online services such as news outlets.Google “is running the marketplace it’s acting on the buy side and it’s acting on the sell side, which is a major conflict of interest,” Jayapal said.Apple’s Cook faced tough questioning over the market power of the company’s App Store and its treatment of developers.“We treat all app developers the same,” Cook said. “We do not retaliate or bully people.”Bezos, in his first appearance before a congressional committee, defended Amazon’s dealings with third-party sellers after a blistering attack from Cicilline.“Isn’t it true that small businesses have no real option but rely on Amazon to connect with customers to make online sales?” the committee chair asked.“We’ve heard from third party sellers again and again during the course of our investigation that Amazon is the only game in town.”Bezos disputed the characterization while adding, “There are a lot of options for small firms.. I think we are the best one.”Playing politicsPresident Donald Trump, who has accused Facebook and Twitter of censoring his remarks and being biased against conservatives, weighed in with a tweet shortly before the hearing began, and some Republican lawmakers echoed those remarks.“If Congress doesn’t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,” Trump said. Representative Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio, said during the hearing: “I’ll just cut to the chase -- Big Tech is out to get conservatives. That’s not a suspicion. That’s not a hunch. That’s a fact.”Democrat Jamie Raskin of Maryland rejected the argument, saying Facebook and other platforms have failed to contain misinformation from Trump and his supporters, including unverified COVID-19 claims.“If Facebook is out there trying to repress conservative speech they’re doing a terrible job,” Raskin said. “I don’t understand this endless whining” from Republicans.Moving forwardSome analysts said the hearing could set the stage for revising US antitrust laws, which at present make it difficult for enforcers to target companies simply for being large or dominant without also showing harm to consumers or abuse of market power.“There was considerable skepticism toward the tech sector as legislators worry about unfair competition and unfair practices,” said Darrell West, director of the center for technology innovation at the Brookings Institution.“If Democrats gain control in the (November elections), this hearing will serve as a blueprint for enhanced regulatory oversight,” West said.Michael Carrier, a Rutgers University professor of antitrust law, said that “the hearing showed that the representatives did their homework” and showed documents hinting at anticompetitive actions.“I don’t think any immediate changes will result from the hearing, but it will provide support for the continuing momentum to challenge these companies,” he said.Avery Gardiner, a former government antitrust lawyer who follows competition for the Center for Democracy & Technology, said the hearing was “an opportunity squandered” which failed to demonstrate specific anticompetitive actions, leaving the matter now to regulatory agencies.“Congressional hearings, which by their nature are broad-ranging, do not lend themselves well to thoughtful analysis about what Big Tech does that could affect competition,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lawmakers-pummel-big-tech-ceos-at-us-antitrust-hearing/story-RtJ6mhNo4laoRP9DfgXkSM.html
30-07-2020||World||US tech giants too powerful, antitrust panel chair warns||Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook are too powerful and will likely emerge from the coronavirus pandemic even stronger, the head of a US congressional antitrust committee said Wednesday at a high-stakes hearing featuring the CEOs of the four US tech giants.“Simply put, they have too much power,” Representative David Cicilline said in his opening remarks at the hearing expected to feature a grilling of the leaders of the technology companies.Also read: Documents show Facebook bought Instagram to quash competitor“Whether it’s through self-preferencing, predatory pricing, or requiring users to buy additional products, the dominant platforms have wielded their power in destructive, harmful ways in order to expand,” the Democrat from Rhode Island said.“Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, these corporations already stood out as titans in our economy,” Cicilline said. “In the wake of Covid-19, however, they are likely to emerge stronger and more powerful than ever before.”Republican Representative Jim Sensenbrenner struck a more moderate tone, saying “being big is not inherently bad.”“Quite the opposite, in America you should be rewarded for success,” Sensenbrenner said.The unprecedented joint appearance -- remotely by video -- before the House Judiciary subcommittee features Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google and its parent firm Alphabet.The hearing is part of a probe into the competitive market landscape and antitrust law, but questioning is likely to veer into other areas such as hate speech and content moderation, economic inequality, privacy and data protection and even claims of political “bias” from President Donald Trump and his allies.Ahead of the hearing, the top executives of the firms sought to offer an upbeat assessment of the tech landscape, highlighting their roots and values and how the companies have benefitted average Americans.“An important way we contribute is by building products that are helpful to American users in moments big and small, whether they are looking for a faster route home, learning how to cook a new dish on YouTube, or growing a small business,” Pichai said in his remarks.Only in America Cook said Apple is “a uniquely American company whose success is only possible in this country,” and that the California giant is “motivated by the mission to put things into the world that enrich people’s lives.”Bezos, in his first appearance before a congressional committee, spoke of his modest upbringing and initial backing from his parents to start Amazon and its early losses of billions of dollars.Also read: Bezos, Zuckerberg and Musk have made $115 billion this year“I walked away from a steady job into a Seattle garage to found my startup, fully understanding that it might not work,” said Bezos, who is the world’s richest person based on his Amazon stake.Zuckerberg called social media colossus Facebook a “proudly American company” and added that “our story would not have been possible without US laws that encourage competition and innovation.”But hours ahead of the hearing, fast-growing video app TikTok accused Facebook of “maligning attacks” that are part of a movement “disguised as patriotism and designed to put an end to our very presence in the US.”TiKTok welcomes “fair competition” chief executive Kevin Mayer said in a blog post, while adding that “without TikTok, American advertisers would again be left with few choices.”Political theater? The hearing is part of a congressional probe into “online platforms and market power” and takes place against a backdrop of antitrust investigations in the United States, Europe and elsewhere.Current US antitrust laws make it difficult for enforcers to target companies simply for being large or dominant without also showing harm to consumers or abuse of market power.The committee, however, could lay a blueprint for antitrust in the digital era that would require a fundamental rewrite of the century-old competition rules.Some analysts say the hearing could offer fresh insights into how Big Tech “platforms” squelch competition by buying rivals or copying products from rivals. Apple’s hefty commissions for its App Store and Amazon’s dealings with third-party sellers are expected to come under scrutiny.Google, which has faced antitrust investigations in Europe, will face questions on whether it favors its own services to the detriment of rivals and Facebook for its dominance of the social media landscape including its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.Robert Atkinson of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank often aligned with the sector, said the political theater may distract from the issue of competition and focus on issues “from privacy to political speech.”“These companies create enormous value for hundreds of millions of users and small businesses,” Atkinson said. “Congress shouldn’t twist antitrust law to launch an ill-defined broadside on internet platforms as a class.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-tech-giants-too-powerful-antitrust-panel-chair-warns/story-RZrbVgjro3iLcg9expQByO.html

30-07-2020||World||Antitrust probe: Documents show Facebook bought Instagram to quash competitor||Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg bought Instagram because he was concerned about the nascent company’s potential to turn users away from Facebook, according to documents obtained by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.That makes it “exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition that antitrust laws were intended to prevent,” US Representative Jerrold Nadler told Zuckerberg at a hearing Wednesday. After Zuckerberg reminded committee members that the Instagram acquisition was allowed to proceed by the Federal Trade Commission, Representative David Cicilline said the FTC’s failure in 2012 has no bearing on whether the acquisition violated the law.Zuckerberg didn’t deny that his company acquired Instagram in part so it wouldn’t compete with Facebook on photo sharing. According to emails with Facebook’s chief financial officer in 2012, Zuckerberg wanted to do the deal to buy time -- a year or more to integrate Instagram’s features so Facebook would be up and running on photo sharing before anyone else could reach the same scale.Instagram, which had 13 employees and no revenue at the time of the Facebook purchase, was already becoming popular at a dramatic clip, surpassing other photo-sharing apps with the size of its network. After six years as part of Facebook, Instagram surpassed 1 billion users. Today, the app contributes more than $20 billion to Facebook’s annual revenue, people familiar with the matter have said. Zuckerberg is still concerned about the potential for Instagram to cannibalize Facebook’s growth, and has restricted its resources and worked to integrate it more tightly with Facebook.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antitrust-probe-documents-show-facebook-bought-instagram-to-quash-competitor/story-pRtJlKjkiTm4lloIPzOMWP.html
30-07-2020||World||With Kamala Harris in his notes, Joe Biden says vice-president pick next week||Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said Tuesday he will announce his vice-president next week. He did not say who it will be, but notes he held during the speech to unveil his economic plan for racial equality, had one name in it: Kamala Harris, the senator from California.Harris’s name was followed by five attributes, as captured by an AP photographer. “Do not hold grudges,” was at the top. It was a reference to an exchange at one of the primary debates when Harris had questioned Biden’s position on busing, a practice used in the 70s to racially desegregate schools. The four other attributed were: “Campaigned with me & Jill”, “Talented”, “Great help to campaign”, and “Great respect for her.”.“I’m going to have a choice in the first week in August and I promise I’ll let you know when I do,” Biden said when asked about his running mate pick.Harris is on a long list of 13 names Biden is understood to have considered seriously in a guessing game he triggered in march when he first announced he will pick a woman.Harris will not be the first woman to run for vice-president if does indeed get the nod — there have been at least two before Geraldine Ferraro and Sarah Palin. But she will be both the first African American (father is from Jamaica) and the first Indian American (mother, who is no more came, from India).Others on the list include Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Duckworth, Congressional Black Caucus chair Karen Bass, Representative Val Demings, Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, former National Security Advisor Susan Rice, Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottom, and Georgia politician Stacey Abrams.Biden spoke about his VP pick in response to questions from reporters after unveiling his racial economic equality plan, the fourth plank of his “Build Back Better” economic plan. It was a repackaged mix of plans and schemes from the whole spread of his presidential platform.Key elements included a Small Business Opportunity Fund of $30 billion from his $300 billion domestic innovation funding.; one-time debt reduction for students; $15 hourly wage; scheme to encourage housing for low-income communities and a legislation to make the Federal Reserve trace and report trends on racial inequality gaps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-kamala-harris-in-his-notes-joe-biden-says-vice-president-pick-next-week/story-PyW2vEZCkAn3wXIVMlk7pK.html
30-07-2020||World||Trump administration to reject new DACA applications||The Trump administration on Tuesday announced it will continue to reject new applications from undocumented immigrants brought as children as it reviews an Obama-era regulation that protects them from deportation. During the review of the programme, Deferred Action on Childhood Arrival (DACA), those already signed up will be granted shortened renewal from 2 year to 1 and all applications for “advance parole”, which allows these immigrants to travel abroad, will be denied barring “exceptional circumstances”.This new arrangement is likely to be challenged in court as it violates a federal court’s order preventing the administration from rejecting new applications and denying advance parole.There are an estimated 644,000 undocumented immigrants protected from deportation under this regulation and they are also called DREAMERs, including at least 2,500 from India.“The administration is now undertaking a comprehensive review of the DACA program and the justifications that have been offered for winding DACA down, including its illegality and the negative effect the program has on what I’d call ‘immigration behavior’,” a senior Trump administration official told reporters.The Trump administration has had this programme in its crosshairs from Year 1, and rescinded it in September 2017, arguing, chiefly, for congress to legislate a resolution, to replace the Obama-era regulations instituted through an executive order. “As the Department continues looking at the policy and considers future action, the fact remains that Congress should act on this matter,” said Chad F. Wolf., acting secretary of the department of homeland security on Tuesday.The Supreme Court in June blocked the administration’s September order saying it had not provided adequate legal justification for rescinding the Obama-era regulation.But the Trump administration argued the court had not upheld the Obama regulation as lawful. “The issue that the Court reached in its decision was only that the administration had insufficiently justified its wind-down of the DACA program,” the official said. “The court agreed that the administration can, in fact, pursue a wind-down of the DACA program.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-to-reject-new-daca-applications/story-LQ24YUqwowoSeOD3PW1wgK.html
30-07-2020||World||Prince, papad, pint: William serves Indian food to guests||Indian food tingling palates and going mainstream in Britain is no longer news, but on Wednesday Britons were served new visuals of Prince William offering ‘poppadoms’, naan, pints and other dishes to his guests in Kensington Palace.‘Going for an Indian’ is a popular weekend practice after imbibing copious amount of pints, more so after a boisterous football match. So it was rather normal that the prince served pints and ‘curry’ to Peter Crouch and others during a recording of the former England football star’s podcast on BBC5Live.They joked about the ‘curry’ being delivered to the palace by an Uber driver who was frisked at the gates, as the food seemed to go down rather well. The prince dwelt on his love for football, mental health and losing patience with his children during lockdown.Prince William, whose title is Duke of Cambridge, is also president of Football Association (FA). Part of the podcast was recorded before the lockdown, but figured prominently in news discourse on Wednesday as sport in Covid-secure conditions begins in the UK.Since becoming a father, William said football has become his “release”, particularly when he needs to “go and be amongst other guys and let out some steam, shout a bit,” joking that he couldn’t abuse the referee since he is the FA president.Amidst blokey banter, William says: “It (football) has become a lot more relevant to me and I need it. Talking about football helps a lot…This period of time has allowed us to all revalue things”. “The thing about lockdown is that it has been a little bit of an awakening that we maybe take our lives a bit for granted sometimes and there’s a lot of things out there that can wobble all of us at any time”.“I think particularly now, as a parent, it starts to make you look a bit more to the future at what kind of world we are going to hand over to the next generation. There’s been a lot of time to think - and you can also have too much time to think, and that’s also what worries me,” he adds.On the challenge of keeping his children entertained during the lockdown, the prince says: “I found it pretty testing, trying to keep the children engaged and interested in some sort of work. It’s been an interesting few months”.“I’ve learned my patience is a lot shorter than I thought it was. That’s probably the biggest eye-opener for me, and my wife has super patience.”An ardent supporter of Aston Villa, William revealed that he is not allowed to operate the twitter account of the ‘Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’, but said he could not hold himself back in May 2019.“They deliberately keep me away from that. When Liverpool won that amazing Champions League semi-final against Barcelona (in May 2019), I grabbed hold of the Twitter thing and just posted”.“It was an amazing match, I was blown away by it. It was one of the best games of football I’ve ever seen. I got completely out of control. I was like: ‘Tweet that! Get it out!’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-papad-pint-williams-serves-indian-food-to-guests/story-X8zPPtBoiAIUfUMJRH5nSO.html

30-07-2020||World||New UK ruling on PNB debt recovery stayed||A judgement of the high court of England and Wales in favour of the Punjab National Bank’s international branch in a $22 million recovery case has been stayed and India-based defendants have applied to appeal against it.The case involves two loans PNB extended between 2012 and 2013 to defendants that include businessman Pradeep Agrawal of Superior Drinks Pvt Ltd. and the non-payment of loans to purchase and operate a cruise liner, MV Delphin.The PNB’s subsidiary in London operates under English law. The defendants accepted they entered into various guarantees but challenged the jurisdiction of the English court to hear the bank’s claim and also raised technicalities about notices served in India.After a recent two-day hearing, conducted remotely due to the coronavirus pandemic, Justice Sara Cockerill rejected the defendants’ arguments put forth by solicitor Karishma Vora, who came in for praise in the judgement.“In conclusion, although Ms Vora for the Applicants has done an excellent job of marshalling and presenting her many and various points, the challenges brought are a collection of issues, all of which lack merit. I therefore dismiss the applications”, the judge said.On the point of whether a certificate of good service from a foreign (in this case Indian) judicial authority can be valid service of English judicial proceedings, Cockerill also found that there is a strong presumption of service and that a claimant need not look beyond the certificate.Paul Gair of law firm TLT that represented PNB, said: “This is a significant victory for PNBIL as it means it can now pursue its enforcement action against the defendants in the English courts”.TLT is currently advising a consortium of 13 Indian banks on a £1.05 billion debt recovery action in the UK against controversial businessman Vijay Mallya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-uk-ruling-on-pnb-may-influence-mallya-debt-recovery-case/story-tFkKkJJHp5ao6op9Pj8RaM.html
