Caught in a vicious cycle of drug addiction and police cases, it seemed he was throwing his promising life away.But the death of his older brother due to drug overdose in 2018 served as an eye-opener. While lighting his pyre, Gurjit pledged to give up drugs.Encouraged by his sister, he went to a drug rehabilitation centre but after coming out, he again got addicted to drugs. But the one-time athlete was not ready to give-up. He started going to the village grounds to take up athletics again. He was soon joined by some other youths and his determination only grew stronger. Gurjit soon started training over 100 youth in athletics.“During my school years, I used to take part in track events. In college, I started participating in national-level games and even won several medals,” Gurjit says, adding that he then started training at the Guru Nanak Stadium in Ludhiana to get into the Indian Army through sports quota.The army dreams were, however, stalled after he got entangled in criminal case. “I was booked under Section 326 (causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons) of the Indian Penal after I took part in a quarrel between two groups. After that, I started mingling with anti-social elements and started drinking alcohol. One day, at a marriage function, I inhaled heroin and got addicted to it. Soon I started taking drugs worth Rs 4000 on a daily basis,” he says.In 2014, he was booked in a drug case and then declared a proclaimed offender. He remained in jail for about a year and a half. 171 ASPIRANTS TRAIN UNDER HIM Having fought his addiction through sports, Gurjit now coaches at least young army and police aspirants in the village. “My aim is to protect the youth of my village from drugs,” says the 31-year-old, who trains around 171 young men and women these days. At least 68 youngsters who trained under him have already got jobs in various security forces, which include 48 in the Indian Army.“It’s a miracle,” says village sarpanch Jaswant Singh. “Gurjit not only won his own battle, he is helping others in their fight too. There were three of four young men in the village who had been addicted to drugs but after training under Gurjit, they too have overcome their addiction.”One of his successful trainees, Mahanbir Singh, 19, of Dall village, says, “It is only due to the great effort of my coach Gurjit Singh that my army dream has been fulfilled.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/31-yr-old-who-won-battle-against-drugs-inspires-youngsters-to-fight-for-country/story-avMe5ZcTwG7H7OF7fpb3iM.html

06-07-2020||Mumbai||We received 48,000 complaints, resolved 95%, says Adani CEO||Over the last month, the Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited (AEML), the largest power distributor in Mumbai, received 48,000 complaints on inflated power bills. Adani officials, however, said that only 2,111 complaints need a re-validation.In a press conference addressed by the group‘s chief executive officer (CEO) on Monday, AEML said that it had anticipated that there will be complaints about the bills and had also intimidated consumers about it when actual meter-reading began on June 1.Kandarp Patel, CEO, AEML said, “We had intimated consumers via messages and email that there will be an increase in billing later owing to the lockdown and suspension of actual meter-reading. In 2019, we had observed a 33% difference in consumption between the winter and summer months. This year, owing to the lockdown, there has been a 50% difference in consumption.” Patel also said that around 11,300 and 35,120 readings were received from customers in April and May respectively Owing to the lockdown, the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) had asked utilities to suspend meter-reading. For March-May, consumers were being billed on an average of the December, January and February months. Many consumers, including Bollywood actors, took to Twitter to complain about being charged excessively.“95% of the complaints have been addressed and there has not been a single bill which was wrong so far,” said Paresh Chaudhry, group president - corporate brand custodian, Adani Group. The company now has a recovery due of almost ₹750 crore. Almost 6.7 lakh consumers have not paid their bills in the last one month, Patel added. He also said that if consumers were billed as per 2019’s consumption in March, April and May, it would have been better, however, power regulations restrict billing, in such case, to calculate as per the presiding three months.As a measure towards removing human intervention from meter reading, the distributor is also looking at installing seven lakh meters in the city by March 2022. Meanwhile, on Monday, AEML also termed remarks of a Bollywood actor against the group on Twitter as “derogatory and irresponsible”. According to AEML, the actor had recently posted an April 2019 bill to complain of high electricity bills and used derogatory remarks. The actor, however, later deleted the tweet.--||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/we-received-48-000-complaints-resolved-95-says-adani-ceo/story-0bUTlFhihvr5OjJ8AcsEZI.html

Work from home directions should be similar for both the departments. The office rooms are small and social distancing norms are harder to practice.”Stating that the union had earlier also requested officials to strictly enforce screening at the entry of the building and ensure social distancing norms, Singh, said, “Even though staff has been stationed at the entry gate for screening of people coming to the building, it is very slack. Both of these are public dealing departments.”Slack screening a matter of concernEmployees at the main UT secretariat building (deluxe), too, criticised the slack screening at entry gates, and crowded office rooms where they said social distancing was not possible.Meanwhile,there was panic at the additional deluxe building as news of more positive cases came in and most of the engineering department staff left early.When contacted, Mukesh Anand, UT chief engineer, said no directions for work from home had been issued to the department staff and offices in the building had not been sealed. “We have asked the office-in-charges to call minimally required personnel. We have also asked them to sit in the deluxe building till sanitisation is undertaken,” said Anand.Concerned over the rising Covid-19 cases in the city, Punjab governor and UT administrator VPS Badnore, on Monday, tweeted, “The increase in Covid positive cases in Chandigarh is worrying; stringent steps are being taken to combat the situation inflow of patients without formal reference to PGIMER (Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research)needs to be monitored.” Also during his s interaction with the deputy commissioners of Panchkula and Mohali in Monday’s war room meeting, Badnore urged the neighbouring states to treat patients without severe illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/as-edu-dept-shuts-down-after-covid-19-cases-other-staff-worried-about-reporting-to-work/story-c8mCc0RQQ4RKCBSiLe6anN.html

However, when they failed to answer, the court called an officer from the Delhi government to reply to its questions.“You people don’t know anything as to how many nursing homes are there, whether the premiums (Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana scheme) are to be filled monthly or yearly and how many nurses are there… This is a very casual approach. This is how you guys are arguing in the court of law,” the court said.The Centre, represented by its standing counsel Anil Soni, told the court that he would seek instruction on the suggestion of extending the benefit of PMGKP of insurance protection to nurses.Later, after brief arguments, the Delhi government’s counsel sought time to file a reply to the suggestions, following which the matter was listed for a hearing on July 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-raps-centre-and-delhi-govt-for-failing-to-clarify-benefits-for-nurses/story-U2pM2NA7onEkjslwjhnXUN.html
06-07-2020||Mumbai||Use of gadgets, summer led to inflated power bills: Experts||An increasing number of citizens and celebrities have complained about ‘inflated bills’ received in June, resulting in a social media outrage post the announcement of unlock 1.0. In some cases, the bills are two-three times more than the average bill of the household. However, utility companies and experts maintain that the bills are higher owing to the suspension of meter-reading in March-end, more usage of electronic gadgets due to the lockdown and hot weather in the summer months of March, April and May.“If you see the average demand in Mumbai during the day, in these months - it was around 1,800 megawatts (MW), which spiked to 2,400 MW between 11pm and 5am, when the air-conditioners were on,” said Ashok Pendse, a noted Mumbai-based power expert and a consumer representative at the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC).As per MERC guidelines, meter-reading was suspended at the end of March and utilities were asked to charge consumers based on the average of the preceding three months - December, January and February, which were winter months. “This effectively means that consumers underpaid in the months of April and May when consumption was high. And in June, when actual meter-reading began, the residual electricity amount was also taken into consideration,” said an official from the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL). During the lockdown period, only 2.32% consumers across the state were billed as per actual reading, data reveals.Last week, MSEDCL also released a video, explaining the multiple reasons behind the high bills. The video shows that when all members of the household are at home, more gadgets are being used. The video shows people utilising chargers, laptops, air-conditioners and mixers, when in the house. “People should also remember that when your consumption is high, you are also charged at a higher slab,” Pendse said further.For instance, if MSEDCL charges ₹4.91/unit for 0-100 units, it increases to ₹8.88/unit for 100-300 units and so forth. A BJP MLA from Mumbai, who has been addressing complaints in his area since a month, said, “In my own house, all gadgets were in use throughout the day during the lockdown. People are not able to accept this fact, and their frustration, also a result of the lockdown, is pouring on social media. Owing to the lockdown and job losses, people’s income and spending capacity have also reduced.”“There is a simple way to check if your bill is right,” says Pendse. “If you have received a bill where your consumption is 1,500 units, go and check your meter. If it is higher than 1,500 units, that means the bill is right, if it is at 1430 units, you can approach the utility to check the meter again. In any case, if your bill is more than double of the average for the period of March-May 2020, utilities are bound to give you an option to make payment in three easy monthly instalments,” Pendse explained.MERC, in a directive issued to utilities, has also stated that utilities cannot disconnect power supply unless the grievances are resolved. --||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/use-of-gadgets-summer-led-to-inflated-power-bills-experts/story-olSEqUeDA3XaczKNizuJML.html

06-07-2020||Noida||FIR to be lodged against doctors, nurses, who quit jobs during Covid-19 pandemic||The Uttar Pradesh government on Monday said that cases will be lodged against doctors and medical staff who decide to quit their jobs during times of the Covid-19 pandemic. Addressing a meeting with senior district officials and head of different Covid-dedicated hospitals at Indira Gandhi Kala Kendra in Noida, additional chief secretary (health and education) Rajnish Dubey said that escapism has never been a part of the medical profession. “How can doctors and paramedics quit their jobs, particularly when there is a public health emergency in the state ? Every responsible fraternity of the society — like police, administrative officials, fire dept staff and above all the doctors — need to step up and put themselves in the battle against the deadly virus. I am surprised as to how some doctors and health workers want to quit and flee this battle, fearing for their own lives,” he said.In context with the recent reports of some health staff and seven doctors, including four anaesthesiologists, quitting their jobs at Sharda hospital last month, Dubey said that the government will first warn them for dereliction of duty. “If they’ll still do not resume their duties, FIRs will be lodged against them and they ca=n even be jailed for violation of rules under the ongoing pandemic Act,” he said.Dubey further said that 10 additional ventilators will be made available to Sharda hospital soon. “With these ventilators, the Covid-19 ward of this hospital will now run with 30 oxygen intensive care units (ICUs) and 30 ventilators,” he said.About a proposal of increasing capacity of beds from 150 to 250 in Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), the additional chief secretary said that the move had already been cleared by the Uttar Pradesh government. “We will soon allocate adequate funds to GIMS for increasing the capacity of beds in its Covid-19 ward,” he said.Meanwhile, when contacted, GIMS director Dr (Brig) Rakesh Gupta said that if the number of beds are increased, he hospital will be able to cater to more Covid-19 patients for their proper treatment.Echoing similar views, spokesperson of Sharda hospital, who said that with enhanced infrastructure, the comfort level of coronavirus patients will increase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/fir-to-be-lodged-against-doctors-nurses-who-quit-jobs-during-covid-19-pandemic/story-gPj5MbsJR0d0PvAt2sYxEN.html
06-07-2020||City||Fire at illegal factory: Police arrest owner of manufacturing unit||The Ghaziabad police on Monday arrested the owner of the illegal factory manufacturing party poppers in Modinagar where eight persons, including seven women and an 18-year-old man, were charred to death in a major fire on Sunday. The police said they are on the lookout for a cracker manufacturer from Farrukhnagar who illegally supplied raw material to the owner.As many as 11 women were also left injured in the fire, including two still in critical condition, in Bakharwa village of Modinagar following which the police registered an FIR under IPC sections 304, 336, 338 besides levying provisions of the Explosives Act and Criminal Law Amendment Act. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey on Monday said that he has also asked the police to initiate proceedings to add charges under the National Security Act (NSA) against the factory owner, identified as Nitin Chaudhary, the prime suspect in the case.The police said Chaudhary, who was arrested from Modinagar itself , had employed over 150 people, mostly women, in his factory. The police said he was engaged in making reels for yarns for over ten years and had started manufacturing party poopers in November, 2019. “Chaudhary had come in contact with one Waseem (single name) who is a fireworks’ manufacturer from Farrukhnagar who supplied him with raw materials. The suspects told us that before Sunday’s incident many small fires were reported from his factory, but all of them were doused on time. He was in house when the incident took place and then fled,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural). The suspect has no criminal record.The police said they are on the lookout for Waseem and are also probing the role of other persons who could be involved in the operation of the illegal factory. A policeman has already been suspended for alleged laxity.Cracker manufacturing in Farrukhnagar had completely stopped in October 2018 after a Supreme Court order imposed a ban on the sale of non-green crackers in the wake of rising pollution levels. “It is probably due to this reason that Waseem had partnered up with Chaudhary and supplied him with raw materials in Bakharwa. Our local police post in-charge had inspected the illegal factory about fortnight ago but failed to take any action, and this is why he was suspended on Sunday,” Jadun added.Chadhaury’s arrest comes on a day when the National Human Rights’ Commission issued a notice to the Uttar Pradesh chief secretary and the director general of police (DGP) calling for a detailed report into Sunday’s incident. The notice gave a four-week deadline for the filling of the report which should include “action taken against the factory owner and the delinquent officers/officials, status of the medical treatment being provided to the injured and relief/rehabilitation provided to the aggrieved by the state.”“It is necessary for the local administration to fix the responsibility of the concerned officer and start departmental/criminal proceedings against them immediately to ensure justice to the victims and their families,” the NHRC said in its notice.The UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday had announced a compensation of ₹4 lakh for the families of the deceased.The police on Monday said five of the deceased were from Bakharwa village, while three, including two minor girls, aged about 16-17 years, were from the nearby locality of Vijay Nagar. “Initially, there was some discrepancy in the identification of victims and some of the villagers had wrongly identified women from Vijay Nagar as residents of Bakhwara. Since minor girls were also employed at the factory, we will also add more sections related to child labour. As many as 11 persons are under treatment and two of them are in critical condition,” SP Jadaun said.On Monday, the families of the eight deceased arrived at the Hindon mortuary where the were bodies were sent for autopsy.“My niece Parul was 17 years old and was a class 8 student. Her school was closed due to the lockdown, so she, along with one other girl and another boy from Vijay Nagar, had started working at the factory. All three of them died in the fire incident. Parul’s father had died 10 years ago, and she has five siblings. She just wanted to help her family financially,” said Manohar Kumar, a relative of one of the victims. “My mother was working in the factory since December, 2019 and was got about ₹4,500 per month. We had often asked her to stop going to the factory but she continued to work there. The factory owner had employed people from dozens of families in Bakharwa for the packaging of the party poopers. About a fortnight ago, a complaint about the factory was also made. The police came to the factory and did nothing,” said Deepak Kumar, son of one of the deceased, 45-year-old Baby (single name).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fire-at-illegal-factory-police-arrest-owner-of-manufacturing-unit/story-AsDtQPNyKnPAinrs6sHjTM.html

06-07-2020||Chandigarh||Fee collection issue: Private schools can’t be allowed to feed on human misery, Chandigarh admn tells HC||The UT administration has told the Punjab and Haryana high court that the private schools’ plea challenging UT’s directions on fee collection proved that they were charitable public trusts only interested in collecting donations and amassing land, and not public service.They can’t be allowed to feed on human misery; education is a noble profession, not a trade,” the administration said in its response to the plea filed by schools that challenged UT’s move to allow them to only charge a tuition fee during the lockdown.The plea was filed by the Independent Schools’ Association of Chandigarh, a body of 80-odd private schools in the city, on June 22 seeking the quashing of the notification issued on June 3 under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, directing the educational institutions to collect only tuition fee from the students till further orders.In the wake of the pandemic, the state ought to frame policies that provide relief to residents, the UT administration stated in front of the court, adding that the June 3 notification was put out to help financially-crippled parents of wards studying in private schools.‘PLEA DOESN’T MENTION SHORTFALL’The UT further stated that the plea did not mention how much fee was collected by the schools earlier and how many parents already deposited the fee. The plea also did not mention the shortfall faced if the schools were to collect fee as per UT’s notification. It was difficult, therefore, to ascertain the hardship, if any, being faced by the schools. Moreover, even CBSE and ICSE bylaws clearly provided that the fee shall be charged only as per the regulation of the appropriate government, the UT told the court.The court was told that of the 78 schools of the association, 41 were already complying with UT’s notification. “Majority of the schools have always propagated themselves to be smart schools, fully equipped with computerised and digital technology. So to say that any school has spent extra on technology is a misrepresentation,” the court was told. Majority of the technology platforms like Whatsapp and Zoom were free and no special training was required to be imparted to teachers as claimed, the UT officials said.Since the issue is pending with the Supreme Court, the UT requested the court to defer plea hearing till the apex court’s ruling. The plea will next be taken up on July 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fee-collection-issue-private-schools-can-t-be-allowed-to-feed-on-human-misery-chandigarh-admn-tells-hc/story-XvNMjJSUqnIKclNYMR1PHM.html
06-07-2020||Chandigarh||Teaching and non-teaching staff of UT colleges can work from home till July 31||Teaching and non-teaching staff of government and aided colleges in Chandigarh have been allowed to work from home till July 31. An order regarding this was released by the UT higher education department on Monday.There has been a growing concern among teachers after the higher education department last month had directed the government and aided colleges to ask 50% of their teaching and non-teaching staff to report to work.The order issued by the higher education department of Chandigarh reads, “The guidelines issued by the ministry of human resource development (MHRD) are hereby circulated for compliance by the faculty members, teachers, researchers, non-teaching staff working in government and government-aided colleges and institutions and they are permitted and advised to work from home till July 31.”The UT education department had planned to review the orders after the MHRD permitted teachers to work from home.Inderpal Singh Sidhu, an assistant professor at Sri Guru Gobind Singh College, Sector 26, said, “We have been demanding the provision to work from home since June 30 when the MHRD had notified the same. Nonetheless, we welcome the step taken by the UT higher education department.”However, college principals were told to ensure that the online admission process and other related activities are carried on smoothly and for that, they were allowed to call the required staff at their own level.Conducting elections during pandemic Meanwhile, teachers at Goswami Ganesh Dutta Sanatan Dharma (GGDSD) College, Sector 32 have submitted a complaint to the president of Punjab and Chandigarh College Teachers Union (PCCTU), after the College Teacher Union elections were held on Monday.“This is completely against the instructions issued by competent authorities which suggest avoiding any sort of gathering or holding any such meetings which involve a large number of individuals. Despite the teachers demanding to withhold the election in view of safety of the staff, the elections were conducted on the campus today and also scheduled for tomorrow,” the teachers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/teaching-and-non-teaching-staff-of-ut-colleges-can-work-from-home-till-july-31/story-AwvcbC3QTGr8i2ZZJHs6fJ.html

However, financial crisis has been cited as the reason in the notice by the outsourcing company. The higher authorities would be observing their work for a month now before the MC takes its final decision.Out of 43, 37 employees work in the B&R department, while the others are engaged work the light branch and horticulture wing. Most of them were appointed in 2016. The contracts of employees working in the operations and maintenance cell have been renewed.An official requesting anonymity said, “The notices have been served amid the row over inferior quality roads being constructed by contractors, with MC officials failing to keep a check on the same.”Stating that most of the work is done by them, the JEs and SDOs rued that the MC should not terminate their services at this time of health and economic crisis.“The MC is already facing staff crunch, so how will it carry out the development projects without proper staff. Most of the field work is done by JEs and SDOs as the executive and superintending engineers remain involved in office work. The MC should reconsider the decision as it would also result in unemployment,” a contractual JE said.Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “These employees are under observation by the MC.

06-07-2020||City||MCD teachers get training in inclusive education||New Delhi: The North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Monday started an online ‘Inclusive Education Training Programme’ for its 7,500 school teachers to enable them to focus on children with special abilities. According to civic officials, teachers were trained how to sensitively handle and teach students with disabilities and how a healthy environment can be created for them in the class. Teachers have been divided into 16 batches of around 450 participants each for the programme.Civic officials said teachers at municipal schools generally are unable to harness capabilities of a student with any kind of disability because they cannot provide a conducive environment in the classroom.Ira Singhal, deputy commissioner North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said it was for the first time municipal school teachers were being imparted training on inclusive education.“Since teachers are not very familiar that what exactly is a disability and what limitations or abilities a disabled student has, they tend to mix physical disability with mental one and so they are unable to guide and treat that child well in a classroom environment. They generally think if a child is physically disabled, he would be mentally weak too and hence they fail to understand the child’s mental abilities. In such a scenario, the social inclusion of any student with a disability is hard. The training workshop is to overcome all these challenges and provide a conducive environment for inclusive education at municipal schools,” she said.There are around 714 primary schools run by the north corporation where nearly 287,000 children get basic education. Mostly children from lower-income groups study at municipal schools across the city.Singhal said the exercise, which will continue for the entire month, is being conducted online in the form of a webinar with the help of an NGO Vision Divyang and Rehab Council of India’s (RCI) Delhi chapter. Monday was the first day of the training session in which 600 teachers participated. The session continued for over six hours. Mukesh Gupta, one of the trainers, said it is the system’s responsibility to create an environment where every individual is able to contribute to society as much as his capabilities are. “Disabled children do not get that opportunity. In the training, teachers were told about the special needs of a child with a disability. Teachers enthusiastically took part in the exercise and asked nearly 4,187 questions related to various types of disabilities in children and ways to harness their capabilities through inclusive education,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mcd-teachers-get-training-in-inclusive-education/story-qzk16jQ0Pg2x63pWEvk8IM.html

It asked the University Grants Commission (UGC) to give its committee’s report on conducting exams in universities across the country.The court was hearing a plea filed by six students through the Vera Cause Legal, a law firm, seeking to call off the open book exams. They said students are facing several problems in taking the online exams.On Monday, advocate Shivankar Sharma, counsel for five students of DU—one from Faridabad, two from Delhi and one each from Rajasthan and Nagaland —told the court that several students would have to go to the nearest community centres to write the exams and risk their lives in a situation when Covid-19 cases are rising every day.The Delhi University has suggested students to use common service centres in their localities to write online exams in case they do not have the internet facility at home.. Sharma said students live in remote areas where there might not be electricity and internet connections.He contended there were glitches during the mock tests conducted on Saturday when students had to download and upload question papers and answer sheets of different subjects . Students faced trouble logging in, and downloading and uploading PDFs. The website too crashed many times, students had alleged on Saturday, a claim the university had denied.He said several students complained that the community centres were not aware of the mock examinations.Appearing for Delhi University (DU), senior advocate Sachin Datta and advocate J S Rupal, told the court that DU is the only varsity in the country attempting the online exams. They said officers are taking huge risks to conduct the examinations, and that those who cannot take the exams now later appear in September.The court then said, “You cannot make the students guinea pigs. Think about their mental status also. Suppose there are children whose family members are unwell; they need to be in the correct state of mind. This is complete callousness where the decision has been taken without any basis”.The judge said that by conducting the exams, the university is putting their careers in jeopardy because by the time the results are declared by the end of August, many foreign universities and other higher educational institutions would already have started their academic session. It said because of the postponement of the exams, earlier scheduled to start from July 1, the interest of the students had been “jeopardised”. Despite several attempts, DU Dean examination Vinay Gupta and Vice Chancellor Yogesh Tyagi did not respond to calls and texts sent for a comment. A member of the examination team, requesting anonymity, said, “The University will produce relevant information in the court on Tuesday. We can’t comment further since the matter is sub-judice.”The UGC counsel told the court that its notification is not binding and advisory in nature. The UGC notification in April suggested the universities several modes of conducting exams amid the Covid-19 pandemic, which includes the open book exams. He said many universities have decided to not conduct the exams.The judge said there can’t be any delay in UGC’s recommendations on the conduct of exams for final-year students in universities across the country. UGC is coming up with a fresh notification on exams for final-year graduation and postgraduate students. The court asked DU to give state-wise data of final-year students, a detailed examination schedule, including declaration of results and distribution of answer sheets.The matter would be now heard on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/don-t-treat-students-as-guinea-pigs-delhi-hc-to-du-on-open-book-exams/story-W80fLMltqEbDqJXfMudHoK.html

06-07-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai receives 60% of its average July rainfall in first six days of the month||The city has received 60% of its average rainfall for July in the first six days of the month this year. The Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded 508mm rain between July 1 and July 6 (8.30 pm) against the monthly average of 840.7mm. South Mumbai recorded 406.3 mm during the same time.Last year, Mumbai had covered 62% of its July average rain in the first five days and 84% in the first eight days after two extremely heavy rain spells. However, rain intensity reduced thereafter and the city reached its monthly target by July 21.In 72 hours till Monday evening, Mumbai had received 478.6mm rain, leading to around 27% excess rain for the season, so far, for the suburbs and 26% excess for south Mumbai. However, on Monday, the suburbs and south Mumbai recorded a considerable drop in rain intensity against a yellow alert (heavy rain across isolated areas) issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Between 8.30am and 8.30pm, the Santacruz weather station recorded 6mm rain and the Coloba weather observatory recorded 5mm rain. High speed winds, though, were recorded throughout the day. According to IMD, the wind speed ranged between 45kmph and 55kmph.“As witnessed on Monday, a significant reduction in rain activity is expected over the west coast over the next few days as weather systems have shifted towards the Gujarat region where intense rain spells are being witnessed,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD. “However, heavy to very heavy rain at isolated areas across Palghar district is expected to continue.”Hosalikar said the three weather systems that led to intense rain over the weekend were still active. “This will allow Mumbai, Thane and Raigad to receive moderate showers over the next two to three days,” he said. Independent meteorologists said strong wind gusts could persist on Tuesday and Wednesday owing to weather systems in the Arabian Sea. “Winds are a result of the well-marked low pressure system in the Arabian Sea close to Gujarat.

Though the move was opposed in court, the first mayor was elected in June 2013 after a Supreme Court decision.In December 2017, a panel led by Ambala divisional commissioner Vivek Joshi recommended bifurcation of the corporation. According to the panel report, both Kalka and Pinjore have separate administrative and police structure. It is not fair for people of those areas to depend upon the corporation that has its head office miles away in Panchkula, the report stated.The report suggested that both Kalka and Pinjore could have a council as the population of both the towns along with villages was 1.28 lakh. The council status requires a population above 1 lakh.Similarly, the Panchkula corporation could sustain on its own since it had projected population of 3.31 lakh along with villages in its catchment, sufficient to have the corporation status.The report was sent to the local bodies department, and then to the state cabinet, which decided in its favour during a meeting in Panchkula on Monday.Gian Chand Gupta, local MLA and speaker of the legislative assembly, said: “It’s a welcome decision. I was consistently highlighting this issue for the last two years. The Panchkula MC was overburdened with the additional work of Kalka and Pinjore. It slowed down the city’s development works.”Former mayor Upinder Kaur Ahluwalia said: “The council might face funding issues, but as long as the officers are honest and hardworking, work will continue.”AREAS INCLUDEDThe Panchkula municipal corporation will include 21 villages, namely Chowki, Nada, Saketri, Beed Ghahhar, Ramgarh, Billa, Nangal, Jaswant Garh, Kot, Khangesra, Nanngal, Moginand, Bhanu, Beed Babupur, Jaloli , Sukhdarshanpur, Toka, Dabkori, Chandi Mandir, Mankya, Alipur and Khatoli, besides the erstwhile municipal council of PanchkulaThe 22 villages of Pinjore, namely Bhagwanpur, Bitna, Dhamala, Islam Nagar, Lohgarh, Surajpur, Manakpur Devilal, Manankpur Nanak Chand, Manakpur Thakar Dass, Rajjipur, Mohabaatpur, Milk, Gumthala, Bhogpur, Damdama, Bisawal, Kheda, Majri Jatta, Rampur Siyudi, Vasudevpuri, Meerpr, Bakshiwala and Raipur, and 11 villages of Kalka, namely Bhairo Ke sair, Kanguwala, Kheda Sitaram, T Dangra, Hansua, Tangra Hakimpur, Tangra Hari Singh, Tangra Kali Ram, Tangra kangan, Tangra Sahu, Tipra and Majra Mehtab, along with the two towns will form a separate municipal council||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-cabinet-okays-bifurcation-of-panchkula-mc-kalka-pinjore-to-have-separate-council/story-THgbPEQUL9OzQJzBNypNGO.html

Similarly, we have sent a list of cycle components being imported from China to the government which can be placed under the restricted category. This will increase focus on manufacture of indigenous goods, reducing reliance on China. However, it’s a long road ahead,” he said.United Cycle Parts Manufacturers Association president DS Chawla said Indian imports 7 lakh cycles from China annually, including components for high-end cycles worth hundreds of crores. “Cycle traders are contemplating cancelling deals and orders with China and are exploring alternatives,” he said.Earlier, Hero Cycles chairman Pankaj Munjal had stated that they were localising manufacture of cycle parts and components in a phased manner. The company has cancelled a ₹900-crore deal with China which it was to execute in the next three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cycle-traders-propose-restriction-on-parts-imported-from-china/story-IUzGpNhoTX2dVzRTK1qREP.html

During monsoon, major road cave-in incidents are reported in the city and the authorities blame underlying wires by cable companies for the same. However, no steps have been taken to keep a check on the working of these companies or conduct a survey of the water-sewer lines. On Sunday, a road cave-in incident took place at Kaka marriage palace and the authorities claimed that the water supply lines got damaged due to underground laying of wires and cave-in occurred after soil eroded due to leakage. However, the authorities said that the repair work will be completed within two days. Major cave-in incident has been reported on the same road for the second consecutive year.One of the officials requesting anonymity said, “No field staff is present on-site when the companies dig the roads for laying wires. The sewer and water lines installed in many parts of the city are decades old and there is no map available. The authorities do not even have an idea about the damage made to the lines by cable companies until the soil erodes due to leakage in the line and road cave-ins.”Last year, road cave-in incidents were reported in different parts of the city including Dugri, Ghumar Mandi, Fountain chowk, Chandigarh road among other areas and the civic body officials blamed underground laying of wires for the same. MC additional commissioner Rishipal Singh said, “Till now the officials were not following the procedure. I have directed the staff to get the area inspected and apprise the cable company officials about the water-sewer lines before they commence the work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-check-on-laying-of-underground-cables-leading-to-road-cave-ins-in-ludhiana/story-GJGYsvleoYdVc0s7qdIXnI.html

06-07-2020||Mumbai||Time for a fresh start!||It is true that the on-going pandemic has affected almost every business venture in the world. And therefore, with the clouds of uncertainty looming over heads of businessmen, there is nothing else for them to do but try and get back on track.For instance, holiday properties like villas and estates are a result of massive investments that require a steady return. With everyone staying home, the owners are staring into a bleak future. “The opening of our homes is going to be a combination of people, process and technology. When I say people, it means getting your people completely aware and sensitised to the fact that we are in very different times,” says Devendra Parulekar, Founder, SaffronStays.It is the same for the owners of luxurious sets. “Before the nationwide lockdown we accepted 4 bookings a day, but adapting to the new normal we have restricted that to one shoot a day,” says Rajesh Dembla, Founder, Sets In The City, adding, “We have seen a 90% decline in our bookings but are hopeful that it will get better by August.”Sorting out financial leeway is another important step towards recovery. “We controlled our fixed costs, for instance, lease rentals. We spoke to the homeowners and as a first measure, all of them agreed to waive off the lease rentals for the period and also at the same time, expenses were brought down to bare minimum. That ensured that the cash position wouldn’t be impacted,” adds Parulekar.The maintenance, too, requires huge manpower and regular checks and necessary precautions are important for their safety. “We have arranged for accommodation for our team at the premises so they do not travel and interact with other people. We are taking all the precautions as per government guidelines,” adds Dembala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/time-for-a-fresh-start/story-3DpLy6B9dHA5tL4FoXBwsO.html

The Central government in February had allocated ₹1,426 crore to PGIMER in its Union budget, ₹724 crore less than what it had sought.PGIMER was also not likely to generate estimated revenues of ₹150 crore for this financial year because of partial closure of medical services.“There is no clear cut thought on when everything will be back on track and therefore around ₹85 crore has been sought to meet expenditure – the source of which was the internal revenue,” said Kumar Abhay, the institute’s financial adviser.Much to disappointment of PGIMER authorities, just ₹300 crore was allocated out of the ₹700 crore they had sought as grant-in-aid. Factoring this, the institute sought an additional ₹300 crore in supplementary grants.New projects likely to be hitProcurement of medical diagnostic equipment and new projects are likely to be hit if the additional grants don’t come through. Among its major projects, PGIMER is setting up a 430-bed, high-end mother and child care centre, a 300-bed neurosciences centre and a 300-bed hospital at its satellite centre in Sangrur. The institute has also sought an additional ₹100 crore under the salary component.“Though the amount granted initially is enough for salaries, but as more people are expected to join the institute, the need for more money may arise. So, this amount has been demanded to be on the safe side,” Abhay said. No special funding sought for Covid-19 No special funding for Covid-19 care has been sought by PGIMER, which is utilising available funds for the purpose. “However, if some costly item is to be purchased, people who can replenish the stock are encouraged to do so,” officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-seeks-485-crore-from-centre-under-supplementary-budget-grant/story-yVDjl7qSY2NUpTBotsxkyH.html

Click here for full Covid-19 coverageTaking cognisance of the matter, Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia, who is also handling the health portfolio, directed all Covid hospitals of the city to make authorised helpline numbers. “All these hospitals have come out with 24*7 available authorised helpline numbers and the numbers are available in the Delhi Corona app which was developed and launched by the Delhi government to provide Covid-19 pandemic related information,” the statement said. Any person who wants to reach out to these hospitals with Covid-19 related query can now dial these numbers directly from the application, it said. When a person clicks on the name of a hospital where beds are available, its phone number along with its location on a map, will pop up in the mobile app. The AAP government had launched the ‘Delhi Corona’ application last month to provide real-time information on the availability of beds for the treatment of coronavirus in hospitals across the city. Days after launching the application, the government had ordered the medical facilities to ensure real-time updating on the app. The application also helps Delhiites locate nearby healthcare facilities dealing with coronavirus patients.The hospitals have also been colour-coded red, yellow and green depending on the availability of beds, with ‘red’ denoting hospitals with very few beds available and ‘green’ denoting those with an adequate number of beds, the statement said. Till July 6, Delhi has around 14,986 beds, out of which, 5,169 beds are occupied and 9,817 beds are vacant, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/helpline-numbers-of-covid-hospitals-available-in-delhi-corona-app-says-kejriwal/story-AsDTDDTmRc5RtF37jGapvJ.html

06-07-2020||Chandigarh||Alleged kingpin of match-fixing racket held in Mohali||The alleged kingpin of a betting racket, Ravinder Dandiwal, was arrested on Monday by Mohali police for suspected links to an international tennis match-fixing scandal and for hosting a fake Uva Sri Lankan T20 league games in Sawara village in this district from June 29 to July 5.Two bookies were held three days ago for the cricket betting racket.The trio, including Dandiwal, was produced in a local court that sent them to a five-day police remand.Divulging details, Mohali senior superintendent of police Kuldeep Singh Chahal said Dandiwal, who was on the radar of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), was facing charges of hosting a cricket match of the Uva T20 league on June 29 that was aired in Sri Lanka through YouTube. BCCI unit arriving todayHe said the anti-corruption unit of the BCCI would be arriving in the city on Tuesday to share details and interrogate Dandiwal.A report in the Indian Express had said earlier that Dandiwal was named as a suspect in a tennis fixing racket by the Victoria Police in Australia. Chahal said the cricket match, comprising small-time players largely from Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, was played at a cricket academy in Sawara village located about 15 km from Chandigarh. The players were wearing face masks, presumably for Covid-19 protection, and numbered jerseys.It was being streamed live as a Uva T20 League match in Sri Lanka’s Badulla city, home of the Uva Province Cricket Association.Village cricket ground bookedChahal said after the arrests of bookies Rajesh Garg and Pankaj Arora, the police learnt that the grounds of Stoker Cricket Academy in Swara village had been booked from June 29 to July 5, 2020, for ₹33,000.Four teams had been formed for the cricket series named Uva-T 20-Premier League. Though held in Punjab it was shown as being held in Sri Lanka and relayed on various social media apps such as FanCode, Diamond, Sky, Lotus, 10bet, Spin, Punjab Exchange, for earning money through betting. Chahal said Dandiwal’s role in the racket was being investigated.Those hired to play the match were small-time players who were offered ₹5,000 to ₹10,000. The role of some Ranji players in hosting the match is also being investigated,said a senior police officer.He said the players who looked like Sri Lankans were selected.Two cameras at the venue focused on the back of the players to conceal their faces and were typically taking long shots.“When the match was airing, suddenly a camera captured some farmers working in a rice field. That raised suspicions that the match is not being played in a stadium,” said the police official, who was part of the investigation.Cases against Dandiwal and the two other bookies have been registered under section 420, 120-B IPC, 13A/3/67 of the Punjab Gambling Act at Police Station Sadar in Kharar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/alleged-kingpin-of-match-fixing-racket-held-in-mohali/story-aNX2QSGHBqRDdrtugPgktO.html
06-07-2020||Chandigarh||HT Spotlight: Covid warriors put duty before self||MARCHING ON Policemen and health workers are the frontline warriors in our fight against Covid-19. With India expected to hit the coronavirus peak this month, Hindustan Times reporters take a look at how the health and police departments in J&K, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh are fighting the invisible enemy amid a surge in cases and challenges, including increased risk, longer hours at work, and colleagues in quarantine. Some of our warriors have made the supreme sacrifice in the line of duty, while many have recovered and are back Covid duty.43 doctors, over 200 security men test positive in Kashmir Forty-three doctors in Kashmir have tested positive for Covid-19 while treating coronavirus patients in hospitals across the Union territory.Director, health services, Kashmir, Dr Samir Matto says, “Almost all of them are doing fine.”Dr Javeed Iqbal Monga, who is working at Government Medical College, Baramulla, was the first doctor from Kashmir Valley to have contracted the infection. His wife also tested positive and they were hospitalised at Srinagar’s Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS) for three weeks before they tested negative.“I was the first doctor from Kashmir to get Covid-19. I got the virus while performing intubation of a patient at Baramulla Medical College. I was scared initially because my condition was getting from bad to worse, but after a week of treatment, I started recovering,” he says.“After the hospital stay, I completed home quarantine and got back to treating patients. Today, I can easily recognise patients with Covid symptoms as I have gone through this disease,” Dr Monga says.He is ready to donate his plasma for therapy and save lives. “In J&K, plasma therapy has not started yet. But once it does, I will surely donate my plasma,” he adds.Family members of Dr Gul Afroz Khuroo recently posted a message on social media, seeking prayers and blessings after the condition of the doctor deteriorated. She had got the disease at a hospital in Sopore and is fighting for life.Security personnel have also borne the brunt of coronavirus while performing their duties.More than 200 security personnel, including policemen, Central Reserve Paramilitary Force personnel and soldiers, have tested positive in the past four months in different parts of Kashmir. -Mir EhsanPart of the job, 12 Jammu doctors get back to duty With a testing rate of 25,000 per million and a doubling rate of 22 days, the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir has fortunately not seen a single death of a doctor or security personnel in its four-month drive against coronavirus.“We haven’t lost any health worker or policeman to Covid though we have positive cases among them but the figure keeps changing,” says Bhupinder Kumar, the nodal officer of Covid-19 mitigation efforts in J&K.“Twelve doctors engaged in treating Covid cases tested positive in four months. Most of them have recovered and the rest are on the road to recovery. It’s part of the profession,” says a senior doctor at Government Medical College And Hospital in Jammu.Kathua district police chief Shailendra Kumar Mishra admits that six personnel of the central armed police force are undergoing treatment at a police training school in Kathua, which has been converted into a quarantine centre. “But we don’t have a single positive case in the police force of Kathua.”On countering challenges, he says, “From the outset, we didn’t consider it a dreaded infection. It’s a weak virus. Kathua has recorded only one death of an elderly woman from Basohli so far.”Mishra credits community involvement and sustained awareness campaigns for fewer cases.“Initially, we had to be strict but it paid off. Today, we are comfortable in tackling the virus compared to other states and UTs,” he says. - Ravi Krishnan KhajuriaSeven police personnel, two doctors catch infection in HP Seven police personnel and two doctors have tested positive for coronavirus since the pandemic began four months ago. Fortunately, there has been no casualty among Covid warriors.The first instance of a policeman getting infected was reported in Kangra district on May 12 when a 50-year-old head constable posted at Panchrukhi police station tested positive. He has since recovered but the source of infection remains untraced.In Una, a constable at the superintendent of police’s office tested positive after which the entire premises was sealed and staff quarantined.Two head constables and a constable at Bhabha Nagar police station in the tribal district of Kinnaur tested positive on June 26. Again, the source of infection remains untraced.Two doctors have tested positive for Covid-19 in Himachal so far. One of them was deployed in the Covid ward of the Dr Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College (RPGMC), Tanda, Kangra. The other was a lady doctor on duty at a quarantine centre near Palampur town.Both of them have recovered and are back on duty.KEEPING MORALE UP AMID INCREASED WORKLOADShiv Kumar Sharma, additional superintendent of police (ASP), Solan, admits policing has become challenging in such times. “The biggest challenge is that cops on frontline duty should not let the morale dip. Everyone knows the dangers; they have families and limitations. Precautions are of utmost importance,” he says.The work of police has also increased manifold due to the pandemic. Apart from law and order and border management, police are engaged for contact tracing and supply of essentials.Doctors too are struggling with increased workload. Dr Satyavrat Vaidya, the district surveillance officer in Kullu, says, “I haven’t taken an off in the past three months and haven’t even been able to meet my father who not keeping well.”Doctors are working in shifts stretching from 12-18 hours a day as against the eight hours on normal days.- Naresh K ThakurAggressive testing helps Punjab Police, most cases asymptomatic Punjab’s policemen and health workers on Covid duty are leading from the front in the fight against coronavirus.From catching people violating protocol to ensuring strict lockdown, Punjab Police is on their toes yet so far only 0.8% of the 29,456 cops tested have been found positive. Tests of rest of the force is underway.It’s compulsory for all police personnel to get themselves tested for Covid and so far, 37% of the total force has undergone the RT-PCR test.A total of 241 cops have been found positive, while 168 have recovered till date. Barring two deaths due to Covid-19, all police personnel were asymptomatic.“From catching people jumping quarantine to ensuring law and order, even routine duties make police personnel vulnerable to the virus. We are doing RT-PCR tests for all and thankfully, a very less number has turned out to be positive,” says Punjab Police chief Dinkar Gupta.With 13 positive cases, Sangrur has the maximum number of positive police personnel followed by Ludhiana City at 10.According to a senior official, most of personnel have recovered and rejoined duty.ADGP, welfare, V Neerja has been given the task of overseeing RT-PCR tests of the police force.“I didn’t have any symptom but felt stiffness in the body one night. I went for a routine check and was stunned to learn about my positive status. I was shifted to a government isolation facility in Ludhiana, where I was kept for eight days. I’m perfectly fine now,” says assistant sub inspector Harmesh Singh from Ludhiana, who was posted at Ladhowal Toll Plaza. The ASI resumes duty this week. FEW HEALTH WORKERS TESTED POSITIVEDr Rajesh Bhaskar, Punjab’s nodal officer for fighting Covid-19, says, “We don’t have the exact data of health workers testing positive since the outbreak. It’s only recently that we added the column for data of health workers and cops testing positive.”Director, health and family welfare, Dr Avneet Kaur says, “Let me assure you this number is very low.”In Government Medical College, Patiala, 22 health workers were found positive, including 10 nurses, 10 ward boys and a junior doctor. At least 20 ASHA workers also tested positive, a senior health functionary said, requesting anonymity. Ravinder VasudevaStrict oversight helps cut down cases among health workers in Chandigarh  Twenty-two healthcare professionals and a policewoman contracted Covid-19 infection since the first case was reported in Chandigarh on March 18. Most of them are back on duty at the city’s two tertiary care hospitals – Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research and Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32.Work at the Sector 32 hospital was hit at one stage when 12 health workers tested positive out of 20 such cases in town.In Mohali, two doctors and a policeman were infected, out of which a doctor is in quarantine, while in Panchkula, 11 health professionals and policemen contracted the virus and 10 are in isolation.A 28-year-old resident doctor of the anesthesia department of GMCH-32 says that testing positive and getting isolated from the family was a tough experience. “I felt low initially and even thought it was the end of my career. But I persisted and recovered to join back work,” she says.After infection was reported among healthcare workers, the city’s hospitals extended the sphere of providing safety gear to non-Covid wards and areas. “Safety of healthcare professionals is a must and we didn’t want to take any chances. Protective gear is being provided in emergency wards, which are the first point of contact between doctors and patients,” says PGI director Dr Jagat Ram.“There is no room for complacency, so whenever, a healthcare worker dons the PPE, experts supervise it. There is a doffing area and the same activity takes place there. This has helped control the infection spread among healthcare workers,” spokesperson Dr Ashok Kumar said.In Panckula, 11 health professionals and policemen have tested positive so far. The doctors who tested positive are working with a private hospital and so is a nurse. They are all posted in a non-Covid ICU but had treated a chronic kidney patient who tested positive in June.A family of four that works in the Civil Hospital of Panchkula also tested positive. The husband , 47, works in the post-mortem department, while the wife cooks at doctors’ residences inside the campus. Their two sons work as class four employees on contract. The woman had travelled to Rajpura to attend a funeral after which she tested positive.In Mohali, a 35-year-old doctor of a private hospital in Sector 69 tested positive on March 31, while on June 7, a policeman at the judicial complex was found positive. Both have resumed duty after treatment. On July 2, a doctor from Sohana Hospital tested positive and is under quarantine.Civil surgeon Dr Manjeet Singh sums it up well: “Times are difficult and if we won’t work in solidarity, we can never defeat this virus.” - Hillary Victor748 health workers, nearly 800 officials, cops infected in Haryana Deployed on Covid duty in hospitals, containment zones, quarantine centres and testing labs, health workers and police personnel are vulnerable to catching the virus.According to the state health department, 12% of the infected persons in the state are doctors, paramedics, police and government officials deputed to save lives of infected persons.By June 28, the state had 748 infected health workers, which is 5.41% of the 13,829 patients. As many as 779 (5.6%) state police personnel, army and government officials have tested positive in Haryana so far.“There is no need to worry as most of the infected health staff workers have recovered and resumed duty,” says Haryana health services director Dr Suraj Bhan Kamboj.Dr Anjali, an ENT specialist at the Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College and Hospital, Karnal, who tested positive on April 6, recalls, “It was shocking for me as I was worried about my two-year-old daughter and husband. But my family and colleagues supported me and I recovered to join duty after 26 days.”POLICING RISKY DESPITE PRECAUTIONSThe state reported the first Covid 19 death involving a police personnel on April 4 as a sub-inspector died of coronavirus at the Maharaja Agrasen Hospital in Delhi. On June1, a sub-inspector of Haryana Police posted in Gurugram also succumbed to the virus.Barring the two cases, police personnel have defeated the virus and resumed duty after quarantine.Lata Rani, an assistant sub-inspector in Panipat, got infected along with her two brothers and parents on April 24. It took her 25 days to recover. “Being public servants, police personnel have to deal with people from different backgrounds daily. That’s why I don’t know the source of my infection,” she says.Haryana director general of police Manoj Yadava says, “The number of infected cops is low as compared to other states. Policing is risky in these times despite all precautionary measures. We issued a detailed protocol and training was also suspended to avoid the spread of infection.”Similarly, Bharti Arora, inspector general of police, Karnal range, says district police heads have been asked to monitor and provide all facilities if personnel test positive.

06-07-2020||Lucknow||No pension causes heartburns among ex-UP cricketers||In the nine Ranji Trophy matches Hari Daas Bhandari played over four years in the 60s, the Kanpur player earned R5 per match, totalling R45. But more than the money, the “biggest earning” for him was “pride and satisfaction of playing for his state”.A right-handed batsman and stumper, Bhandari began with a catch and a stumping, besides making two runs in his only innings against Madhya Pradesh at Banaras (now Varanasi). Still, he continued to be backed by his skipper AK Chaturvedi and when he quit in 1960-61, he had 11 catches and eight stumpings to his credit besides scoring 96 runs with 37 being his highest in 14 innings.“Money was not the issue, it was pride and passion and I enjoyed my four seasons with the UP team with full enthusiasm and excitement,” said Bhandari. “The passion for the game was such then as I used to travel to Lucknow to play Sheesh Mahal Cricket Tournament and for that I used to get trouser, shirt and even shoes from my team-mates.”Now retired as an executive director from Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL), Bhandari has been a strong voice for the pension to the former cricketers. Now 83, the former junior state selector Bhandari wants that contribution of all 120-odd former cricketers of the state should be recognized by the Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association in the form of monthly pension.“A token amount of R5,000-10,000 as pension to veterans won’t make a big difference to the coffers of the UPCA as they have been getting huge money from the BCCI. They (UPCA) should also copy other state cricket bodies, who have been giving pension to their former cricketers, including those who could play just one match,” said Bhandari.Only this January in the very second meeting of the Apex Council at Ferozabad, the UPCA had agreed to a pension scheme and Indian Cricketers Association’s representatives in the state --- Ashok Bambi (men’s cricket) and Iti Chaturvedi (women’s cricket) --- were assigned the jobs of finalising the list of genuine beneficiaries.“Yes, we are waiting for a response from the UPCA and I have been assured to get the things done soon,” Bambi said on Friday. “Have already submitted the list of the beneficiaries to the UPCA and even my suggestions in this regard, but now they are silent over the issue. Even a few among the listed beneficiaries have passed away during the last five months. Financial aid to veteran cricketers in this pandemic COVID19 would be a big help.”He, however, said that even he told UPCA to give R10,000-20,000 to all such beneficiaries in advance, and the money should be deducted from their accounts when the pension scheme is approved. “If UPCA can R50 lakh to the government’s relief fund it can also give financial help to its veteran heroes. It’s not going to be R1.10 crore a year to run this scheme properly.”In 2009, UPCA had distributed R50,000 each to veteran cricketers in its maiden endeavor before handing over a similar amount to those beneficiaries as the second installment after a few years, but it never bothered to introduce any pension scheme. “In many states, cricket bodies are giving even pension to their domestic players, who are getting pensions from the BCCI, but here in UP we are struggling for a routine system.”Women’s cricket representative in UP Chaturvedi said that process to complete the membership with the ICA was on. “Due to the lockdown over the last three months, the scrutiny has been delayed a bit but so far we have identified 37 genuine cricketers, who come under the pension scheme. We are expecting pension for them soon,” said Chaturvedi.She also said that but so far as many as three cricketers, including Shikha Chatterjee (Kanpur), Kashmira Jain (Lucknow) and Farzana Begum (Kanpur) have been given one-time benefit by the ICA.Former Ranji cricketer and selector Neeru Kapoor was furious over the delay in pension to the veteran cricketers of UP. “I don’t understand the reason behind this delay. “Many of us have been facing financial hardships in this crisis situation and this is the right time when UPCA should given financial support to its former cricketers,” said Kapoor.No one from the UPCA, including secretary Yudhveer Singh could come on record to say on the issue, but insiders confirm that process is on and soon things would be finalised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/no-pension-causes-heartburns-among-ex-up-cricketers/story-peqvyhZkflCVZoB0jYfHtM.html
06-07-2020||Lucknow||Goat milk was like ‘elixir’ for village kids during lockdown||The goat has received the least attention among milch animals in the country and is supposed to be an asset of the very poor. Yet its milk helped scores of undernourished kids in Uttar Pradesh during the lockdown.Four-and-a-half-year old Jeetu’s father Ajay Kumar, a daily wage labourer in Bada Tal Maiti village, Barabanki, said: “Jeetu never had milk -- cow’s or buffalo’s. When he drank the goat milk offered to him for the first time, he relished it and looked forward to it every day. He used to pick up his glass and troop out to the free goat milk distribution spot during the first 35 days of intense Covid-19 lockdown.”“His health showed visible improvement and his weight increased. He did not miss even a day.”The Goat Trust, a voluntary organisation engaged in promotion and support of goat rearing -- especially in Bundelkhand and Lucknow region of the state -– faced disruption in its commercial milk supply during the lockdown. So it chose free distribution and on-the-spot goat milk-drinking campaign for 138 under-nourished children in Bada Tal (Barabanki) and Newada, Dhawa Takia and Achchhripurwa villages of Lucknow.“We checked their undernourishment parameters before and after the 35-day campaign. A total of 129 children showed marked positive growth. There was an average of 500-gram weight gain among the 129 and 10 of these children gained an average of 1.32 kg. Nine did not show any noticeable change. In all the villages, not even one child missed his daily dose of a glass of goat milk,” said Sanjeev Kumar, founder of the Goat Trust.He said: “While the government made arrangements for food security to people, we thought to provide some nutrition to these children during the lockdown.”Sanjeev Kumar, a social entrepreneur and an Ashok fellow (2013) had founded the Goat Trust in 2013 to promote systematic goat rearing as a means of livelihood and nutrition in rural areas of the state. Last year, the trust set up a milk pasteurisation plant near Kukrail forest area in Lucknow and began buying milk from its member goat-rearers. An alumnus of the National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, Sanjeev Kumar said: “Most of the people buy our goat milk as medicine. The goat milk has many health benefits and is also healthier than cow/buffalo milk. Maximum of our consumers are elderly with digestive, heart, or diabetes issues and goat milk is beneficial in all these diseases. But it is not as tasty as the other kinds of milk.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/goat-milk-was-like-elixir-for-village-kids-during-lockdown/story-dCbdSfOYbDXRtIKga86qBJ.html

06-07-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 vs COPAL-19: Meet Delhi’s engineering students who powered plasma donor app with AIIMS doc||Though there is no breakthrough in developing a vaccine for Covid-19 yet, the youngsters of the country are leaving no stone unturned to back India’s brave fight against the pandemic. Meet engineering students Tushar Chaudhary, Kaashika Prajaapat, and Tanay Aggarwal, who have collaborated with Dr Abhinav Singh Verma from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi. Together they have successfully developed the COPAL-19 app, which will help build a plasma donor bank to speed up recovery of Covid-19 patients. Prajaapat, a fourth year Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) Delhi, says, “I had been creating a Medical Facility Tracker that could help people locate things like the nearest hospital for treatment against Covid-19, the number of beds available in that hospital etc. I was working on this with my friend Tanay, a student of Maharaja Surajmal Institute Of Technology (affiliated to Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University). When we launched the tracker, a lot of people came to us to discuss about what other problems can be solved though mobile apps. And one of the issues we found pertinent was the lack of routing between plasma donors and Covid-19 patients. We started work to create a prototype. And Tushar, who is my senior at IIT-D, connected us with Dr Abhinav Singh Verma from AIIMS, who was also aiming at solving the same problem. That’s how we all collaborated and took this initiative further.” “There have been a lot of cases where people have died because of the unavailability of plasma, and we wanted to do something about it,” says Chaudhary, adding, “The app helps to connect those patients who need plasma therapy with the potential donors, well in time for the treatment to begin. We coordinated with Dr Verma and developed the app digitally! So, this was majorly a remote project. Phone calls and video conferencing is what helped us remain in touch as we developed the app during these odd times.” In absence of a Covid-19 vaccine, the age old plasma therapy is proving useful to reduce the viral load, making COPAL-19 app a crucial software. The Resident Neurosurgeon at AIIMS Delhi informs that the idea for one such app was propelled by the need to find a plasma donor for his senior. Dr Verma adds, “We wanted matching plasma for one of our senior doctors who had turned Covid-19 positive. And it took a group of 50 doctors almost one full day to arrange it! Still they managed to find only two donors. At that point, I realised what a crisis it is and thought of how can it be solved with a simple solution to make a smart database of plasma donors.” Calling COPAL-19 app the need of the hour, Chaudhary adds, “If a doctor had to face so much trouble to get plasma donors, wonder what common people would have been facing... That’s how the idea for COPAL-19 was born.” Thus the engineering students acted quickly and moved from the ideation stage to the execution within a matter of few days. “It took a week from ideation to prototyping. We worked day and night to get the permissions and to have a working prototype launched. It will now be made available pan India, on the playstore, within a week or two,” says Prajaapat, sharing that the team is also in touch with Karnataka government to further spread the word about the app. Talking about the response so far, Prajaapat adds, “Though it’s not yet a published app since we are seeking certain permissions, people have already registered themselves as donors and have voluntarily come forward to save people who are infected and in need of plasma.”Interact with the author @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-vs-copal-19-meet-delhi-s-engineering-students-who-powered-plasma-donor-app-with-aiims-doc/story-zs9Yo1VCRFnYOi6t4qZN1N.html

They said the movement will be intensified if no relief is provided within a week.The SNS has alleged that the state government has not provided any financial relief to the people who have been badly affected due to the pandemic.SNS secretary Kapil Sharma said at least 70% people in the state have fully or partially lost their employment and have not received any financial support through the PM Cares Fund and the CM Relief Fund. He said in the current situation, people were hoping for some financial relief from the state government but instead have been handed over inflated bills.Sharma said the bills that should have be given every month are now given after a period of four months. “Less time has been granted to deposit these bills. Bills of garbage collection and property tax are also inflated which has increased the financial burden on people,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shimla-nagrik-sabha-stages-protest-over-inflated-bills/story-N4ivhN7OuExI2rMrnPYW6J.html
06-07-2020||Chandigarh||Recite ‘mani mantra’ at least 1,000 times: Dalai Lama on 85th birthday||Prayers marked the Dalai Lama’s 85th birthday, which was celebrated in Dharamshala, the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile, on Monday. In his message to the Buddhist community from his home in McLeodganj, the Tibetan spiritual leader asked people to recite the “om mani padme hum” mantra at least a thousand times. With this practice, you will create some roots of virtue that you can dedicate to me — Avalakiteshvara’s messenger — to live for 110 or 108 years or so, the Dalai Lama said.The mantra ‘om mani padme hum’, encapsulates Buddhist teachings and indicates that we can all transform ourselves to be more like Buddha. The spiritual leader said, “We Tibetans have a unique connection with the Avalokiteshvara (a bodhisattva who embodies the compassion of all Buddhas),” he said. “As I often say, Avalokiteshvara is my boss and I am his messenger. So if you wish to celebrate my birthday, remember Avalokiteshvara and recall that he is the one on whom I, Gyalwa Rinpoche, rely, and in whom I seek refuge. In terms of pure vision, Avalokiteshvara is someone who I have been connected with over successive lifetimes.”He said, “ On my birthday, either visualise me, Gyalwa Rinpoche as inseparable from Avalokiteshvara or visualise Avalokiteshvara as the principal deity and me as a monk sitting in front of him.”This year, the celebrations remained a low-key affair due to restrictions imposed by the government in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.Prayers marked the occasion at the community’s main temple in McLeodganj.The Tibetan spiritual leader too said it was not possible to hold a large celebration due to the pandemic.“And it’s not necessary either,” he said, asking his followers to recite the mantra if they wished to celebrate the occasion.DALAI LAMA MOST REVERED LEADER OF TIBET: KASHAGKashag (Tibetan cabinet) and the Tibetan people, those inside Tibet and those in exile also wished the 14th Dalai Lama on his birthday and issued a statement in say that the Dalai Lama was the most revered leader of Tibet, the world’s leading spokesman for peace, an epitome of Buddha’s wisdom and unconditional compassion.“The Dalai Lama often describes himself as an ‘ordinary monk.’ For Tibetans, His Holiness is the glorious sun. He is a rare and unequaled leader who has been shouldering a nation and its people from the time he was sixteen years old. His Holiness is the peerless teacher who has been guiding Tibetans through every hardship, both personal and national,” the Kashag said. GLOBAL LEADERS WISH THE DALAI LAMA The Dalai Lama’s office in Dharamshala said the spiritual leader received birthday greetings through the internet or social media from across the world, including former US president George Bush.“Laura (former first lady) and I send our very best wishes on your 85th birthday. I admire you, I care for you and I love you,” Bush said. Indian Union minister Kiren Rijiju too wished him on his birthday. BJP leader Ram Madhav wishing the Tibetan spiritual leader said he is ‘a great guru and master for mankind’.Governor Bandaru Dattatreya and chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur also extended warm greetings to the Dalai Lama on his birthday. Arya, spokesperson of the Tibetan government-in-exile, said grand celebrations were planned for celebrating the spiritual leader’s birthday but due to the coronavirus pandemic, the celebrations had to be downsized.“TIBETAN PARLIAMENT IN-EXILE CRITICISES CHINA FOR GALWAN CONFLICT Karma Yeshi, finance minister of Tibetan government-in-exile, wished the leader a “happy birthday and a very long life” and said that China must use the message of Dalai Lama as a tool to resolve the Tibet border issue.“I think His Holiness is the key on the issue of Tibet so China must use his voice and wisdom to resolve the issue,” he said.The statement said the People’s Liberation Army of the communist-ruled China continued to make “attempts to encroach into India from all across its border areas”. “And recently, a dispute in Galwan Valley in Ladakh led to a clash between the troops from the two sides with the result that 20 Indian soldiers died and several others were injured. The Tibetan parliament-in-exile wishes to express our condolences to India for the tragedy which resulted from that unfortunate incident,” the statement said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/recite-mani-mantra-at-least-1-000-times-dalai-lama-on-85th-birthday/story-aeuktLGFCKulTMofABooGM.html

Besides, Mulshi, rural police also acted against revellers vising local tourist destinations. According to Pune rural police, a total of 187 persons were booked in the district on Sunday while 80 persons were fined for not wearing masks.On Sunday, the police station officials collected a fine of Rs 18,000 from mask violators in these places, according to inspector Ashok Dhumal of Paud police station.“This has been happening every weekend since June. Every weekend there are close to 50-60 cases. We must have registered at least 200 cases in June alone. Most of these people are from Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad areas,” said Dhumal.While 45 cases were registered on Saturday, over 50-60 cases were registered on Sunday as well, according to Dhumal.The cases have been registered under Section 188 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Rs 500 fine is levied upon people who fail to wear masks. “The gram panchayat officials collect that fine. We must have collected over Rs 1 lakh in fine in June,” said Dhumal.The Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram has continued the prohibition of assembly and movement to tourist places in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.

06-07-2020||Pune||Pune needs to avoid mistakes Mumbai made to get through Covid-19||Pune, the second largest city in Maharashtra has always matched every trend in Mumbai, be it business, fashion, culture, and also, the incidence of infectious diseases.In 2009, Pune became the epicentre of the swine flu outbreak and it also reported the first case in Maharashtra on March 9, 2020, in the Covid-19 pandemic. At present, there are 21,520 cases in Pune. The population of Pune is estimated to be 6.5 million while Mumbai’s population is exactly its double at 13 million. The total number of cases in Mumbai is 84,524 which is the highest not only in Maharashtra, but nationally too. If compared statistically, Pune city has 25 per cent cases as against Mumbai. However, the case fatality rate in Mumbai is 5.85% and that of Pune is 3.32% as of July 3.All these figures show that though Pune claims the better numbers, it is closely following Mumbai. The civic administration of Pune has not yet realised the blunders committed in Mumbai and have been blindly following the trail. Mumbai mistakesTesting criteria: In Mumbai, testing rate at the ground level is low. Citizens who want to be tested are discouraged and sent back by government and municipal doctors, which is happening in Pune too. This has led to a delay in diagnosis and worsening of the patient’s condition, resulting in more serious patients and deaths.· Patients referred by private practitioners to the BMC hospitals for Covid-19 tests are seldom tested. On the contrary, private doctors in Mumbai have been served legal notices for referring such patients. Many of them, turn out to be positive when tested at a private laboratory. Similar incidents are being noted in Pune as well.· The reports of the patients undergoing RT-PCR tests are given neither to the patient nor to the referring doctor. It is in the possession of the medical officer of BMC. This procedure of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has caused a delay in admission and treatment of patients. In Pune too, a similar pattern has been observed.· Private laboratories in Pune often deny testing those referred by private practitioners and they have also been instructed to send reports to the referring doctors and PMC and not to the patients.· Contact tracing is very poor in Pune. Positive patients do not even submit names of their contacts and apart from family members, only a few others are traced. This trend proved to be detrimental in Mumbai.· Testing of senior citizens and those having co-morbid conditions and living in containment zones has not been prioritised either in Mumbai or Pune. The case fatality rate of this group is around 80% as such people easily fall prey to the disease. The case fatality rate pattern in Mumbai and Pune clearly indicate it. Hospital facilities: Sassoon General Hospital, being the only government hospital with ICU facilities in Pune, is always full even in the pre-Covid period. PMC has failed to construct a new general hospital with tertiary care facilities and trained doctors and staff. Sassoon’s demand for modern equipment has been ignored till now. The assurance of having a 500-bedded infectious diseases hospital after the H1N1 outbreak in 2009 was never fulfilled. Doctors on duty: The number of doctors in the public sector hospitals are insufficient and hence, many posts are vacant. Newspapers, doctors’ associations and social workers have been demanding appointment of doctors, but the government and PMC always turned a deaf ear to their demands. Now, new applications are being invited.Treatment meted out to private doctors- Private practicing doctors were given notices to attend duties in Covid-19 wards. In Mumbai, Pune and across the state, private doctors or their associations like the IMA, were never consulted. Doctors have been threatened with legal consequences under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, Disaster Management Act, 2005 and MESMA.To compensate the lack of hospital beds, the government acquired 80% beds of private hospitals and capped rates of various services. Government of Maharashtra alleged that private hospitals in Mumbai were overcharging and sending the patients away. The government has failed to resolve the problems of doctors. The same pattern is being followed in Pune. Scarcity of facilities: Pune’s situation is becoming grim with every passing day. Private doctors do not know where to send their patient and patients have to visits numerous hospitals. The scenario is very similar to the tragic situation in Mumbai. IMA’s demand for developing an app for ambulances and bed availability has not been answered till now.Eight of every ten patients prefer private doctors to government hospitals. So, the government should stop ignoring them and must take some advice from private doctors. The residents of Pune are always satirised about their afternoon siesta even while doing business. It is time for the administration to wake up from their slumber and look for better solutions.(Dr Avinash Bhondwe is the president of the IMA, Maharashtra state and is the UNESCO Chair For BIOETHICS)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-needs-to-avoid-mistakes-mumbai-made-to-get-through-covid-19/story-sGYIt2yMrg6Ns3diWRH1cJ.html

In order to do so, the caller asked the complainant to send an SMS to 1234.“He had not realised that the SIM stopped working until 2-3 days after. That is when he came to the police,” said Auti.The complainant works in a private company, according to the police. The caller offered to upgrade the services from 3G to 4G.“We have had 10 complaints in the past two months alone. We have written to the cellular company saying such frauds have been happening,” said Auti.A case under Sections 419 (personation) and 420 (cheating) of Indian Penal Code along with Sections 66(c) and 66(d) of Information Technology Act is registered at cyber police station of Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/57-year-old-duped-of-rs-11-lakh-in-sim-swap-case-in-pune/story-l9pU04sCPbJ7w2hDrVsMxH.html
06-07-2020||Pune||State govt wants PMC to improve contact tracing||With Pune crossing the 20,000-mark of Covid cases – half of them coming in just 18 days – the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to focus more on its contact tracing and ramp up its health infrastructure to avoid a situation that Mumbai is witnessing.On Saturday, Pune reported 819 Covid-19 positive cases, taking its overall tally to 20,668 while the overall death toll to 703. According to state surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate, Pune’s contact tracing is lower to the state average and needs to improve. The PMC data suggests that the source of infection among 21.35 per cent cases is unknown.“Pune could do better on contact tracing which is the only way to break the chain of Covid-19 transmission. While the state’s average of contact tracing is about 21 per positive cases Pune’s is much lower. Every person who came in contact with a positive person two days before the onset of the symptoms must be tested as per ICMR guidelines. There should be no fixed number of contact tracing but every person who might have come in contact with the patient must be screened thoroughly. While in June we collected over 14,000 samples daily, as of Saturday we collected close to 26,000 samples in one day. It is obvious that as the movement of people raises the number of positives will increase but aggressive contact tracing will ensure early detection and to contain the spread further. This is what Pune should also do to ensure that the chain breaks,” said Awate.The PMC officials have also accepted that its current contact tracing is around 8-9 persons per positive case though it needs to improve.Shekhar Gaikwad, PMC commissioner said, “Yes it is true that our contact tracing is close to 8-9 contacts per positive person. However, we are only following the ICMR guidelines which state testing only symptomatic patients and asymptomatic on every 5th day which means there is a lapse of 5 days. We are also trying to increase our testing capacity, now that we have the rapid antigen detecting kits so at least 1,000 samples will be tested through these kits by next week which will increase the number of positives but also ensure better contact tracing. We are putting in more beds at the Covid care centres but the logistics like mattresses, pillows and beds are a huge issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/state-govt-wants-pmc-to-improve-contact-tracing/story-ZcvDglyRhTw36lHjMMZQIL.html

Not these public toilets... anymore||The public toilets operated by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), have once again started displaying a lack of hygiene, regularly now running out of water. This comes days after the PMC, during lockdowns 1.0 and 2.0, June 4 and June 15, had started cleaning public toilets four times a day to prevent the spread of Covid.Pune has 1,240 toilets, of which 57 toilets are currently in containment zones, PMC officials said in Sunday, requesting anonymity. Dnyaneshwar Molak, deputy commissioner, head of the solid waste management department of the PMC said, insists that the public toilets are still cleaned five times a day. “We clean the public toilets five times a day and appeal to citizens to exercise discipline and follow hygiene rules while using the facilities. There are instances where the users dump cigarette butts, spit tobacco and don’t flush after use, which is very unhealthy. Also, jetting machines are used for deep cleaning to ensure that the necessary hygiene is maintained,” he said.During its visit, the central team, headed by IAS officer Kunal Kumar, had asked PMC to clean public toilets and mobile toilets in slums. Residents of Vishrantwadi, Viman nagar, Kalyani nagar, Wanowrie, Undri, Mohammadwadi, Bund Garden, Boat Club, Kashewadi, Bhavani peth, Sahakarnagar, Swargate, Koregaon Park and other suburbs have complained about public toilets not being cleaned. A spot visit by HT confirmed the same in at least five of these areas.Akhilesh Salve, a resident of Boat Club road said, “The public toilets are not cleaned regularly and PMC has to take the blame. In the wake of the Covid crisis, PMC must carry out regular cleaning and sanitisation of the toilet blocks to avoid the spread of infections,” he said.Manohar Patil, a resident of NIBM road said, “The public toilets in Kondhwa are and stinking. The PMC has stopped the special cleaning of the toilets.”The public toilet outside the ST bus depot in Swargate is so bad, people rather use the road outside to ease themselves. Cantonment residents have complained about public toilets in Bhimpura, Pul Gate, Modikhana and Ghorpadi. President of Vithalrao Vandekar Foundation Dhairyashil Vandekar and Koregaon Park Mohalla Committee member said, “The way we see at toilets have to be changed and we have to move into a new phase. Dirty and stinky public toilets are unacceptable.”Vandekar Foundation has proposed all PMC urinals be manned with the personnel to ensure proper upkeep, cleanliness and to ensure social distancing is maintained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/cleaned-5-times-a-day-not-these-public-toilets-anymore/story-N2F4hXxM0jNYnCsSMF7LfI.html
06-07-2020||Pune||Residents defy janata curfew appeal in PCMC||Despite the local administration’s appeal to not venture out on Sunday, which was to be observed as a “janata curfew” day in Pimpri-Chinchwad, large crowds were seen at shops across the city.Pimpri-Chinchwad mayor Usha Dhore and the Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal corporation (PCMC) municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar appealed for a curfew twice a week – on Sundays and Thursdays.The appeal came as the industrial town has been witnessing a rise in Covid-19 cases. As on Sunday, PCMC reported 4,288 cases and 61 deaths.However, despite the appeal, people followed a regular Sunday routine as most of the shops were open and heavy traffic was on display in most areas in PCMC.People followed their routine in the morning, many claiming that they were not aware of the curfew appeal made by the PCMC civic body.“I have not heard anything about the janata curfew. Like a daily routine, I will close my shop at 5pm. I don’t think anyone is aware as I can see all the shops are open at Dange chowk,” said the owner of Raj vada pav centre in Thergaon.In other areas, like Kalewadi phata, normal traffic was seen while at the Pimpri market all shops were open but customers were scattered. The shops at Pimple Saudagar and Chinchwad had a mixed response to the curfew; some were closed.“Since the message was circulated by 9pm yesterday, many people are still not aware of the appeal. Once people are aware of it they will support the call of the mayor and commissioner,” Anna Bodade, assistant municipal commissioner, PCMC said.In the last 15 days, the civic body authorities have noticed people not following social distancing norms and despite fine not wearing masks.Although the civic body is not in favour of a complete lockdown, they are seeking support from residents so that the transmission of the virus can be stopped.“Twice a week is a good idea, I hope on this Thursday, we will see more people voluntarily observing the curfew,” Bodade said.Mask for Safe PCMC movement:Pimpri -Chinchwad Municipal Corporation has started selfie with mask to support the wearing of masks. PCMC aims for safe movement within its jurisdiction. The selfies can be sent to @pcmcindiagovin.The PCMC has appealed to people to stay home, maintain social distance and fight Covid-19 together.

AIIMS will be the fourth medical institution in Punjab to have the facility. Director professor DK Singh on Monday said that rapid antibody polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests will begin within 10 days as the central health authorities have given the proposal a go-ahead.After assuming office as the first director of the institute last week, Singh said adjoining districts in Punjab and Haryana may also be linked with AIIMS for coronavirus testing.Since the RT-PCR kits are not available in the market, testing equipment will be supplied to AIIMS by the central agencies.“In view of the rising number of Covid -19 cases, it is important to add more institutes for aggressive testing,” Singh said. 10-15 BED AD HOC ICU “A 10-15 bed ad hoc ICU will also be be made operational at AIIMS for emergency medical assistance to patients till they are moved to dedicated Covid-19 care facilities. A ventilator-equipped vehicle will also be pressed in to service for safe transportation of Covid patients,” he added.The director said that due to the pandemic construction work on the campus had been delayed indefinitely.“As most workers have left for their native states, the construction firm engaged by the central agencies has expressed its inability to commit to a deadline,” he said.

06-07-2020||Mumbai||Massacre of cops in Kanpur exposes ‘encounter specialist’ UP govt: Shiv Sena||The Shiv Sena on Monday targeted chief minister Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government over the killings of eight police personnel by henchmen of notorious gangster Vikas Dubey last week and warned that he should not become ‘Dawood (Ibrahim) of Nepal’ for India.An editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana said that the killings of the police personnel during a raid has exposed the “encounter specialist” UP government and asked what has changed since Yogi Adityanath became the UP chief minister in March 2017.Eight police personnel, including a deputy superintendent of police, were gunned down last week at a village near Kanpur by the henchmen of Dubey. An accomplice of Dubey has been arrested, while the gangster is still at large.Also read: 3 more Kanpur cops suspected of ‘leaking raid info’ to Vikas Dubey suspendedThe Saamana editorial said that Dubey is said to have fled to neighbouring Nepal. Pointing to the porous border and current relations with Nepal, the editorial said, “India’s border with Nepal has always been a concern in such cases. At the moment, our relations with Nepal are also not good. In this perspective, Vikas Dubey shouldn’t prove to be ‘Dawood of Nepal’ for us tomorrow.”The editorial stated that Uttar Pradesh is often referred to as ‘Uttam Pradesh’, but it now stands “soaked in the blood of policemen” leaving the “country in a state of shock”. How did Dubey’s name not feature in the list of UP government which is otherwise known for finishing off gangsters in ‘encounters’, the editorial asked in a series of questions to Adityanath’s government. During the three-year tenure of Adityanath, more than 113 gangsters were gunned down, while Dubey had built an unauthorised bungalow that came to the government’s notice only after the gangster orchestrated the killings of policemen, which is “unfortunate,” the editorial said.Also read | Vikas Dubey, UP’s most wanted man, may have fled UP before borders were sealed: Cops“It has been more than three years since the Yogi government came to power in Uttar Pradesh. During this period, the police had ‘encounters’ of more than 113 goons, but how did the name Vikas Dubey get dropped in it? He has over 60 serious crimes, including murder and robbery. But how did he survive due to lack of evidence? How did the police become witnesses on his behalf? Is the list of encounters being prepared according to the convenience of Uttar Pradesh police and government? If someone makes such an allegation, what does the Yogi government have to say on this?” questioned the editorial.It added that the incident revived the memories of the killing of 11 policemen in UP’s Kathuapur by a dacoit named Chaviram four decades ago. “Even after 40 years, if gangsters can kill policemen in this manner than what has changed in Yogi Maharaj’s Uttar Pradesh… There are several questions that Yogi government will have to answer because ‘Uttam Pradesh’ is now soaked in the blood of policemen,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/uttam-pradesh-now-soaked-in-blood-of-policemen-shiv-sena-targets-yogi-s-govt-in-saamana/story-WxW8EI84IQstB1n0itDl6J.html

It enlists the properties amassed by people who used politics for gaining property on its 24th foundation of the party (RJD). Rashtriya Jaalsaaj Party the name given to RJD on the poster too is quite apt. The 24 years (of RJD) is a dark chapter in the history of politics. Their leader (Lalu Prasad Yadav) is not only behind the bars in corruption cases, but the party is also a living, breathing example of corruption,” Kumar said.Meanwhile, the RJD celebrated its foundation day in the absence of Lalu Prasad Yadav, who is in jail in Ranchi on a number of cases related to the fodder scam.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on Sunday said that his father and senior party leader, Lalu Prasad Yadav, is very important in the phase the country is going through.Tejashwi along with elder brother Tej Pratap Yadav and other leaders undertook a cycle rally along with supporters as a mark of protest against the hike in fuel prices.“Laluji is very important in the phase the country is going through currently. Laluji especially should be in the Parliament today, everybody is missing his presence,” Tejashwi said.He went on to add: “In the last 15 years we were not even in power, still we apologised and asked for forgiveness. Only those who have a spine can bend, the others crawl. We have never compromised with the ideology, had we done so then I would have been the chief minister today.”The Assembly elections in Bihar likely to be held later this year will decide the fate of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led NDA government. Lalu Yadav’s RJD will fight the elections with its main ally Congress in the contest for 243 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/poster-attacking-tejashwi-yadav-springs-up-in-patna-terms-rjd-rashtriya-jaalsaaj-dal/story-IZ6ZBNNdbzbqgAxiaYAGAJ.html
06-07-2020||Patna||Will fight Bihar polls as united force: Minister dismisses ‘rumours’ of rift in NDA||Union minister Nityanand Rai on Sunday asserted that there was no rift within the NDA in Bihar and charged the RJD-Congress combine with spreading rumours regarding it. The former Bihar BJP chief made the remarks, while addressing party workers in Purnea district through video conference, in an oblique reference to speculations which have followed notes of discord emanating from LJP chief Chirag Paswan in the recent past. “The NDA, under the leadership of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, will fight as a united force in the assembly polls. It will repeat the stupendous success of 2010 when the coalition had grabbed more than 80 per cent of assembly seats,” Rai said. “The RJD-Congress will do better to stop spreading rumours about NDA and worry about fissures in their own camp,” said the Minister of State for Home. Founded by Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, the LJP had severed its links with the Congress-led UPA and walked over to the NDA ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. Paswan handed over the party mantle to his son Chirag last year and the young leader has been critical of the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar over its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and the migrant crisis resulting therefrom. Chirag Paswan, who also represents the Jamui Lok Sabha constituency in Bihar, had raised many eyebrows recently with his cryptic remark “we are supporting the government in the state but are not a part of it”. The LJP chief was, understandably, venting his frustration at his party having no representation in the state government after his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras, a member of the cabinet, got elected to the Lok Sabha in 2019. Reports have claimed that Paswan has been unhappy over Nitish Kumar, who heads the JD(U), expressing unwillingness to part with a respectable number of seats in assembly polls for the LJP, which had contested six out of 40 in Bihar in Lok Sabha. Last week, a district unit chief of LJP in Bihar was also removed from the post for giving a statement before the media that the NDA was “atoot” (unbreakable) in Bihar. Although it was said that the lower-rank party leader had violated the diktat that only Chirag Paswan was authorised to make remarks with regard to alliance, the action fuelled fresh speculations about the LJP’s disaffection with the NDA. At a video-conference meeting held by Rahul Gandhi with Congress leaders from Bihar, Rajya Sabha member Akhilesh Prasad Singh is understood to have conveyed the message that the rift in the NDA be cashed in on and attempts be made to woo the LJP. Congress MLC and AICC media in-charge Prem Chandra Mishra held out an olive branch to the LJP on Saturday when he came out with a video message, reminding Ram Vilas Paswan of his association with the UPA and saying that he would be welcome in the Grand Alliance. The Grand Alliance, a five-party coalition which comprises, besides RJD and Congress, HAM, RLSP and VIP, however itself seems to be in disarray.

On reaching Bikru village, the police team left their vehicles on the road and walked about 100 metres, said Singh at the hospital where he is being treated. They eventually found a heavy earthmoving machine blocking the road. The team, he said, somehow reached close to Dubey’s house.“Dubey’s men were fully prepared. Each of them had weapons. They were using semi-automatic weapons. Suddenly, firing began from all the directions. We looked for safe places. But the majority of our men went down in the first hail of bullets,” he said.The remaining policemen fired back, he said, adding the criminals could see them but policemen could not.“Two of my constables Ajay Sengar and Ajay Kashyap were injured. My priority at that time was to save them and take them to safer ground as others had fallen,” he said. Singh was injured when he was taking the constables away. He said he came to know later when he saw visuals of the attack on social media that the firing was going on from three sides and that at the place where Circle Officer, Bilhaur, was hiding, firing was done from right above him. -- here is the reporter version“All the workers of the local police station are under our scope of investigation on how Vikas Dubey got information about police movement.

06-07-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi govt yet to restart doorstep delivery of services||Shikhar Arora (18), a resident of Krishna Nagar, east Delhi, on Thursday returned disappointed from the subdivisional magistrate’s office as he couldn’t get an income certificate of his family, which he needs urgently to apply to the Delhi University. Arora, who is seeking admission to a BA Pass course, said he won’t be able to apply under the economically weaker section (EWS) category without the income certificate to show that he is eligible. “I have been going to the office for nearly a month, but have not been able to get the certificate. They have now asked me to apply online,” he said.Issuance of income certificate is one of the 70 services provided by the Delhi government under its ambitious doorstep delivery of services project, which was launched in September 2018. It was suspended this March in view of the nationwide lockdown to control the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).While the government has further relaxed restrictions from July 1, under the Unlock 2.0 plan, the Delhi government is yet to restart the doorstep service delivery project. Under the project, 70 services from 10 different departments, including those of social welfare, transport, and food and supplies,among others, were being provided to citizens at their doorstep.Arora said, “Had the service been operational, it would have saved me from unnecessary trips to the SDM’s office.” He is one of the many people queuing up outside the district revenue offices for certificates needed to apply to colleges/jobs.An official at the East Delhi district office said, “Currently, only the registry of property is being done manually. For all other certificates, citizen have to apply online.”The office is also in the process of setting up help desks to help applicants fill up online forms, he said.Ananya Mandal (18) is seeking admission to BA (Hons) in Economics at DU and she had visited the SDM’s office in Mehrauli to get an OBC (other backward class) certificate, a mandatory document to apply under the OBC quota.“I was told that we will have to apply online since the staff at the SDM’s office are currently busy with Covid-19 duty. I tried to fill the form online but that the portal was not working properly. Still, I managed to apply for the certificate online and submitted the acknowledgement slip along with my admission form. But I don’t know by when I would get the certificate itself,” she said.A senior official at SDM Mehrauli said, “We are accepting applications online. We are trying to clear all EWS and income certificate related applications at the earliest as these are required by students.”The government, however, has no immediate plan to restart the service. A senior official with the administrative reforms department, on condition of anonymity, said, “The service was suspended due to Covid-19. Currently, there are a lot of Covid-19 cases being reported from the national capital. There is no immediate plan to resume the service in these circumstances. We will do so only when the Covid-19 situation is under control.”The official added, “The doorstep delivery was an additional service. People can still apply for essential documents either online or manually at the offices concerned.”Under the government’s doorstep delivery scheme, people could just call on the centralised number -- 1076-- and place a service request. The services included the issuance of certificates (caste, income, domicile, delayed birth order; duplicate registration certificate of the vehicle, transfer of vehicle ownership), and new water and sewer connections, among others.The government had outsourced the operations to VFS Global, which had set up the centralised call centre and hired ‘mobile sahayaks’ to ensure timely and hassle-free delivery of services. “In light of the Covid-19 pandemic situation in Delhi, the doorstep delivery operations were suspended from March 23, 2020, and we are awaiting further instructions from the Delhi government,” a VFS Global spokesperson said.As the city crawls back to normalcy with further relaxations in restrictions imposed earlier to contain the spread of the infectious disease, citizens say the doorstep delivery of service should be resumed as people could then avoid visiting crowded places.Atul Goyal, president of United RWAs Joint Action (URJA), said, “It was a good scheme and would have proved beneficial during the present times when the number of Covid-19 cases are on the rise. While government offices have resumed public dealings, people want to avoid going to public places for fear of contracting the infection. But those who need crucial documents are forced to step out. The government should encourage online systems or provide doorstep delivery of services.”Explaining the reason why the service cannot be resumed, a government spokesperson (CHECK)on condition of anonymity, said, “We can’t resume services immediately, as the entire staff at the call centre and officials of the revenue department are deployed on Covid-19 duty. It will be restarted once the Covid situation improves.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-delhi-govt-yet-to-restart-doorstep-delivery-of-services/story-njFBBfCbSdBIwRjcJNeisL.html
06-07-2020||Delhi||Three-time plasma donor spreads hope among Covid-19 patients||Yogesh Dhakad, a 28-year-old nursing officer at Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital’s paediatric surgery department, was infected by the coronavirus in April and he spent 21 days in isolation at Safdarjung Hospital. Having recovered now, Dhakad has donated his plasma three times already – in 45 days of his discharge from the hospital. And he is not done. “As long as my body continues producing sufficient antibodies, I’ll continue donating every 15 days,” says Dhakad, who has been serving at the hospital since December.Plasma therapy is a process in which blood rich in antibodies from a Covid-19 recovered patient is transfused into the body of someone still struggling with the virus.Dhakad, who shares a rented flat in east Delhi’s Pandav Nagar with a friend, had been deployed in the Covid section of RML Hospital when he tested positive for the disease on April 18. “I must have been a little careless while dealing with patients,” says Dhakad. During 21 days of isolation at Safdarjung Hospital, he was asymptomatic throughout and kept himself busy with a physical workout, meditation and diet. It was on May 30 — nearly three weeks after his recovery — that he received the first request for donating plasma. “A social worker called me to ask if I could donate plasma for two patients admitted at Max Hospital,” says Dhakad.Dhakad, who weighs a little over 70 kilos, had no qualms. “I have donated blood about a dozen times since 2014. I am educated and aware that it is safe for a healthy person to donate plasma,” says Dhakad.In plasma donation, as against blood donation, plasma is extracted from the body while other components of the blood are injected back into the body, says Dr Sangeeta Pathak, senior consultant and head of department for the blood bank at Max Healthcare.“It is a totally safe process as a single needle and kit are used in the entire process. About 96% of the donors don’t feel any adverse effect. Some may feel dizziness and nausea, but it is a temporary effect and can be dealt with by taking sufficient liquid before and after the donation,” says Dr Pathak.But not every recovered Covid patient is eligible to donate.In an interview with HT, ILBS director Dr SK Sarin, had said that plasma donors should be a Covid patient younger than 60 years of age, not having uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney, heart, lung, or liver diseases and are well-nourished and weigh above 50kg.“Women who have been pregnant cannot donate,” says Dr Sarin, adding that people can donate again after a gap of 15 days.It was only several days later — after a thank you note from one of the beneficiary patients — that Dhakad got to know that both the patients at Max Hospital had recovered. “They were both over 50 years of age. One of them picked my address from the form I had filled and sent me a box of sweets and a thank you note,” says Dhakad.A curious Dhakad himself dialled a hospital attendant to learn that the second patient too had been discharged.Over the next 30 days, Dhakad donated plasma to yet another unknown patient during his visit to his hometown in Gwalior after a request from a known person, and then at Jaipur Golden Hospital in Rohini on receiving a call from RML Hospital.“I don’t know who the other two patients were or whether they got better, but it gives me immense satisfaction and a sense of pride to even think that I contributed to some families feeling hopeful,” says Dhakad.But Dhakad won’t reveal about his contribution to his parents; his two sisters being the only two relatives who know of it. “My father is a farmer and my mother a homemaker. They won’t understand that donating plasma is a safe, quick and painless process. When this crisis ends, I’ll let them know,” Dhakad says.Smriti Tiwari, the PRO of RML Hospital, says that Dhakad has also made the hospital proud. “We are proud that a colleague has come forward to set an example.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/three-time-plasma-donor-spreads-hope-among-covid-19-patients/story-lOnXvCvujd1cT2JF8CtQkK.html
06-07-2020||City||1984 riots convict lodged in Delhi’s Mandoli jail, dies of Covid-19||Mahender Yadav, a former legislator from Delhi’s Palam constituency who was convicted in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, died at a private hospital in Dwarka on Saturday, days after testing positive for Covid-19 at Mandoli Jail where he was lodged for the last 18 months.Yadav is the second prisoner to have died of the disease in the national capital. The other Covid death, on June 19, had taken place in the same barrack where Yadav was lodged.On Wednesday, Yadav’s family had approached the Supreme Court seeking interim bail for him on the grounds that they were not allowed to meet him in hospital. The Supreme Court had rejected his bail petition saying nobody could visit a person admitted in the ICU and that prisoners suffering from coronavirus were not entitled to getting any special treatment or favours.So far, 53 inmates and 88 staffers of Delhi’s jails have tested positive for Covid-19. Of them, 31 prisoners and 28 staffers have recovered, said Sandeep Goel, director general (Delhi Prisons).Yadav was serving a 10-year sentence in the anti-Sikh riots case after conviction by a CBI court in 2018. He had been in jail since December 31 that year.He was lodged in jail number 14 of Mandoli Jail located in north-east Delhi.Giving a background of the spread of Covid-19 in Mandoli Jail, Goel said the death of the other prisoner, Kanwar Singh, due to coronavirus had prompted the authorities to test all the other 29 inmates in that barrack. These 29 prisoners, including Yadav, were mostly senior citizens.“Seventeen of these 29 inmates tested positive in the first round on June 20. The others were tested again five days later and three more inmates were found to be infected. Yadav was found positive in the second round of testing,” said Goel.A day after his test results showed he was positive, Yadav developed “uneasiness and heart-related symptoms” upon which he was referred to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, said Goel.“The same day, he was referred to Lok Nayak Hospital (a Covid-designated hospital),” said Goel.Four days later, on June 30, Yadav was moved to the private Akash Healthcare Hospital in Dwarka. “The transfer was made under police guard on the request by Yadav’s family.On Wednesday, his family had approached the Supreme Court to request interim bail for him on the grounds that his relatives weren’t allowed to meet him in hospital and granting him bail would allow his family to take suitable steps in view of his deteriorating health.His family had cited his advancing age and ailments like diabetes and kidney issues.But the bench, headed by justice Indira Banerjee, had remarked, “If a person is in ICU, nobody can visit him. The petitioner cannot be given differential treatment because he is under detention.” HT’s efforts to reach Yadav’s son did not elicit a response.Yadav passed away at the hospital on Saturday evening, said Goel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1984-riots-convict-lodged-in-delhi-s-mandoli-jail-dies-of-covid-19/story-DOYTwkQjsMzBrFKa13qpON.html
06-07-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi govt orders hospitals to test all ‘high-risk’ individuals||The Delhi government on Sunday made it mandatory for all hospitals to conduct rapid antigen testing on all people with influenza like illness, all patients admitted with severe acute respiratory infection cases, all asymptomatic admitted patients or those falling in the high-risk group seeking admission in their facility. The order defines high-risk group undergoing chemotherapy, immunosuppressed, suffering from a malignancy, transplant patients and elderly (over 65 years of age) with co-morbidities.All patients undergoing aerosol generating procedures such as dental procedures will also have to undergo the test, the order says.“In view of above, medical directors, medical superintendents, directors of all hospitals of Government of NCT of Delhi are directed to ensure that rapid antigen detection testing of all individuals or patients falling in the above categories who visit their hospital is mandatorily done,” read the directive from Delhi government’s health and family welfare department.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on June 17 had issued an advisory to states, recommending antigen based rapid test to be expanded in a big way, especially those with high disease burden.Tests that detect presence or absence of an antigen in the body are called antigen detection tests. An antigen is a foreign molecule that induces an immune response within the body, especially the production of antibodies, and detecting its presence determines present infection.Delhi was the first state to roll out antigen based testing in June as Covid-19 cases had seen an unusual surge.ICMR had provided 50,000 kits to Delhi government for conducting antigen based testing across the state.An ICMR official, in the know of things, said, on condition of anonymity, “Antigen based test can help determine an ongoing infection which is why it is a good tool that can be used for diagnosis of Covid-19 along with the RT-PCR testing. RT-PCR, while a gold standard in diagnosing Covid-19, needs a proper biosafety level 2 lab for analysis. Antigen based test is a rapid point-of-care test that can be done on the spot without posing a biosafety hazard as it doesn’t deal with analyisng a live virus.”RT-PCR testing also has its limitations in terms of widespread availability because of the need for a specialized lab for analysis, and it takes about five hours to get results as compared to 30 minutes needed for antigen-based testing.The move is a part of enhancing Covid-19 testing capacity in the country as an upsurge in cases due to increased transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus that is expected because of relaxation in travel restrictions in the country post lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-govt-orders-hospitals-to-test-all-high-risk-individuals/story-HoUDIEl8nsd4jZyUXCB0UK.html
06-07-2020||Delhi||Number of Covid patients requiring hospital care in Delhi declining: CM Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said the number of Covid-19 patients in Delhi requiring hospital admission has been declining even as the state government announced that the number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds in three Delhi government hospitals has nearly tripled. “Less and less people in Delhi are now requiring hospitalisation, more and more people are getting cured at home,” Kejriwal tweeted.“Whereas there were around 2,300 new patients daily last week, no of patients in hospital has gone down from 6,200 to 5,300. Today, 9,900 corona beds are free,” he said in another tweet.As per a statement by Delhi government issued on Sunday, ICU beds in the three major covid-dedicated hospitals in the city – Lok Nayak (LNJP), Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospitals – have witnessed a 169% increase.After a visit to the temporary Covid hospital set up by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), along with Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday, Kejriwal said ICU beds are “very much needed at the moment” in the Capital. “For now, there is no scarcity of hospital beds, we have over 15,000 beds out of which 5,300 are occupied. There is a paucity of ICU beds. If there is any spike in Covid cases, these ICU beds are very critical for us,” the Delhi CM said. Delhi is on the cusp of reporting 100,000 cases with the city recording 99,444 cases by Sunday. The city has 3,067 fatalities so far due the viral disease.Also, 71,399 people have recovered and 15,564 patients with mild symptoms were in home isolation, according to the Delhi government’s daily Covid bulletin. In its statement on ICU beds, the Delhi government said, “The three-fold increase in ICU beds in Delhi’s three largest state-run Covid hospitals is a timely addition that will further strengthen the city’s fight against Covid-19. A few days back, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced with adequate bed capacity in Covid hospitals, major efforts are underway to now increase the ICU beds.“As a result of a continued push from the top, the number of beds in LNJP has increased from 60 at the beginning of lockdown to 180 today. The number of ICU beds in Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital has increased from 45 to 120 and the number of beds in Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital has increased from 31 to 66,” it said.It further said, “With an increase in the ICU beds, the fatality rate in Delhi is expected to further reduce due to enhanced capacity to take care of critical patients. Over the last few weeks, the daily number of fatalities due to Covid-19 has gone down substantially from over 120 a day to 55 on July 4.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/number-of-covid-patients-requiring-hospital-care-in-delhi-declining-cm-kejriwal/story-PJczLFhXLIGWu3fmRboHuO.html
06-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s Covid-19 case count likely to hit 100k today, fatality rate at 3%||With 2,244 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Sunday, the total number of confirmed infections in the national capital stood just 556 away from the 100,000 mark, 126 days since the first case was recorded in Delhi on March 2.According to the Delhi government’s daily health bulletin on Sunday, the Capital’s Covid-19 tally was 99,444. Delhi has recorded 2,338 new cases of Covid-19 on average every day over the past week.So far, 3,067 people have died due to the infection in the city, which means that Delhi has a case fatality rate (CFR) of 3%, slightly higher than the national average of 2.8%.Also read| Covid-19: Delhi govt orders compulsory rapid antigen detection test for high-risk individualsHowever, a silver lining for the national capital is the recovery rate, which on Saturday exceeded 70% for the first time. On Sunday, another 3,083 people recovered from the illness, taking the city’s recovery tally to 71,339, even as the testing numbers continue to rise.This means there are around 25,000 “active cases” — those still living with the infection — in the city. “Active cases” are a crucial metric because they directly correspond to the strain on a region’s health care system.According to the state government’s “Delhi Corona” app, the Capital has 15,161 beds for Covid-19 patients, of which 5,294 are occupied and 9,867 vacant as of Sunday.With 32,477 tests per million on Sunday, Delhi has among the highest testing rates in the country once the population is factored in.With nearly two-thirds of the Capital’s Covid-19 beds vacant, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday tweeted: “Less and less people in Delhi are now requiring hospitalisation, more and more people are getting cured at home.”“Whereas there were around 2,300 new patients daily last week, no of patients in hospital has gone down from 6,200 to 5,300. Today, 9,900 corona beds are free,” he said in another tweet.Just over one in five people admitted to hospitals with Covid-19 in Delhi are admitted to intensive care units.Testing numbers in the city have gone up since the commencement of rapid antigen tests on June 18, as part of the Centre and state governments’ efforts to stabilise the Covid-19 situation in the Capital. While the rapid tests were initially limited to the city’s containment zones initially, administrations in all 11 revenue districts of the city began conducting these tests from Friday, in a move to bring a greater proportion of the population under the testing net.The increase in the daily testing and the change in testing strategy to include asymptomatic people has meant that the positivity rate of cases has also dropped. The average weekly positivity rate, which was 21.6% two weeks ago, has since dropped to 11.6% on Sunday, though it still remains one of the highest in the country. At its peak, this number crossed 30% on June 16, which meant that nearly one out of every three tests was coming back positive.

As per these reports, Shahdara district had the highest antigen test positivity rate in the national capital — 11.29%, while the most tests had, as of Friday, been conducted in south-west district.Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicine department at Safdarjung Hospital, said: “Our recoveries have more or less been on international lines. In fact, the recovery rate will get much higher in the coming days because the new cases that are being detected are mostly mild or asymptomatic. We have also had far fewer deaths than estimated earlier, which is positive as well, showing that we our understanding of the virus has evolved from the initial situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-covid-19-case-count-likely-to-hit-100k-today-fatality-rate-at-3/story-CX91FPsG4fhoOxL3bgtA2J.html

The death toll in L ward is 249, while the case count is 4,257.With 69 deaths reported in the past 48 hours, the city’s Covid-19 toll has reached 4, 896, while its fatality rate has risen to 5.8%.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of G-N ward said, “Death records are maintained by the civic body’s epidemiology cell, as they have access to all the hospitals’ details. We have been given the deaths count recently and are looking into it.”Another civic official from Andheri said that the Covid-19 deaths data is not shared with the local administrative ward office of the area every day.Meanwhile, the lowest number of deaths was recorded in the wards in south Bombay. The A ward (Nariman Point and Churchgate) recorded the lowest deaths, followed by B ward (Bhendi Bazaar, Dongri, Pydhonie and Mohammad Ali Road) and C ward (Marine Lines, Chandanwadi, Kalbadevi).

06-07-2020||City||Kalyan and Dombivli too, need attention, says Fadnavis as Covid cases witness rise||The Maharashtra government should pay immediate attention to the spread of Covid-19 in Kalyan and Dombivli amid the rapidly increasing cases in the area, Devendra Fadnavis, leader of the Opposition in the legislative Assembly, said on Sunday at Holy Cross Covid-19 Hospital in Kalyan (West).Fadnavis was on a visit to the Covid-19 hospitals in the city to review the situation. “In the coming days, the cases in Kalyan Dombivli will be out of control. With less manpower, the civic body will not be able to look after the patients with the existing infrastructure. The state should see if extra manpower can be provided to the city,” the former chief minister (CM) said.After Kalyan, Fadnavis also visited Ulhasnagar and Bhiwandi.The Opposition leader said that though the situation has improved at Bhiwandi, the civic authorities must keep on improving the health care facilities in the city.“The state can help in providing funds to these areas so that the authorities can set up more beds and quarantine centres for the timely treatment of Covid-19 patients,” he said.Kalyan-Dombivli’s cases cross the 9-K markThe Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) recorded 482 new cases on Sunday, taking the total figure to 9,086. The first five days of the month have already seen a rapid surge in the Covid-19 cases, with around 400-500 cases recorded every day. Five deaths were also reported on Sunday, taking the death toll to 140.Meanwhile, KDMC recently joined hands with local private doctors’ association and set up three more Covid-19 hospitals in its vicinity. It has tied up with 17 private hospitals as a part of its efforts to curb the Covid-19 cases.The civic body will operate its 30 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 155 oxygen beds at the badminton court in KDMC Sports Complex at Dombivli MIDC on Monday. By July 15, KDMC will set up a facility with 70 ICU and 30 oxygen beds at Dombivli Gymkhana, and with 120 ICU and 250 oxygen beds at an art gallery in Dombivli. KDMC also plans to set up a quarantine facility in every ward by July 15 and ramp up the screening of residents from the current 800 to 2,000 each day. 120 deaths in BhiwandiMeanwhile, the Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC) on Sunday recorded 69 new cases and one death, taking its total case count to 2,319 and fatalities to 120.‘Why divide villages within KDMC’Speaking on the state’s recent decision to form a separate municipal body for 18 villages within KDMC, Fadnavis said, “The state should have considered establishing a civic body for all the 27 villages with proper planning instead of dividing them. Lack of planning will prove to be a major disaster in the future.”In the wake of the KDMC polls to be held later this year, the state had in June passed a notification to keep the remaining nine of the 27 villages within the civic body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kalyan-and-dombivli-too-need-attention-says-fadnavis-as-covid-cases-witness-rise/story-3cyVJanCXmQzeoQfsXOSdM.html
06-07-2020||Mumbai||Ramping up health infra, keeping Covid fatalities in check: Maha task ahead||Maharashtra’s victory in the battle against the Covid-19 outbreak looks like an uphill task amid the daily spike in positive cases and the mushrooming of newer hot spots across the state. After the state crossed the grim mark of 2 lakh cases on Saturday, it has multiple challenges ahead, including containing the spread of the virus, ramping up the health infrastructure in hot spots other than Mumbai, and keeping the fatality rate in check.It took 96 days for the state to cross the 1 lakh mark, but the 2 lakh figure was breached within a mere 22 days.Despite the grave situation in the state, health minister Rajesh Tope is confident that the virus spread will stabilise in a few weeks. However, the minister did not wish to comment if the state is yet to reach its peak. “There is no point in talking about the peak now. I think that the cases in the state will flatten by August,” he said.According to senior officials, the challenge now is even greater than before, as the state government ‘unlocked’ several restrictions.Though Mumbai continues to remain the worst-affected city in Maharashtra, the daily surge in the number of cases has stabilised. However, the new hot spots in the rest of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) as well as in the cities of Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Nashik and Aurangabad are now witnessing a high number of new cases every day. In the past two weeks, cities in MMR, excluding Mumbai, contributed over 41% of the cases recorded in the state. Between June 22 and July 4, the region recorded 27,808 cases. According to Tope, like Mumbai, the satellite cities, too, will witness a decline in daily cases. “Cases had spiked in south Mumbai but have subsided now. Cases from Dharavi and other major slums have also reduced. Now hot spots have resurfaced in north Mumbai and MMR. But the cases will be under control in the next 15 days there also,” he said.Senior health department officials said that densely populated areas, ease in restrictions on movement, and opening up of businesses, etc., led to the surge in MMR. Laxity in contact tracing further fuelled the surge in MMR’s cases.“As things have opened up now, the major challenge is to keep the numbers in control. The movement of citizens has increased after Unlock 2.0. Apart from social distancing campaigns, we have enforced closure of areas or selective lockdown now,” state health commissioner Anup Kumar Yadav said.As areas in MMR do not have adequate health infrastructure, district collectors and municipal commissioners rely on stringent lockdown measures to grapple with the increasing Covid-19 cases here. The situation in Mumbai came under control owing to a strong public and private health infrastructure. However, in the rest of MMR, barring Thane city, the health infrastructure is not as strong, said Yadav.“We have invested a lot to ramp up the infrastructure. Thane has a strong infrastructure but other corporations are not developed on the lines of Mumbai and Thane. We have conducted the gap analysis and proposed new Covid care centres, there is increased supply of ventilators as well as an increase in quarantine centres. In a short span of time, we are trying hard to supplement the health infrastructure. As of now, there is no shortage of bed or other equipment,” Yadav said.According to a civic official, around 80% of the positive patients are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms and therefore they recover in their home without burdening the health infrastructure in MMR region. Tope also acknowledged the lack of institutional quarantine facilities in other parts of MMR. He said he directed municipal commissioners from the region to put quarantine infected patients at institutional facilities.Lack of aggressive contact tracingSenior health department officials pointed out that lack of aggressive contact tracing caused several areas to take longer to control the cases. They added that it has a “cascading effect” which ultimately impacts the chances of survival of a positive patient. “Data shows that a positive patient comes to hospital on the fifth day of getting infected because tracing did not take place. In the meantime, they develop severe symptoms and the patient’s chances of recovery reduce. They also infect others before they are hospitalised. Ideally, we want patients [who need hospitalisation] to be admitted between 24 and 48 hours,” a health department official said.Tope admitted that contact tracing ratio in the state is 1:6 as opposed to the 1:15 target (15 contacts per one Covid-19 patient). Cases seeing surge in other cities tooIn the past two weeks, Pune city recorded around 8,112 cases, while the adjoining Pimpri-Chinchwad region recorded nearly 2,000 new cases during the same period. Nashik and Aurangabad too have been recording cases every day that largely contribute to the state’s cumulative figure. But officials said that since the movement in these areas is not as much as what is witnessed in MMR, cases are not growing exponentially. “We have adequate health infrastructure in Pune and other rural areas. The state has set up a task force in every district and advice from expert doctors, epidemiologists and virologists are being made available to rural patients with comorbidities,” Yadav said.Fatality rateAnother challenge before the state government is its battle against the rising fatality rate. After the state recorded 295 deaths – its highest ever in a day – the fatality rate in Maharashtra stands at 4.33% on Saturday. Yadav said the state has stepped up efforts to combat the fatality rate. “The death rate is largely under control. We have set up task forces, introduced a new clinical guideline, and experts guide the physicians treating Covid patients in rural areas through video conferencing. We also have the necessary drugs, including Remdesivir, and we are getting ventilators also,” Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ramping-up-health-infra-keeping-covid-fatalities-in-check-maha-task-ahead/story-JVcM8CkZkQrJ12xh2COkKI.html
06-07-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s active Covid-19 cases between 25,000 and 30,000||The city’s active Covid-19 cases have plateaued between 25,000 and 30,000 throughout June and the first week of July, as against the steady rise seen in the active cases in April and May. For the past one month, while fresh Covid-19 cases in a single day averaged between 1,000 and 1,300, the active cases have not shown a drastic increase owing to the high discharge rate of patients, who have recovered from the virus. On Saturday, Mumbai had 24,524 active Covid-19 cases, while on July 1 the number stood at 29,288. On June 15, the active cases count was 26,828, and on June 1, it was 22,571. The average growth rate of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai is 1.63%. According to BMC, 66% of Covid-19 patients have recovered and discharged as per the protocols outlined by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Officials from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) as well as experts anticipate that Mumbai’s curve will flatten in mid-July, and total number of active cases will begin to decrease every day after that. In mid-June, the number of discharged patients in Mumbai had crossed the number of active cases. Experts have also pointed out that a steady number of active cases will stabilise the health care system and help predict future health interventions and policies better.Civic commissioner IS Chahal pointed out to HT on Sunday that independent studies by doctors in the city have also indicated that Mumbai’s Covid-19 curve will begin to flatten by mid-July. However, officials have also cautioned that scaled testing, monsoon and further easing of restrictions are likely to affect these determinations.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of the health department, said, “The numbers have given us a clear understanding of where we stand right now. Things are certainly under control. We are on the proper track and our policies are working.”However, he has cautioned against two factors. “It is not time to celebrate yet . We are not aware of two scenarios: the first being what happens after we open up completely and the traffic on the road starts to increase. This may or may not lead to a spike in cases. The second scenario is the monsoon season. In June, it did not rain much but this month it has started to rain heavily. That is a worrying factor for us, as can aggravate the situation if there are high cases of malaria and dengue. These are situations out of our control, and so we are continuing to upgrade our facility to accommodate a spike. The corporation is preparing for future health interventions without considering that the curve is flattening.”As on Sunday, Mumbai reported 23,732 active Covid-19 cases, which is 28% of the total cases reported in the city so far. Mumbai recorded 1,287 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday and 69 deaths. The total cases in Mumbai are now at 84,524, while the death toll is 4,899, with 5.7% fatality rate. Mumbai’s figures contribute to 40% of Maharashtra’s total cases, 27% of the state’s active cases and 55% of its deaths.Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician from Bombay Hospital and chief co-ordinator for private hospitals and BMC, said, “Mumbai’s recovery and doubling rates have improved. The number of cases per day is almost the same – around 1,000 a day but not above 1,300 – from the past three weeks. These are signs that the curve is flattening. I feel that after July 15, our curve will witness a downward trend. But we have to still prepare for the worst-case situation.”When the number of cases can be predicted based on recent trends, healthcare facilities are in a better position to manage patients and can plan future heath care policies better, according to Dr Bhansali. He said, “Bed availability has improved. Very soon patients will also be able to get their choice of hospital. These are signs that we are doing better.”BMC has also started antigen testing that will increase Mumbai’s testing capacity to 7,000 tests everyday. Kakani said, “If someone tests positive in an antigen test, it will be treated at par with RT-PCR [reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction] test’s results. If anyone is tested negative, the person will go through a mandatory RT-PCR test.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-active-covid-19-cases-between-25-000-and-30-000/story-zw1zKcIiWxJHpw77eB98OM.html
06-07-2020||City||Mumbai’s Covid-19 cases are plateauing, but city needs more tests experts say||Are Covid-19 cases in Mumbai plateauing? In the past 10 days, Mumbai has, in descending order of dates from July 5, recorded 1,287, 1,163, 1,338, 1,554, 1,487, 893, 1,226, 1,287, 1,402 and 1,297 cases, averaging 1,293 cases per day. This number was 1,275 for the week ending June 27, and 1,214 the week ending June 20. In the three weeks before that, Mumbai recorded 1354, 1273 and 1375 new cases every day at an average.Since June 15, the city has not recorded major spikes in the pandemic curve. In this backdrop, Maharashtra health officials believe that Covid-19 has hit a plateau in Mumbai.However, that is not the case for the rest of Maharashtra. If we break the 200,000-case march of Covid in the state (Maharashtra breached the grim figure on July 4) into four phases of 50,000 cases each, an alarming trend of the increasing pace of cases emerges. The first 50,000 cases in Maharashtra took 77 days (on May 24) from the first case reported in the state on March 9, while the next 50,000 came in the next 19 days on June 12. The state crossed 150,000 cases just two weeks later on June 26. The 200,000-case mark came in just eight days later.In the last week, Maharashtra reported 5,847 new cases every day at an average – the highest ever recorded. The week before, this number was 4,418, and it was 3,376 the week before, all record highs until that point of time. In fact, the average new case graph has been increasing every day for nearly a month.Another case of worry for Maharashtra is the rise in active cases. In the last week, the state has added nearly 15,700 active cases. The week before that, active cases in the state increased a little over 9,500. Active cases is a crucial metric because it directly reflects the load on any region’s healthcare system. As of July 5, there are 86,040 active cases in the state. On June 25, there were 63,342. Recovery rate improved marginally from 52.42% to 54.08% in the same period.Mumbai, however, appears to have hit a plateau, in both daily cases as well as active cases. As of July 5, Mumbai’s active cases stood at 23,732. The city had recorded 55,884 recoveries out of 84,524 cumulative cases, giving a recovery rate of 66.12%. In contrast, on June 25, Mumbai’s active cases stood at 27,659, with 39,149 recoveries out of a total of 70,878 cases. The recovery rate in Mumbai was 55.23%. Since then, the recovery rate in Mumbai has risen by 10.89 percentage points, and the active cases have dropped by 14.2%.This is not enough to put Mumbai in the clear, though, according to Dr Abhijit More, co-convenor of Jan Arogya Abhiyaan, a pan-Maharashtra health sector NGO. He says testing in Mumbai has been inadequate. “The number of tests has remained constant between 4,000 and 4,500. The identification of cases has therefore maintained a similar path. If the civic-body starts testing more, the pandemic curve will go up, rather than remaining constant,” he said.From June 25 to July 3, Mumbai averaged 5025 tests a day, but from June 1 to June 24, it had averaged 4,298 tests.However, Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state Covid-19 task force refutes More’s claim. Citing data, Joshi said when BMC was testing between 2,500 and 4,000 people every day in April, the positivity rate was higher. For example, on April 28, when the city recorded its highest one-day spike with 2,105 cases, the BMC tested 4,093 people, giving a positivity rate of 51.43%. “In the last week of May, when we recorded the highest spike in cases, our testing figure was between 3,500 and 4,500 samples. Despite increasing the number of tests in June and July, the pandemic curve hasn’t gone up. It has rather plateaued,” Dr Joshi said.Public health experts said the plateauing is not uniform across the city. Cases seem to have plateaued only in south Mumbai, they said, where some locations had recorded the highest number of Covid-19 cases, whereas numbers are gradually increasing in north Mumbai, especially in the western suburbs.Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, a public health expert and analyst, said. “G-North ward, which has India’s largest slum cluster of Dharavi, was BMC’s prime concern. Now, we are recording very few cases there. The curve has flattened in Dharavi, but the situation is the opposite in Borivali, Dahisar and Kandivali.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-covid-19-cases-are-plateauing-but-city-needs-more-tests-experts-say/story-1JhVRjpIyekcSPhGVoLkcP.html

06-07-2020||Chandigarh||Ahead of monsoon, Chandigarh MC issues 700 notices over illegal water supply connections||Cracking the whip on illegal water supply connections and to stop contamination of drinking water with sewage, the municipal corporation has issued notices to around 700 houses in Sector 32 directing them to immediately disconnect ferrule connections to old supply lines.The residents have been given a week’s time to remove old connections, after which MC will remove them while taking a strict action against the defaulters. Residents have been directed to only use water connections from the new supply lines laid in the area.“In some locations of Sector 32, the old water supply lines were covered under illegal constructions, and their use was discontinued by the department after new pipes were laid in the area. But some residents haven’t disconnected the old lines, even when they have been provided with new connections,” said a senior MC official privy to the development.With people using both lines, the department reasons that the drinking water of the new pipeline gets contaminated. “The old water supply lines are laid in close proximity to the sewage pipelines. There are leakages at several places in these old lines. The sewage water gets mixed with drinking water. Through ferrule connections, the contaminated water enters the new pipelines,” said the official.Complaints received of stinking waterAfter receiving several complaints of contaminated water, the public health department of the MC had examined the reasons behind the problem. “Even though the drinking water supply was clean, residents were complaining of stinky and contaminated water for some time now. It was discovered that the reason lay in water from old lines getting mixed with new line supply leading to contamination,” explained the official.The contamination of the drinking water with the sewage water can lead to major health problems, especially in monsoon, which is why the notices have been issued, the official said.Besides contamination, the use of double water supply lines leads to low water pressure. “The leakages in old pipes that are difficult to locate now, are leading to water loss from the new lines. As a result, in many multi-storeyed houses, people on higher floors are not getting proper water supply. When people cut connections to the old pipes, this problem will be mitigated,” the official added.Meanwhile, residents are blaming the civic body, alleging that it was the department’s responsibility to disconnect old connections when the new lines were laid. “They are now putting onus on the residents and blaming us for issues like low water pressure. They should have taken appropriate steps when new lines were being laid,” said a resident, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ahead-of-monsoon-chandigarh-mc-issues-700-notices-over-illegal-water-supply-connections/story-TzCM5g9G820NBpV95L4sfO.html

An order issued by the Delhi Health department directed all medical directors, medical superintendent and directors of all Delhi government-run hospitals to ensure that “rapid antigen detection testing” of all individuals/patients falling in the categories listed, who visit their hospital, is mandatorily done. All individuals with influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms, all patients admitted with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) are to be mandatorily tested, it said. “All asymptomatic patients admitted or seeking admission of following high - risk group -- Patients undergoing Chemotherapy, Immunosuppressed patient including HIV+, Patients with Malignant disease, Transplant Patients, Elderly patients ( > 65 years of age ) with co-morbidities and all asymptomatic patients undergoing aerosol generating interventions,” the order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-delhi-govt-orders-compulsory-rapid-antigen-detection-test-for-high-risk-individuals/story-zLIHGgfW1wjuhXA5iTsTdK.html
06-07-2020||Mumbai||State Covid-19 tally rises to 206,619; toll 8,822||A day after breaching the 2-lakh Covid-19 case mark and recording, in a first, over 7,000 infections in a day, Maharashtra on Sunday recorded 6,555 new cases. The state’s tally is now 206,619, of which 86,040 are active cases, according to the state health department. Maharashtra now joins 14 countries that have reported over 2 lakh cases, as per data with worldometers.info. The state took 17 weeks to pass the bleak mark since the first case on March 9 and on Sunday surpassed the tally of countries such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which have reported 2,05,929 and 2,04,610 cases respectively.The state also recorded 151 deaths in a day, taking the toll to 8,822, health officials said. The state’s highest single-day spike of 7,074 cases and highest 24-hour toll of 295 was recorded on Saturday. Mumbai’s tally touched 84,524 after 1,287 cases were reported in the past 24 hours. Of these, 23,732 cases are active. The city’s toll stands at 4,899 after 69 more deaths were reported.Last week, CM Uddhav Thackeray had confirmed that there will be a spike in infections in the next few weeks as the state has begun opening up economy.Sharp surge in cases was observed in the past 10 days from June 24 onwards. The daily case count increased from 3,890 on June 24 to 4,841 the next day. It then recorded over 5,000 cases for each of the next five days and over 6,000 cases for each of the two days after that and crossed 7,000 cases on Saturday.In the past five days since July 1, the state has got 31,860 cases, as against 302 in March, 10,196 in April, 57,157 cases in May and 1,02,172 in June. Chief secretary Sanjay Kumar said there is no need to worry over the rise in cases until proper medical care is being made available to the people. “As we are opening up restrictions and allowing people to start their day-to-day activities, it is obvious that cases will go up. The rise should not be seen as a reason to worry as we are doing better surveillance, contact-tracing, testing and treatment. If we are providing better medical care, there is no need to worry about it,” Kumar said.However, following the spike in cases, many cities and districts have reimposed lockdown, although for a brief period to break the chain after the state government empowered them to take the decision as and when required.Cities in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) such as Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli, Mira-Bhayandar, Ulhasnagar, Navi Mumbai and Panvel have imposed lockdown in their jurisdiction for ten days.In MMR, cases have increased to 135,358 from 55,086 cases on June 3, when the state decided to provide relaxations in red zones, including MMR.In other cities such as Aurangabad, lockdown has been imposed in Walunj industrial area, between July 4 and 12. In Nashik city, night curfew has been imposed from 7pm to 5am to curb the pandemic’s spread.Aurangabad and Nashik have 5,205 and 2,932 cases respectively. Districts such as Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Beed, too, have imposed lockdown in their jurisdiction, following the surge in cases. Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Beed have 712, 246 and 142 cases respectively. While there has been a buzz that cases have started to peak in the state, public health secretary Pradeep Vyas denied this.“It is an infectious disease, movement of people and opening of restrictions has resulted in the rise in cases. I still cannot say that the peak has started,” Dr Vyas said.“We have found that the rise is cases was recorded in the areas where contact-tracing per positive patient is less than 10 people. Following this, authorities have been directed to trace at least 10 people behind one patient,” said another senior official, wishing not to be named.State health minister Rajesh Tope on July 2 had clarified that there is no community spread in the state so far. The numbers are rising, but there is no indication of community transmission, he said.“The number of fresh cases is increasing, but it cannot be termed community transmission as most of the cases are coming either from containment zones or institutional quarantine facilities. There is no community spread in the state yet,” Tope said.Despite rise in cases, the recovery rate of the state is over 54%, said the health minister. “On Sunday, 3,658 patients were discharged from various hospitals and are allowed to go back to their homes. Total number of recovered patients has increased to 1,11,740 and recovery rate stands at 54.08%,” he said.Along with surge in cases, the state is also facing a large number of deaths on a daily basis. In the past five days (since July 5), 967 deaths are recorded. To control the situation, the state has now formed a taskforce of expert doctors in all districts. With 8,822 deaths on Sunday, the case fatality rate (CFR) of the state was recorded as 4.27%. It is second-highest in the country after Gujarat, where CFR is 5.45% with 1,925 deaths (35,312 cases) till Saturday, according to the statistics shared by the state medical education department.Maharashtra still has highest number of deaths across states in the country.By the end of May, the state has successfully brought down CFRto 3.26% (on May 26) from 7.41% (with 148 deaths) on April 13. Currently, 46,062 people have been kept in institutional quarantine and over 6,04,463 people have been put under home quarantine across the state.So far, the state has also completed 11 lakh tests. On Sunday, the health department declared to have conducted 11,12,442 tests at various public and private facilities across Maharashtra. Of them, 10,05,823 people tested negative. It means 18.57% of the total samples tested positive, said an official.This works out to 11.36% of the total tests conducted in the country. Till July 4, a total of 97,89,066 samples have been tested across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-covid-19-tally-rises-to-206-619-toll-8-822/story-XwIhyeK14UcfXqzLip07jJ.html

06-07-2020||Mumbai||Classify buildings on their use while levying development charges: HC||Civic bodies ought to classify buildings on the basis of its predominant purpose (residential or commercial) while levying development charges, the Bombay high court (HC) said on Friday, while directing the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to not take any coercive steps for the recovery of the charges from Macrotech Developers Ltd.The division bench of justice KK Tated and justice Milind Jadhav directed the civic body to accept the ₹13.15 crore from the developer, instead of the ₹26.30 crore the corporation had demanded for.The bench also directed BMC to issue a commencement certificate to the commercial wing of the building developed by Macrotech Developers up to 26 habitable floors, after ₹13.15 crore is paid by the latter.Macrotech moved HC after the civic body on July 1 demanded ₹26.30 crore towards development charges for the issuance of commencement certificate for the habitable floors of the fourth - commercial wing of its project, World Towers at Worli.Senior advocate Sharan Jagtiani, who represented the developer, submitted that the development charges levied were in contradiction to sections 124A and 124B of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act, 1966. He added that the predominant user of the development which is being carried out by the developer was residential, as 78℅ of the construction is residential in nature, and therefore, the developer was liable to pay development charges at the rate of 4℅ of the ready reckoner (for residential buildings) and not at 8℅, required to be paid for commercial constructions.Senior advocate Anil Sakhare, who represented BMC, strongly opposed the prayer for interim relief. He submitted that if interim relief was granted to the developer, there was a possibility that he will complete the work and vanish without making any payments to the civic body, in case the court upholds the civic body’s demand notice later.The argument, however, failed to impress upon the bench.“On a careful perusal and consideration of the provisions of section 124A read with section 124B of MRTP Act, the petitioner has, prima facie, made out a case for seeking interim relief,” the bench said, adding that it was clear that the building was required to be classified for the purpose of levy of development charges on the basis of its “predominant user” as stated in the provisions.The bench also noted that of the total floor space index of 1,95,524 square metres to be utilised at the site, a majority (1,52,646 square metres) was being utilised for residential purposes, clearly indicating that the predominant purpose was residential.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/classify-buildings-on-their-use-while-levying-development-charges-hc/story-BdimXrLUUHghqPeEIdHExN.html

06-07-2020||Mumbai||ICT researchers work on Covid-19 rapid testing kit||The Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT), Matunga, is developing an indigenous rapid testing kit, RTqPCR 2.0, for the detection of Covid-19 at almost half the cost of the existing test.A five-member team of researchers from the institute, in association with the Indian Institutes of Technology Alumni Council, is creating a one-step lyophilised real time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) kit that can detect a host of diseases. The kit will contain a testing reagent that is in dry state and can be stored in room temperature.Currently, RT-PCR test is one of the most effective diagnostic tools for confirmation of Covid-19 owing to its qualitative results. However, since the cost of the test is high and the method of detection is complex, the use of the test is limited across the country.The existing RT-PCR tests, which have been either adopted or imported from other countries, require sophisticated refrigerators to store the reagent. This increases the cost of the test significantly. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has capped the cost of the test at ₹4,500. “The reagent is in liquid state and has to be stored at -20° C. It requires standardised and quality-controlled refrigeration facility, which makes it unsuitable for tropical countries like India. Especially in rural India, such refrigeration facilities are not available,” said Ratnesh Jain, coordinator of the project.The scientists are lyophilising this reagent — or drying it out — to a solid powder state that can be stored at room temperature. “This reagent can then be mixed with water and used for the diagnosis,” said Jain. The process of lyophilisation is not new to the institute that has in the past done the same for pharmaceutical and food industries. According to Jain, lyophilising traditionally helps pharmaceutical companies cut manufacturing cost by two to three times. The product is in development stage and will soon be ready depending on how the funding flows in, he added. It will be available in the MegaLab, an initiative of the IIT Alumni Council to build a lab in Mumbai with the capacity of conducting 10 million Covid-19 tests a month. Apart from Covid-19, the kits will have the ability to detect tuberculosis, dengue, chikungunya, HIV, Hepatitis, select cancers and some sexually transmitted diseases. With this, ICT has joined the league of technical institutes that are working on indigenous variants of the Covid-19 tests. “MegaLab Mumbai and RTqPCR 2.0 are excellent initiatives by IIT Alumni Council in the fight against Covid-19. It will meet the immediate need for mass testing through reliable, faster and cheaper genetic diagnostics, in addition to becoming a showpiece for indigenous technology and engineering capability,” said Anirudha Pandit, vice chancellor of ICT, Mumbai and one of the investigators of the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ict-researchers-work-on-covid-19-rapid-testing-kit/story-xz7NCS73vu6GiovZyS77FJ.html

BJP leaders have alleged severe malpractices and corruption at the facility.Kotecha alleged that Velrasu denied furnishing a work order of oxygen cylinders at the Nesco facility as the later claimed that the facility was built using CSR funds. “However, later we got a copy of the work order that was issued to a local builder to supply 23 oxygen cylinders worth ₹10.90 crore to the Nesco Covid facility,” said Kotecha in a press release. The release added that this amounted to breach of privilege.Kotecha further alleged that there have been many such purchases made by the authorities during the pandemic that have severe irregularities.

06-07-2020||Mumbai||CMO, home minister cancel transfer order of 10 Mumbai DCPs||The transfer order of 10 deputy commissioner of police (DCPs) has been stayed by the office of chief minister Uddhav Thackerey and home minister Anil Deshmukh. Ten DCPs were recently transferred within Mumbai by the commissioner of police Parambir Singh Deshmukh on Sunday evening in a message on Twitter said that the Mumbai commissioner of police’s (CP) order of internal transfers in Mumbai police were stayed by his and chief minister Udhhav Thackeray’s offices. Home minister Anil Deshmukh remained unavailable for comment.It’s for the first time that Mumbai CP’s decision has been overturned by the government in the last decade. Sitaram Kunte, additional chief secretary, (general administration) department having additional charge of ACS (home) department, said, “It has been done out administrative reasons.” The order has come amid reports of discontent among the ruling partners — Congress and NCP — over decisions taken by Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. However, Anil Deshmukh in a video statement claimed that there was no differences between three parties. The 10 DCPs which include three Indian police service (IPS) officers as well were recently transferred as part of internal shuffling by CP Mumbai. Sources in the home department said that while shuffling DCPs internally, some transfer rules were overlooked and some senior political leaders of the ruling parties were not happy with the move.The joint commissioner of police (administration) Naval Bajaj, on Sunday, issued an order to cancel these transfers. Bajaj also directed all the DCPs who had taken charge of the new postings, to resume back to their previous postings. The exact reason for holding the transfers is not yet clear. On July 2, 10 DCPs; Paramjit Dahiya, Prashant Kadam, Ganesh Shinde, Dr Rashmi Karandikar, Shahaji Umap, Mohan Dahikar, Vishal Thakur, Sangramsingh Nishandar, Pranaya Ashok and Nandkumar Thakur were given new postings. Apart from this, DCP (headquarter-1), N Ambika was given an additional charge of DCP zone 3. “For the internal shuffling of DCPs, CP’s recommendation holds maximum weightage. But it has to be done after securing prior approval from the home department,” said a home department official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cmo-home-minister-cancel-transfer-order-of-10-mumbai-dcps/story-uDecf1meHClMNSJpy10tYJ.html
06-07-2020||City||People in Thane quarantine centre complain of inadequate food, hot water||Patients at a quarantine centre set up in one of the buildings of a private residential complex in Manpada, Thane, have alleged a lack of many basic facilities. Patients said that food is served only twice a day and no hot water is provided. Additionally, they claimed that Covid-negative patients are made to stay with those who tested positive, increasing their risk of infection.“Our basic complaint is the lack of adequate food and its quality. Lunch is served at 1pm, while dinner is served at 10pm, with no tea or snacks for nine hours in between. Many old, diabetic patients and children suffer due to these timings. Moreover, breakfast is very meagre and irregular. At times, no breakfast is served. My in-laws who are diabetic need food on time and face difficulty in this centre,” said a 40-year-old woman who has been quarantined at the centre along with her family members.The Manpada facility is one of 10 civic quarantine centres in the city. The 23-storeyed building can accommodate 120 patients.Quarantined individuals allege that there is no provision for hot water in the washrooms and people suffering from cold are forced to bathe with cold water. Hot water is also not provided for drinking.“We do not get enough water to drink. Sometimes the water is over and not re-filled on time. In this heavy rain, we need hot water to bathe. We even asked for hot drinking water but were denied. It would be better if we were quarantined at home and could take care of ourselves rather than deteriorating here. We don’t get any immunity booster products or tablets to have if we are suspected of Covid-19,” said a 38-year-old man who was admitted to the quarantine centre along with four of his family members.One patient at the centre who was Covid-negative complained that he was given a bed near a positive patient and later tested positive as well.Thane Deputy municipal commissioner Sandip Malvi said, “The allegations are baseless. Apart from the lack of hot water, there are no major problems in any of our centres. It is true that we are facing difficulty to provide hot water in some of the centres and are working on it.”He claimed that food reaches on time and is adequate at all the centres. “Along with the patients, our staff is also provided food. We provide breakfast, lunch, evening tea and biscuits, and dinner. There is no scarcity of food. We check every morning if the patients have received breakfast. However, I will send our volunteers to check on these complaints. Our doctor is also checking on the health of every patient,” Malvi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/people-in-thane-quarantine-centre-complain-of-inadequate-food-hot-water/story-JnlGDPCfFjB69eCjPh7ICN.html
06-07-2020||Mumbai||HC judges to pay surprise visits to Covid facilities in Aurangabad||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Friday said that it would pay surprise visits to hospitals, quarantine, and Covid care centres in the city after it was informed that officials continued to be negligent in their Covid duties despite the court’s direction to initiate a suo moto public interest litigation (PIL) based on news reports on the matter. The court said that if they found public servants shirking their responsibilities, they would issue directions for registering criminal complaints against such officials. They would also seek details of negligent officials from the Aurangabad civic administration.A division bench of justice TV Nalawade and SD Kulkarni, while hearing the suo moto PIL initiated at their behest, was informed by senior counsel Rajendra Deshmukh appointed as Amicus Curiae, that indiscipline and apathy among public servants involved in containing the spread of Covid-19 continued even though the court had issued strict directions in the previous hearing.Public prosecutor for the state DR Kale, however, assured the court that based on the previous directions, disciplinary action had been taken against public servants and persons who were not obeying orders made by the officers and authority created under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. Kale claimed that since said action was not publicized, it seemed like the authority was not acting. Kale also submitted a compilation of documents to show what action had been taken against errant public servants.However, Deshmukh submitted that there was still no discipline among public servants and Covid staff, and they remain absent from duty.“It is a fact that the graph of the affected persons is still ascending in Aurangabad district. This court has already observed that only giving direction is not sufficient, the directions need to actually be implemented,” the bench said.In light of these observations, the court said that it would pay surprise visits to hospitals, quarantine, and Covid care centres and containment zones. It said that if it finds that staff negligence is leading to the spread of the virus, criminal action will be taken against the errant public servant or staffer, no matter their rank. “This court will not be sparing anyone if such lapses are found,” the bench said, posting the hearing for July 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-judges-to-pay-surprise-visits-to-covid-facilities-in-aurangabad/story-FHQ39LyyO0kf0ncUDesviN.html
06-07-2020||Chandigarh||Stop confusing people on agri ordinances: SAD to Capt||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Sunday asked chief minister (CM) Capt Amarinder Singh to “stop creating confusion on the central agricultural ordinances despite knowing it had nothing to do with minimum support price (MSP)”.In a statement here, former minister Daljit Singh Cheema asked the CM to shun politics on the central agricultural ordinances in the interest of Punjabis. “Punjabis want answers to the ₹5,600-crore excise revenue losses. They want to know what you have done to recoup the losses which were pointed out by your own colleagues. Why no action has been taken against Congress leaders and distillery owners who are accused of bottling illicit liquor and denying excise duty to the state,” the former minister asked.Cheema said Punjabis also wanted to know why illegal mining of sand was continuing unabated in the state. “Why is the state government facilitating the sand mafia by reducing their lease fee and even allowing them to mine sand where clearances have not been given,” he asked.The former minister said even in the case of central ration received by the state, the Congress government had turned a blind eye to diversion of ration to houses of its leaders. Further, according to Cheema, there are other issues concerning the state, such as denial of dues to sugarcane growers and huge power bills thrust on the common man, but the CM seems oblivious to these and is bent on building a false narrative to cover his failures.Asking the CM to tell farmers and Kisan Unions the whole truth, Daljit Cheema said, “Isn’t it a fact that you amended the state Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act in 2017 to include all the provisions contained in the farmers’ produce and trade ordinance, such as allowing creation of private yards, direct marketing and e-trading.”He said the state did not only amend its APMC Act but also participated in the consultation process on the agricultural ordinances. “Now after doing all this, the CM is misleading farmers and Kisan Unions in league with AAP for petty political gains,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/stop-confusing-people-on-agri-ordinances-sad-to-capt/story-tk4GZ68yiuS36oVcumiDQP.html

06-07-2020||Mumbai||City gets second highest 24-hour July rain in 5 years||Heavy rain for the second consecutive day led to waterlogging in 13 spots on Sunday. The disruptions exposed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s monsoon preparedness, including desilting and cleaning of nullahs. The suburbs received heavy rain, whereas the island city saw light showers throughout the day.Chronic flooding spots of Parel, Chembur, Khar, Andheri, Jogeshwari, Malad and Dahisar were waterlogged for a couple of hours. Routes for Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses, Bandra National college via Linking Road, SV Road via Linking Road, were diverted. Suburban railways ferrying only essential staffers remained uninterrupted.A portion of a balcony of a dilapidated building in Bandra’s Nirmal Nagar collapsed on Sunday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The heavy rain on Saturday midnight also lead to collapse of a balcony of a ground plus 10 storey building in Mazagaon. Civic officials who visited the site said the building was not in a dilapidated condition, however, residents decided to move out of it. It was also later found that owing to heavy rains over the weekend, water had gotten accumulated in the balcony leading to its collapse.Leader of Opposition in BMC, Ravi Raja, alleged claims of monsoon preparedness turned out to be false. He added, “BMC commissioner’s claim of completing 113% desilting of drains turned out to be hollow. The contractors claimed to meet the desilting target by mixing debris in the garbage dumped from the sewer at several places. These contractors should face legal action.”BMC recieved 75 complaints of tree/branch crashes from various areas of the city, 16 of short-circuits and five of wall collapse. No one was injured in either of the incidents. A high tide (4m) is expected on Monday at 12.17am midnight and of 4.72 meters at 1.06am. Powai lake also overflowed on Sunday morning. A senior civic officer of BMC’s hydraulics department said, “Around 6am, the Powai lake overflowed. Data on lake levels for the seven lakes that provide drinking water to Mumbai is being compiled following Saturday’s rain.” Meanwhile, two flights had to be diverted. One Navy aircaft had to be diverted to Pune around 9.45am and a Swiss Air flight from Zurich had to be diverted to Hyderabad at 10.58am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/heavy-rain-washed-away-bmc-s-claims/story-nXVvjD4h4RhyMzzLzoWWPP.html
06-07-2020||Gurugram||First spell of rain floods Gurugram, officials track situation||The city received its first heavy downpour of the season on Sunday morning, with rain bringing its share of pain for an unprepared city and leaving a bunch of stretches waterlogged.A spell of heavy rain lashed the city between 3 am and 4 am, and left areas like service lanes of Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway at Narsinghpur, Rampura flyover, IFFCO Chowk, Signature Tower, Sector 30/31 exit heavily waterlogged. Arterial stretches such as sector 30/31 dividing road, Sheetla Mata Mandir Road, and a spot near Basai Chowk also reported some waterlogging.Gurugram traffic police later took to the social media to warn commuters about all the waterlogged stretches that should be avoided.As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD) website, the city received 7mm of rainfall on Sunday. The website further said that the city is expected to have spells of rains and thundershowers till Thursday.Last Thursday, during a meeting at the PWD rest house, officials of Gurugram police, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), and district administration had identified 35 “most crucial” waterlogging-prone points in the city. Barring Rampura flyover which is located in Manesar, all the other points that witnessed waterlogging on Sunday were part of the 35-point list.Officials said each of the points that witnessed waterlogging is being monitored via CCTV cameras and teams have been allocated to initiate remedial measures at the earliest.VS Kundu, chief executive officer (CEO) of GMDA, said he was carrying out a site inspection of all the 35 points on Saturday and Sunday. He said that at some spots, — Vatika Chowk, the highway stretch near Ambience Mall, HUDA City Centre, and Mahavir Chowk — GMDA was waiting for a spell of rainfall in order to gauge the condition of the drains in the area.“Construction activities are underway at some of these points, due to which there is a possibility that drains could have been clogged or blocked entirely. We were, hence, waiting for the first proper spell of rain to ascertain the time it would take for water to recede so that we could initiate remedial measures accordingly,” said Kundu.As per GMDA officials privy to the matter, remedial measures include placement of high-power motor pumps to divert rainwater to the nearest drainage outlet, or establishing new drainage lines at these spots entirely.Even during the construction of underpasses on the e-way between 2016-18, similar practices of waiting until the first spell of rains to predict the drainage conditions of stretches were followed by officials.As per MCG officials, they had deployed motor pumps at several points across the city and by noon water had receded in most parts of the city.“At several points, especially those on the arterial stretches, we realised drains had become clogged due to which there was heavy rainwater accumulation. Using super suction machines we were quickly able to remove the silt and other depositions and drain out rainwater. At some of the points on the expressway, drainage was an issue and hence, we used motor pumps to divert the water to the nearest outlet. Barring the Narsinghpur-Khandsa service lanes, rainwater had receded across most parts of the city by noon,” said an MCG official privy to the matter.With a majority of people staying indoors and working from home amid the Covid-19outbreak, there were no snarls reported on Sunday as the volume of traffic was lower than usual. However, a few commuters did say that they got delayed as they drove on flooded stretches at a low-speed.“Amidst the coronavirus outbreak, it was taking me less than 25 minutes to drive between Sirhaul and Kherki Daula toll along the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway. However, today morning, it took me nearly 40 minutes to cover the same stretch as roads were heavily waterlogged, especially between Hero Honda Chowk and Kherki Daula. I had to drive at a much slower pace and with caution,” said Virender Singh, a resident of sector 82.Last month HT had reported that the city should brace for waterlogged stretches as authorities are lagging behind on monsoon preparedness as most of the resources and attention had been diverted towards containing the spread of coronavirus.From March 21 till April 15, MCG had issued an internal order to all its officials to solely focus on ensuring “basic services” such as sanitation, water, sewage, and streetlights, continue to remain uninterrupted during the initial phases of the lockdown.

Key agendas on the list of the civic body include the current status of the takeover of several private colonies across the city, the beautification of green belts and parks, and the rejuvenation of ponds during the monsoon season.Regarding the first agenda, the councillors have asked the MCG to give a status update on the takeover of the privately developed colonies in the city, including Sushant Lok 2 and 3. The civic body has already taken over the responsibility of the upkeep for six private colonies, while the work on 11 others are underway. The private colonies taken over by the civic body include Nirvana Country, South City 1 and 2, Sushant Lok 1, Palam Vihar and Suncity.While the developers of South City 1 and 2, Nirvana Country, Palam Vihar, Sushant Lok 1 have opted to pay the civic body to the fix the deficiencies in the civic infrastructure their colonies, developers of DLF phases 1, 2 and 3, and Suncity have opted to fix deficiencies themselves. Barring, DLF phases 1, 2 and 3, the takeover of all other colonies has been completed.As per a reply from the planning branch of the MCG, the civic body held a meeting with the officials of the department of town and country planning (DTCP), residents’ welfare associations, and the developers of the some of the remaining private colonies, including Ardee City, Malibu Town, Vipul World, Uppal Southend, Rosewood City, and Mayfield Garden, last month for “working out a strategy” to improve the deficient civic infrastructure in these colonies. Subsequently, another meeting was held, where it was decided that the MCG will initiate a deficiency assessment survey in these colonies for which the DTCP has been asked to provide a service plan design and estimates, after which the survey can be initiated. Simultaneously, the engineering wing will be working on identifying an agency that can carry out the survey on the behalf of the MCG.In its reply, the planning branch has said that the proposal for the takeover of Sushant Lok 2 and 3, along with Greenwood City, DLF phases 4 and 5 has already been approved in the last month’s House meeting and a proposal has been sent to the directorate of town and country planning (DTCP) in Chandigarh in this regard.Another agenda in the MCG’s meeting is the beautification of green belts and parks, and the rejuvenation of ponds.In its reply, the engineering wing said that the MCG is currently undertaking several plantation drives that will result in more than 75,000 saplings being planted across the city during the monsoon season while work on rejuvenating five ponds is also underway.

06-07-2020||Mumbai||State awaits nod to release Avni’s cub after monsoon||After failing to release the female cub (T1C2) of alleged man-eater tigress T1 or Avni last year, the Maharashtra forest department has yet again decided to go ahead with the plan this year post monsoon.T1C2, now a sub-adult tigress, aged two-and-a-half years, has been kept in captivity in a 4.5-hectare (ha) area in Pench Tiger Reserve since December 22, 2018. She was captured around a month after Avni was shot dead by a father-son hunter duo hired from Hyderabad on November 2. The decision to release T1C2 was taken on Thursday during a meeting chaired by principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF) wildlife with forest officials and the committee constituted in November 2018 to oversee the cub’s capture and behaviour and captivity. However, the forest department needs approval from the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NCTA) before releasing the animal back in the wild.“T1C2 has been showing all traits of a tigress that can hunt and kill in the wild. She is fit for release. A proposal to that effect will be submitted in the coming week to NTCA. Based on their approval, we should be in a position to release the tigress in a couple of months or just after monsoon,” said Nitin Kakodkar, PCCF (wildlife), Maharashtra.PCCF added that three locations had been shortlisted as possible areas of release — Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve in Gondia, Pench Tiger Reserve in Nagpur and Melghat Tiger Reserve in Amravati. “As of now, Navegaon-Nagzira looks most promising as there is a low tiger population. However, this will be finalised based on NTCA’s nod,” said Kakodkar.SP Yadav, member secretary, NTCA, said, “We are aware about the matter. A decision will be taken once we receive their (Maharashtra’s) proposal.”Last year, the state had planned a similar release after monsoon but met with complications with NTCA guidelines. “Some activities as per NTCA’s standard operating procedure (SOP) still needed to be studied. For example, the number of prey killed by her, prey base, and frequency of kills etc. We were not complying with NCTA’s SOP then. All conditions are met now,” said Kakodkar.One of the committee members requesting anonymity said, “We were monitoring her behaviour using CCTV. She was too young to be released last year, and would not have survived in the wild.”Former member of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) Kishor Rithe said the tigress’s timeline in captivity and extent of human imprint (changes in behaviour in captivity) were two crucial factors. “If we are sure that there is no human imprint on the animal then it is fit for release. Also, the time period between the animal’s capture and translocation has to be minimum. In this case, the period is more than one-and-a-half years. I have serious doubts about this experiment,” said Rithe.Earlier this year, a rewilding experiment in Madhya Pradesh’s Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve had failed after two tigers were shifted to a Bhopal zoo after they were found incapable of hunting wild prey. Tiger cubs usually mature slowly and stay with their mother till at least eighteen months, after which they disperse into the wild in search of new territory.“One school of thought says there is nothing like human imprint on large carnivores. However, if her release is happening as per NTCA protocol and assessed in a scientific manner, it should be done. The animal cannot be kept in captivity for life,” said Dr Prayag HS, former chief wildlife veterinary officer, Karnataka forest department. Tiger scientist from Wildlife Institute of India (WII) Bilal Habib said, “Since T1C2 was captured, it was decided that she would be released. She was kept away from humans and all efforts have gone into ensuring minimal human imprint unlike other captive animals. Thus, it is the right decision to release her back into the wild.”WHY WAS T1C2 CAPTUREDTigress T1 or Avni was shot dead by a father-son hunter duo hired from Hyderabad on November 2, after it was said that she killed 13 people in Pandharkawada forest in Ralegaon, Yavatmal. The forest department began the capture of her male and female cubs soon after as they were too young to fend for themselves in the wild and could have fallen prey to infighting among other tigers. It was also suspected that the cubs allegedly posed a threat like T1. While T1C2 was rescued on December 22 with the help of Madhya Pradesh forest department and sent to Pench, the male cub T1C1 remained elusive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-awaits-nod-to-release-avni-s-cub-after-monsoon/story-RHTWv1K0WZsl0KlbA3mgSK.html
