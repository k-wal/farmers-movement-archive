The seized contraband is slated to be around Rs 12 lakh in the international market, the police said.This is the fourth major haul within the past two weeks in the district, where cannabis being transported into National Capital Region areas was seized and suspects were arrested.According to the police, the suspects had allegedly brought the contraband in three-wheelers from Chhattisgarh.

02-07-2020||Mumbai||Yuva Sena urges state to cancel online exams announced by ICT||Yuva Sena, the youth wing of the Shiv Sena, has written to state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant seeking to scrap examinations of the Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT). This comes a week after HT reported that ICT had announced the dates of exams for all students.On Thursday, Yuva Sena, led by state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, wrote to Samant stating that ICT in Matunga was defying the state government’s decision to scrap all exams. “In the interest of students during Covid-19 pandemic, and under the guidance of Yuva Sena chief Aaditya Thackeray, we request you to scrap the examinations planned by ICT,” said the letter signed by Yuva Sena secretary Varun Sardesai. HT had, on June 27, reported that the institute planned to conduct two rounds of e-examinations wherein students could take the tests from their home. On May 2, Samant had announced that all exams barring those for final-year students would be scrapped owing to the lockdown. Later on May 30, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced that final-year exams, too, would be cancelled and students will be promoted based on their past performances. ICT administration had claimed that the state’s rules were not applicable to it as ICT is a deemed university. However, Sainath Durge, core committee member of Yuva Sena, said, “The state government’s plan to scrap exams is applicable to all educational institutes, including deemed-to-be universities.” ICT registrar RR Deshmukh did not comment on the matter.Following the letter, the state higher and technical education department issued a government resolution reiterating the decision to scrap all exams. The decision is applicable to all institutions, including deemed ones, the department clarified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yuva-sena-urges-state-to-cancel-online-exams-announced-by-ict/story-1vULQrEEMLgZAmnyzS9lhM.html
02-07-2020||Mumbai||Conduct random testing of inmates, deploy additional forces for prisons: HC||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday directed the prison authorities to conduct random testing of inmates for Covid-19 and also follow guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) scrupulously. The HC, while disposing of a bunch of public interest litigations (PIL) seeking various reliefs for prison inmates after four inmates succumbed to the infection while in prison, has also directed the authorities to deploy additional forces at all prisons as well as the 35 temporary prisons where inmates are kept in quarantine and are undergoing treatment for Covid-19. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice MS Karnik pronounced its judgement on PILs filed by People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) through senior counsel Mihir Desai along with advocates Isha Khandelwal and Kritika Agarwal; and Geeta Bharat Jain, a politician represented by advocate Sunny Punamiya; Archana Rupawate also represented by senior counsel Mihir Desai; and advocate Afreen Khan and Devmani Shukla represented by advocate Bhavesh Parmar.While reading out the operative part of the judgement, the court said it accepted the assurances made by the state government regarding the measures initiated for the well-being of inmates. The bench directed prison authorities to conduct random Covid-19 tests of inmates and to refer for testing any inmate who shows any symptoms for Covid-19. The court also directed the authorities to notify on the prison department’s website details of all the 35 temporary jails that have been set up in 27 districts to serve as makeshift Covid care centres. The court further directed the state government to implement all the measures that it had formulated in the modified draft guidelines based on the suggestions of the petitioner for containing outbreak in prisons and other correctional homes. While stressing on updating family members of prisoners on their health status, the court said, “Every possible endeavour to be made by the prison authorities to scrupulously follow guidelines issued by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Centre and state governments from time to time regarding safety measures and the standard operating procedures be revised from time to time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/conduct-random-testing-of-inmates-deploy-additional-forces-for-prisons-hc/story-3IIpX85MhXx1tGy1fgqFDM.html
02-07-2020||Noida||Temple objects to biogas plant in Sec-28; Noida authority assures safety||A bio-mechanisation plant being installed by the Noida authority at Sector-28 near a temple has become a point of contention between the temple trust and the authority.According to the Noida Bengali Cultural Association, that manages the 40-year-old Kali temple or Kalibari, the facility -- that converts garbage into compost and cooking gas – is being constructed at 10 metres from temple. Stating that it will turn the area into a garbage dumping ground, the trust says it will hurt the religious sentiments. “We have seen some examples where such plants turn the place into a garbage segregation point and leak hazardous gases. This would create an unpleasant atmosphere around the temple. We request that the construction be halted and transferred to an alternative site,” said Ashok Arya, president Noida Bengali Cultural Association and Noida Kalibari.He added that the even last year the construction was halted after complaints.“Every year thousands of devotees come here during Durga puja. The plant would not just create an unpleasant atmosphere and hurt religious sentiments, but also take a lot of space thereby obstruct pandal set ups. The plot where it is being constructed is a nursery for plant, which is under the Noida authority but is maintained by the temple. We have requested the district administration, Noida authority and the chief minister’s office to shift it elsewhere,” said Anupam Banerjee, member Noida Kalibari.The Noida authority has already constructed 12 such bio-mechanisation plants and is in the process of 25 others that will absorb biodegradable waste from nearby residential areas and hope to cover the whole city.In this case, sector -26 would be serviced. “We don’t have any objection to the facility being constructed here,” said Govind Sharma, president, RWA, sector-26. “As a matter of fact, we even asked the authority to demarcate the boundary between the nursery and temple. The temple was allotted some 1,083 sq metres in 1983 but they have occupied around 3,000 sq metres. They also have a guest house there. The facility is to manage waste at its source.”However, some residents said that they were not informed about the facility being built there.“Also the RWA did not inform residents about its location. My home is also a few metres away from the plant, and if any accident occurs, who will be responsible?,” said a resident who didn’t want to be named.According to the Noida authority, the plant is safe.“We have not received any complaints. The bio-mechanisation plant is absolutely safe and crucial to manage the urban waste. There are many other plants installed by us and they are all very safe,” said Indu Prakash, officer on special duty (health) and head horticulture department, Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/temple-objects-to-biogas-plant-in-sec-28-noida-authority-assures-safety/story-LuO3IeJnnHWFf2gaB3JqwN.html
02-07-2020||Noida||Noida: Covid-19 surveillance begins in district, 90% of daily target hit on first day||The 10-day long special coronavirus testing drive that began in all six districts of Meerut division on Thursday, reached almost 90% of its daily sampling target in Gautam Budh Nagar district on its inaugural day, officials said.Against the target of collecting 4,000 samples per day, as many as 3,618 samples were collected during the drive on Thursday which was kicked off jointly by Narendra Bhooshan, the chief executive officer of Greater Noida, police commissioner Alok Singh, and district magistrate Suhas LY, from Haroula in Sector 5.Under the drive, testing is mostly done using on-site rapid antigen kits and lab-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. The district magistrate said that during the 10-day drive, all the tests conducted within the districts will be considered as part of the special initiative.“The achievement on the inaugural day of the drive is overwhelming. Out of 2,037 samples collected through rapid antigen kits on Thursday, 54 samples tested positive. Our teams have also collected 1,591 samples through RT-PCR tests and their results will come in a few days. Apart from this, 10 samples have also been taken through TrueNat machines, of which no one was tested positive,” the DM said.The DM said with the help of 1,500 surveillance teams and 40 sample collection teams formed for the special drive, the district will soon reach its target of collecting 4,000 samples a day. Each surveillance team, which comprises three civil volunteers and at least one ASHA or other auxiliary health worker, conducts door-to-door surveys to collect information on people with symptoms of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). “ We have assigned 40 teams – each comprising one doctor, one nursing staff and one assistant – to collect samples of people with Covid-19 symptoms,” the DM said. The DM further said that around 600 student volunteers are also participating in awareness campaigns under the drive. “Volunteers from National Service Scheme (NSS), Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan, and National Cadet Corps (NCC) are also taking part in this drive. However, none of these volunteers will work on the frontline and their primary work would entail putting up posters outside the houses of positive patients and their direct contacts. For the screening purpose, we have deputed over 1,500 surveillance teams,” he said.The DM also said that the district health department is adapting the plan used to eradicate polio in its surveillance measures for the drive. “The pulse polio micro plan is a tested campaign with instructions from the World Health Organization. The features of the plan include pro-active surveillance of the population, estimating resources, recording and reporting cases, and strict monitoring. Till now, patients used to inform the district administration of their symptoms following which they would be tested. But under this new plan, we’ll reach out to every household and monitor every case,” he said.Under the drive, the DM said, that the surveillance teams will mark every screened household with the letter ‘S’ followed by the date when the occupants were screened. “ If someone is found suffering from prolonged illness or symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) or severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), the surveillance team will immediately inform the health officials to test them for Covid-19. If found positive, the patients will be admitted to isolation wards in different hospitals,” he said. The state government had planned the special drive for Meerut division after around 28% of the total Covid-19 related deaths were reported from the region.Till Thursday, out of the total 735 Covid-19 fatalities in the state, Meerut division has reported 207 deaths, including 87 in Meerut, 57 in Ghaziabad, 22 in Gautam Budh Nagar, 22 in Bulandshahr, 14 in Hapur and five in Baghpat. According to the instructions given by the state government, a daily target of collecting 4,000 samples each has been set Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad districts. Among other districts of the division, 3,000 samples will be taken every day in Meerut, while 1,600 samples will be tested in Bulandshahr, Baghpat and Hapur districts.Meanwhile, 116 fresh cases of Covid-19 were reported in the past 24 hours in the district, taking the overall count to 2,477 cases. District chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said 1,526, including three people discharged on Thursday, have recovered from the disease so far. “So far, 22 Covid-19 positive patients have so far lost their lives. As a result, the district now has 929 active cases,” he said.According to the daily Covid-19 bulletin released on Thursday by the state headquarters in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh had a total of 24,825 Covid-19 cases, including 817 new cases reported in the last 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-covid-19-surveillance-begins-in-district-90-of-daily-target-hit-on-first-day/story-VH4lVH9mMydJUepIKLCwXK.html
02-07-2020||Noida||Noida: District police dept plans drive to test all ‘vulnerable’ personnel||After a 57-year-old constable died of Covid-19 on June 27, the district police department has started a drive to test all cops suspected to be infected with the virus, as well as those with underlying health conditions or above the age of 50 years. Out of the 5,000-strong police force, about 500 have already undergone tests.“A total of 35 police personnel have tested positive so far in the district, out of which 29 have recovered and four are undergoing treatment at a hospital in Greater Noida. However, one constable died as he was diabetic. With the test drive we will test all cops who are above the age of 50 years and/or suffer with co-morbid conditions and influenza-like-illness (ILI). Our motive is to detect the disease early and start treatment quickly,” said Ankur Aggarwal, additional deputy commissioner of police, the nodal officer to handle Covid-related issues. On Wednesday and Friday, a total of 148 cops were administered RT-PCR and antigen tests. As the police are frontline workers in the fight against Covid, they are exposed to risks all the time. They are deployed in containment zones, handle daily cases where public interaction is unavoidable and perform other duties requiring dealing with public, said officials.“We have not fixed any date as to when we will conduct the tests but we have appealed to all cops via the radio system that anyone, regardless of age or health conditions, who feel they have symptoms, can come to Sector 108 headquarters and get their test done,” said Aggarwal.The police are making a list of all those who are above the age of 50 years and suffer from ailments like diabetes, hypertension or other such diseases.“We do not have exact data as to how many police personnel are above the age of 50 years. Therefore, we have spread the word of getting a Covid-19 test done. After the test, we will be ready with the data so that if in need, we can take timely decisions to treat the needy,” said Aggarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-district-police-dept-plans-drive-to-test-all-vulnerable-personnel/story-pZkP4xWEZyHVdToW6SlyZJ.html

02-07-2020||Noida||Noida: Salaries of GIMS faculty to be at par with Lucknow’s SGPGI, says UP minister||Salaries of all faculty members of the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) will be now be equal those of their counterparts at the Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI), Lucknow, said Suresh Kumar Khanna, the Uttar Pradesh minister for minister for finance, parliamentary affairs and medical education departments.While taking stock of preparedness in tackling the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic at GIMS, Khanna spoke to five infected patients lodged in the Institute’s isolation ward over the phone. “I am really happy to hear from them that they are getting the best treatment at GIMS. The hospitals treating Covid-19 patients will not have to worry about funds, as our government is taking all possible efforts to ensure maximum recovery rate of Covid-19 patients. I have asked the directors of GIMS and Specialty Paediatric Hospital and Post Graduate Teaching Institute (commonly known as Child PGI), to send their requisition for establishing additional 100 beds for Covid-19 patients in their hospitals,” he said.Appreciating the efforts of doctors working in the Covid-19 ward of GIMS, Khanna said their services can’t be equated with words or remunerations. “It is the selfless services given by the doctors that the fatality rate in UP is less than many smaller states. Since GIMS has performed exceptionally with its limited resources, the faculties here will soon get salaries equal to their counterparts in SGPGI,” he said.After learning that 451 Covid-19 patients have been cured and discharged, out of the 605 patients admitted so far in GIMS, the minister asked its director Dr Rakesh Gupta to enhance its capacity of beds from existing 150 to 250.Dr Gupta said that the minister’s words will boost the morale of all the staff. “Presently, the basic salary of a professor in SGPGI is around Rs 1,64,000, while in GIMS, it is about 1,40,000. If teachers here get salaries equal to their SGPGI counterparts, we can expect better faculties,” he said.When Dr Gupta informed the minister that several demands, including allotment of land for permanent premises of medical college and hospital, sanction of 18 post-graduate seats despite getting clearance from directorate of national board (DNB) and establishment of trauma centre and dialysis in the hospital are lying pending at the government level, the minister asked him send to the proposal again.Khanna also asked the director of Child PGI to send his hospital’s proposal of pending demands to the government. Despite repeated attempts, however, Child PGI director Dr DK Gupta could not be contacted for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-salaries-of-gims-faculty-to-be-at-par-with-lucknow-s-sgpgi-says-up-minister/story-j60Wqayy22rGBf5EYTJ7GO.html
02-07-2020||City||Low turnout of residents during first week of antigen testing in Ghaziabad||The turnout of people for Covid-19 antigen tests in Ghaziabad is at a dismal rate of about 32%, even as the health department had roped in seven teams which were expected to take up 6,300 samples in a span of six days, starting June 26. Health officials said the low turnout may affect their target of 4,000 tests per day, as directed for conduct during the special surveillance drive which started on July 2 on directions of the Uttar Pradesh government.Each of the seven teams, comprising two lab technicians and a lab assistant per team, has a capacity to conduct about 150 antigen tests per day. However, during the first six days of the drive, the teams could conduct only 2,056 tests. “Out of the 2,056 antigen tests conducted during the week, 126 positive turned out positive. The teams have a potential to conduct 150 tests per day but there was low turnout of residents from areas like Indirapuram, Mirzapur, Vijay Nagar and Vaishali, and the like. This scenario could also affect our testing for the special surveillance drive which started on July 2,” said an officer from the district health department, requesting anonymity.“There have been instances where the turnout of residents has been so low that some areas recorded a turnout of 12, while some recorded a turnout of 32, during the past two-three days. The teams had to sit idle and waited for residents to turn up,” the officer said.According to officials, what is worse is that out of the total 2,056 antigen tests conducted during the week, about 850 tests were conducted at district MMG Hospital and Women’ Hospital, said officials. This meant that only about 1,200 tests were conducted in residential areas where people were expected to arrive and participate in Covid-19 testing.“Testing during the first week has been low and we were expecting that more people will come and get themselves tested through antigen kits. We had already received 8,000 kits and 11,000 more arrived Thursday. So, during the surveillance drive, we are expecting that more tests will be taken up,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.“There were seven teams when antigen testing started on June 26. Now, we have added five more, to a total of 12. These include one team which will be deployed at MMG Hospital and Women’s Hospital each. We are also trying to rope in more lab technicians so that more testing can take place,” Dr Gupta added.On Thursday, on the other hand, a total of 1,765, tests – 775 antigen and 990 RT-PCR tests – were conducted across Ghaziabad, of which 34 came out positive.According to sources, one of the reasons the teams were able to conduct so many tests in a single day may be that they are testing all patients walking in to the Women’s Hospital and the MMG District Hospital, as well as their kin accompanying them.Residents’ welfare associations (RWA) and councillors, meanwhile, said that they have no information about antigen tests being taken up and no officials approached them so far.“We have no information about antigen testing taking place in our areas. Had RWAs been involved, they would have spread awareness in their highrises by putting up information on notice boards and would have urged residents to come forward. But there has been no information given to us about tests being conducted,” said Alok Kumar, founder member of federation of association of apartment owners.This was reiterated by Colonel (retired) TP Tyagi, the president of flat owners’ federation, who said: “We have not received any communication from the administration or the health department to help them out in the antigen test drive. It seems that officials have sidelined the RWAs. But it is evident that without peoples’ participation, no such initiatives will succeed.”“There is a trust deficit among residents and also fear of Covid-19 which is why they are not inclined to take up tests. They know that if they turn positive, they will be admitted directly to government hospitals, where facilities are inadequate. Above all, the administration should hold meetings with local councillors and take their help, as they can immensely help in bringing residents together for taking up tests,” said Rajendra Tyagi, councillor from Raj Nagar.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said officials were trying hard to achieve the target of 4,000 tests per day during the special surveillance drive.“To increase participation, we will be roping in RWAs, councillors and even NGOs to help create awareness among residents and to encourage them to come forward for testing for Covid-19. The surveillance drive is for the benefit of residents as early testing will help us detect cases early and take up proper treatment,” he added.Under the drive, the department has been given a target of conducting 1,000 RT-PCR tests and 3,000 antigen tests per day for 10 days, till July 12. For the purpose of surveillance, the district has deployed 2,029 surveillance teams, which shall take up household surveys to identify patients with co-morbid conditions such as influenza-like illness (ILI) or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). These teams have so far covered a total of 1,35,460 households in the district.z||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/low-turnout-of-residents-during-first-week-of-antigen-testing-in-ghaziabad/story-zQjgLLNKLOd9qgOcOQhJwL.html
02-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad extends curfew time by 1.5 hours, begins mass surveillance||With the rising number of Covid-19 cases, Citizens’ movement has been further curtailed in Ghaziabad with the district administration on Thursday bringing forward the time that prohibitory orders will be in place to between 7.30pm to 9am. The order will be in place till July 31.Earlier, the timings were between 9pm to 9am. Failure to comply with the orders that prohibit the gathering of four or more people, would attract penal action under relevant laws. Police have been told to strictly enforce the directive.The Uttar Pradesh government on June 30, while allowing district administrations to impose prohibitory orders as they saw fit, said the night time prohibitory orders in the six districts of Meerut division, which includes Ghaziabad and has a higher disease burden when compared to others, will be from 8pm to 6am while the rest of the state will observe it from 10pm to 5am. “The timing of the shops and business establishments has been revised in order to strictly enforce curfew. I have also directed the police to ensure that all station house officers (SHO) strictly enforce curfew and no one other than those involved in essential services be allowed to move during the night. The prohibitory orders have also been extended up to July 31,” district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said.The traders however said that despite the earlier curfew, Covid-19 cases have failed to come down in Ghaziabad.“The shops and markets are opening on alternate days on the directions of the district administration. In a month, one shop opens for just 12 days. This is affecting sales. On the other hand, liquor shops and malls are opening everyday. With the revised 7.30pm closing time, the traders will have to start winding up by 6.30pm so that they can also go back home before the curfew starts. We have been trying to urge administration to allow us opening on all days but nothing has happened so far. Infact Covid-19 cases have increased instead of getting decreased,” said Pradeep Gupta, convener of Vyapari Ekta Samiti – Indirapuram.The district magistrate declined to comment on whether businesses will be allowed to open on all days but said that all efforts were being taken to curb the rising number of Covid-19 cases.“The Union Home Minister on Thursday had met officials of Delhi-NCR and said that good practices prevailing in different areas should be adopted. We have also started a special surveillance drive and expect that more patients with influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (Sari) will be reported in the coming days,” Pandey added.ILI cases are those with symptoms of fever and cough, and SARI are ILI cases that require hospitalisation.First day of surveillanceOn the first day of the surveillance drive on Thursday, about 2,029 teams fanned out in different areas and identified 113 cases of ILI and SARI besides 2500 tests were also taken up.Under the drive each team was assigned to cover 75 houses per day and collect 4000 samples. Against the target of 152,175 houses, the officials said that teams covered only 135,460 houses. The district, as per official estimates, has about 1.2 million houses.The surveillance drive was initiated in five other districts too -- Gautam Budh Nagar, Hapur, Bulandshahr, Baghpat and Meerut, all which fall under the Meerut division. Nigrani Samitis (surveillance committees) in 2,375 rural areas and 1,516 in urban area inform officials about suspected cases and also about adherence to home quarantine norms.The chief minister directed for heightened surveillance activities in Meerut division. While the 1,531 teams were requrired to be formed in Gautam Budh Nagar, it was 2161 in Ghaziabad, 1398 in Meerut, 493 in Baghpat, 1356 in Bulandshahr and 545 in Hapur.“Total 7485 surveillance teams have been roped in under Meerut division and they will note down all the details of people having ILI and SARI symptoms so that early treatment can be taken up. The CM has also directed that 15,000 teams should be formed for surveillance. He has also directed that quarantine centres should be formed in every district where people with symptoms will be brought and later sent to Covid hospitals if they are found positive,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).The officials said that 121 helpdesks have come up in Gautam Budh Nagar, 135 in Ghaziabad, 233 in Meerut, 80 in Baghpat, 138 in Bulandshahr and 97 in Hapur. The help desks have facility of pulse oxymeter and infrared thermometers so that people can come and get themselves screened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-extends-curfew-time-by-1-5-hours-begins-mass-surveillance/story-w2LSp5UcRaven1Io1ENj6N.html
02-07-2020||Delhi||Electronics India gets notice for ‘damaging’ trees on Sardar Patel Marg||The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has issued a show-cause notice to the Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL) to “explain” any potential damage caused to trees on Sardar Patel Marg in Chanakyapuri during the road cutting work undertaken by the agency. According to NDMC officials, the ECIL was given permission for road cutting work on June 26 to lay underground cables for installing CCTV cameras along the route. However, after the work begun, it was brought to the notice of the municipal agency that the trenching (horizontal drilling) work to dig pits was being carried out near the tree line, with the result that it could have damaged or weakened the roots of full-grown trees. The municipal agency then issued a show-cause notice to ECIL on July 1.Following the notice, the ECIL Thursday stopped the digging work but its officials refused to comment on the matter.The matter was brought to the attention of the NDMC by a Delhi-based lawyer, who complained that the digging work was being carried out in violation of National Green Tribunal orders and sent a ‘cease and desist’ notice to both the NDMC and the ECIL. The complaint was also sent to the Delhi forest department. “We have written to the ECIL seeking an explanation on violating the conditions of the road-cutting permission as well as previous NGT orders. ECIL officials have intimated us that the work has been stopped for now. They will have to get the permission revalidated,” a senior NDMC official said, on the condition of anonymity.He added that the horticulture department has also been asked to assess the extent of damage, if any, caused to the trees. The stretch has a number of old and deep-rooted trees such as arjuna, jamun, ashoka and amaltas. There are also a few ficus, peepal, semal and exotic trees as well. As per the laid out conditions for road-cutting, trenchless/cutting/digging has to be carried out away from the trees to avoid any damage to the roots...full care shall be taken and if any damage is caused to any tree, the agency carrying out the work will be liable to pay compensation, the notice read.The NGT, in 2013, had asked all public authorities to de-concrete areas around trees and further directed that no kind of construction activity be allowed within a one-metre radius of the tree trunk.Also, trenching within a one-metre radius of the tree trunk, that may damage trees, is a violation of the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994.A senior forest official, who did not wish to be named, said, “A field verification of the site will be taken up. If any damage is found to the trees, a notice shall be sent to the agency and necessary action will be taken.”CR Babu, professor emeritus at the Centre for Environment Management of Degraded Ecosystems at Delhi University, said, “Trenching within the one-metre radius of the tree trunk can have an impact on the roots. The extent of damage depends on the width and depth of the trench and the kind of root the trees have. Since most trees on this stretch are deep-rooted, if the trench cuts into the roots, it can harm the supply of nutrients to the tree. These activities must be monitored well in order to save old and full-grown trees from potential damage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/electronics-india-gets-notice-for-damaging-trees-on-sardar-patel-marg/story-xvl7KOizPBHRPs5fvtXKyM.html
02-07-2020||Delhi||Private labs halting tests ‘not acceptable’: HC||The Delhi High Court on Thursday stated that private labs halting rapid antigen testing was “not acceptable... at such a critical juncture when the number of Covid-19 cases was shooting up phenomenally, on a day by day basis”. The court was responding to the Delhi government’s statement that private labs had stopped collecting samples for rapid antigen testing.Satyakam, the additional standing counsel (ASC) for the Delhi government told a bench comprising justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad that the Delhi government had written to all private labs individually seeking clarification as to whether they were continuing with the collection of samples for testing after it found that the number of tests had reduced.He said that most laboratories had denied halting rapid antigen testing and added that they had several grievances against the Delhi government, that had largely been resolved by the expert committee constituted by the Lieutenant Governor, Delhi.The court then said if any of the private labs had stopped sending phlebotomists to collect samples for testing for any reason, they must immediately respond to the Delhi government.The bench also said that the private labs should convey to the Delhi government if the expenses incurred by them are not covered by the rate fixed for the test by the Delhi government (₹2,400).ASC Satyakam told the court that a total of 68,041 tests have been conducted via the rapid antigen method from June 18 to June 23 at an average of about 11,350 per day. He said that the initial target of 20,000 per district daily was “quite ambitious” considering that the RT-PCR tests were also being conducted at the sample collection facility simultaneously.He told the court that 41,155 samples were collected within this period (Jun 18-23) through the RT-PCR method and hence a total of 1,09,196 samples had been collected in six days. He submitted that sero-surveillance had been started in Delhi on June 27 with a revised target of 21,793 rapid random samples to be collected across the state.He clarified that the sero-surveillance data will be collected up to July 5 and the results will be made public within one week thereafter.“…about 30 government hospitals have been provided user credentials in the past 24 hours to undertake the rapid antigen test, of which 20 government hospitals have started the process,” he said while proposing that the rapid antigen test be conducted for free at all government dispensaries.The court was hearing a plea by Sanjeev Sharma, through his counsel Rakesh Malhotra, who contended that there have been several instances wherein non-Covid patients needing surgery or other procedures were asked to undergo Covid-19 testing before that, but the hospital concerned did not do so stating they did not have the government’s permission.ASC Satyakam responded that a June 23 circular by ICMR stated that any private lab or hospital would have to approach the ICMR for obtaining authorisation to administer the rapid antigen test.The court asked ICMR to file a status report while also clarifying its stand on the grievance by the Delhi government that some tests undertaken by the private laboratories were not specific to Delhi but were from satellite cities and therefore, there was no clarity about the actual number of tests that were undertaken for residents of Delhi daily, for analysis.The court also asked the Delhi government to file a status report indicating the number of rapid antigen tests conducted from June 27 to July 5. The report has to be filed on or before July 13. The matter will be heard on July 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/private-labs-halting-tests-not-acceptable-hc/story-1RDYNyaVOu74imMqNxLe7M.html
02-07-2020||City||Plasma bank gets ready in just two days||New DelhiTwo days ago, the state-of-the-art convalescent plasma bank inaugurated at south Delhi’s Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) on Thursday was a store room. The hospital worked swiftly to add 10 beds and apheresis machines -- which separates the blood components and collects plasma – and get approval from Delhi’s drug controller before Thursday’s inauguration.This is India’s first plasma bank set up by the Delhi government to help Covid-19 patients in need of the therapy. “There is no vaccine for the disease, but initial results have shown plasma from recovered patients reduces mortality from Covid-19. People of Delhi were facing a lot of problems in getting plasma for corona patients. This bank will streamline the process,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said at the inauguration.“The idea of setting up a bank was floated so that people do not have to keeping calling people randomly or reach out to various organisations in times of need. Once it was decided, all the approvals came through quickly. We already have a very well-established apheresis programme so it wasn’t a challenge for us to start the bank in just two days,” said Dr Meenu Bajpai, faculty-in-charge of the department of transfusion medicine at ILBS.All Covid-19 hospitals under the Delhi government will counsel patients at the time of discharge and get their consent to donate plasma after 14 days. A team will also call those under home isolation to ask them to donate plasma.So far, 63,007 people have recovered from the infection in the city.Convalescent plasma therapy uses a blood component called plasma, containing virus-fighting antibodies, from a person who has recovered from the infection. When given to a patient with Covid-19, it should help their immune system fight the virus.Vinay Prakash, 29, a staff nurse from the endoscopy department of ILBS hospital, lay on a recliner chair attached to a machine that circulated his blood to extract a bag of pale yellow liquid.Prakash got the infection and recovered without any symptoms on June 1. “My sample was collected along with the other staff members as part of the routine screening and I tested positive. Had I not been tested, I would not even have realised I had the infection. And now, I can save someone’s life,” said Prakash, who was among the donors on the very first day. The hospital said 10 people came in to donate plasma on Thursday.For Ajay Arya, 48, a teacher from a Delhi government school, the 25-km journey from West Vinod Nagar to ILBS meant nothing. He knew he would be saving two lives if he donated his plasma. The apheresis machine collects about 500 ml of plasma from each donor, whereas patients need only about 200 ml.“I had recovered from the infection in the first week of June. So, when I got a call from the Delhi government, I was not surprised. I was told that I could save two people with the plasma I donate. I did not even need to think twice,” Arya said.A reception area with the words ‘Delhi Plasma Bank’ greets people at the main building. There are two separate queues for donors and people in need of plasma. To reach the plasma bank, the recovered Covid-19 patients take the elevator to the second floor. To maintain social distance, only four people, facing the four corners of the elevator, can ride at once.“This is a non-Covid hospital and we screen everyone coming in to ensure nobody carries the infection in. This should put the mind of people who have recovered from the infection at ease,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, ILBS. The fear of getting the infection again has been one of the challenges that hospitals have been facing in getting donors.A small trial conducted at Delhi’s biggest Covid19 hospital, Lok Nayak, showed an improved respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score that predicts ICU mortality. Duration of ICU stay as well as hospital stay was also less in patients who were given convalescent plasma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/plasma-bank-gets-ready-in-just-two-days/story-nsOXm8WlYTFpsygTDF6F2N.html

This is a part of a larger crackdown plan of the Haryana Police that was put into effect in December 2019. According to the police, this is the biggest action taken so far against illegal mining groups operating in the two districts over the past two decades. According to police officials, during the period of the lockdown, 50 cases were registered against vehicle owners for transporting illegal mining material and a fine of ₹1.5 crore imposed on them. Although illegal mining operations have been taking place in the Aravallis for over two decades, it was in November 2019 that senior IPS officer Amitabh Singh Dhillon, who was also the director-general of mines and geology department of Haryana, put together an enforcement team to crack down on illegal mining operations in the Aravallis. The state was divided into two parts and two police officials were given charge of each. While assistant commissioner of police(ACP) Rajesh Phogat was given the charge of the Sonepat region, ACP Preet Pal Sangwan was given the task of curbing illegal mining in Gurugram and Nuh. According to the police, illegal mining is most active in Nuh and Gurugram. The areas that are particularly notorious for illegal mining include villages of Pipaka, Panchgaon, Raina, Tapkan, and Dhulawat villages — all of which fall under the Tauru belt.In December 2019, Preet Pal Sangwan formed a team of 25 police officers, who were given the task of tracking the movement of vehicles illegally transport mining material from Aravallis to various construction sites and crusher zones in the region. “The teams have increased surveillance in the area and have roped in local informers, who are actively passing information regarding movement of vehicles at night,” he said. The police have also involved forest officials and locals to carry out the mapping of the areas from where the maximum numbers of illegal mining cases are being reported.The state has so far collected a total fine of ₹29 crore since December 2019. A total of 1,400 vehicles, including tippers, trucks, tractor-trolleys, and earthmovers, have been seized by the police between December 2019 and June 30, 2020. This number also includes 350 vehicles seized in June — the highest so far. “The National Green Tribunal(NGT) had ordered in 2019 that all vehicles that are confiscated will be released only after recovery of at least 50% of the showroom value of such vehicles. Besides, the confiscated vehicle owner will also have to pay a royalty fee, the value of the mineral loaded on the vehicles, along with ₹10,000 fine before the vehicle can be released,” said Sangwan, adding that the state has been suffering severe revenue losses because of the illegal mining activity in the Aravallis. The police added during the course of the operation, several police officers have been attacked by truck drivers carrying illegal mining material. Over two dozen cases of attempted murder have been registered against the driver over the last six months. Sangwan said there have been instances where the drivers have even opened the back of the trucks to unload mining material from moving vehicles on the road to stop the police from chasing them“Recently one of the drivers even turned the dumper turtle due to which a police officer was severely injured and is currently undergoing treatment,” he said.These vehicles were found transporting a wide range of construction material, including bajri, sand, boulder, gatka, gravel, and other items without obtaining a requisite e-rawaana, or an e-transit pass. Apart from vehicles transporting illegal mining material, earthmovers were found engaged in excavation activities.Narender Bijarnia, the superintendent of police, Nuh, said they too have formed teams and increased intelligence in the areas where illegal mining is taking place. “We have set up nakas(check posts) and are taking the help of local informers to stop the illegal mining in areas falling under the Tauru region,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/crackdown-on-illegal-mining-in-the-aravallis-cops-seize-350-trucks-in-june/story-9JMH9vQkY0PNxikvL7IgHN.html
02-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram doubling-rate now among slowest among India’s worst-hit districts||In three weeks, Gurugram’s Covid-19 doubling-rate has improved from seven days (on June 11) to 36.5 days (on July 1). Health department officials attributed this slowing of new cases to four main interventions —increase in testing and quicker turnaround time in reporting results, door-to-door screening in containment zones and large outbreak regions, improved contact tracing, and strengthening of home isolation facilities.Gurugram last had a doubling-rate of 36 days in the last week of April. By June 11, cases were doubling every seven days, fastest among India’s 20 worst affected districts (by reported case load). As of Wednesday, however, only four out of India’s 20 worst affected districts had doubling-rates slower than Gurugram’s — Mumbai (43 days), Ahmedabad (67 days), Jaipur (69.5) and Indore (79 days) -- according to an independent analysis conducted by www.paragkar.com/covid19, using data sourced from Covid19India.org, a public dashboard updated daily on the basis of state health bulletins. Hindustan Times has not been able to independently corroborate this analysis for districts other than Gurugram. Dr Ram Prakash, district epidemiologist, Gurugram, said, “For the last two weeks we have been testing more than 900 samples daily on an average. Test results are coming back from the lab within 24 hours. So we are able to isolate positive cases quicker. Earlier, test results were taking anything between 36 to 48 hours and we were not able to isolate positive cases quickly enough.” Prakash added that extensive screening in containment zones for Covid-19 symptoms has helped curb transmission of the virus in badly hit areas.The slowing down of the spread is reflected in other data points as well. During the first two weeks of June, Gurugram had an average test-positivity rate of 51 percent, with 373 tests on average daily. In the second half of the month, the test-positivity rate reduced to 12.4 %, while testing increased to 925 tests per day. The average number of new positives also reduced from 190 cases per day, to 114 new cases per day.Dr Jai Prakash, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Program’s district surveillance officer in Gurugram, said, “We have also had an internal restructuring after the appointment of a new chief medical officer on June 12. Duties have been reorganised, so officers who were overburdened are getting more support.” Though unable to provide any data, Prakash said, “Contact tracing has been strengthened. We are tracing a higher number of contacts per patient now than a month ago, which is another factor in slowing the growth of new cases.”However, experts warned that the apparent improvement in Gurugram’s Covid-19 response should be viewed with an important caveat. “Targeted sampling for RT-PCR tests has slowed down. Private labs are still collecting the bulk of samples from Gurugram, while antigen tests have been confined to large outbreak regions. There may still be cases outside of these areas which aren’t being picked up. We will not know until the health department starts collecting more samples for confirmatory tests,” said Dheeraj Singh, a city-based data scientist tracking the district and state level Covid-19 data.Rajesh Kumar, an epidemiologist and former professor of community medicine at PGIMS, Chandigarh, concurred. “Slower doubling rate and lower TPR is desirable. It could mean that your interventions are working, but on the other hand maybe the right people are not being tested anymore. If that is the case, then Gurugram may see another surge in cases during the next two weeks.”Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-doubling-rate-now-among-slowest-among-india-s-worst-hit-districts/story-T43K0orSSVWjCo0SqQ62OP.html

Police said they have filed an inquest report under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and no complaint had been lodged so far.According to the police, the incident was reported around 10am when other workers arrived at the site. Police said the victims have been identified as Girish Yadav, 24, and Manoj, 28, both from Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh.A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “The victims had been contracted for some digging work to lay pipelines for a washroom at a plot. They were working on Wednesday night. Prima facie, it is suspected that while handling a drilling machine, they suffered an electric shock due to some technical fault in the power line.”Police said they have informed the family members of the victims, who are on their way to the city.On May 27, a 34-year-old man, who worked as a lineman for a private company, was allegedly electrocuted while repairing a technical fault at a power cable in Kanhai village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-two-workers-die-of-electrocution-at-sec-15-construction-site/story-fgudyLF7b8uOd4w3GL8BaK.html
02-07-2020||City||Delhi sets up 12-member panel to set Capital on road to economic recovery||New Delhi: The Delhi government has formed a 12-member expert committee to explore economic reform measures to help businesses in the city recover from the impact of Covid-19, the government said in a statement on Thursday.In an interview with HT earlier this week, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said the state government’s GST and VAT collections in the first quarter of the year dropped to one-third of what it was in the same period last year, falling from ₹7,275 crore to ₹2,500 crore.As per an order, signed by Ravi Dhawan, special CEO of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), the committee will analyse the measures to be taken by various agencies, departments and businesses, and explore moves that improve the ease of doing business and shorten the process of economic recovery from the impact of the pandemic.The committee will be headed by Jasmine Shah, vice-chairperson of the Dialogue and Development Commission (DDC), an advisory body to the Delhi government. The committee will also be comprised of commissioners of the labour department and industries department, South Delhi Municipal Corporation, special secretary of the environment department, and representatives of various industries including trade, manufacturing, automobile, finance and hospitality among others, said the statement.Shah said, “The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a devastating economic impact — nationally and in Delhi… Through this committee, we look forward to collaborating with key industry representatives and identifying specific additional measures that government agencies can take to shorten the process of economic recovery.”According to the DDMA’s order, “The committee shall explore reform measures that improve ease of doing business in Delhi and shorten the process of economic recovery from the impact of Covid-19.”The order further said, “The committee shall explore the possibility of renewal or automatic extension of existing licenses issued by various department and local bodies… without penalty or interest. The exception will be in categories such as excise, pollution control, or fire, where safety or revenue-related issues are involved.”“The committee shall explore the requirement or necessity of new licenses or NOCs [no-objection certificates] issued by the various departments to identify licenses that can be abolished or replaced with only prior intimation,” the order read.This committee will also explore provisions of online license issuing systems or doorstep delivery of licensing systems. The key focus of the committee will be exploring economic reform measures that have the potential for revenue mobilisation for the Delhi government.“The committee should explore international best practices that mega-cities and countries around the world are taking to enable economic recovery from Covid-19. The committee shall also examine and suggest penalties or fines or interest imposed on public or business due to the pandemic, which can be waived off to remove undue financial hardship,” the order read.Jayati Ghosh, professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University, said, “At this juncture, an expert committee to explore economic reforms can play an important role. It is high time for Delhi to have an urban employment guarantee scheme. The committee can play important role in such policy drafting. The committee can also formulate more labour-intensive activities in the days to come.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-sets-up-12-member-panel-to-set-capital-on-road-to-economic-recovery/story-hLzzVvtFBQj0HutmYSziTM.html
02-07-2020||Gurugram||In Dundahera outbreak zone, commuters flout rules at will||The district administration’s plan of intensive Covid-19 testing along with strict curbs on movement of people in eight large outbreak regions (LORs) of the city for 15 days, seems to have fallen flat in Dundahera.The enforcement of guidelines in Dundahera, one of the eight large outbreak areas, remained lax on Thursday with locals trespassing barricades in certain designated lanes in the area. Shops remained open and people continued to move freely with little care for the norms in place. According to a list issued by the district administration last week, four areas — Udyog Vihar police station road, Aggarwal Sweets lane, community centre street, Vishal Mega Mart street — in Dundahera ward number 4, had been listed among the large outbreak regions. Padav Chowk was also among the list of areas where police deployment was suggested. Over 90 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in Dundahera since the outbreak of the pandemic.On Thursday, at the community centre street, no barricading was found with some residents claiming that commuters had removed the barricading on Tuesday itself, the day it was put up, to facilitate movement of vehicles. In the lane adjacent to Vishal Mega Mart, several shops selling utensils remained open, with people often spotted jumping over the barricades, which had been partially removed. People trespassed the bamboo obstacles in the lane next to Aggarwal sweets as well. Locals said that some of these lanes had been barricaded from one side only, leaving the other entry/exit point open for movement. Apart from the check point outside Udyog Vihar police station, the barricading and fortification using bamboo poles, remained inadequate, allowing people to easily pass. Four policemen from Udyog Vihar police station had been deputed at Padav Chowk and near the community centre street.Subhash Yadav, a native of Deoria, Uttar Pradesh, had come for house hunting near Padav Chowk. “I have moved here recently for a job and I am looking for a room on rent. I was not aware that this area has reported several cases of Covid-19 and that all activity had been restricted here for the next two weeks. I was not subjected to any screening before entering the area,” yadav said.Narender Tiwari, a private company security guard, said, “The police have been making rounds but commuters barely seem to care for the rules. They remove barricades at will if they have to pass through.”A policeman from Udyog Vihar police station, requesting anonymity, said, “We had after consultations suggested five points in Dundahera where barricading could be done as part of the large outbreak region containment strategy. Some of the barricading has been inadequate and we are sensitising people in the area to not venture out while testing is being conducted.”Jitender Gahlawat, assistant commissioner of police, Udyog Vihar, said, “We are conducting regular patrolling in the areas. If any laxity is observed, we will conduct a mapping exercise and depute additional staff to enforce the guidelines.”As per the government order issued last week, a large outbreak is defined as a localised increase in Covid-19 cases within a defined geographical area in a village, a town or a city. The cases may or may not be epidemiologically linked. For operational purposes, a large outbreak is deemed to be present when there are 15 or more cases.Despite several attempts, Ashok Sangwan, divisional commissioner, could not be reached for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/in-dundahera-outbreak-zone-commuters-flout-rules-at-will/story-RhMEb5maGwllpUJHwdoBBP.html

The areas which might see power outages include Palam Vihar, Sector 23, Udyog Vihar phases 4 and 5, Chauma, Carterpuri, Sector 23 A and several areas around the ammunition depot, said Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigan (DHBVN) officials.Power supply is likely to remain affected from 9am in the morning to 4pm in the evening, said Omender Bhardwaj, sub-divisional officer, Sector 18, DHBVN.Bhardwaj said that a scheduled maintenance activity is required on the high tension line and it will be carried out by HVPN. “A proposal in this regard had been put up and given the weather conditions, it is important that it is carried out,” he said.The supply will be affected in areas under Palam Vihar sub-station, Sector 23-A sub-station and another located in Sector 18.Bhardwaj also said that all efforts would be made to resume power supply by 3pm but added that they are keeping a cushion of one hour. “We have already sent messages to consumers and informed them of the scheduled activity so that they are prepared for the day,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/7-hr-power-outages-likely-today-in-parts-of-city-due-to-repairs/story-lvQbUu1HyBj3JfF0pbNPtI.html
02-07-2020||Gurugram||City bus service receives lukewarm response on first day of operations||On the first day of resumption of operations since the district went into a lockdown on March 24, the Gurugaman city bus service saw a lukewarm response with minimal ridership on key routes, particularly those plying to and from Metro stations. While ridership numbers for the day had not been compiled until late on Thursday evening, officials in the Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus Limited(GMCBL) estimated that there were no more than 150 to 200 commuters per route throughout the day. On two of the six operational routes (from Basai to Huda City Centre, and from Gurugram bus stand to Sikanderpur Metro), buses were seen travelling with merely a passenger or two. While all commuters were thermal scanned to check for fever, no hand sanitiser was provided. Drivers and conductors were all seen wearing masks and some were wearing gloves. Only in one instance, on the Basai to Huda City Centre route was a conductor seen not wearing a mask when interacting with commuters. A bus driver on the Huda City Centre to Basai route, requesting anonymity, said that internal routes had fared better on Thursday. “Earlier, the busiest routes were the ones going to the Metro stations. Huda City Centre used to get a high footfall, but not more than 10 people have boarded from there today,” he said. On other routes, such as Gurugram bus stand to Sohna, and Rajesh Pilot Chowk to Gurugram railway station, a Hindustan Times team observed slightly greater number of passengers — up to 10 travelling in a single vehicle.Vanita Akhaury, spokesperson, GMCBL, said, “We are only operating with one fourth of our fleet right now, around 68 buses. The number of buses, routes and the frequency of buses will be revised next week based on public response and feedback.” While Akhaury did not speculate about the day’s ridership numbers, a senior administration official in the GMCBL, said, “There were six routes operational today which, by afternoon, had serviced about 100 to 150 commuters each. Ridership would not have been very high in the evening, so the overall ridership would be quite low. We will have to wait till tomorrow (Friday) to see how we fared.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-bus-service-receives-lukewarm-response-on-first-day-of-operations/story-FL6zxXsCUF7L9Iu8OAF6xL.html

HSVP officials said they will now issue occupation certificates, sanction building plans, allow transfer of property and complete other formalities, as required under regulations.The court had granted stay to a land owner on July 18 last year after he petitioned for maintaining status quo and sought the release of the land under Section 24 (2) of the Land Acquisition Act 2013, stating that the acquisition carried out by the authority was in violation of rules.HSVP officials at that time had said that they would approach the court and seek relief on behalf of plot owners, as many of them had already constructed houses and bought plots following all norms. They had however stopped the development of these properties, as per the court order.In light of court directions, there was no development or construction carried out on these plots for almost one year, said officials. “The situation is going to change now and all owners will be allowed to build their houses, their building plans will be sanctioned and other utilities will be allowed operations,” said Hari Singh Jakhar, sub-divisional engineer, HSVP.It may be noted that acquisition of land in Sector 57 started in 2000 and majority of the land falls in Wazirabad village. The ownership of the plots was offered from 2004.The plots in question are of different sizes, such as four marlas (121 square yards), 10 marlas (302.5 square yards) and one kanal (605 square yards).Landowners in Wazirabad, who petitioned the court, argued that acquisition of their land was faulty as the compensation paid to them was quite less. They also wanted the authority to pay fair compensation and enhancement. It is to be noted that HSVP is under a loan burden of around Rs 20,000 crore and authorities are trying to sell residential plots and commercial properties and settling legal issues with plot owners to reduce the financial burden on the authority. In a recent meeting, the HSVP was asked to recover encroached-upon land and put it on auction, officials said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-relief-to-hsvp-plot-owners-in-sec-57-as-hc-allows-development/story-lH2uxHlhTvnXH83quAS3ZM.html
02-07-2020||Gurugram||Health department serves notice to 7 private labs for not collecting contact details||The district health department on Thursday served notices to seven private labs in the city for their alleged failure to comply with government regulations and collect complete contact details of suspected patients submitting their samples for Covid-19 testing.According to health department officials, at least 100 Covid-19 positive cases — who had given samples for Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) in private diagnostic labs — have not been traced or contacted due to incomplete addresses.The lack of contact tracing due to incomplete addresses has come across as a major challenge for Gurugram’s healthcare officials, who have been trying to contain the spread of Covid-19 cases that have been on the rise since May this year. The city has reported 5,569 cases till now, of which 1,183 are active and 4,290 have recovered. The death toll stands at 96.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “The department has issued notice to seven private labs for not noting down complete details of patients coming for RT-PCR test. Due to lack of contact details in over 100 Covid-19 cases, it has become difficult to trace patient and their contacts. This affects the overall surveillance to break the chain of transmission.”Earlier this month, five other labs had been served similar notices. Yadav said that there has been a slight improvement in the functioning of private labs since then. The diagnostic labs are required to feed the details of the suspected patients on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Health officials have seen that there are incomplete entries, sometimes with mandatory columns not being filled. In many entries, there are wrong, missing or incomplete addresses. Some cases have permanent addresses of a particular district, details of which have been taken from Aadhaar card or other ID proof, but the patient is found not to be residing in that particular address. Taking note of the issue, state health minister Anil Vij had on June 2 written to the Union health ministry stating that private labs were not sharing full details of the patients, resulting in delay in contact tracing and surveillance activities. The director general of health services also issued notices to 18 labs in Delhi for taking samples from Haryana without any imitation to district or state authorities. Currently, the Union ministry of health and family welfare has been stressing upon the Three T — Test-Track-Treat — strategyf or early detection and containment of the outbreak. It has advised that states must ensure full capacity utilization of all Covid-19 testing laboratories, including the private ones. The ICMR has recommended that laboratories should be free to test any individual as per guidelines for testing a Covid-19 patient and state authorities cannot stop an individual from getting tested. In Gurugram, testing has been ramped up in the last couple of weeks with more than 1,000 samples being collected daily. On Thursday, at least 1,648 samples were collected —501 by private and 1,147 by government labs — for both RT-PCR and antigen detection test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-department-serves-notice-to-7-private-labs-for-not-collecting-contact-details/story-hPFFihiiQV2zw99gOpa5cN.html

These services include the issuance of driving licences and registration of vehicles. In order to maintain social distancing and prevent overcrowding, only 100 tokens are being issued to applicants on a first-come, first-served basis. The Antodaya Saral Kendra delivers more than 500 citizen-centric services through a single-window system. However, the portal was temporarily closed on March 24, when a nationwide lockdown was imposed to fight the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). District administration officials said with the unlocking process currently underway, the authorities have decided to resume a few of the services in a controlled manner. These services include vehicle registration and issuance of driving licences.Officials said all formalities related to issuance and renewal of driving licences and vehicle registration will be carried out at the Saral Kendra between 9am to 12pm daily. All applicants visiting the office would need to wear masks, follow social distancing protocols and sanitise their hands before entering the office at the Mini Secretariat building. Prior to the lockdown, the Saral Kendras across the state were delivering as many as 546 citizen-centric services of the Haryana government to people. All these services would be resumed in a phased manner, although the details are yet to be worked out, said officials. “The citizens who are coming to the Saral Kendra are being given tokens from counter number 2. All norms pertaining to social distancing and sanitisation are being followed. All applicants must wear masks and if anyone is found without one, he or she will not be allowed inside the premises. Necessary action as per the law will be taken against violators,” said Jitender Kumar, sub-divisional magistrate, Gurugram. Officials also said that stickers and posters have been pasted all across the Saral Kendra, asking people to maintain social distancing and refrain from touching anything unnecessarily. The main focus, as per district administrative officials, is to ensure that work is carried out while minimising the risk of spreading Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/saral-kendra-resumes-operations-in-gurugram-to-register-vehicles-issue-driving-licences/story-nOteuOHCr6Xq46WlhEjiXM.html

They are now being converted into dedicated Covid health centres (DCHC) with oxygen beds and dedicated Covid hospitals (with ICU beds) (DCH).Currently, 174 of the existing ICU beds are vacant, recording 88% occupancy. This is relatively better than the scenario is April and May, when ICU beds had 99% occupancy, and critical patients had to wait for up to even a few hours to find ICU beds. These beds are usually needed for severe to critical Covid-19 patients. With the fatality rate in Mumbai at 5.8%, having sufficient ICU beds is crucial. As per data up to June 30, there are 957 critical Covid-19 patients in Mumbai, at approximately 3% of Mumbai’s active cases.BMC floated an expression of interest (EOI) last week, inviting bidders to provide these beds and maintain them for at least six months. Of the six jumbo facilities, the one at National Sports Complex of India (NSCI) currently has 10 ICU beds. As per the latest EOI, NSCI will have 50 ICU beds. The highest number of ICUs will be at the jumbo facility at NESCO compound in Goregaon (250), followed by BKC ground, Bandra (112), and 100 beds each at the facility at CIDCO Ground at Mulund, and Dahisar.As part of the bid, the contractor will have to provide staff for management of the ICU facility, including one senior and one associate consultants, six resident doctors, 10 nurses, two technicians, and eight support staff, for care of a Covid-19 patient, for every 10 ICU beds. A separate cost head has been created under BMC’s budget 2020-2021 to keep track of expenditure on jumbo facilities, and each facility has been given a ‘cost centre’. P Velarasu, additional municipal commissioner in charge of projects in BMC, said, “In case of cost centres, accounting is done for a specific geographical unit. As jumbo facilities are newly created, they have been given cost centres. We can identify the expenditure incurred by a specific facility by looking at the cost centre.” So far, BMC has spent a total of ₹630 crore on Covid-19 relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/6-jumbo-covid-facilities-to-get-612-icu-beds/story-zxZ6yd72ldQTf4hC8hNieN.html

Merchant received his air ticket on Wednesday around 2.40pm (EST) from the embassy after verifying his bank details.Merchant had written to the Indian Consulate after he lost his job, and his employment authorisation document was nearing expiry on July 12. The Byculla resident had gone to the US in 2017 to pursue a master’s degree in information technology and had been working there since.When Merchant had initially approached the Indian Consulate in New York, he was recommended to fly back on June 29. However, Air India had asked him to pay $1,361 (₹1,02,929) for his ticket and to contact the Indian Consulate if he wanted the charges waived off due to his financial crisis.He then tweeted to the Indian Consulate for help and was directed to explain his case via email. Merchant submitted that he did not have money to pay his home rent for July and would be unable to afford the flight ticket. After sending them the email on Friday night, the Consulate swung into action and replied on Sunday, June 28, asking him to submit his bank statements and salary slips. On Wednesday, July 1, Merchant received a soft copy of his flight ticket from the Indian embassy.“I first got a call from Air India on Wednesday informing me that the Consulate has borne the cost of my air ticket and that I am booked for the flight scheduled on July 3.

02-07-2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan setting up system for checking quality of Punjab water||The Rajasthan government is installing quality monitoring systems for water from Sutlej and Beas rivers from Punjab that comes through the Harike Barrage, said officials.Indira Gandhi Nahar, Sirhind Feeder and Bikaner Canal carry water from Harike Barrage to border districts in Rajasthan – Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh, Bikaner, Jaisalmer and Barmer – for irrigation and drinking.Rajasthan has long been complaining about polluted water coming from Punjab. Punjab has made efforts to treat industrial effluent and sewage flowing into the two rivers upstream of the barrage.Now, Rajasthan will install real-time water quality monitoring system (RTWQMS) on Indira Gandhi Nahar near Rajasthan-Haryana border and on Bikaner Canal near Rajasthan-Punjab border in six months.“We have floated tenders and bids will open next week,” said Rajasthan water resources department (WRD) secretary Naveen Mahajan. “Work will be completed in six months and will help us get real-time data on the quality of water coming from Punjab,” he added.He said the monitoring system data will be sent to State Pollution Control Board, WRD and public health and engineering department (PHED), which supplies piped drinking water. “The PHED will be able to treat the water on the basis of data about pollutants before supply for drinking,” Mahajan said.The monitoring system will generate information related to pH, tubidity, conductivity, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, bio-chemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved ammonia, nitrates and chlorides. “This will reflect in pollution control board, WRD and Hanumangarh control room every hour,” the WRD secretary said.According to WRD officials, polluted water of Ludhiana flows into Sutlej through Buddha Nala; and industrial effluent and sewage from Jallandhar, Nakodar and Phagwara get into the river through Kaliban. Sutlej and Beas meet in the upstream of Harika Barrage.People’s organisations in Sriganganagar and Hanumangarh districts have held several protests over polluted water coming from Punjab, which causes water-borne diseases. In April 2019, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot wrote to his Punjab counterpart, Captain Amarinder Singh, for supply of clean water to the state.Punjab has set up 69 sewage treatment plants in the catchement areas of Sutlej and Bear rivers, and five more are under construction. Two CEPTs have also been set up for industrial effluent. The Punjab government alsoplans to start75 STPs in villages in the Sutlej catchment area; construction of four of these is complete.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-setting-up-system-for-checking-quality-of-punjab-water/story-34qoylOCdUonhyxtzcfsaO.html
02-07-2020||Chandigarh||PUNJAB DGP APPOINTMENT ROW: HC asks UPSC to submit chart on process for names considered in last five years||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday directed the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to produce a chart detailing about process on candidates considered by it for the appointment of director general of police (DGP) in the last five years across India.The direction came during resumed hearing of a batch of petitions in which Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta has challenged Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) order quashing his appointment. The high court bench of justice Jaswant Singh and justice Sant Parkash was hearing an application from another DGP-rank officer, Mohammad Mustafa, who had sought early hearing of the matter.The high court has asked UPSC to produce the chart regarding the consideration made by it for the post of the DGP of different states in the last five years depicting as to how many officers were eligible as per 2009 guidelines for each of such consideration and how many such officers were called for/considered for empanelment in each such consideration. It has also been asked to submit whether the zone of consideration was restricted/regulated as per the relevant department of personnel and training (DoPT) guidelines and what was the inter-se seniority of the empanelled officers among the officers eligible as per 2009 guidelines. The information is to be submitted with supporting documents. The UPSC has also been told to compile the chart showing the comparative merit of all officers considered for the post of the Punjab DGP on adopted criteria.The UPSC has also been asked to state about the number fixed for zone of consideration for the empanelment of eligible officers and if there is no number fixed for the zone of consideration as per 2009 guidelines then whether the DoPT guidelines and instructions were followed to regulate the zone of consideration. Further it has asked to submit if the DoPT guidelines and instructions are not followed what is the process followed by UPSC for restricting/ regulating the zone of consideration; and if there is no restriction for the zone of consideration, then whether all officers eligible as per 2009 guidelines are required to be considered irrespective of their number.The UPSC has been directed to state that whether it asks for the forwarding of the list of all the officers eligible as per the guidelines or leaves it to the discretion of the state to forward and send the list of eligible officers. The UPSC has been told that the pan India practice regarding the number of officers in the zone of consideration for empanelment as DGP be shared.It was on January 21 that the high court had stayed the CAT order. Earlier, the CAT had quashed the February 2019 appointment of Gupta, observing that the procedure adopted by the empanelment committee and the UPSC for preparing the panel violated the Supreme Court judgment in the Parkash Singh case. Besides, Mustafa, another officer Siddharth Chattopadhyaya too has challenged Gupta’s appointment. A 1987-batch IPS officer, Gupta had superseded five senior officers for the post on February 7, 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-dgp-appointment-row-hc-asks-upsc-to-submit-chart-on-process-for-names-considered-in-last-five-years/story-OB9uEsdHafWQUQDoPtsxDO.html
02-07-2020||City||Centre to decide on deporting foreign Jamaat attendees: Supreme Court||New Delhi: Deportation of foreign nationals against whom criminal proceedings have been initiated for attending the Tablighi Jamaat congregation during mid-March in Delhi will be at the discretion of the central government, the Supreme Court orally observed on Thursday while granting liberty to such foreigners to make representation before the Centre to send them back to their home countries.The bench headed by justice AM Khanwilkar made the observation during the hearing of a plea by 34 foreign nationals from various countries, who have challenged revocation of their visas, stating they had not indulged in any serious offence and had attended the gathering before lockdown restrictions were put in place. The petitioners made a vehement appeal for their deportation.“They cannot be deported if there are criminal cases pending (against them). It will be the central government’s discretion”, the bench, which also comprised justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna, orally remarked.In an affidavit submitted before the Supreme Court on Wednesday, the central government said that deportation and grant of visas cannot be claimed as a right and foreign nationals can be let go only after legal process under the criminal laws is completed. The Centre also pointed out that individual orders have been issued cancelling the visas of the foreign Tablighi Jamaat members.It was submitted by the Centre that 205 FIRs have been filed against foreign Tablighi Jamaat members in 11 states and 2,765 foreigners have been blacklisted.“Grant of visa is a sovereign function of the centre. There is no right to be deported. Deportation can be allowed if there is no criminal case. There are criminal charges pending against them,” solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the central government, told the court.The apex court eventually adjourned the matter for July 10 to enable the petitioners to file a rejoinder to the Centre’s affidavit.“The pendency of these writ petitions will be no impediment for the concerned petitioners to make representation to the department/competent authority for deporting/sending them back to their respective countries. That representation may be considered by the authority on its own merits and in accordance with law”, the court said in its order.Delhi’s Nizamuddin was sealed on March 30 after it came to light that several people, who had attended a religious event held in March in the area by a Muslim organisation called Tablighi Jamaat, were found to be infected with coronavirus. At least 16,500 people had visited Tablighi Jamaat’s headquarters in Nizamuddin between March 13 and 24.The Union Home Ministry (MHA) had initially, in April, blacklisted 960 foreign nationals who had attended the religious event.The Centre, in its affidavit, claimed the foreign nationals who participated in the Tablighi Jamaat event violated provisions of visa rules and the Foreigners Act since they had arrived in India on limited tourist visas and Tablighi Jamaat activities were not covered by tourist visas.“The petitioners did not seek any specific permission from the Ministry of Home Affairs for engaging in activities in the nature of Tablighi activities. Therefore, it is a clear case of violation of visa conditions”, the affidavit said.The Centre specifically highlighted the provisions of visa manuals that have been updated from time to time, the latest being in 2019.According to para 1.25 of the visa manual of 2019, foreign nationals granted any type of visa shall not be permitted to engage themselves in Tablighi work unless they are granted specific permissions for the same by the Ministry of Home Affairs, the affidavit highlighted. Further, the Foreigners Act criminalises violation of visa conditions. Section 14 of the Foreigners Act makes provision for a jail term of upto 5 years if a person does any act in violation of the conditions of visa issued to him for entry and stay in India.“Apart from that, these foreigners might have violated the provisions of National Disaster Management Act (NDMA) and the Epidemic Diseases Act (EDA)”, the affidavit added.The central and state governments had imposed lockdown and other restrictions to check the spread of Covid-19, invoking the power granted under the NDMA and EDA.“Deportation of foreign Tablighi Jamaat members have not been done till date to ensure completion of legal process going on against them. All such foreign nationals against whom cases have been registered will be deported as soon as the legal processes are completed”, the affidavit said.‘Please deport us’The petitioners through their counsel CU Singh made a vehement appeal for their deportation, stating that the attendees had not committed any grave offence.“Please deport us to our home countries. We came here before any restrictions (imposed due to Covid-19). If we have not committed anything grave, the Centre can consider deporting us,” they said through Singh.The bench observed that the proper course of action for the petitioners would be to challenge the central government’s orders individually before the high court concerned.“This is not something which affects national security. These people came here much before (the Covid-19 restrictions and lockdown). Blacklisting would mean we should not be allowed to return to India but we can be deported,” Singh added.205 FIRs against foreign Tablighi Jamaat members, 2,679 visas cancelledAccording to the affidavit, a total of 205 FIRs have been filed in 11 states against foreign Tablighi members. 2,765 foreigners have been blacklisted so far and visas of 2,679 foreign nationals have been cancelled, it was stated.It was also submitted that 227 foreign nationals left India before a lookout notice could be issued against them.“47 foreigners who attended the Jamaat event are Nepal nationals who are not holding any visa. Visas of remaining 39 cases are under the process of cancellation,” the affidavit said.The orders cancelling visas were intimated to 1,502 foreigners by email. However, 1,168 foreigners on regular visas could not be intimated regarding cancellation of visas as their email ids are not available with the immigration bureau, the central government submitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/centre-to-decide-on-deporting-foreign-jamaat-attendees-supreme-court/story-PcYRmDklDcNVjKiqfWVf8O.html
02-07-2020||Delhi||Phone calls, worksheets: Sisodia charts out plan to help offline students||Addressing concerns over the “digital divide” in the education sector, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia Thursday announced that students of 1,030 government schools in the national capital will engage in “learning with a human feel” and have increased interactions with their teachers over phone.Beginning Monday, government schools will resume online classes with three different strategies for class groups between kindergarten and class 8, class 9 and 10, and class 11 and 12. According to the Union ministry of home affairs and the Delhi government directives, all schools in Delhi will remain closed till July 31 in view of the Covid-19 crisis. The government had announced that schools and educational institutions can opt for online or distance learning. However, several stakeholders have pointed out that many students could not attend these classes owing to lack of internet access and/or smartphones and computers.“The digital divide should not come in the way of children’s access to learning opportunities. We have formulated a plan wherein the focus will be on learning with a human feel. This si to ensure that students and teachers stay connected directly,” Sisodia said during a press conference Thursday.Before the summer vacation for government schools began on May 11, students up to class 8 were receiving text messages from schools with learning activities. For students slated to appear for their board examination next year, the directorate of education had organised online classes with two or three sessions a day.From Monday, students from kindergarten to class 8 will receive one worksheet each with questions, tasks or activities on basic reading, writing, understanding, basic numeracy, and happiness curriculum via WhatsApp. Class 9 and 10 students will each receive two or three subject-specific worksheets a day, while those in class 11 and 12 will have online classes.“We have learnt that around 10-20% students do not have access to WhatsApp. For such students, parents can come to the school on a designated day and collect the learning material and worksheets for their wards. Teachers can offer guidance to these students over phone,” Sisodia said.Heads of schools have been asked to ensure class teachers have updated WhatsApp groups and lists of parents whose children are not available on these groups. Students of classes 11 and 12 will attend live online classes in 12 subjects. Teachers will follow up students over phone or WhatsApp to clear any doubts. However, those students who don’t have access to online classes can contact their teachers and they will facilitate offline learning through parents and school management committee (SMC) members,” Sisodia said.On July 1, the department also issued a circular over reconstitution of SMCs – comprising parents, school officials, and area residents– since the existing term is over. “An active SMC is most essential to take remote learning initiatives of DOE to the community,” the circular read.Emphasising that the role of teachers will be crucial in this plan, Sisodia said, “Regular teachers, guest teachers, and contractual teachers will be engaged for this plan.” The announcement is significant as over 20,000 guest teachers were rendered jobless after their contracts lapsed in May. The All India Guest Teachers Association welcomed the move and requested the government to pay them salaries for the months of May and June.School principals will now be working to track students who have been inactive on WhatsApp class groups. “Most of our students are active but a few may have difficulty in accessing the app. We will call such students over phone, check if they need any help and then work out a plan accordingly,” Rakesh Semalty, principal of a government school in Nand Nagri, said. With the education department focusing on a one-to-one interaction with students over phone or WhatsApp, the teaching community has a monumental task ahead of them. Most students have smartphones and those who don’t have are often stressed and feel inferior. It will be difficult to counsel such children and ensure that their learning continues. Also, the department should ensure that proper sanitization facilities are provided in schools when parents visit to collect learning aids,” Pankaj Kumar, who teaches science and computer science at a government school in Shalimar Bagh, said.Private schools in the capital are also continuing with online lessons. While most students in such schools have access to online classes. But students from economically weaker sections have difficulty in attending these classes as they have no smartphones or internet. NGO Justice For All has filed a petition in this regard before the Delhi high court and the case is currently being heard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/phone-calls-worksheets-sisodia-charts-out-plan-to-help-offline-students/story-JR625mouuXwGqMU8PS7KaM.html

02-07-2020||City||Mega green drive in Delhi aims to plant 3.1 million saplings||New Delhi: Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Thursday said the government will launch a 17-day mega greening drive with a target of planting at least 3.1 million saplings across the national capital. The campaign aims at reducing overall pollution levels and increasing the green cover.The mega-drive titled ‘Plant Saplings, Save Environment’ or ‘Vraksharopan Pakhwada’ will focus on planting shrubs on key stretches that see heavy traffic movement in order to curb dust pollution. Road dust is a major contributor to PM 10, which is a prominent pollutant in Delhi’s air.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal before the 2019 elections had in his guarantee card promised that over the coming five years, his government will plant 2 crore saplings across the city. “We are committed to reducing pollution levels in Delhi. We will plant over 31 lakh (3.1 million) saplings during this 17-day plantation drive. All departments will be involved in this initiative. Our target is to plant 20 lakh (2 million) saplings of big trees and 11 lakh (1.1 million) saplings of small trees and shrubs,” Rai said in a statement.Rai will kick start the drive by planting saplings at the ITO nursery near Yamuna Bank on July 10. All 70 MLAs will hold plantation drives in their constituencies.This year’s target is much higher than last year’s 2.4 million saplings but still lower than 3.2 million in 2018, which has been the highest so far. Mega plantation drives have been Kejriwal governments’ strategy to mitigate air pollution in Delhi. According to officials in the forest department, the nodal agency for plantation in the city, more than 90% of the saplings to be planted will be native species such as peepal, bargad, gular, jamun, gulmohar, sheesham, arjun and pilkhan, among others. The major plantation will be carried out in South (Asola), West (Alipur) and North divisions where large patches are available.“The central government gave the target of planting 15 (1.5 million) lakh saplings in Delhi this year but we will plant double the target this year. While various Delhi government departments will plant 18 lakh (1.8 million) saplings, another 9, 40,000 will be planted by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA),” said Rai.Besides, the three municipal corporations and the New Delhi Municipal Council will together plant 200,000 saplings. Other agencies such as Delhi Metro and Northern Railways, among others too will plant a total of 200,000 saplings.The government has roped in the Forest Research Institute (FRI), Dehradun to perform a third-party audit of last year’s plantation drive. In 2019-20, the Delhi government planted a total of 29, 366, 3.6 million saplings against the target of 24, 18,300 lakh saplings. “We have decided to get a third-party audit done to assess the survival rate of the plantations this year as well,” said Rai. The minister said the aim of the mega plantation drive is to increase Delhi’s green cover to 350 sqkm by 2021 from the current 325 sqkm. “In the last few years, there has been a significant increase in the green cover of Delhi due to the mega plantation initiatives. In 2017 the green cover was 299 sqkm, which increased to 325 sqkm in 2019 and it is estimated that by 2021 the green cover will increase to around 350 sqkm, which will help in a substantial reduction of pollution levels,” said Rai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mega-green-drive-in-delhi-aims-to-plant-3-1-million-saplings/story-DcTBe0VZYl7xHCk25vo8KO.html
02-07-2020||Delhi||Traffic in Delhi contributes to highest share of toxic VOC emissions||Traffic emissions and the burning of solid fuel contribute to the highest share (80%) of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Delhi’s air, the national capital’s first-ever analysis of such compounds has revealed. VOCs are gases emitted from certain solids and liquids, affecting local and regional air quality, human health and climate, both directly and indirectly. They are a group of pollutants that can cause a range of health issues, including injury to the central nervous system and even certain cancers, according to the US Environment Protection Agency.A team of 14 researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Kanpur, IIT-Delhi, Laboratory of Atmospheric Chemistry (LAC), Switzerland, Space and Atmospheric Sciences Division and the Geosciences Division (Ahmedabad) conducted the study of the source apportionment of VOCs in Delhi’s air. They collected high-frequency data during January -March 2018.They collected the samples at two locations—IIT-Delhi campus (an urban area surrounded by residential and commercial areas) and Manav Rachna International University (MRIU), Faridabad (a suburban site in a relatively open area and small parks in the vicinity). The study is part of the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) ongoing projects on real-time source apportionment of air pollution as well as the Department of Biotechnology’s on the impact of air pollution on health.“During the analysis, we observed a high concentration of VOCs and trace gases. We also saw strong day-night variations in the concentrations at the two sites. We identified six major contributing factors to VOCs at the sites, including two traffic-emission related factors, two solid-fuel combustion factors and two secondary factors,” SN Tripathi, head, civil engineering department, IIT-Kanpur, and one of the corresponding authors of the study, said.At the urban site, traffic-related emissions contributed 56.6% to the total VOC concentration compared to 36.0% at the suburban site. The researchers found a higher concentration at the urban site, mainly because of heavy vehicular movement during the day and the plying of heavy-duty vehicles during the night as compared to the suburban site.Solid fuel combustion contributed 27.5% to emissions at the urban IIT-D site, and 30.4% to the emissions at the suburban MRIU site.“Emissions from the burning of solid fuels (such as wood, charcoal, coal, biomass, leaves and waste), particularly in the night, were identified as a significant source contributing to a high concentration of VOCs at both the sites,” the study read.According to the study, secondary factors were the most important source of VOCs during the daytime, accounting for 15.9% of the total VOC concentration at the urban site and 33.6% at the suburban site. At the suburban site, the factors were dominated by oxygenated VOCs such as benzene, toluene, xylene, which are mainly emitted from industries and the burning of biomass. These substances are carcinogenic and prolonged exposure to them can adversely impact human health.“The study highlights the crucial role that anthropogenic sources (man-made emissions) play in pollution levels in Delhi. We urgently need measure to reduce such emissions from traffic exhaust and solid fuel combustion to mitigate the severe pollution and environmental impact of VOCs as well as aerosols in Delhi-NCR,” Tripathi said.Interventions such as transitioning to cleaner fuels and ultimately to electric vehicles are required to cut down on these emissions and improve the ambient air quality in the region, he added.“It is crucial to study VOCs to get a complete picture of air pollution and its sources. For instance, when Delhi switched to CNG (lesser polluting fuel) from diesel, it was thought that, for the time being, it would reduce pollution. But CNG emits more VOCs, and eventually, cities like Delhi will have to convert to cleaner fuels to actually control high levels of pollution,” Dilip Ganguly, associate professor, Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT-Delhi, and one of the study’s corresponding authors, said.An air quality analysis conducted by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) during January 1-May 31 this year also revealed high levels of ozone (a product of VOCs and NO2) pollution in Delhi-NCR. The analysis underlined vehicular and industrial emissions as the major reasons behind it.Anumita Roychowdhury, the executive director of research and advocacy, CSE, said, “So far air pollution has been dealt with only in terms of particulate matter (PM), which is not enough, given the complex nature of pollution in Delhi-NCR. Gases such as VOCs are major components of air pollution. They are toxic and harmful and contribute to the formation of ozone and secondary particulates in the atmosphere. We require a holistic approach to address the issue of air pollution. Cleaner action plans, therefore, need to address particles and gases together.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/traffic-in-delhi-contributes-to-highest-share-of-toxic-voc-emissions/story-HAUNSb49rjJLPYidVep7vN.html
02-07-2020||City||Delhi: NDMC to launch anti-spitting drive, deploy civil wardens||New Delhi: To contain the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease and maintain public hygiene, the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has decided to launch an “Anti-Spitting drive” with 10 civil warden squads. Apart from issuing fines, these civic wardens will also spread awareness and educate the public about the ill effects of spitting and urinating in public places.The civic body had in May issued a notification regarding penalty of Rs 1,000 on spitting or urinating in public places under its jurisdiction.According to NDMC officials, these civil wardens will carry a point-of-sale (POS) machine to issue on-the-spot fine. The POS machine will also have the option of e-payment, in case violators are not carrying cash.“If the violator has no money to pay the fine, they will be produced before a special municipal magistrate to take action as per the provisions of law. The civil warden squad will comprise sanitation inspector-level employees of the NDMC,” an official of the civic body said, asking not to be named.He said that civil wardens will be uniformed in a sky-blue shirt marked with the NDMC logo and dark blue trousers.“In the first phase, the anti-spitting drive will cover Connaught Place, Khan Market, Gole market, Sarojini Nagar Market, Bengali Market, Janpath and other prominent market areas. In the second phase, by mid-July, the drive will cover parks, gardens and other public places to fine violators as per the notification issued by NDMC,” the civic body said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-ndmc-to-launch-anti-spitting-drive-deploy-civil-wardens/story-3og36TVMTkyu15t4UTC4AN.html
02-07-2020||Delhi||DU students flags breach of privacy on varsity’s online admit card portal||A section of final-year undergraduate students of Delhi University (DU) colleges Thursday raised concerns over a possible breach of privacy on the varsity’s online portal for issuing admit cards for the upcoming online exams, which are scheduled to start on July 10. Students alleged that anyone can access a student’s admit card that carries personal details such as their mobile phone number, address, date of birth and email id.DU had earlier announced that it would conduct open book online exams for final-year students as a one-time measure in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and the need to ensure social distancing. The university is issuing admit cards online through a link available on its website. To access the admit card, students are provided a gateway password that is unique to each college. Students can enter this password along with their roll numbers and names to access the admit card.Vivek Prasad, a final-year LLB student at DU’s Campus Law Centre, said the gateway passwords are being circulated on WhatsApp groups, thereby posing a threat to the privacy of thousands of students. “If anyone gets hold of this gateway password, (s)he can easily access the roll number and names of students, which are available on the college websites, and then access their admit cards. There is a real risk of potential stalkers getting hold of phone numbers, email ids and home addresses of girls using the admit card portal,” he said.Other students, too, raised similar concerns. Suruchi, a final-year BA (Hons) student at Rajdhani College, said, “It’s scary for a student to know that her details can be accessed by anyone online. Our privacy has been openly violated by the university,” she said.Vinay Gupta, dean of examinations, said the university has given a unique password to each of the 60 colleges. “We cannot distribute the admit card in person this year, given the circumstances, and we had to switch to the online mode. We do not expect our students to search for the roll numbers of other students and pull out their personal details. Students should have a moral responsibility to not indulge in something like that, considering the prevailing situation. Some students are trying to create a fuss over nothing,” he said.Later in the evening, Gupta said the administration has fixed the issue faced by law students. “We added an option of one time password (OTP) on the admit card portal of law students since their roll numbers were easily accessible on the website. No other college student should face any such issue since their details are not available online,” he said.However, students of other colleges said their roll numbers are also easily available on websites. Amreen, a student of BA (Hons) English at Gargi College, said, “Some of the colleges have also uploaded a notification mentioning the gateway password on their websites. The college websites also have the names and roll numbers of students. This will lead to cases of online harassment and stalking. Who will take responsibility if something untoward happens?”A group of DU teachers, who are also members of the Indian National Teachers’ Congress, has written to vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi on Thursday saying, “The university administration has uploaded the admit cards on its website which can be accessed by anyone. Examination roll number and names can be accessed from the college websites. Surprisingly, gateway passwords are common for all students. Even an outsider can access the phone numbers, email addresses and home addresses of students which are mentioned on their admit cards. Therefore, the university administration must take notice of this breach of confidentiality and privacy.”Despite several attempts, Tyagi did not respond to calls and texts sent to him seeking his comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-students-flags-breach-of-privacy-on-varsity-s-online-admit-card-portal/story-XEuvgXFFCRNiHJTHsxhjVL.html
02-07-2020||City||SDMC asks teachers to be present at schools, staff unhappy||New Delhi: The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has asked its teachers to start coming to schools even as physical teaching remains suspended till the end of July 31 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The teachers have opposed the move, saying all schools are closed in Delhi and regular classes are suspended for students and so then there is no point in asking teachers to go to schools risking their lives. The SDMC in its June 30 order said, “… it is directed that teaching and non-teaching staff of SDMC schools, including aided ones, will attend schools from July 1, by properly maintaining SOP for prevention of Covid-19, to distribute textbooks and other teaching materials collecting from the zonal stores.”The Delhi government had also issued instructions that schools will remain closed in the city till July 31 in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. It had said only those employees (teachers and other staff) will report for duty whose services are absolutely required for Covid-19-related operations.Though schools are shut for students, online classes are being conducted by the municipal schools for their students. They are provided links of recorded audio and video lectures on WhatsApp by municipal schools. Students of East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) schools are also being given assignment and assessment sheets for remote study.Currently, neither Delhi government teachers nor private school teachers are going to schools these days.The South Corporation manages 581 primary schools in its jurisdiction and employs around 6,000 teachers. Till now, only those teachers are visiting schools and going to the field who are engaged in Covid duties. Ram Niwas Solanki, general secretary, Municipal Corporation Teachers’ Association, said Delhi government and North Delhi Municipal Corporation schools are closed even for teaching and non-teaching staff but in SDMC, they are asking teachers to be present at schools at a time when Covid-19 cases are increasing the city every day.Solanki said in EDMC, teachers have been asked to report to school only once in a week as decided by the head of the school for study material distribution.“Asking teachers and non-teaching staff to come to schools every day even when there are no classes at a time of Covid-19 crisis is harassment. Many school buildings were closed and hence they are not even sanitised, so going to schools will only pose threat. This move will only increase crowding at schools and more teachers may get infected with the virus. We have requested the SDMC commissioner and other officials of the civic body’s education department to reconsider their decision,” Solanki said.He, however, said work related to the distribution of books and study material can be done just in a week’s time and there was no need to call teaching and non-teaching staff to schools for the entire month.A senior SDMC official of the education department on the condition of anonymity said the order regarding asking teachers to come to schools would not be revoked.“School will open as per orders to start a fresh admission process, distribution of books and stationery, lesson planning while maintaining social distancing protocol. When other departments are working to full capacity, there is no question of exempting teachers,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sdmc-asks-teachers-to-be-present-at-schools-staff-unhappy/story-3w8VPdfI33w3qj1FPPVywK.html
02-07-2020||City||HC suggests complaint helpline for private health care workers||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Thursday said the Delhi government should think of setting up a mechanism like a helpline on which health care workers can call anonymously to complain against private hospitals or nursing homes not providing N-95 masks and PPE kits.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan suggested this during the hearing of a plea by an NGO, which has alleged that nurses in private hospitals and nursing homes were not being provided proper personal protection equipment (PPE) kits and masks to guard against Covid-19 infection.The court said once a complaint is received on the helpline, the Delhi government can inspect the hospital or nursing home concerned and fulfil the PPE kits and masks requirements. It asked the NGO, Distress Management Collective, to give suggestions on how the issues raised in its PIL can be addressed and listed the matter for hearing on July 6.During the hearing, the Delhi government said it was taking action against private hospitals and nursing homes that violate Covid-19 guidelines as and when such instances are brought to its attention.The Delhi government said it had issued an order on April 7 that states if any person, including doctors, nurses, para-medical staff, sweeper or any other staff in government or private sector, died while attending to Covid-19 patients his/ her family shall be provided Rs 1 crore as compensation.It said an order was issued on June 17, notifying that psychiatric social counselling services are being made available to health care workers under a programme called “samarthan”.The Centre, represented by its standing counsel Anil Soni, told the court that it was providing all assistance to states that have to do the actual work. It has in its affidavit said it has provided PPE kits and N 95 masks to states and union territories as per their requirement and it is up to them to “optimally utilise” the protective gear.The plea contended that nurses in private hospitals and clinics were being given used PPE kits. It said all private sector nurses be covered under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package of insurance protection and provided proper psycho-social support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-suggests-complaint-helpline-for-private-health-care-workers/story-tF70CluJ77sExXkDiQYDEN.html

Dr Abhishek Bhayana, 27, a junior resident, had started experiencing Covid-19-like symptoms 10 days ago.He had travelled back to his hometown Rohtak, where his first test came out to be negative for the viral infection. Another test done on July 1 was also found to be negative.“Although he had all the symptoms of Covid-19, he tested negative for it. Unfortunately, we have not determined any cause of death so far. Another sample has been sent for testing,” said a doctor from the hospital, on condition of anonymity.Although he had not been posted in Covid-19 wards of Lok Nayak hospital, which is associated with MAIDS and is the city’s biggest Covid-19 hospital, he had worked in the screening areas of the institute.“Now, every hospital has been getting Covid-19 cases and exposure could have happened anywhere. He did work in the screening area where everyone coming into the hospital is checked for Covid-19 symptoms before being allowed in,” the doctor said.Any health care worker who died of Covid-19 while serving patients with the infection get Rs 1 crore ex gratia as per a scheme announced by the Delhi government. Apart from that, the PM had also announced a 50 lakh insurance cover for all health care workers.So far, at least 2,000 healthcare and hospital staff have tested positive for the infection in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/doc-with-covid-like-symptoms-dies-but-initial-tests-are-negative/story-BxA6oPYR971UJNSnPf7brI.html

He and the accused’s mother, Shindar Kaur, had rekindled their relationship and were living together. However, the two brothers were against this and ended up murdering Gurmel, police said.Gurmel’s sister Dharamjit Kaur told police that her brother and Shindar had married 35 years ago, but due to strained relations, the two had divorced. Following this, Shindar married her second husband with whom she had sons Jaspreet Singh (25) and Jasdeep Singh (23).However, Shindar’s second husband died three years ago and she started living with Gurmel, the complainant said. As her sons were against their live-in relationship, on June 27 they barged into the shrine and assaulted Gurmel with sticks while he was asleep and fled, the victim’s sister added.An injured Gurmel was taken to a local hospital from where he was referred to PGIMER Chandigarh. He, however, succumbed to his injuries there on Thursday.PAU police station house officer, inspector Paramdeep Singh, said a case under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC has been registered against the accused who are at large.

02-07-2020||City||How ‘Lockdown 1 meal a day’ fed a taluka of 130 villages with a dedicated Covid centre||PUNE Until June, 130 villages in Velhe taluka, a population of at least 50,000 citizens were facing the Covid-19 pandemic with no dedicated Covid care centre for tests or quarantines in the taluka.The lack of medical facilities – for testing and quarantine - in the taluka was as stark as the prospect of Covid-19 cases rising.As of July 1, a total of 36 residents from various villages in the taluka have tested positive for Covid-19. Currently, there are three active positive patients. The fact that Velhe today has a handle on the Covid situation rests, in part, in a Covid care centre at the ITI college in Velhe.The brick, mortar and tented structure did not exist till June.In three days it was built up by 75 residents of Wakad, Pune; most of these philantrophists from the IT sector in the city. It began with ‘Lockdown 1 meal a day’, the group’s unofficial name, simply a reflection of what their early charity was dedicated to.It today stands testimony to urban fortunate reaching out to change rural lives – a Covid care centre in Velhe; built by the group volunteers themselves; at the cost of Rs five lakh; all paid for by the group’s volunteer. From‘Lockdown 1 meal a day’ donating food packets during the lockdown, across the city to a 101-bed Covid care centre in Velhe taluka, the effort has been relentless.The centre will serve at least 130 villages and can be accessed by at least 15,000 villagers.“We began our ‘Lockdown 1 Meal a Day’ initiative where we cooked and delivered food to poor people. When the unlock process started in the last week of May, there was 700kg of grain left with us. So went to Velhe village to distribute it. That was when we realised there was a need for a Covid care centre, as there were positive cases found earlier. The total budget of the project went upto Rs 5 lakh and we, members of the group, contributed. Some contributions came from our supporters in the US and Australia,” said Raj Sekhon, owner of an IT company and coordinator of the project.Group volunteers worked for three days to build the centre at the ITI College in Velhe. Beds with saline rods, pillows, bed-sheets and pillow covers were all set up. Initially, it was a 50-bed set up and later on it was increased to 101 beds. As of July 1, a total of 36 residents have tested positive for Covid-19 in Velhe taluka and currently, there are three active positive patients. Twenty-seven close contacts of Velhe’s three active positive patients are in quarantine at this centre. There is a team of doctors and nurses provided by the district administration at the centre. Once a person tests positive, s/he is immediately moved to a government hospital in Pune city. “Looking at the situation there, there was not even a basic medical facility in Velhe. With permission from the tehsildar we took ownership and built a Covid care centre of 51 beds in three days in the first week of June. Later on, we added 50 additional beds. To ensure the safety of medical staff we also provided good quality, reusable PPE kits and face shield for the staff. As an immunity booster we prepared a total of 11,994 medicine doses to be distributed to every house in Velhe taluka,” Sekhon said.Shivaji Shinde, tehsildar of Velhe taluka, said, “As the number of Covid positive patients starting increasing in the taluka we were in need of a proper care centre where we can do testing, and quarantine close contacts. We were in search of help, when this group of people came to our rescue. On their own they built the entire centre, and people are quarantined from all over the taluka. We are very thankful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/how-lockdown-1-meal-a-day-fed-a-taluka-of-130-villages-with-a-dedicated-covid-centre/story-vAej2i07WnXXByQvs8PFYM.html

Punjab government has refused to refund or exchange the tickets for Rakhi bumper.In a meeting held here on Wednesday evening, the dealers rued that around 9 lakh tickets worth over ₹22 crore were sold before the announcement that the bumper has been cancelled. However, the dealers are stuck with tickets valued at ₹2 crore.One of the lottery dealers, Som Nath, said, “We have refunded the amount to most customers, but the state government is now harassing the dealers by not allowing refund or exchange of tickets. The government can at least exchange the tickets with the Rakhi bumper, which has been recently announced by the government. But the authorities are not paying any heed.”Recently, the members of Northern India Lottery Association had also conducted a meeting with the officials of Punjab State Lotteries department, but to no avail.Association president H K Chugh said, “The draw for the Baisakhi bumper was scheduled for April 17, but the government cancelled the same on April 11 due to Covid-19. It had conveyed that tickets could be encashed from sellers and post offices, but now the government is not issuing refunds. It is not even exchanging the tickets, which will surely hit the credibility of the department and the state government. Dealers across the state are a harried lot.”“If a person is facing harassment for getting a refund of ₹250, how can he/she expect that the prize would be provided to him with ease,” asked Chugh.He added that they will take up the matter with the state government and would also meet chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh in the coming days, if needed.Punjab State Lotteries superintendent Harjeet Singh said, “Dealers have submitted their demands and the department is looking into it. A few claims made by them regarding the sale of tickets are also suspicious. A decision has to be taken by higher authorities and it would be announced soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stuck-with-tickets-worth-2-crore-lottery-dealers-allege-punjab-govt-denying-refund/story-Wz0wfFleSDh4ZBUdbw6yTL.html

Ahmad was accompanied by his three-year-old grandson at the time.Bashir’s wife is a retired station house officer at women’s police station in Baramulla. “The police version is a blatant lie. If he was caught in the crossfire, his body would have been inside his car or his car would have suffered some damage. There’s not even a scratch or a bullet mark on his car,” said Suhail Ahmad, the victim’s son.A photo of a toddler sitting on the chest of his dead grandfather has outraged residents of Kashmir.According to the family, Bashir Khan was driving in his car with his grandson from his home in the main city of Srinagar.While Ahmed’s family has released a video message on social media, accusing the CRPF personnel of dragging him out of his car and shooting him at point-blank range, the Jammu & Kashmir Police said he died in the exchange of fire with militants. The victim’s son said troops later placed the child on his father’s chest and took pictures.Militants threatening family, says IGPAt a press conference Wednesday, Kashmir Inspector General of Police (IGP) Vijay Kumar said the family’s accusations against the CRPF were driven by threats issued to them by militants.A wreath-laying ceremony was held at RTC Humhama Campus of CRPF to pay tributes to the slain CRPF personnel.‘Bashir was hit by bullets fired by militants’Special Director General of CRPF, Zulfiquar Hassan said that militants had already taken position in the mosque when the CRPF reached there.“When we reached there, the militants had started firing at the CRPF personnel who bravely retaliated,” he said adding that Bashir was hit by bullets fired by militants.“While alighting from the car, he was shot in the back by the militants,” he said.The 3-year-old boy was rescued by a CRPF man.(with agency input)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-version-is-a-blatant-lie-says-family-of-civilian-killed-in-sopore-shootout/story-xCEFJuYDvW1p1wPHqr84GM.html

This is the second such case within month as authorities face resistance for institutional quarantine from those arriving in India under the Vande Bharat mission.The 24-year-old resident of Kothrud returned to Pune from Oman on June 30, but did not follow mandatory protocol of quarantine, officials said. When authorities found that the woman went home, PMC officials filed a complaint with the police.Later, the police filed a first information report (FIR) against the woman based on the PMC complaint under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Sections 188 (disobedience to duly promulgated by public servant), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection and disease dangerous to life) and Section 51 (b) (refuses to comply with any direction given by or on behalf of Central Government or the State Government) of the Disaster Management Act and relevant sections of the of Maharashtra Covid-19 Regulations Act and Epidemic Diseases Act.“The woman who returned from Muscat to Pune on June 30 was asked to be quarantined at a hotel for seven days, however, she violated the rules and went to her house in Kothrud even after a prior warning. The FIR was filed against her,” said Yuvraj Deshmukh, PMC executive engineer and incharge for coordinating quarantine facilities of travellers.As per government orders, everyone returning to the country has to mandatorily spend seven days either at a government quarantine facility or hotel.

I am already running out of money and now at the hotel, I have to pay Rs 2,000 per day during my quarantine,” said the woman booked by the police. The woman claimed that on June 30, PMC officials contacted her and asked her to go to the hotel . “I requested them on WhatsApp that I wish to be quarantined at the hotel the next day.

02-07-2020||Bangalore||DK Shivakumar takes charge as Karnataka Congress president, ceremony on Zoom||More than three months after he was declared as president of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee and three failed attempts to hold an event for swearing-in ceremony, Vokkaliga strongman DK Shivakumar on Thursday formally took as the state unit president. In a massive show of strength, lakhs of Congress workers across 15,000 locations in the state took part in a ‘Pratijna Divas’ (oath-taking ceremony) over Zoom video app. Incumbent Dinesh Gundu Rao formally handed over the party flag to the new president.Addressing party workers as their state president for the first time, Shivakumar said: “Joining together is the beginning, thinking together is progress, working together is success.”Fifty eight-year-old DKShi (as he is known within the party) has been intensely loyal to Congress. A six-term MLA, Shivakumar has been a minister in four different cabinets in the state. His first stint as a minister came when he was all of 28 in the S Bangarappa-led government. But it was his tenure as the urban development minister in the SM Krishna government where he emerged as the right-hand man of the then CM that catapulted him into the spotlight. Incidentally, his daughter recently got engaged to Krishna’s grandson though the former CM is now with the ruling BJP. Shivakumar’s brother DK Suresh is an MP from Bangalore rural.Shivakumar is one of Karnataka’s richest politicians who during the 2018 assembly polls declared a wealth of Rs 840 crore. He has been accused of involvement in illegal mining, and a housing society scam. Last year, the Enforcement Directorate arrested him in a money laundering case and he was jailed in Tihar. The Congress leader has rejected these charges as political vendetta. What has endeared Shivakumar to the party high command is his troubleshooting skills. Shivakumar, who has never hid his ambition to become the CM, is hoping that helping the Congress come back to power in the 2023 assembly polls would help him realise that dream.L Manjunath, a political analyst, noted how Shivakumar sustains his momentum over the next three years and builds relations with other aspiring leaders within his own party will determine how far he goes. “Nobody can deny his political acumen or dynamism. But he has accumulated a number of enemies both within and outside the party over the years. For now though Congress which had become moribund in the state after the fall of the coalition government has become very active taking on the government and this has been primarily due to Shivakumar’s leadership,” said Manjunath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/dk-shivakumar-takes-charge-as-karnataka-congress-president-ceremony-on-zoom/story-CTPLtirfLCekaHQjbSD4cK.html

Farmers say that the goats they are rearing for breeding and dairy purposes have no takers.A weekly mandi held at Bathinda’s Tungwali village was a reliable platform for a large number of goat farmers where traders from Rajasthan and Maharashtra used to come and buy animals from small and medium-scale farmers.Farmers visiting the mandi said at least 200 animals were sold at the fair held on second, ninth, 17th and 24th of every month. However, this mandi was suspended since March 9.Makhan Singh, 38, from Dhurkot village in Ludhiana, has 55 goats but rues for not getting any income from goat rearing. He cultivates rice-wheat cycles on his 2.5 acre land and additional same size of the land on lease for his family of five along with two workers hired to look after the goats.“Visiting Tungwali every week for sale of goats was quite profit-making. For goats I used to get around Rs 15,000 at mandis and now I cannot sell them for even half the market price. Now, I am finding it difficult to make ends meet due to non-availability of buyers for goats,” he said.The mandi is organised by a group of progressive farmers at Tungwali, located 20km from district headquarters. Beatle and barbari are among the most popular breeds reared in goateries in state.Gursewak Singh, of Phulo Mithi village in Bathinda, who started rearing goats in September last year, said he has been waiting for reopening of animal mandi to sell five kids of improved breeds.“My plans to improve family income have dashed and I have to incur extra to feed the goats. Since these animals are of improved breed, local slaughterhouses offer less than half of the market rate of Rs 12,000-15,000 per kid,” he said.The man behind the goat market, Balwinder Singh, said he also is facing financial losses due to restrictions. “I had reared about 100 goats for Bakarid scheduled for next month, but owing to lockdown, no trader is placing any order. Usually, we start getting orders for sacrificial animals at least a month ahead of the festival,” he said.A progressive goat farmer Gurdeep Chahal said goatery is mainly adopted by low-income farmers and due to their limited resources, the lockdown period has caused an immense problem for them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/unlock-2-0-punjab-goat-farmers-await-opening-of-animal-mandis/story-pNaFo5ROw867YDrIGH1RqK.html

While the JEE main paper is to be held between July 18 and 21, the NEET exam is scheduled for July 26.‘NO CLUE ABOUT EXAM CENTRE’Hritik Nain, a NEET aspirant from Rohtak, says, “Only about 24 days are left for the exam but we still don’t know where our exam centre is and how we will reached there, especially since taking a public transport is risky right now. And with many states extending the lockdown till July 31, the government should direct the National Testing Agency to postpone the exams.”‘WHO WILL RESPONSIBILITY IF AN INFECTED CANDIDATE REACHES EXAM HALL’Ashish Jaglan, a JEE aspirant from Hisar, who has been stuck at his uncle’s house in Sonepat since the virus outbreak, says the risk of infection is higher in Sonepat and he doesn’t know how he will appear for the exam, which is barely two weeks away. “Many students will need public transport to reach the exam centre as not everyone has a vehicle of their own. Who will take responsibility if there is an infected student in the exam hall,” he says, adding that due to ongoing situation he has not been able to concentrate on his studies.The students and their parents are writing to the Union ministry of human resource and development, and the ministry of health and family welfare to intervene and ask the NTA to postpone the exam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-students-urge-govt-to-postpone-jee-neet-exams/story-xJAARsXNiv3rBlh6smSo2I.html

Meanwhile, a close relative of the girl, pleading anonymity, said all close family members had tested negative. He said the girl was in a state of shock after her return to Piplawan on June 17. “Everything was normal during the wedding. The couple was sent off to Paliganj on June 16. However, the 28-year-old groom developed stomach ache on June 16 and was admitted to a hospital, where he passed away on June 17,” he said.The BDO said eight containment zones had been marked in Paliganj and people who had tested positive were returning to their homes after completion of isolation. “All precautions are being taken. The vegetable market in Paliganj, which draws maximum crowd, is being opened in two shifts. Today, fire brigade vehicles were used to sanitise the containment zones,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/super-spreader-weddinggroom-s-family-to-face-action-says-patna-dm/story-5aIuD6pVeSIsahLc5GpHQL.html

02-07-2020||Chandigarh||Australia’s Deakin University, Chitkara University announce academic mentorship in software engineering||CHANDIGARH: Deakin University, Australia and Chitkara University, near Chandigarh, have announced an exclusive academic mentorship in software engineering for Indian students, which will commence in September. In the midst of uncertain circumstances caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, Deakin University and Chitkara University have announced the launch of an academic mentorship program to ensure that students continue to achieve their international study goals during this time. The announcement has come at a time when travel is suspended and many students are unsure about having an opertunity to study overseas. Deakin University and Chitkara University have developed a four-year bachelor of software engineering course that will facilitate Indian students to study two years of Deakin University’s licensed curriculum at Chitkara University before transferring to Deakin University in Australia. This transfer is based on conditions, and students after successful completion will receive a Deakin University bachelor of software engineering degree in Australia.Deakin University’s deputy vice- president (global) and CEO (south Asia), Ravneet Pawha, said, “at Deakin we are continuously innovating our offerings and with the current challenges presented by Covid-19, innovative hybrid programs like this would help students keep their study and career goals on track.” “We are proud of our partnership with Chitkara University and delighted to have developed this unique program, which will allow students to study an international degree from their home-country while having academic mentorship through the teaching and support by the faculty at Chitkara University.”This is a one-of-its kind initiative in the international education space, where students will earn 100% credits of prior learning at a leading Indian university before transferring to a Deakin University campus in Australia. As a part of the arrangement, students while studying the first two years of the program at Chitkara will pay local tuition fee. Students will also be co-taught some academic units by Deakin faculty in infrastructure, and resources that will be similar to Deakin.

It also contrasted the decision to ban Chinese apps with the surgical strike in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) after terror attacks in Uri and Pulwama.On Monday, the Ministry of Home Affairs banned 59 Chinese apps, including TikTok and ShareIt. The Centre stated that it has received many complaints from various sources, including several reports, about the misuse of these apps for stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users’ data in an unauthorised manner to servers located outside India. It claimed the move was meant to protect the sovereignty of Indian cyberspace and ensure the interests of crores of Indian mobile users.The editorial said that merely banning apps would not impact the Chinese economy. “After there was a demand to teach China a lesson like Pakistan, India launched an ‘online’ attack or a digital strike on China and created a stir... But merely banning apps will not break the back of China. Chinese businesses have invested heavily in India. Gujarat has the majority of these investments. Chinese company Huawei has been given the contract to erect a 5G network in India. This company having the keys to India’s digital economy is like giving [China] the keys to the future economy of the country. This contract is going to be the biggest threat to India in the future. Is the government not aware of this?” the editorial mentioned.The Centre, according to the editorial, claimed that Chinese intelligence agencies and People’s Liberation Army was using app data of Indian users. “If there was a threat to national security, then why were these apps allowed to function and their businesses [allowed to] thrive all these years?” the editorial questioned. It added that there has been no change after banning these apps. “The Chinese troops are still in Galwan Valley and are refusing to withdraw.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-mocks-digital-revenge-on-china-says-banning-apps-won-t-affect-chinese-economy/story-ztNp2mBQfCuocjJMvJsglI.html

The exams were earlier scheduled to commence from July 28.“The decision to defer the MBBS exams was taken by chairman of the examination board, who is also AKU vice-chancellor, after discussion with other members, including external members from the department of science and technology, government of Bihar,” said AKU examination controller Rajeev Ranjan.New dates for conducting these examinations would now be issued after receiving suggestions by the state or central government or necessary directives by the regulator, the Medical Council of India, Ranjan added.“The decision to defer the examinations was taken based on suggestion by medicos, many of whom were stranded outside the state. The medicos had expressed apprehensions of contracting Covid-19 if they were to travel back to appear for the exams,” added Ranjan.The Hindustan Times had on June 28 carried a news report titled “Medicos irked as AKU announces exam dates amid rising Covid cases”.Medicos of intermediate semesters, however, are not satisfied by the AKU decision. They want the university to promote them to the next semester based on marks obtained in previous semesters and are bracing up to seek legal remedy.Barring MBBS and dental, the AKU has already postponed examinations and decided to promote to the next semester all students of B.Tech, B.Pharma, BBA, B.Com and BMC among other courses.“As per the AKU itinerary, our MBBS second professional exams were scheduled in January, this year. However, they got delayed till July because of Covid-19. If the university defers the exams further, we will continue in the MBBS second year for more than two years, whereas the curriculum is of one-and-a-half year only,” said Kritika Singh, a second year MBBS student of the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), stuck in Delhi at present.“Deferring the exams further will not only hold us back in the same class, but also leave us with little time to attend classes and prepare for third professional exams. As such, we are demanding that the students be promoted internally,” she said. “Besides, those whose previous grades are not good and they want to improve should be allowed to do so when the pandemic eases,” said Kritika, who has taken it upon herself to fight on behalf of the medicos. Ranjan, however, said any decision to promote the medicos without conducting exams would have to be taken by the MCI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/aku-defers-mbbs-exams-medicos-want-to-be-promoted/story-BNZp5qvWEEr5p7IVJpSu8M.html

02-07-2020||Bangalore||D K Shivakumar officially takes charge as Karnataka Congress chief||D K Shivakumar on Thursday officially took charge as president of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee after over three months since he was appointed to the post.Called “Pratijna Dina”, the function to mark the official take-over of Shivakumar as president, along with Eshwar Khandre, Salim Ahmed and Satish Jarkiholi as working presidents of KPCC, is said to have been digitally witnessed by lakhs of people from over 15,000 places.Following the restrictions in place to control the spread of coronavirus, the ceremony was organised at the party’s new office building.Aimed at mobilising the party leaders and cadre, arrangements were made at panchayat and ward-level across the state to see to that they are part of the function through live telecast on TV channels, Zoom, YouTube and social media.The official take-over saw immediate past president Dinesh Gundu Rao handing over the Congress flag to Shivakumar, and this was followed by party workers across locations, who were digitally watching the function, taking oath and reading the preamble of the Constitution.The ceremony was held on Thursday after it was postponed thrice due to Covid-19 related restrictions in place.The Congress high command had on March 11 appointed Shivakumar, a six-time MLA, known to be the Congress’s chief troubleshooter in crisis situations, replacing Dinesh Gundu Rao as the KPCC chief.Rao had quit the post in December after the party’s dismal show of winning only two of the 15 seats in the bypolls.A written message by AICC president Sonia Gandhi was read out by party general secretary K C Venugopal in which she appreciated the judicious use of technology to mobilise the workers and leaders. Former Congress national president Rahul Gandhi telephoned Shivakumar and asked him to work for the party’s success by taking everyone together. Venugopal, Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah, senior leader Mallikarjun Kharge, former state Congress presidents, former and present party legislators and MPs, Congress leaders from neighbouring states were among others who attended the function here, virtually. Addressing the partymen, Shivakumar, vowing to convert Congress in Karnataka as a cadre-based party, said he was just a party worker and believes in collective leadership. “Joining together is the beginning, thinking together is progress, working together is success,” he said, while remembering that he was being written off during his arrest in a money laundering case, but Sonia Gandhi picked him for the post and even came to prison and spent time with him.Stating that Congress should come to power again on its own in the state, Shivakumar spoke about implementing the Kerala model.“Theres the Kerala model. All big leaders there must represent their booth. We have to follow the Kerala model...,” he said.It was not an easy path for the Vokkaliga strong man to become the KPCC president, as there was opposition from within.He continues to have a tough task ahead in taking together the faction-ridden party.There were reports of Siddarmaiah being in favour of one of his confidantes to be made state president.According to many party insiders, he is said to be the man behind the idea of three working presidents seen as a move loosen Shivakumar’s grip on the party.Several other leaders had also opposed Shivakumar’s name, citing his recent arrest by the Enforcement Directorate in a money laundering case.However, Shivakumar’s loyalty, roles that he has played in the party’s interest during troubled times, worked in his favour.Many feel his appointment would help in consolidating the party in southern parts of the state, where Vokkaligas are in large number.Considered as Congress’s man Friday, Shivakumar had hosted party legislators from Gujarat here in 2017 to ensure the victory of AICC leader Ahmed Patel in the Rajya Sabha elections.He was a key link in the Congress-JDS coalition and had made hectic attempts to prevent the collapse of the H D Kumaraswamy-led government last year after a section of the then ruling MLAs revolted.Speaking at the take-over function, Siddaramaiah said, “Our aim is to remove BJP and bring Congress to power once again to save the country.” He lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi accusing him of lying and betraying the people. He hit out at the government for its handling of COVID crisis and economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/d-k-shivakumar-officially-takes-charge-as-karnataka-congress-chief/story-VXUVoFCprMIhsLrgNcb0xJ.html

Show us a miracle. Human beings have given up,” said Thackeray after he performed a ‘’mahapuja’’ at 2 am along with wife Rashmi.“We have not been able to come up with medicines so far. How to go with day-to-day activities by covering the mouth with a strip of cloth,” he said.This year, doing away from tradition, a handful of warkaries (devotees) came to Pandharpur with ‘padukas’ (holy footprints) of saint-poets Dnyaneshwar and Tukaram as state authorities banned annual pilgrimage in view of the pandemic.To prevent people from visiting temple town, Solapur district administration has imposed curfew in Pandharpur since Tuesday.Collector Milind Shambharkar issued an order bringing restrictions on people’s movement in and around Pandharpur town from 2 pm on June 30 to 12 night on July 2 under the Disaster Management Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/thackeray-says-human-beings-have-given-up-prays-for-miracle-to-overcome-covid-crisis/story-WTMAZ9d1k4DunSXA6PNTLM.html
02-07-2020||Chandigarh||Selection of 1,983 PTIs: Vigilance Bureau registers FIR against former Haryana SSC chairman, members||The vigilance bureau has booked the former chairperson and members of Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) for allegedly misusing their positions and tinkering with the selection criteria to help certain candidates get selected as physical training instructors (PTIs). The recruitment of 1,983 PTIs took place in 2010 during the Congress rule. On the basis of a communication from the Haryana advocate general, BR Mahajan, a first information report (FIR) was registered on June 30 by the vigilance bureau (VB) at Panchkula under IPC sections 166, 193, 466, 468, 471 and 120-B and provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act. The FIR does not have any names. The sections invoked in the FIR pertained to punishment for false evidence in a judicial proceeding, public servant disobeying law, forgery of court record or public register, forgery for the purpose of cheating and criminal misconduct by a public servant. A single bench of the Punjab and Haryana high court had on September 11, 2012, set aside the 2010 selections of PTIs on account of changes made in the selection process. An HC division bench had upheld the decision of the single bench. The Supreme Court on April 8 too upheld the HC decision. The content mentioned in the FIR registered by VB has its foundation in the Supreme Court judgment. An apex court bench of Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice Navin Sinha had said that HSSCs decision of June 30, 2008, to cancel the written examination, the July 11, 2008 decision to call candidates eight times the number of vacancies on minimum percentage of marks for interviews and the decision of July 31, 2008, to call all the eligible candidates for interviews were arbitrary. These decisions were taken without any reason to change the selection criterion published in 2006 which have the effect of downgrading the merit. The top court also said that since commission was a multi-member body, all decisions pertaining to mode of selection and criteria were to be taken by the commission itself, there being no rules or resolution delegating the said power to chairman or any other member. “The decision of not holding written examination, to screen on the basis of eight times of vacancies and percentage of marks and to call all eligible candidates, were taken by the chairman himself, and cannot be said to be decisions of the commission,’’ the SC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/selection-of-1-983-ptis-vigilance-bureau-registers-fir-against-former-haryana-ssc-chairman-members/story-86OqyEUHuedjWPJQC2NKnJ.html

Officials at other government medical colleges have also been transferred. The decision has no link with the PPE kits scam,” Soni said.DK Tiwari, principal secretary, medical education and research, said, “The decision was taken for administrative reasons in public interest.”When contacted, Dr Sujata Sharma said, “The PPE kits were purchased by the medical superintendent. The GMC authorities are not responsible for buying any equipment for the hospital.”She said, “The medical education department sent the transfer orders and cited that in view of the increase in Covid-19 deaths at GMC, Amritsar, the decision has been taken. The hospital tries its level best to save every life but the Covid-19 patients in Amritsar are not being detected at an early stage by the administration and civil surgeon office.”SCAM UNEARTHED IN APRILIn April, doctors, nurses and other healthcare staff at the hospital refused to use around 2,000 PPE kits procured, alleging that they were substandard and did not include N-95 masks.They also accused the authorities of paying Rs 41 lakh for the kits, which according to the them, should not have cost more than Rs 7 lakh.The medical superintendent of Guru Nanak Dev Hospital (the hospital with GMC) Dr Raman Sharma, had bought the kits on behalf of GNDH.Subsequently, Amritsar deputy commissioner Shiv Dular Singh Dhillon marked an inquiry on April 24.Amritsar member of Parliament Gurjit Singh Aujla, who issued a grant of Rs 1 crore to the medical college to fight Covid-19, wrote to the government demanding a probe. In mid-June, he again wrote to the Union ministry of statistics and programme implementation complaining that the inquiry was being delayed. On June 23, the Centre wrote to the Punjab government to complete the inquiry in a time-bound manner. The state government then entrusted the inquiry to the chief administrator, Amritsar Development Authority, who began the probe on June 30.

02-07-2020||Patna||Bihar’s super-spreader wedding was attended by 400 people; 200 at groom’s cremation||More than 100 people have tested positive for coronavirus in India after attending the wedding -- and then funeral -- of the groom, who reportedly tied the knot while ill with the disease. Officials in Bihar state said Wednesday the 26-year-old groom had symptoms of the deadly virus when he got married on June 15.He died two days later.“So far 111 people who either attended the wedding or the funeral have tested positive,” said Raj Kishor Chaudhary, chief medical officer in Patna, the state capital.“All others have been identified and isolated.” Doctors are not certain the unnamed groom was the source of the infection as he was cremated before tests could be carried out.But Chaudhary said around 400 people who attended the wedding or funeral would be isolated following a spurt in infections.The groom, a software engineer who returned home from near New Delhi only a week before the wedding, had shown symptoms before the nuptials.He was briefly admitted to hospital, but his family had him discharged and hosted the wedding with over 300 guests.He died at his home two days later, with nearly 200 people attending the funeral. Some had attended both.None of the groom’s relatives -- including his bride -- tested positive, officials said.Authorities have launched an investigation into possible violations of social distancing regulations on the number of guests at both the wedding and funeral.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage No more than 50 guests are allowed at India’s famously lavish and colourful weddings -- and just 20 people at funerals -- to limit the risk of spreading coronavirus.The epidemic is raging across the South Asian country of 1.3 billion people, with almost 600,000 infections and 17,000 deaths reported so far.Bihar, one of the country’s poorest regions and home to 120 million people, has recorded nearly 10,000 cases, with 62 deaths.Experts believe a lack of testing is hiding the true figures and that the nationwide toll is far higher than reported.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has eased lockdown restrictions despite a surge in cases.But on Tuesday he warned the nation to be more cautious.“We have become lackadaisical,” he said.“I again want you all to observe precautions in the same way as under lockdown.”ja/stu/fox/gle||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-s-super-spreader-wedding-was-attended-by-400-people-200-at-groom-s-cremation/story-zY3a6sS7LO9teFUzFIbDqK.html

Home department handed over investigation to STF on the instruction of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.“We investigated the people who were doing jobs on fake IDs. People have used the PAN number of the person who’s ID they were using for the Job. Original person received a notice from Income tax department that access money was being transferred into his account. When this matter came forward, other people who were working in this way changed their PAN numbers,” Amitabh Yash, Inspector General of Police, STF said.“So we have asked for the list of people who have changed their PAN numbers. There is a possibility that some of the PAN numbers have errors and people must have rectified them but these numbers should be less. It is possible that PAN number have been changed by the people who were doing jobs on fake IDs. These numbers are in thousands,” added Yash.The move was taken after Anamika Shukla case came to light which pertains to the appointment of teachers allegedly using fake documents in schools across the state.The case came to light after an FIR was lodged against Shukla for allegedly withdrawing over Rs 1 crore as salary for over a year from 25 different schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/stf-to-probe-for-fake-appointments-of-teachers-in-uttar-pradesh/story-a9kqbsyFHFXK2qos1qkmRK.html

02-07-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: A walk beyond the iconic Karim’s||The shutters are pulled down. The doorways are closed. The place is empty.This is Karim’s, in Old Delhi. From early morning to late night, the iconic restaurant would always be crowded. The diners would wait for their turn to enter in any of the three eating halls by standing about the alley. Now no one’s here. (No thank you, coronavirus.)But the temporary closure of this gastronomic landmark due to the ongoing pandemic has opened doors to other possibilities, other explorations.The restaurant complex is tucked at the front of Gali Kebabian street, thus named because it was traditionally home to kebab makers. Now, unencumbered by food scents or pressing crowds, the visitor can quickly cross through this part of the alley and wade deeper into it.You shall be surprised to discover that this is one of Old Delhi’s most atmospheric streets. The lane, at first, captivates with its very interesting, weird shape. It begins on the Matia Mahal Bazar road in the form of a tunnel, and a few steps later, suddenly distends into a wide unwieldy space—where lies the aforementioned restaurant. A casual stroller might feel as lucky as a chicken piece elbowing its way through the diner’s throat, finally falling into his comfortable, big stomach.Immediately afterwards the lane constricts into a narrow wedge. The walls here are beautifully discoloured with the patina of several seasons. One notice board is painted in a neat Urdu script, advertising the services of a plumber with a “licence number.”Soon the lane again widens into an opening. Here would be the stall of cook Naimuddin who is famous (among the locals) for his delicious haleem, prepared right on the pavement. This morning, against all odds, the pleasant man is present, fussing over his much-loved dish, bubbling in the gigantic cauldron. His wooden ladle is so huge that you could use it as an oar to row your boat across the Yamuna. Naimuddin reopened his stall following the lifting of the lockdown. He generously gives away the exact recipe of his haleem without being asked, and also offers a spoonful of it to taste.In the old times, when Karim’s hogged all the attention in this street, and Naimuddin used to be everyone’s cool discovery, a curious explorer was most likely to turn back at this point. One assumed that nothing more interesting lay further ahead. And in any case the lane doesn’t go anywhere; it’s a dead-end alley.But the true beauty of the street begins from here. Both sides are lined with the most beautiful flights of staircases. Additionally, the twisting and twisting of the lane itself evokes adventure and suspense, as you wonder what might appear next. Arresting sights wherever you look—in terms of doors and windows. One door is particularly noteworthy with metallic flowers welded onto its metallic surface. At one place, half the wall is painted with a shade of the most ethereal blue, while the rest revealing an array of raw bricks. The contrast is like two vastly dissimilar pieces of music merging harmoniously into each other.Here, the lane gets even narrower. A pair of birds, possibly the pets of a house-owner, are perched behind a grilled window, which is small enough to be a roshandaan (ventilator). The birds are intently looking out at the passerby, as if imploring to be set free.A few steps later, the lane reaches an impasse. The flâneur stands in front of a residence with a facade of three beautiful arches. The air is humming with the steady drone of an AC. A woman is peering out from behind a curtain. The walk ends.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-walk-beyond-the-iconic-karim-s/story-nkzlTVrtYManzvLgBsgMWI.html
02-07-2020||Bhopal||Donate TV to shelter, but not made in China: MP high court to bail-seekers||The Gwalior bench of the Madhya Pradesh high court has asked two bail applicants, both accused of attempt to murder in the same case, to donate an LED television set worth no less than ~25,000 to a night shelter, specifying that the TV should not be a made-in-China brand, as border tensions simmer between India and the neighbour.The court passed the order on June 26, but it came to light only on Tuesday through Ankur Modi, the additional advocate general (AAG) in Gwalior. The ruling came in the backdrop of a violent brawl between troops of the two countries in Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), and calls to boycott Chinese products.The bench of justice Sheel Nagu granted bail to petitioner Arvind Patel, a resident of Datia district, with several conditions, one of which was to donate a TV set to the shelter home and that is not made in China. The bench also granted bail to co-accused Kamlesh Pal, a resident of the same district, with the same condition.“Accordingly, without expressing any opinion on merits of the case, this application is allowed and it is directed that the petitioner be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond in the sum of ~25,000 with one solvent surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the concerned magistrate...The petitioner along with petitioner in McrC No.11789/20 undertake to purchase and install a black coloured LED TV at Renbasera, district hospital, Morar worth at least ~25,000 manufactured in India or abroad except China,” said the order of the court on Patel’s bail plea.Arvind Patel and Kamlesh Pal, residents of Aurina village in Datia district, and two others from the same village allegedly opened fire at another villager in February over a dispute. The other conditions for the bail set by the court were for both accused to cooperate in the trial, not to extend inducements, threats or promises to any person acquainted with the facts of the case to dissuade him/her from disclosing facts related to the case to the court or to the police officer.The court ordered that a compliance report pertaining to the condition it specified on the TV set be submitted along with photographs to the registry of this court. The registry shall supply a copy of its order to the legal aid officer of the state legal service authority, Gwalior, who shall in turn depute a para-legal volunteer to verify compliance with the condition and submit a report to the registry within two weeks of the verdict.“The accused themselves had offered to install the LED TV set in Renbasera. On this, court allowed this and also said that it will be a part of conditions for release of the accused on bail. However, the court also said that the TV set should not be manufactured in China,” AAG Ankur Modi said.Pawan Pathak, the secretary of High Court Bar Association, Gwalior, said, “It’s a unique order of the court. It has further infused a sense of patriotism in all of us...This order will have a wide psychological impact on the minds of people across the country who are boycotting Chinese products...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/donate-tv-to-shelter-but-not-made-in-china-mp-high-court-to-bail-seekers/story-tYboZVhoDxdYVvE8xVA8zM.html
02-07-2020||Mumbai||Prisoners out on temporary bail cannot report to police station via video calling: HC||The Bombay high court rejected a plea which sought permission for undertrials out on interim bail to report to concerned police stations through video calling.The state while opposing the plea said that as the location of the undertrial, which is one of the conditions of release recommended by the high power committee (HPC), could not be ascertained through video calling, the HC should not permit the plea.A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice NJ Jamadar while hearing public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Geeta Jain, independent MLA from Mira-Bhayander constituency through advocate Sunny Punamiya was informed that as per the Supreme Court directions to decongest jails, a HPC was constituted to recommend conditions for releasing the undertrials and convicts on interim bail or parole. The HPC stipulated that undertrials released under the arrangement would have to report once every 30 days to the jurisdictional station house officer.While making submissions in the PIL, on Tuesday, through video conferencing, Punamiya said that due to the spread of Covid-19, such prisoners should be allowed to report to the concerned police station or officer through video calling so that physical reporting was not required. The state through public prosecutor Deepak Thakare, along with additional public prosecutor SR Shinde, however, argued that if physical reporting was dispensed with and the undertrial was permitted the facility of a video call, the police could find it difficult to readily ascertain, in all cases, as to the location of such released undertrial prisoner, more particularly whether he is residing within the jurisdiction of the station house officer or not.Thakare further submitted that in case such a released undertrial prisoner violates the condition of bail, if any, of not leaving the jurisdictional limits of a particular police station and hides in unknown territory, the police would face immense difficulties in tracing him out, if he fails to surrender upon expiry of the temporary period of bail. In light of these submissions, the state sought dismissal of the PIL.After hearing the submissions, the court accepted the contentions of the state and said, “We do not propose to introduce any such arrangement, the possible ills whereof could largely out-weigh the intended benefits.” The court further observed that it did not wish to tinker with the recommendations of the HPC and hence was dismissing the PIL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/prisoners-out-on-temporary-bail-cannot-report-to-police-station-via-video-calling-hc/story-jFEa4igFDMPPaCXgDVcL1L.html

The products have been listed on Amazon under the brand name ‘Wardhini’, as these are made by self-help groups from Wardha district.“Like other sectors, self-help groups also suffered huge economic losses due to lockdown imposed to contain spread of the pandemic. Now, they have been made available on an international platform which will enable them to restart their business,” Mushrif said.This process was started on a pilot basis in May with two products — paper bags and terracotta jewelry — listed on Amazon. The products received good response, leading to a business of more than ₹2 lakh for the self-help groups. “Considering the response, we have now registered 33 products on Amazon, such as eight varieties of papad, four varieties of paper bags, four types of terracotta jewellery, four types of cooking masala, nutri biscuits, masks etc,” the minister said.“The 50 products available on GeM are made by self-help groups from different districts. ,Soon products made by self-help groups from various districts will also be made available on Amazon.

As part of the restrictions, the civic body will not permit counter delivery, and only home delivery of essential goods will be allowed. This led residents to crowd grocery and vegetable shops, a day before lockdown came into effect.“All these days the shops were open and counter delivery was allowed so we could go any time and buy. Now, since there won’t be any counter delivery, it was necessary to stock up on vegetables and fruits. The roads were more crowded than usual as many came out to shop,” said Shalini Rai, 45, a resident of Rambaug, Kalyan (West).On Thursday morning, several localities like Rambaug, Syndigate, Tilak Chowk, and Khadakpada in Kalyan (West); Chinchpada, Kolsewadi, and Tisgaon in Kalyan (East); Tilak Road, Manpada Road, and Phadke Road in Dombivli witnessed long queues outside shops as customers waiting to buy essentials.Rahul Duseja, 30, a resident of Phadke Road, said, “We came to know that the police will strictly act on those found on the road. We don’t want to take any risk and hence decided to buy the necessary things and stay home for the next 10 days.”Police also took to the streets on Wednesday to broadcast announcements on loudspeakers, asking residents to restrict outdoor movement, and stay at home for 10 days. As per Kalyan zone 3 police, a total of 500 policemen will be deployed in different parts of the city on Thursday to keep a lookout for people roaming on streets unnecessarily.“We won’t allow anyone to travel in vehicles unnecessarily. Even if they want to go anywhere, they need to have due permission. Legal action will be taken on the spot against violators. We have already made announcements across the cities so that people are aware of it,” said Vivek Pansare, deputy commissioner of police, Kalyan, zone 3.Meanwhile, KDMC initiated the sealing of most containment zones in the city to ensure there is no public or vehicular movement there.“We have sealed most of the containment zones so that no vehicles enter or exit these areas. The civic body and police will ensure the lockdown norms are followed in the containment zones,” said a senior KDMC official, who did not wish to be named.Last week, the civic body had identified 32 containment zones and had imposed restrictions on counter delivery, public, and vehicle movement in these areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/day-before-lockdown-kalyan-dombivli-residents-crowd-shops-to-stock-up-on-essentials/story-T4S9FIyngN1ZnFTPKg15xH.html

The third accused is absconding.The complainant, Irfan Qureishi, was closing his chicken shop on Monday when Sachin Singh, 45; Kiran Sakpal, 33; and Jayesh Singh, 32, asked for 1.5 kg chicken. Qureishi first refused, but later gave him the meat. However, the accused refused to pay ₹377 which led to an argument, said Vijaykant Sagar, additional superintendent of police (ASP), Vasai. One of the accused pulled out a knife while another took out the toy gun and fired black shots in the air to scare Qureishi. As the sound of the shots led to a panic in the area, the trio fled from the spot.“Qureishi complained to us and we registered a case under section 386 (extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt) of the Indian Penal Code and arrested Sakpal and Singh, while the other accused is absconding.

02-07-2020||City||Bhiwandi power loom owners stare at tough times ahead||Tejas Savla, 46, can see his three-decade-old family loom crumbling due to lack of business amid the lockdown in view of Covid-19 pandemic. Savla had to shut shop as instead of profit he ended up with expenses to maintain the loom and he sees no other option but to sell the business to earn some money for sustenance. Savla is merely one of the thousands of loom owners affected by the lockdown.While the state government eased lockdown norms and allowed power looms to open from June 8, the Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC) went into a lockdown again on June 18. Looms, which saw a ray of hope at the start of June, had to close once again. Many have lost their livelihood and are reeling under financial distress. They are now looking for some subsidies in power from the government to stay afloat.Savla, a resident of Kalyan, said, “There has been a slump in demand since the past few years, and we have reduced the number of machinery as we were not able to bear the expenses. However, the lockdown has taken a complete toll on profits. We are unable to match the expenses for maintenance and rentals. We might have to shut shop to avoid getting debts. Selling everything will hopefully help us earn some money for survival.”Bhiwandi, a small town around 30kms from Mumbai, is known as a power loom hub with more than one lakh small and big power loom factories. Some of the factory owners are facing huge losses that would take around two years to make up; while a few others plan to shut shop.Despite the municipal corporation allowing around 30,000 power looms in non-containment zones to open up, hardly 2,000 opened up for a few days last month due to dearth in demand.Yusuf Hasan, president of Powerloom Federation, said, “There is a huge drop in demand which is a big reason for the slump in business. Moreover, since the past three months none of the power loom owners have manufactured anything. Power companies or the government has not given any concession to industries while we continue to pay huge tariffs despite our factories remaining shut. There needs to be some relief for power loom companies in such times.”Lack of manpower, funds, materials and difficulty in transportation are few of the reasons that are making loom owners sceptical to reopen business.Jivraj Nagariya, a power loom owner from Bhiwandi, said, “On an average, for 20 machines we need a minimum of 10 people for operations, testing and maintenance related work. However, most of the men were migrant labourers who have moved to their hometowns. Some have returned but most of them are scared to come back in such a situation. With hardly 30% production, we cannot make ends meet. For the revival of these factories and for us to get as much business as before, it will take at least another two years. This will leave a huge impact on smaller factories.” Meanwhile, with only a few days of the lockdown left in Bhiwandi, the municipal corporation hopes to allow some power looms to start functioning. “We are still contemplating on the move. We may allow some of the factories in industrial areas to reopen soon; however, this depends on the spread of the virus in these areas,” said an official from BNCMC.With no clarity on ease in restrictions, loom owners say the future looks bleak for the industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhiwandi-power-loom-owners-stare-at-tough-times-ahead/story-r9KK3fUWwRoJyhEWSzRJKI.html
02-07-2020||Mumbai||Businesses restart operations: PPE kits, masks, gloves is new normal for professionals||With the lockdown being relaxed since June 3 and the state allowing some non-essential businesses to open, many are figuring out ways by which they can operate while adhering to the safety measures recommended to prevent the spread of Covid-19.Some salon owners said they would focus on home services in the coming months, with beauticians and barbers wearing personal protective kits (PPE), including masks and gloves, for home visits. Samir Srivastav, chief executive officer of the salon and spa chain Jean Claude Biguine (JCB), said, “While the salons are under the strict scrutiny of their management teams to ensure health and hygiene daily, JCB is shifting gears to ramp up the ‘Home Salon Service’ vertical. JCB will only offer essential home salon services such as haircuts, root touch up, waxing, water-less manicure, pedicure that requires minimum skin contact. Services such as massages, nail bar & other spa treatments have been temporarily restricted.”Ishaan Varma, founder of TC1 EMS, a fitness studio in Lokhandwala said, “For next few months, we will be focusing on HOMERUN – our ‘trainers at your doorstep’ programme. TC1 will bring the gym to your home. Electric muscle stimulator (EMS) enables us to do so. We are dealing with niche clientele and can train them indoor as well as outdoor while taking all the necessary precautions and safety measures to ensure risk-free training. Trainers have been instructed to sanitize their hands and equipment frequently. We came to a standstill along with the world, but this is the time to innovate and add value.”Gyms and fitness clubs have been closed, by order of the state government, since March 13.For real estate brokers and consultants, selling or renting homes via video conference is picking up. Amit Wadhwani from Sai Estates, a property consultancy, said, “The model that we have explored is of leveraging our virtual builder services on generating leads for developers.” Sai Estates generates a virtual visit for a potential home buyer and the developer is charged for this, irrespective of whether or not the buyer chooses that apartment. “This was in the backdrop of the lockdown when visits were the most challenging part. Immovable properties aren’t sold easily without site visits and we took the chance to convert the adversity into opportunity,” said Wadhwani, adding that there has been “keen interest and subscription from the industry”.With the Maharashtra government permitting social functions like marriages and engagements so long as the guest list is limited to 50 people, those providing wedding-related services are also trying to adapt to the new rules.Sneha Sedani, founder of the wedding photography and videography firm Rhythmic Focus, said, “ Currently, I do not have assignments, but have drafted a standard operating procedure that we expect the client to follow. This will include no guests coming near the photographers during the wedding, no guests asking us to click their pictures using their phones since that involves touching. I will also prefer clicking pictures of guests and the bride and groom from a certain distance.”Meanwhile, those involved in maintenance and repair of automobiles say fumigating and maintenance of vehicles has ensured some cash flow for them as many vehicles have developed snags due to being stationary for months. Kartik Shetty, an automobile garage owner from Andheri, said, “We have planned visits strictly by appointments and if possible, we send our mechanics with precautions to conduct initial testing of the vehicle to ensure minimal crowding at my garage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/businesses-restart-operations-ppe-kits-masks-gloves-is-new-normal-for-professionals/story-BcM2nthcYAosjKSU3Ha50K.html

02-07-2020||Mumbai||Visually challenged man donates blood plasma||A month after Nitish Sonawane, a visually impaired music teacher, recovered from Covid-19, he returned to the private city hospital where he was treated and donated blood for the convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) on Monday. CPT is believed to improve the condition of patients infected with the novel coronavirus.Officials at the Vile Parle-based Nanavati Hospital said Sonawane, who travelled almost 15kms from his Mankhurd home, has set an example for thousands of recovered patients who are refuse to donate their blood for CPT.“The whole process took around 40 minutes. Through a needle placed into my vein, blood is drawn out. After extraction of the plasma, the blood is returned into the body. This is done in several cycles,” said Sonawane who plans to donate his plasma again. “There was no reason to let my visual impairment deter my ability to donate plasma. Knowing that I can donate plasma after 15 days, I may return,” he added. Individuals infected with Covid-19 develop antibodies as part of the body’s natural immune response to the foreign pathogen. This antibody invades pathogens and works to eliminate the novel coronavirus in patients. During CPT, these antibodies are infused into the blood of the Covid-19 patients to help to fight against the virus.It was in the second week of May that the 28-year-old was diagnosed with Covid-19 following which he was admitted to Nanavati hospital. He underwent treatment for two weeks before getting discharged on May 31. When Sonawane got to know about the potential benefit of CPT in fighting the virus, he decided to donate his blood. “It was my first day at work post-quarantine when I received a call from the hospital. I informed my superiors (at the music school) that I wish to donate plasma and they immediately agreed. It felt like I was fulfilling my responsibility,” said Sonawane. On June 29, he travelled alone from the Happy Home and School for the Blind—his workplace at Worli - to the hospital and back home. It was also the same day that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray unveiled ‘Project Platina,’ world’s largest plasma therapy trial run by Maharashtra government. More than 500 Covid-19 patients suffering from severe symptoms from across the state are likely to be beneficiaries.Last month, HT had reported that less than 1% of recovered patients were willing to donate blood, posing a hurdle for CPT. Manpreet Sohal, director and chief operating officer, said, “Such good samaritans encourage us to keep fighting this war against the pandemic. Covid-19 survivors like him are a living testament of our grit and determination to eliminate the virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/visually-challenged-man-donates-blood-plasma/story-xaxfLbrEGiMPy40cGqPlfM.html

It has also asked all department heads to take actions such as warning, mentioning it in the confidential reports, issuing strictures and withholding annual increment as a punishment against the staff found deliberately not using Marathi language in official business.The circular was issued by the Marathi language department.“It is mandatory to use Marathi language for official communication and business. Comprehensive guidelines have already been issued for 100% use of Marathi language in administrative work in the past. Despite that, many departments are still found using English language for issuing government resolution, official communication etc. Complaints in this regard have also been raised by the public representatives time and again,” stated the circular.It further said, “The department heads are again asked to issue strict instructions to their subordinates to use Marathi for all official business. They are directed to strictly implement the instructions and also take necessary action against all those found not using Marathi deliberately. They can issue warning, record it in their confidential report, pass strictures and also withholding annual increment as a punishment.”The circular stated that using Marathi will help people easily understand the information and also follow the instructions. In the budget session of the state Assembly in February, the government had passed a law making Marathi language a mandatory subject in all schools of all the boards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/withhold-increment-of-staff-not-using-marathi-for-official-business-deliberately/story-JOfqqBxg8nz127Vr4yixNP.html
02-07-2020||Mumbai||‘Jan-May saw drop in farmer suicides’||The first five months of 2020 have seen a drop in farmer suicides compared to the corresponding period in 2019 and 2018, according to state data.From January to May, 826 farmers died by suicide, with the lowest number in the past five years recorded in April (102). The first three months of 2020 saw 198, 201, 168 suicides, while in May, 157 farmers ended their lives. In 2018 and 2019, the first five months of the calendar year recorded 1,117 and 1,085 suicides, respectively. A total of 2,761 and 2,808 farmer suicides were reported in 2018 and 2019, respectively. A majority of suicides (437) in these five months were reported in 11 districts of Vidarbha, followed by Marathwada (273). Western and northern Maharashtra reported 12 and 104 cases till May 31. The state government released the suicide data after a gap of three months due to Covid-19 lockdown. The figures are compiled by the state’s relief and rehabilitation department which gives compensation to kin of farmers if they commit suicide due to indebtedness.Farm experts and government officials cite various reasons for the drop. Loan waiver, which is expected to benefit more than 30 lakh farmers, was announced in the last week of December. The following months reported fewer suicides, after November and December reported 308 and 242 suicides, respectively, an official from the relief and rehabilitation department said. After the beginning of disbursement in the last week of February, the state disbursed ₹12,000 crore in loan accounts of 19 lakh farmers. The scheme has been temporarily suspended due to pandemic, although 11.12 lakh more farmers are eligible for loan waiver worth ₹8,100 crore. Farm activist Vijay Jawandhia cited multiple reasons for the drop in suicide cases. “Amid the greater challenge of the global pandemic, the farmers must have found psychological solace that their crisis is comparatively insignificant. Another reason may have been the announcement of the loan waiver which is expected to be more than ₹20,000 crore. Many farmers are yet to get the waiver, but they must have gotten this mental relief that they are eligible for it. Another reason is the better prices farmers got for cotton and other agriculture produce last year. Against the minimum support price of ₹5,450 a quintal, the market price had gone up by around ₹1000 a quintal,” he said.Jawandhia however added that the number of suicides should not be linked with their plight as challenges before them haven’t reduced.Agriculture minister Dadaji Bhuse said, “The drop in suicides is a very pleasant thing, but I would not like to take credit for it immediately. We have been doing everything possible for farmers since we came to power, be it loan waiver or crop loans and quick action against those selling faulty seeds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/jan-may-saw-drop-in-farmer-suicides/story-x1jK35zWH7k6I17NhzydDO.html
02-07-2020||Mumbai||AEML sets up help desks for bill related queries||To address the rising number of complaints from consumers regarding exorbitant electricity bills, Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited (AEML) on Wednesday announced that it has taken several measures to address customer queries. Following directives from the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) on Monday, AEML assured consumers that power will not be disconnected over non-payment of dues until all grievances have been addressed.The power utility firm, which has over 27 lakh consumers in Mumbai, has set up 25 dedicated help desks at eight customer care centres in the city. “Consumers can avail the video call facility to speak to customer service teams regarding their queries at all centres. Consumers can call our 24X7 helpline number at 19122 or use WhatsApp to reach us at +919594519122,” AEML said in its statement.Consumers can also avail of the easy monthly installment (EMI) facility via the AEML website. Additionally, they can self-check their bills on the website by uploading account details to cross-verify the meter reading, consumption, and amount payable. AEML is also looking at installing 7 lakh smart meters in the city, which will enable meter reading without human intervention. ”AEML has undertaken various measures such as virtual help desk, EMI facility, as well as proactive awareness initiatives to increase clarity on the billing process among consumers. The consumers will be receiving bills based on their actual consumption with applicable tariff slab benefits. All necessary actions are in accordance with the rules and regulations laid down by the state government and MERC,” said an AEML spokesperson.Following a large number of complaints received from consumers regarding inflated bills, MERC issued guidelines to all utility firms to create robust mechanisms to ensure quick redressal of complaints. It also asked firms to allow consumers to pay bills in three instalments and not disconnect power until the dispute is resolved. With meter-reading suspended in March, consumers were billed based on average consumption in December, January, and February. However, utility firms maintain that actual consumption has been high in those months owing to summer and the lockdown.In a video released on Wednesday, the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) said that if the central government had included electricity in the list of items eligible for aid through the National Disaster Response Fund, customers would have got some respite.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/aeml-sets-up-help-desks-for-bill-related-queries/story-7efdwUbqCy1CPuNYtN623I.html

02-07-2020||Mumbai||Reduce electricity bills for June, PIL urges HC||A public interest litigation (PIL) has been moved before the Bombay high court (HC), seeking directions to state authorities and electricity service providers to suspend recovery of the exorbitant amounts billed to customers for June and late charges, given the lockdown and financial problems being faced by citizens.The PIL has been filed by a Mulund-based businessman who received an electricity bill for June, which was 10 times his average bill. The man approached the court as many other citizens had received similar bills, and there was an apprehension that coercive measures would be taken to recover the amounts due.According to the plea filed by Ravindra Desai through advocate Vishal Saxena, since the nationwide lockdown was imposed, his business activities had come to a standstill. Desai said that despite Mission Begin Again allowing businesses to resume, movement restrictions have prevented him from restarting his work.The petition further states that when Desai received his electricity bill for June, the charges were 10 times that of his previous bills. He noted that like him, many Mumbaiites also received similarly inflated bills which they are not in a position to pay. Additionally, this has led to fear among citizens that the electricity providers would resort to coercive measures to recover the amount and also levy late payment charges which again would put a financial strain on them.In light of these submissions, the petition has prayed for directions to reduce the electricity bill for June and formulate a strategy to avoid such high charges until the situation in the city is back to normal. The petition has also prayed for an interim stay on the payment of the June bill till the matter is decided by the court, and to waive off late payment charges for the same.The petition has been admitted and is expected to come up for hearing in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/reduce-electricity-bills-for-june-pil-urges-hc/story-9JYzAxbBLpTZGQi71Eb8bN.html

By way of interim order, the company had sought immediate refund of ₹833 crore, an undisputed refund quantified under the department’s rectification order of May 28 itself.According to its petition, the telecom major had filed returns in September 2014, which was revised in March 2016 and further revised on February 2017. On October 31, 2019, an assistant commissioner of I-T department passed an assessment order determining the refund of ₹733.80 crore to the company. Vodafone Idea, however, sought rectification of the assessment leading to a litigation, which was finally decided by the apex court on April 29, 2020.Pursuant to the Supreme Court order, the department passed fresh orders on May 28 declaring that the company was entitled to refund of ₹1,009.43 crore for assessment year 2014-15. The assessing officer, however, deducted amount of ₹176.39 crore towards demand for several other years that was pending against the company, thus fixing the net refund at ₹833 crore.On June 11, the company wrote to the principal commissioner of I-T department and sought refund of ₹1,009.43 crore, as determined under the order dated May 28, and later also sent reminders. The firm then moved the high court as it did not get any response and contended that the department was bound to release the refund amount as there is no provision under the I-T Act permitting withholding of the said admitted amount once orders are passed determining the refund.I-T department responded to the petition contending that withholding the refund was justified since huge outstanding demand has been pending against the petitioner. It was also submitted on behalf of the department that section 241A of the I-T Act empowers the department to withhold the refund.The bench of justice RD Dhanuka and justice Madhav Jamdar, however, refused to accept the argument and said the department’s May 28 order has attained finality. It added that the only remaining issue was whether the assessing officer could have adjusted the amount of ₹176.39 crore from the refund or not.The judges added that the issue can be decided later by the court, but as regards the balance amount of ₹833 crore all proceedings have now culminated and the department cannot withhold the refund on the grounds that they may have a future demand against Vodafone Idea arising out of the pending assessment orders. The bench further said I-T officials had no power to withhold refund against undetermined future demands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/refund-833-crore-to-vodafone-idea-hc-tells-i-t-department/story-F2YO96vQre8xB321hbN49O.html
02-07-2020||Mumbai||Expert finds errors in Balbharti’s Class 12 geography textbooks||A city-based Geography expert has pointed out several errors in the Class 12 Geography textbooks under the revised syllabus that were released by the state’s publishing bureau Balbharti in April this year. Vidyadhar Amrite, an academician and former member of the board of studies of the Maharashtra state board, has alleged that the textbook has several error-ridden marks and diagrams. “To begin, in many places dot maps have been used to show population and other values. The usage of these maps, however, is wrong. Each dot in a dot map should indicate a single value while it has been used in the text to represent ratios, density of population etc,” said Amrite. For instance, one such dot map on population distribution states that a dot is equivalent to settlements above 200 persons per square kilometre. In his report sent to Balbharti, Amrite also said that in the world map showing primary activities, agriculture is seen as a prominent activity only in Canada while prominent agricultural regions in India including Maharashtra are not highlighted. Similarly, in a map on regions that produce rice, prominent areas like Java in Indonesia, New Guinea near Australia, Punjab-Sindh in India and Pakistan, and Venezuela in Latin America have not been shown. A map of Lonar, a town in Buldhana district, has been tagged as Lonar city which, Amrite said, is wrong as it is only a town. As per the Census of India, a place is called a city when its population is one lakh or above. As per the 2011 census, the population of Lonar was 23,416. “Balbharti needs to understand that all the maps and diagrams that are published in the textbook have some relevance to the text. When scales on the maps are used wrongly or when there is inadequate information with a diagram, it is of no use for the students,” added Amrite. Vivek Gosavi, director of Balbharti, said, “All our maps and graphs are approved by the survey of India. We are yet to see the objections raised and will look into them. Our subject experts will see the report and will decide on the validity of the same.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/expert-finds-errors-in-balbharti-s-class-12-geography-textbooks/story-ZQgW71ikBEeG1j6WqNiC9L.html
02-07-2020||Mumbai||IMD issues orange alert: Very heavy rain forecast for Friday, Saturday||The weather bureau has predicted widespread heavy to very heavy rain for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) this week.On Wednesday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued an orange alert (very heavy rain warning) for Mumbai for Friday and Saturday, and yellow alert (heavy rain) across isolated areas for Thursday. IMD had earlier predicted a yellow alert for Wednesday, but south Mumbai and the suburbs recorded 0.2mm and 0.1mm rain between 8.30am and 8.30pm, respectively. However, there was a slight increase in rainfall across the city after 8.30pm.“Rain over the west coast, including Mumbai region, is expected to increase with isolated heavy to very heavy rain between July 3 and 5 under the influence of high convergence of strong westerly to southwesterly winds at lower tropospheric levels from the Arabian Sea, which will intensify monsoon currents leading to widespread rainfall. A cyclonic circulation lies over south Gujarat and neighbourhood in lower and mid tropospheric level that will further enhance rainfall for parts of north Konkan, including Mumbai,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general, IMD.Between 8.30am Tuesday and 8.30am Wednesday, Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded 9.4mm rain while 6mm was recorded at Colaba (representative of south Mumbai). HT had, on Wednesday, reported that the city witnessed its lowest June rain in five years.Meanwhile, the city and suburbs recorded the day and night temperature close to the normal mark while moisture levels were high at 89% humidity in south Mumbai and 79% in the suburbs during the day, which fell to 81% and 65% by the evening in south Mumbai and suburbs, respectively.IMD has also predicted an orange alert for Raigad, Ratnagiri, and Sindhudurg between Thursday and Saturday, and a similar warning for Palghar for the weekend.The city and suburbs can expect cloud cover with the possibility of moderate rain through the day and heavy showers at isolated areas, the forecast said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/imd-issues-orange-alert-very-heavy-rain-forecast-for-friday-saturday/story-nZtWELvbAjULEXQNNffraN.html

02-07-2020||City||Rape accused undertrial tests positive for Covid||A 26-year-old rape accused was in judicial custody since past one-and-a-half year in Thane jail tested positive for Covid-19 while undergoing treatment for stomach infection at Sir JJ Hospital. This has led to panic situation in the jail as he was lodged there till June 15. Meanwhile, his appeal for bail in Thane sessions court has been rejected due to his Covid status.H Ahirrao, superintendent of Thane jail, said, “The prisoner was suffering from stomach infection which worsened around June 16 and we took him to Sir JJ Hospital. He did not have any Covid-19 symptoms. Later, during the treatment he tested positive.” Thane jail has around 3,000 prisoners. Ahirrao said all prisoners are screened regularly for symptoms and added, “The prisoner was not infected here. We check for symptoms and conduct timely health check-ups. Our officials or doctors who are working inside the jail are scanned for temperature and oxygen levels every time they leave or enter.”Salim Yusuf Shaikh, the advocate of the accused, however, said the accused’s 70-year-old mother has been running from pillar to post to know about her son’s health condition, but have not been given any clarity. He said neither the jail authorities nor the hospital has given her any information, hence they had appealed for bail.Shaikh said, “On June 19, Kalwa police visited my client’s house and informed that his health condition is deteriorated due to stomach infection. He was shifted from Thane Civil hospital to Sir JJ Hospital. We tried to apply for bail so that his mother could meet him, which was not possible over the past five months due to pandemic. Recently we got information from jail officials that he was shifted to St George Hospital in Mumbai as his Covid-19 report came positive. The judge did not grant him bail as he has tested positive for Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rape-accused-undertrial-tests-positive-for-covid/story-LPR9bRHMDOK97VtatbPBfJ.html
02-07-2020||Mumbai||Sanitary napkins could be declared as essential commodity: Centre to HC||The centre has informed the Bombay high court that it may consider declaring sanitary napkins as an essential commodity after public interest litigation was filed in this regard. The petitioners, law students, in light of the lockdown and Covid pandemic had sought directions for sanitary napkins to be made an essential commodity and be provided through the public distribution system.The division bench headed by chief justice Dipankar Datta while hearing the petition filed by the students Nikita Gore and Vaishnavi Gholave through advocate Vinod Sangvikar on June 5 was informed that due to the pandemic situation most outlets dispensing sanitary napkins were shut. As a result of many women from the poor and marginalized sections of the society were unable to maintain personal hygiene due to the non-availability of sanitary napkins.In light of these submissions, the petitioners had sought directions to the government to recognize sanitary napkins as an essential commodity by making changes to the Essential Commodity Act, 1955 and also sought effective implementation of the ‘Menstrual Hygiene Management National Guidelines, 2015’.On June 5, after the state submitted that any addition in the Act was the prerogative of the centre, the bench had directed the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) to respond to the plea within three weeks.In response, MoHFW under-secretary Dilip Kumar Sahu submitted an affidavit last week which said that the petitioners were making sweeping allegations about the government machinery not functioning properly during the lockdown. The affidavit stated that MoHFW has been implementing the 2015 programme for promoting menstrual hygiene for girls between 10 and 19 years of age and states and union territories have a decentralised process for procuring sanitary napkins through a competitive bidding process ensuring quality standards.Sahu further stated in the affidavit, “I most humbly submit that the decision to bring sanitary napkins under the essential commodities may be done after understanding the current market scenario, demand-supply gap, if any; also keeping in mind the various options of brands, quality, specification, costing and preferences of the beneficiaries.”The affidavit added that a decision could be taken after consulting the Consumer Affairs Ministry and involving all stakeholders.As per the directions of the court on June 5, the petitioners have to file a rejoinder to the affidavit after which the petition will be heard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sanitary-napkins-could-be-declared-as-essential-commodity-centre-to-hc/story-Jyd0mSzfJfHOXcCaQ2hlVP.html
02-07-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray offers prayers at Vitthal temple||Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray performed special prayers at the Lord Vitthal temple in Pandharpur on Wednesday morning on the occasion of Ashadhi Ekadashi.“I (Uddhav Thackeray) prayed to the Lord that now I want to see magic. Show me that magic because as humans our hands are clasped. We don’t have medicine or anything else. How to live with a mask on our faces? Start destroying corona from today and give the entire world a happy and healthy life,” tweeted the chief minister’s office (CMO). “I also prayed to bring happiness for the agrarian community and fulfil all desires and wishes of people of the state.”This was the first time Thackeray offered prayers at the Pandharpur temple as the CM of Maharashtra. He was accompanied by his wife, Rashmi, and son, Aaditya, who is also the state’s environment and tourism minister. It is a long-standing tradition in Maharashtra for the CM and his spouse to attend the morning prayers at the temple on Ashadi Ekadashi.Despite the Shiv Sena being part of the previous governments, the Thackeray family never took part in this tradition, as no member had contested any election till recently.Last year, Aaditya was the first member of the family to contest and win the Assembly elections. This year, Thackeray, too, got elected as a member of the legislative Council to retain his post as the CM.Thackeray also held a review meeting at Pandharpur late Wednesday evening. He took stock of the situation and also directed authorities to prepare a development plan for Pandharpur. “We are ready to provide all support for development of Pandharpur. Local authorities should prepare a development plan which will be approved by the state government,” Thackeray said in the meeting. He also issued a cheque of ₹5 crore as government grant for Pandharpur.After performing special prayers, he also urged devotees not to visit the temple this year and stay at home. “For the sake of health, I urge devotees and people at large to avoid visiting Pandharpur temple. Instead, perform all your prayers by staying at home,” he said.Traditionally, lakhs of warkaris (pilgrims) – devotees of Lord Vitthal – undertake the wari (pilgrimage) on foot from across the state and reach Pandharpur on Ashadhi Ekadashi. Local authorities decided to keep the celebrations low-key this year because of the Covid-19 outbreak. This year, the wari, with the padukas (footprints) of saints Dnyaneshwar, Tukaram, and seven others was taken to Pandharpur by bus with a limited number of people, and not on foot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cm-uddhav-thackeray-offers-prayers-at-vitthal-temple/story-ryLoG0VMwfedeo8HJehSQO.html
02-07-2020||Mumbai||No Lalbaugcha Raja for first time in 86 yrs of its existence||This Ganpati season, the by-lanes of Lalbaug in south Mumbai’s Chinchpokli will be bereft of the usual rush of devotees waiting for a view of their favourite elephant God. For the first time in the 86 years of its existence, the Lalbaugcha Raja Ganpati Mandal (committee) will not have an idol this year, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Instead, an 11-day blood and plasma donation drive will be held at the Lalbaugcha Raja pandal from August 22. The donation camp will aid health workers in the city in their fight against the virus, said Balasaheb Sudam Kamble, president of the committee. While the decision is in the interest of the physical-distancing norms set by the government, devotees of ‘bappa’, as he is fondly referred to, are not too happy. Many have thronged the pandal every year for a ‘darshan’ (viewing) or to ask for a ‘mannat’ (wish) but this year, they will be deprived of the trip. Smita Mestry, a 28-year-old IT professional, has been visiting the Raja every year. To not be able to visit him this year has upset her. “I have a lot of faith in him. At least they should have placed a smaller idol and allowed a virtual darshan for the devotees,” said the Andheri resident.The decision was not so simple, according to Santosh Kambli, the chief murtikar or sculptor of Lalbaugcha Raja. “In most other sarvajanik mandals, there are two idols. A smaller one for the puja and the bigger one is for darshan. But in Lalbaug, the 14-feet idol is the one for both,” said Kambli, whose family has been making the idol for Lalbaugcha Raja for three generations and has held a patent for the idol since 2011. The Maharashtra government had issued guidelines for Ganesh pandals and set the height for all idols at 4 feet. “We cannot reduce the height of the idol as we have been doing puja for 86 years. As we could not build the 14-feet idol, we decided to not have an idol at all,” said Kambli, who has lost around 50% of his business owing to the pandemic. His 79-year-old father, Ratnakar, who usually adds final touches to the idol and draws the eyes, is sorely missing the ‘bappa’ this year. “He [Lalbaugcha Raja] is not just an idol that we make. He is an emotion for our family,” said Kambli. Established in 1934 by the fishermen community of Kolis in Chinchpokli, Lalbaugcha Raja or ‘Mannat cha Raja’ (loosely translated as the wish-granting king), has since come to symbolise the Ganpati festival in the city.Until this year, the mandal had managed to brave the Emergency (1975-77) and the Mumbai riots (1992-93) to set up the 14-feet idol every year. Over 1.5 crore devotees from various parts of the state throng the pandal through the 11 days in hopes of getting their wishes granted. The committee also receives large donations from devotees that are then used in several public service activities. In 2019 alone, the committee received donations to the tune of ₹12 crore.“The decision to not organise the Ganesh festival this year is understandable as we need to focus on the society at present. But for someone who has not missed visiting the Ganesh idol at Lalbaugh fort the past 47 years, I will miss being part of the festivities this time round,” said Ajinkya Mhatre, 68, a retired banker and Borivali resident. For Hassan Khan, 30, visiting the Lalbaugcha Raja every year with friends is an emotion. “Ganpati festival is the biggest one in the city and Lalbaugcha Raja is a flavour of the festival, which will be missing this year,” said Khan, a Goregaon resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-lalbaugcha-raja-for-first-time-in-86-yrs-of-its-existence/story-LrhajG7Mv5AL15JKHDYPpO.html
02-07-2020||City||Faisal Farooq bail plea: HC asks police lawyer to produce L-G permission||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Wednesday said the stay granted on the release of Faisal Farooq, principal of Rajdhani School who was booked in connection with the northeast Delhi riots, would be “vacated”, if the police’s lawyer does not produce the permission granted to him by Delhi Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal to challenge the bail granted to Farooq.The court also said that the DCP, legal cell does not have the power to appoint a lawyer to represent the police without approval of the higher authorities.Justice Suresh Kumar Kait said the counsel, who had filed the plea, has not shown any document highlighting authorisation from the LG representing Delhi police in the matter and granted time to advocate Amit Mahajan, appearing for the Delhi Police, to file the letters of communication .The court was hearing a plea by the Delhi Police seeking to cancel Faisal’s bail granted by the lower court. On an earlier occasion, the hearing had seen exchange of words between solicitor general Tushar Mehta and the Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra who submitted that the Central Government has no power to file this petition against the June 20 order of the trial court.Later, ASG Aman Lekhi had appeared in place of the SG who submitted that in this situation, out of disgust, he seeks permission to withdraw his name from the petition.On Wednesday, the issue was again raised where the additional standing counsel (Delhi government) Rajesh Mahajan told the court that ASG Lekhi had no permission from the LG to appear in the matter.He said the counsels have to show the grant of authorisation to file the plea as the L-G can’t approve and give clearance without the aid of the Delhi government council of ministers.This irked the court which came down heavily on both the sides for not solving the issue even when it was informed on the last date that the ASG would appear and the matter was resolved.Advocate Amit Mahajan, appearing for the Delhi police, said that after SG Mehta, ASG Aman Lekhi was also “getting embarrassed” to appear before the court due to the controversy. He said that now instead of the ASG, he would appear and gave some documents to the court showing grant of permission. He said that Rajesh Deo, deputy commissioner of police, (legal), had authorised him to file the plea.However, the court said that the DCP does not have such powers to appoint someone without approval from the higher authorities. He said that the documents filed do not show the permission from the LG and also expressed displeasure on this conduct.The police, in the petition filed through advocates Amit Mahajan and Rajat Nair, have challenged the trial court’s June 20 order, which granted bail to Farooq on the ground that it had prima facie not been established that he was present at the spot at the time of incident.The Delhi Police had on June 3 filed a charge sheet before the court against Farooq and 17 others in connection with a building being gutted during the northeast Delhi riots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/faisal-farooq-bail-plea-hc-asks-police-lawyer-to-produce-l-g-permission/story-lYx4At4KjSDvxpXGSb3j5H.html
02-07-2020||Mumbai||Maha Covid-19 cases rise by 5,537, highest in a day; toll is 8,053||Maharashtra on Wedn-esday recorded its sharpest single-day jump in Covid-19 cases with 5,537 more infections, taking the count to 180,298. The toll crossed 8,000 to touch 8,053 after the addition of 198 fatalities on Wednesday. Mumbai saw 1,487 new cases and 75 fatalities, taking the tally to 79,145 and toll to 4,631. The state health department has, however, said of the latest fatalities, 69 are from the past 48 hours, while the remaining 129 are from the past few weeks.Many district and civic administrations in the state have announced a reimposition of stricter and curfew-like lockdowns for the next eight to 10 days in the backdrop of the sudden spike in cases. Besides the Thane, Mira-Bhayander, Kalyan-Dombivli corporations, districts like Nashik, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg have imposed stricter lockdown norms. In Mumbai, too, police have prevented people from stepping out of the house unnecessarily. Few other districts like Jalgaon are planning such restrictions for a few days to contain the spread of the virus. In fact, many districts have reported an increased growth rate of cases in rural parts, rather than in urban areas, after activities were opened up on May 22. For instance, in rural Jalgaon, cases rose from 252 on May 21 to 2,652 till Tuesday, while in Aurangabad rural the spike was from 20 cases to 1,011. In Nashik and Solapur rural, cases jumped to 877 and 314 from 113 and 10 respectively. The growth in cases in the corporation areas of these districts was comparatively less, data revealed. Water supply and sanitation minister and Jalgaon’s guardian minister Gulabrao Patil said the social taboo about the virus is making the task of tracing its spread difficult. “Infected people report very late due to the fear of ill-treatment in society. Of the 234 deaths, 70 were reported in 14 to 42 hours of their admission and most of them had comorbidities. People have been hiding the symptoms, making it very difficult in tracing and early treatment. This led to the rise in number of patients and deaths too. We are now planning awareness programmes, besides aggressive tracing with the help of village-level machinery,” he said. Laxminarayan Mishra, collector, Ratnagiri, said stricter lockdown was imposed for eight days, after they found large-scale violations of norms. “The number of active cases has reached 140 after we found a rise in cases last week. Operation break the chain is to restrict the social transmission of the virus,” he said. The reversal of the lockdown at local levels has put a break on the state government’s plan of opening up activities. “There were plans of allowing more staff in red zones and interdistrict transport services in non-red zones as part of our Mission Begin Again, but the sudden surge in case put a spanner in the works. Local authorities have approached us for stricter restrictions of lockdown for the next few days in their bid to contain the spread. Besides the stricter lockdown, local authorities have been asked to ramp up health infrastructure and plan aggressive tracing of patients,” said a state government official.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday had said that while extending the lockdown, the government was planning a few more relaxations in a calibrated manner. The decision by local authorities of making the restriction stricter has created confusion among the people. Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) state chief, Chandrakant Patil, criticised the government for the contradictory decisions by state and local bodies and has asked government to bring clarity on the policy. Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, public health consultant, said that civic bodies and district collectors should pull up the sleeves and go chasing the virus. “Government appears to be confused over relaxations from the ongoing lockdown as the local authorities and state are not on the same page on this front. It is easy in the rural areas to contain the virus, but it is spreading rapidly in some districts because of the lack of effort. Even in the rest of Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the tracing of suspected cases should be done aggressively. Mumbai could succeed in containing it, only because of aggressive tracing done in areas like Dharavi and Koliwada,” he said. Dr Pattiwar said that civic bodies and district authorities should now spare health workers from the contact-tracing job as they are overburdened and should instead rope in volunteers and NGOs. Meanwhile, the state’s case fatality rate (CFR) dropped to 4.47% from 4.69% on June 16, the day on which there was an addition of 1,328 deaths as part of the reconciliation of data. The CFR was 3.79% on June 15. The recovery rate slightly dropped to 51.67% after 93,154 patients were reported to have recovered from the infection. The recovery rate was 52.59% on June 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-covid-19-cases-rise-by-5-537-highest-in-a-day-toll-is-8-053/story-U22gHRBKPCjzgwzrEFFtxI.html
02-07-2020||Mumbai||10 wards account for 64% of cases in a week, cause for worry for BMC||Ten wards, which reported 5,315 or 64% of the total cases (8,242) from June 22 to June 29, remain crucial for the city, a week after Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said the number of Covid-19 cases may have plateaued in Mumbai. For the past few days, the number of daily new cases is in the range of 1,000 to 1,300, which indicates it may have reached a plateau. However, while the civic body has managed to check the outbreak in initial hot spots such as Worli and Dharavi, these 10 wards, with a sharp surge in cases, remain cause for concern. The wards cover Bhandup, Mulund, Malad, Andheri East, Borivli, Ghatkopar, Andheri West and Kandivli in the suburbs, and Dadar, Mahim and Parel in central Mumbai. In this period, the highest number of cases (829) was reported in S ward, which covers Bhandup, Vikhroli, Kanjurmarg and parts of Powai, taking the ward’s total to 4,381 on June 29 from 3,552 on June 22. Santosh Dhonde, assistant municipal commissioner of S ward, said, “There is a spike in the number of cases because of three reasons. Firstly, there is a lot of movement due to relaxation of lockdown. Secondly, we have increased screening and testing. We are easily screening more than 1,000 citizens daily by organising 10 medical camps daily. Also, now cases are coming from high-rises due to relaxations. Earlier, the ratio of slum and high-rises was 80:20, but it has now become 50:50.”BMC recently launched a rapid action plan to curb spread in the suburbs, including Dahisar, Borivli, Kandivli, Malad and Mulund. Another area of concern is P-N ward (Malad), which was the second highest (675) in the cases reported in the past one week. A BMC official from the ward said, “The number of cases has increased, considering we have increased screening under the rapid action plan launched on June 22.”The other three wards that are in the top 10 list include K-E ward covering Andheri East that was third highest in the number of cases (621), taking its total to 5,242 from 4,621, followed by T ward covering Mulund reporting 592 cases in the past one week and R-C ward covering Borivli (521) cases.Vishwas Shankarwar, deputy municipal commissioner of zone 7 covering the western suburbs, said, “We have conducted 70 medical camps since the past one week as part of the rapid action plan and have identified 191 people suspected to be having Covid-19. Of these, over 25 have tested positive, and other reports are pending.”Shankarwar said, “We are not seeing an unusual spike, but one has to also consider that these are the areas where cases were not being reported earlier. It is due to this that we are now seeing those cases coming out, and also in the case of R-Central ward, we are finding many cases from hospitals who go for treatment of non-Covid-19 issues, but are later found to be positive. However, overall, there is no unusual spike.”Among the other wards in the top 10 list are N ward covering Ghatkopar with 442 cases in the past one week, followed by K-W ward covering Andheri West reporting 423 cases, R-S ward covering Kandivli reporting 416 cases, F-S ward covering Parel, Lalbaug reporting 408 cases and G-N ward covering Dadar, Mahim and Dharavi reporting 388 cases.The eastern suburbs (six wards) covering areas such as Mulund, Bhandup, Kanurjmarg, Kurla, Ghatkopar, Mankhurd and Govandi reported 2,593 cases last week, followed by the western suburbs (nine wards) covering areas such as Dahisar, Borivli, Kandivli, Malad, Goregaon, Andheri and Bandra reporting around 3,585 cases. Central Mumbai covering areas such as Parel, Worli, Dadar, Matunga, Dharavi and Sewri reported 1,277 cases. Meanwhile, in the past one week, 817 fresh cases were reported in south Mumbai that includes areas namely Colaba, Churchgate, Charni Road, Kalbadevi, Malabar Hills, Nagpada, Byculla, Mazagaon. On Wednesday, Mumbai recorded 1,487 fresh cases and 75 new deaths. The city’s case tally rose to 79,145, while the toll touched 4,631. The number of discharged patients in Mumbai is 44,791, with a recovery rate of 56.59 %. Further, active cases stood at 29,715. The fatality rate as of Wednesday was 5.85%, and doubling rate of 42 days. Starting Wednesday, BMC launched its sero-surveillance drive in densely populated slums of Ganpat Patil Nagar in Dahisar and a slum pocket in Govandi. The survey will also be conducted in Dadar, Matunga and Wadala.Sero-surveillance is conducted to diagnose individuals for antibodies of Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19, and monitor the spread of the virus. During sero-surveillance, residents undergo blood tests to detect the presence of IgG antibodies, which develop against Sars-CoV-2. For this, a total of 10,000 blood samples will be collected.BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal on Wednesday also issued a circular with guidelines for salons and beauty parlours, stating that BMC, from time to time, may take localised decisions to regulate opening of non-essential shops. The BMC chief also added that for shopping of non-essential goods, citizens should go to nearby shops, adding that long-distance travel will not be permitted, reiterating the Mumbai Police’s order of citizens not travelling beyond 2km for purchase of non-essential goods. However, BMC has said that exceptions will be allowed on humanitarian grounds and medical reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/10-wards-account-for-64-of-cases-in-a-week-cause-for-worry-for-bmc/story-bggbNyVsXVVgcZeEfhCp7O.html

02-07-2020||Delhi||At capacity, Chhatarpur centre to dish out 100k meals a day||New Delhi: More than 1,000 ‘sewadars’ of the Radha Soami Satsang Beas (RSSB) will be involved in cooking and packing meals on a daily basis when the temporary Covid care facility set up in the organisation’s Chhatarpur branch is occupied to its capacity of 10,200 patients. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe meals will be cooked at the institution’s in-house mess — a short walk from the facility — and the costs will be borne entirely by the RSSB, said Sonalika Jiwani, Mehrauli sub-divisional magistrate (SDM).The meals will be spread over five courses — tea, breakfast, lunch, evening tea and snacks, and dinner.Over 3,000 beds have been set up, as of Wednesday afternoon. However, the first batch of patients are yet to be sent to the facility.But the preparations at the RSSB continued unabated. On Wednesday, doctors of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) — tasked with managing the facility — considered patients’ nutritional requirements and submitted a menu to district authorities.The proposed menu had different breakfast and vegetable options for all seven days of the week. “The morning tea will be accompanied by ‘kadha’. The patients will also be served a spoon of chayavanprash and giloy juice everyday,” Jiwani said.Since June 14, when work first began at the facility, the RSSB has been preparing meals for workers employed here, the volunteering sewadars and ITBP personnel. As of Wednesday, meals for more than 2,000 such staffers, including 900 workers and 700 ITBP personnel, were being prepared in the ashram mess.“The food is simple, but is timely and served to us with dignity,” said Vijay Kumar Yadav, an electrician hired to fix wiring at this facility.CAPABLE OF COOKING LARGE QUANTITIESAccording to officials as well as RSSB office bearers, the mess can fix up meals for around 300,000 persons every day.“While previously we cooked meals for large number of people for a few days three times every year, we can also cook meals for an extended period of time if needed,” said an RSSB office-bearer, who asked not to be named.For 70 days during the lockdown, staff at the institution cooked and packed 275,000 meals to be distributed to people in Delhi.When the facility is occupied at its maximum capacity, it will be preparing food not just for patients, but also ITBP personnel, including doctors, nurses, volunteers and other workers.RSSB office bearers said that a relatively small number of sewadars will be involved in cooking, and most of the 1,000 volunteers in the mess will be involved in packing. “We’ll be packing the food in disposable packets to be distributed to each patient,” an office bearer said.Outside the mess, meal packets will be handed over to government volunteers and workers.From there, the food packets will be wheeled to each of the 116 sections where the patients will be housed. “Each section will have at least two volunteers. The patients who are able to walk and help themselves can collect the meals when it arrives in their sections. For those who can’t make it to that point, volunteers will serve them in bed,” Jiwani said.Once patients are done with their meals, they can either leave their used disposable utensils at a single point in their section, or volunteers will collect them from their beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-s-biggest-covid-facility-to-dish-out-100-000-meals-a-day/story-lkrQlswn5jC6YEPbu0zRrO.html
02-07-2020||Education||Private schools’ body says lockdown over, demands full fee; govt says not yet||Private schools in Delhi are free to charge annual and development charges besides tuition fee from July since lockdown is over now, a body representing 400 unaided schools has written to the Delhi government. The directorate of education (DoE), however, has clarified that an order issued on April 18, barring private schools from charging any other component except tuition fee till lockdown is in effect, is still in force. “Our April 18 order is still valid. The government has not lifted the lockdown completely as of now. There has been some relaxation and the schools do not fall under that ambit. The schools cannot charge anything other than the tuition fee,” said Binay Bhushan, director of the DoE. The Delhi government had announced on June 26 that all schools will stay closed until July 31.In its letter to the government on June 25, the Action Committee of Unaided Recognised Private Schools --- an umbrella body of over 400 schools -- said private institutions are finding it difficult to pay salaries of teachers and other staff and managing expenses such as maintenance of buildings and transport.“Your order clearly mentions that this restriction imposed by the government is a temporary phase and the same shall be withdrawn once the lockdown period is withdrawn. Now since the lockdown is officially withdrawn by both the central government as well as by the government of Delhi NCT and the process of unlocking has started, the schools in accordance with the order are free to charge annual fees and development charges on pro rata basis effective from July, 2020,” said SK Bhattacharya, president of the committee, in the letter.The Centre on Monday issued guidelines for the second of a three-phase plan aimed at lifting restrictions imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The fresh guidelines said schools, colleges and coaching institutions will remain closed till July 31.As per the April 18 order of the Delhi government, “Annual and development charges can be charged from parents on a pro rata basis, only on a monthly basis after the completion of the lockdown.” The order added that schools can only charge tuition fee. The annual fee is a sum schools charge parents over and above the tuition fee. While the majority of schools charge it once a year, some take the payment half-yearly or quarterly.The school’s body, however, argued that they do not have sufficient funds to meet necessary expenditure. “Some of the schools are complaining that they do not have money to pay salaries of their staff. The schools authorities are ready to give concessions to parents who are facing financial constraints,” Bhattacharya said.Aprajita Gautam, president of Delhi parents association, said she has received several complaints from parents against private schools demanding charges other than the tuition fees from July. “Many parents have approached us, complaining about schools asking for annual fees and other charges from this month. There is a lot of confusion among parents since schools are saying that the Delhi government’s April 18 order is not valid any more. The government should issue fresh orders in this regard,” she said.Prince (goes by first name), whose two children are enrolled in a private school in Janakpuri in classes 8 and 6, said that the school has demanded annual fee and development charges with July fees.“The school has asked us pay an annual fee and development fee with the tuition fee in July, saying that the Delhi government’s order is not valid since unlock has been announced. My shop remained shut two months due to the lockdown. Even after opening the shop, I am not being able to earn much. I won’t be able to pay the entire amount,” he said.Another parent of a class 5 student at a private school in Jamia Nagar said, “The school has uploaded the fee structure of July mentioning annual charges and other components. We won’t pay the fee till the Delhi government issues a clarification.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pvt-schools-body-says-lockdown-over-demands-full-fee-govt-says-not-yet/story-hQc998ueCRWsuIyqlzkbjO.html
02-07-2020||Gurugram||Unlock 2.0: Gurugram RWAs told to maintain status quo, allow helps to enter||As part of ‘Unlock 2’, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has reiterated its directions, issued over the last two months, and asked resident welfare associations (RWAs) in the city to continue to allow domestic helps to enter, regulate walking in common areas and parks, identify vulnerable residents and keep details of coronavirus (Covid-19) patients in their areas confidential.The order, by MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh, was issued in this regard on late Tuesday.Singh’s order reiterated that RWAs need to permit entry of all domestic help workers unless they are coming from or going to a containment zone or large outbreak region. He further said that walks in common areas and parks “are to be restricted by staggering the morning and evening times, between 5am to 10pm on basis of odd-even house number scheme, to avoid crowding and maintain social distancing.” He also said that games requiring teams and group activities will continue to remain closed.Two weeks ago, during a press conference, and in communication to RWAs via Whatsapp groups, Singh had said that the civic body seeks their help to identify pregnant women, senior citizens, persons with co-morbidities and children up to 10 years of age in their respective areas; putting up home isolation notices on behalf of MCG at residences of positive cases; deputing security guards to assist regulation of entry and exit in containment zones; coordinating with the MCG for lifting bio-medical waste of residents in home isolation; establishing isolation centres within their respective area, and maintaining confidentiality on details of Covid-19 positive cases and only sharing them with health department officials. Singh’s Tuesday order reiterated all these directions.The order, though, said that RWAs need “to adhere to the guidelines issued by the government in letter and spirit, failing which penal provisions as given in MHA (Ministry of Home Affairs) notifications will be attracted against the responsible office bearers of the RWAs.”His order further stated that complaints from residents about RWAs introducing measures in violation of the MHA order “will be investigated thoroughly and action will be taken against the office bearers of the concerned RWAs wherever necessary.”“The directions have been issued to ensure there is no confusion among RWAs that guidelines issued previously by the MCG have been discontinued. We will continue to both extend and seek their support throughout the coronavirus outbreak,” said Singh.A comment from an RWA could not be received by the time the copy went to publish.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-as-city-unlocks-mcg-reminds-rwas-of-covid-duties/story-IqlhLHo2LTLWulhfuxQZQJ.html
02-07-2020||Gurugram||Two try cutting open ATM in Palam Vihar, give up, flee after 30 minutes||Two men allegedly barged into the ATM kiosk of a private bank in a market in Palam Vihar on Tuesday morning, tried to cut open the machine using a gas cutter for close to half an hour, before eventually giving up and escaping from the spot. The entire sequence of events was caught in the CCTV installed inside the ATM.Police said they have recovered footage from the CCTV in which the suspects can be seen entering the ATM and trying to tamper with the machine. In the footage, one of the suspects — wearing a cap, a face mask and carrying a backpack — is seen entering the kiosk, closely followed by the second man, whose face is covered with a helmet. Police said the incident took place at 5.29am on Tuesday and was reported to them in the afternoon. A preliminary probe has revealed that the concerned bank had outsourced the security of the ATM to a third party. A police officer, privy to the investigations, said, “No security guard had been stationed at the kiosk. The suspects were carrying tools, including a gas cutter, which they tried using to cut open the machine. After about 30 minutes , they abandoned their plan and fled. It seems that they were either amateurs or there was some issue with the gas cutter that they had got. No cash was stolen.”Police said several teams had been formed to try and trace the two suspects. A case has been registered against the suspects under sections 380 (theft in dwelling house) and 511 (punishment for attempting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life or other imprisonment) of Indian Penal Code at Palam Vihar police station on Wednesday.Wednesday was the fourth incident of suspects targeting an ATM in the city since the lockdown restrictions were eased in May. Last week, an army officer and his friend were arrested for allegedly stealing Rs 1.29 lakh from an ATM using an electronic cutter on Sohna road in Badshahpur area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-try-cutting-open-atm-in-palam-vihar-give-up-flee-after-30-minutes/story-Y4MZcS0EHzbYR0FAbdlsnK.html

The doctors who treated the woman praised her grit and positive attitude which is why despite being in the fourth stage of cancer the woman never required a ventilator or an intensive care unit (ICU). With the help of a good diet and medicines, the woman fought the infection and has now been discharged after a month of successful treatment.The woman was admitted on May 24, 2020, and discharged on June 25. The 65-year old was mentally stressed when her neighbours decided to bring her into Sassoon hospital, knowing she did not have any relatives to help her.She was given good diet, medicines and two blood transfusions. With utmost care and treatment given by doctors and assisted by staff nurses who bathe her daily and fed her food, there was a dramatic improvement in the patient.The patient was initially admitted for cancer treatment and on further inquiry, it was found that she was a resident of a containment zone. A swab test was taken for Covid-19, for which she, unfortunately, tested positive.The 65-year old was then shifted to the Covid building where she was given excellent care by a team of doctors.A doctor that treated her praised her for a positive attitude that did not budge even when her weekly reports tested positive three more times for the virus until she finally tested negative for Covid-19.In addition to the Covid-19 treatment, the hospital staff had to convince the initially untraceable relatives of the woman. The hospital staff along with social worker Nandbothi Pagare finally traced her relatives who had to be guided to continue further cancer treatment of the woman. She is now receiving palliative treatment as she is now in the fourth stage of cancer.Dr Ramesh Bhosale, head of the department of obstetrics and gynaecology said, “She was earlier brought to the hospital for cancer treatment as she was referred from some other hospital. During the treatment process she started showing some symptoms of Covid-19 and when we found that she had come from Patil Estate, Shivajinagar, a containment zone we got her tested for Covid-19. It is a rare case that despite her age and cancer, the woman fought the virus which is why she never required a ventilator. She was only given blood transfusions and oxygen therapy which is an inspiring story. As she did not have any other comorbidity, it helped her fight the virus.”A team of doctors who treated the woman and counselled the woman’s relatives included superintendent of the hospital Dr Ajay Taware, Dr Uma Wankhede, Dr Arun Ambadkar, Dr Shashikala Sangle, Dr Rohidas Borse and Dr Chakor Vora.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/stage-4-cancer-patient-defeats-covid-19-discharged-from-sassoon/story-t7RhsVOEIv3xiDAUPUo9jO.html
02-07-2020||Pune||Covid-19 victim’s body cremated after 72 hours, relatives untraceable||The story of a 46-year-old man who died due to the Covid-19 infection and had to await cremation for 72 hours pending tracking of relatives was the first of its kind in the city, according to the Sassoon General Hospital staff.The reasons for the failure of his relatives to show up or turning incommunicado are not known. While the phone number provided by the relative who had come to admit the patient on June 9 was unreachable, the contact address was given by him also led to a dead-end, according to officials of two police stations.The officials of Faraskhana police station and officials of Khadak police station tried to trace the relative, but with no success. The body, meanwhile, awaited cremation in the hospital morgue.While the personal details of the person are not known, one of the reasons for which the relatives could have failed to show up could be the fear of Covid-19.The rules of burial and the precautions should be explained to the relatives of the victims of Covid-19 by the administration as well as local politicians, according to Dr Avinash Bhondawe, president of Indian Medical Association (IMA) Maharashtra.“This is tragic and sad. This is the fault of the administration. But it cannot be denied that all government officials are overloaded with work. The management of ambulances and funeral services should also be made online just like bed availability. Maybe an application can be built for this purpose. If the relatives of the patients are not ready to come forward, it is because they are scared. When relatives are scared of taking care of the dead, the hospitals are in trouble in such cases. The procedure is explained without the law; it should be done without high-handedness. I think these public leaders, corporators, MPs should take bold steps regarding raising awareness about these things. There are guidelines but they should be more practical. The rules should be more human,” said Dr Bhondawe.The body was finally taken by a team of PMC officials from Sassoon General Hospital around 7pm on Tuesday and cremated. The relatives continue to remain untraceable.“If the body is kept wrapped using proper precaution as per ICMR guidelines and in a body bag, I do not see why this should be an issue. Nobody should be in contact with the body, is the point. The face, hands or any part should not be touched. I do not see why that should be an issue,” said Dr Abhijit More, co-convenor of the Jan Arogya Abhiyaan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/covid-19-victim-s-body-cremated-after-72-hours-relatives-untraceable/story-P89hXDhx6q3lM87S9MiiTN.html
02-07-2020||Pune||Month after Unlock: Spike in Covid cases, deaths an inevitability Pune unable to escape||As Unlock 1.0 completed one month on Wednesday, Pune has seen a massive rise in the number of Covid positive cases along with deaths, an indication that increased movement of people resulted in the spike.The city has started opening up as a part of the unlocking process amidst the Covid-19 pandemic with an increase in commercial activity and relaxations coming in. Along with the containment zone, as the people have started mingling in, the city is seeing a rise in the number of cases coming from non-containment zones.Although Centre and the state government announced Unlock 1.0 from June 1, major relaxations such as reopening of private offices, auto-rickshaws and cab were allowed to operate a week later.According to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), the Covid progressive positive cases have surged from 6,529 on June 1 to 17,228 cases on June 30, a rise of 37 per cent in the number of patients. At the same time, the number of deaths reported in June stood at 330 compared to 228 in May and 85 in April.Dr Raman Gaikwad, infectious disease specialist working in a private hospital said, “The increase in the number of cases is not as explosive as it was expected. Until now all predictions about the number of cases estimated have been wrong. Fortunately, the city hospitals have been able to manage patients and there is no shortfall in the number of beds too. However, the government must focus on the use of masks which is most essential when it is planning to unlock the city. As of now, it looks like the virus will only die its natural death eventually and people can only avoid coming in contact with anyone even when they are in public places by using masks and avoiding touching their face.”With increasing cases, the civic body has also increased its testing capacity from 1,000 tests at the beginning of June to around 3,500 tests currently. The active to positive cases proportion rose from 30 per cent at the beginning of June to 38 per cent by June end as the number of positives reported rose drastically.PMC officials said after some of the curbs were relaxed, more cases are now being reported from outside the containment zones than from inside the zones.“We have observed that cases are coming up from housing societies where the infection had not reached till recently. During contact tracing, we found that the spread was because of allowing outsiders into the society or residents stepping out for work,” said PMC Commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad.After the civic body started observing a spike in cases, the PMC has decided to review the containment zones twice every week to ensure that the movement of the people is restricted sooner rather than wait for 14 days. As the number of cases is rising, the civic body revised its projection which was earlier estimated to be around 40 thousand by July end to now estimated 47 thousand by the same time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/spike-in-covid-cases-deaths-an-inevitability-city-unable-to-escape/story-byvYKWFsPVQd4aGWOxxXrK.html
02-07-2020||Gurugram||Malls reopen in Gurugram, shoppers still missing||Malls in the city sputtered back to life on Wednesday, after a three month pause owing to the raging Covid-19 pandemic, which has so far infected 5463 people in Gurugram and killed 92. On Day One of their reopening, however, most malls experienced a thin footfall.The district administration had directed a shutdown of all malls in the city on March 18 after the city started reporting a surge in Covid-19 cases. On Wednesday, safety was the first priority for all the malls that reopened its gates, with visitors being made to follow norms of social distancing, wearing masks, undergoing thermal scanning and sanitizing hands outside every store. Guards and other mall staff were deployed in PPE kits, face shields, masks, and hand gloves. Cinema halls and play area for children inside these malls continue to remain shut.Malls located on Golf Course Road, MG Road, and Sohna Road, reported around 20% of the usual footfall on Wednesday, according to their managements, with a significant number of shops opting to wait and watch for now and voluntarily remaining shut. At Ambience Mall, however, the footfall was marginally higher and most shops were open in the building. Most visitors cited ongoing discount offers, especially in clothing and shoe stores, as the main reason for people flocking to the mall . Last Friday, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh had said that malls would reopen in Gurugram without citing a timeline. Subsequently, on Sunday, the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the Haryana government permitted malls to reopen from July 1 onwards.Mall associations on MG Road and Golf Course Road said they expect the footfall to be significantly low in the first month of operations, as many people will be initially sceptical about stepping out amid the coronavirus outbreak. They, however, hoped that the situation starts to improve afterwards.“We weren’t expecting any footfall at all in the first few weeks as we got no time to advertise and inform residents that the malls had reopened. We ourselves didn’t know how many stores would reopen on Wednesday and the entire day was largely spent in disinfecting and sanitising establishments that opened up. It will take some time for us to regain the trust of visitors and for them also to get accustomed to the habit of venturing outdoors once again,” said Aman Bajaj, a member of MGF Metropolitan Mall Association. The mall is located at Mall Mile on MG Road.Bajaj said that in July they are expecting to do 40% of the total business that they used to do before the pandemic set in. From August onwards,when the festival season commences, they expect to do more than 60% business . He further said that around 15% stores in the mall were closed on Wednesday and those that had opened reported shortage in staff.At South Point Mall on Golf Course Road, barring two supermarkets which had remained open throughout the lockdown period, the building appeared to be deserted. Association members said that though around 100 out of the 180 stores opened to the public on Wednesday, footfall was less than 15% of what it used to be before the lockdown.“Besides the two supermarkets, we experienced extremely low turnout on the first day. We had anticipated this to be the situation. We ensured that those who did visit the mall felt safe and secure with the sanitising and disinfecting operations. We want visitors to feel confident to return again and also bring their family and friends along the next time. A large number of our regular visitors just enquired about which stores have reopened and said they will be coming in the next few days. We are anticipating a much higher footfall over the weekend,” said Shobha Sengupta, president of South Point Condominium Association. Rakesh Kapoor, a resident of DLF5, who was among the few who visited the mall on Wednesday said the visible precautions taken at the establishment served as a reassurance for him. “I actually needed to get my spectacles fixed from the regular store that I go to located in this mall. So this was an unavoidable outing for me. I was concerned about venturing out like this because Gurugram is still reporting a high number of coronavirus cases daily. However, having witnessed the measures being taken at the mall , i came back reassured to some extent,” said Kapoor. He said that the staff was wearing protective gear, such as face shields and masks, and he was asked to sanitise his hands using the automatic sanitizer dispenser at the entrance and then again before entering the shop. “The staff was roaming around sanitising every nook and corner of the mall. I guess this is something we have to get used to, at least for the next few months,” he said. Sengupta further said that as almost all the shops in the mall were unable to do business for more than three months, around 10 shops had to permanently shut down owing to financial constraints. She, however, said that the remaining are expected to open within the next two weeks. In contrast, at Ambience Mall, officials of Ambience Private Limited said that more than 70% of the stores were open and they had a much higher turnout than anticipated. Ambience Mall officials said that around 5,000-7,000 people visited the mall on Wednesday, which is around. 20-25% of the footfall they used to receive before the Covid-19 pandemic. The footfall figures for other malls was not immediately available.“More than 70% of the stores were open today and we are expecting around 90% of our stores to open by the end of this week. Throughout the day, especially between 2 pm-4 pm, the footfall remained strong despite it being a weekday,” an official representative of Ambience Private Limited said. Visitors to the mall said that sale offers in major clothing and shoe stores were among top reasons why they ventured to the mall.“I buy all my clothes from a particular multinational apparel company that has a store in Ambience Mall. They had a 60-70% sale in their clothing range today. I thought it will be a good time to buy clothes as they will be cheaper. Plus I expected very few people to be present, because of which more options would be available for me,” said Sahil Sharma, a resident of sector 4.On Tuesday, MCG had directed its enforcement wing to visit malls to ensure all visitors and mall staff were abiding by the SOPs laid out by the state government . Violators were to be fined. Hariom Attri, joint commissioner, MCG said that, despite random and surprise visits of all malls, not a single challan was issued on the first day.“The footfall across all malls in the city was extremely low. Hence, there was little to no scope for people to flout norms. Even I visited some malls at random and found everything to be in order. We had held regular meetings with mall associations in the last few days and had cautioned them about the repercussions if rules were flouted,” said Attri||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/malls-reopen-in-gurugram-shoppers-still-missing/story-0EtsRUwhkTLnpayYjXcjhN.html

The district administration of both the districts had put restrictions on movement of commuters to Delhi and back in April to contain the spread of Covid-19 cases.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageUnder the restrictions in place, only those involved in providing essential services are at present allowed to freely cross the border into Delhi. Everyone else need to obtain and produce valid passes issued by district administration , authorisation letters from their offices or in cases of certain individuals show valid identification cards in order to cross. Uttar Pradesh chief secretary, RK Tiwari, late on Tuesday night had rolled out Unlock 2.0 directions for the state. Under the new guidelines, no intra-state or inter-state restriction on movement of persons or goods/commodities was to be permitted between Noida/ Ghaziabad and Delhi. The new guidelines also clarified that activities outside containment zones can be restricted on the basis of evaluation at the local level.The rules also authorised officials of the NCR districts of Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad to review the border situation at a later date and take a call accordingly.“As per the directions, we have asked police and health department officials to submit their views and they have been requested to submit a fresh assessment report. We have their previous recommendation and the status quo will continue till we get fresh data from them,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar.“The last assessment had said that cross-border infection was continuing. The status quo will be maintained if the current assessment reports too state the same things,” he warned.Gautam Budh Nagar shares its borders with Delhi at DND flyway, Mayur Vihar, Kalindi Kunj, Jhundpura and Kondli areas.“The border restrictions are in place and we take up regular checks,” said Ranvijay Singh, Noida’s additional DCP.The district administration officials of Ghaziabad too said that the ongoing restriction will continue under Unlock 2.0 till July 31.“We will continue with the present border curbs till July 31 or till further orders. The restriction at the Delhi-Ghaziabad border will continue and no relaxation is to be provided as of now,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate Ghaziabad.The Ghaziabad authorities too had in two orders — issued on April 20 and May 25 — issued directions for strict sealing and checking at borders with Delhi in the wake of rising number of Covid-19 cases resulting from cross-border travel. Ghaziabad shares several border crossings with Delhi at UP-Gate, Anand Vihar-Kaushambi, Seemapuri and in areas of Loni.“During the initial days when restriction were put in place, there were routine jams at the border as regular checking was taken up during peak hours. But for the last fortnight, the traffic flow has been smooth as cops resort to random checks. Even the broken patch of Delhi-Meerut Expressway near UP-Gate has been repaired. So, commuting is smooth nowadays,” said Kuldeep Saxena, a resident of Shakti Khand in Indirapuram and a daily commuter to Delhi.The Ghaziabad police said that they are continuing with checks with restrictions in place at Delhi-UP border.“Random checking is in place and barricades are also put up . Nowadays, there is no issue of traffic jam at border,” said Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city), Ghaziabad.Earlier in June, while hearing a petition, a three judge bench of the Supreme Court had asked the Centre to convene a meeting of officials from the three states of NCR within a week and come up with a common portal to facilitate interstate travel between Delhi and Noida or Delhi and Gurugram.The court was hearing a petition filed by a Gurugram resident who had challenged sealing of borders with Delhi by the Uttar Pradesh and Haryana governments.Later, the Uttar Pradesh government on June 12 had told the Apex court that restrictions between Uttar Pradesh and Delhi will continue to remain in place considering the spike in Covid-19 infection.UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on June 16 had suggested a uniform policy for NCR to effectively check the spread of Covid-19. He had also favoured sealing Uttar Pradesh’s borders with Delhi to regulate the movement of traffic. The CM had made these suggestions during PM Modi’s video-conferencing meet with chief ministers of different states.Later on June 18, Union Home Minister Amit Shah held a video-conferencing meeting with senior officials of Delhi-NCR for a review of Covid-19 situation in region and told officials that entire NCR should be considered as a unit in the fight against Coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/unlock-2-restrictions-to-continue-at-delhi-up-borders-till-further-orders/story-4KrgWnzyQK30yKixcoFRiN.html

However, a pregnant woman if found positive on testing is ideally to be transferred to dedicated Covid-19 hospitals for further management,” the Delhi government told the court while hearing a plea by lawyer who said test results of pregnant women should be given priority.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in its response filed through central government’s standing counsel Vivek Goyal, said it had issued guidelines for the management of pregnant women during the pandemic and there were no restrictions for testing pregnant women for Covid-l9 symptoms.Goyal, during the hearing, said ICMR cannot decide which category of patients should be given priority in testing.The Delhi government, in its response, said it was trying its best to make available Covid-19 testing across all sections of the population with possible and justified prioritisation.The lawyer representing the Delhi government sought more time to file an affidavit on giving priority to tests of pregnant women. The bench listed the matter for further hearing on July 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-test-not-mandatory-to-admit-pregnant-women-in-hospitals-delhi-govt-to-hc/story-7vvmbG1WhmQqIJDLYS78EM.html

02-07-2020||Pune||Rapid antigen testing begins in Pune after 1 lakh kits made available||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Wednesday began rapid antigen detection tests in the city for the diagnosis of Covid-19 infection. On the first day, the tests were conducted on 25 people of whom four tested positive .The tests, according to civic officials, have been carried out at the Naidu hospital and results were made available within 30 minutes. The quick results will help isolate first contacts of the patient sooner, thereby, stopping the spread of the virus within the community. The use of antigen kits will also reduce the burden on the National Institute of Virology and other laboratories currently testing swabs for Covid-19 infection.The first batch of the one lakh kits, arrived in city earlier this week and have now been given to Naidu hospital. Authorities will start using them from Thursday in mobile ambulances, flu clinics and door-to-door surveys to identify positive patients immediately, PMC officials said. According to state health department officials, rapid antigen detection tests are faster as they offer results within 30 minutes as compared to a minimum of 24 hours required for RT-PCR test results and are non-confirmatory. Therefore, those who test negative will have to be tested again using the RT-PCR test for re-confirmation while positive patients are considered “positive” and do not require further test. According to PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad, the civic body received kits from a private firm, which has already offered training online to the municipal staff.“The PMC plans to use one lakh kits in various areas on symptomatic persons. Since the tests results will be available within 30 minutes, we will be able to restrict movement of first contacts. We are also providing hands-on training to our staff posted in swab collection centres in the city,” said Gaikwad. According to the PMC commissioner, accuracy rate of the rapid antigen test is 90 per cent. The kits use nasal or saliva samples from the suspects and within 20-30 minutes, the results are made available. The kit indicators are very similar to a pregnancy kit. It helps detect the antigens that are found in the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection. The kits were ordered by the civic body after the India Council of Medical Research (ICMR) approved its use on June 18. The antigen test kits are not only fast as compared to RT-PCR kits, but are also cheaper as it costs about Rs 450 per test, according to officials. PCMC to also use rapid antigen testsThe Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) will soon start using the tests as the industrial township sees a spike in number of cases daily. The civic body has ordered 4,000 such kits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/rapid-antigen-testing-begins-in-pune-after-1-lakh-kits-made-available/story-d0doNxjokQq3Sz69WfkctJ.html

Due to the Covid-19 outbreak, the pre-admission and the admission process will be conducted online this year.From Tuesday, junior colleges will be allowed to make changes to details such as intake capacity and subjects offered on the online portal for FYJC admissions.“Colleges which have registered last year will get messages with their usernames and passwords which can be used for logging in to the portal and changes if any, can be made,” said a circular released by the department on Monday.This year, training for the admission processes will be given to junior colleges through video conference. While the training in Mumbai will be held on Tuesday, for Thane and Navi Mumbai it will be held on July 2.The government has simplified the admission for FYJC this year by scrapping the first come first served rounds and the zero round for bifocal admissions. The education department is now working on solutions to ensure the equivalence of scores across boards. This year, while the state board cancelled the last paper for Class 10 exams and decided to give average marks to students, the ICSE board will now allow students in the state to be scored on their previous scores. All papers of CBSE have been conducted in the state and students will be marked accordingly. “Talks are on at the government level to ensure that all students are at the same level for admissions,” said a senior official at the department.Results of SSC (Class 10) exams are expected to be out by the end of July and the admission process will begin in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fyjc-pre-admission-process-to-start-today/story-cYtQJF8R2zu51v0xNviYMO.html
02-07-2020||Delhi||With hotels shut, hospital linen keeping Dhobi Ghats busy — but workers wary of infections||The clothesline at dhobi ghat number 28, on central Delhi’s Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg, wears a drab uniformity these days -- the sterile the green and white hospital linen have gradually inched out the colourful sarees, shirts and dresses that once adorned these lines.Manish Kumar, one of the laundry men at this dhobi ghat, says ever since the government announced a nationwide lockdown to control the Covid-19 outbreak, laundry services in the area stopped receiving clothes from restaurants, salons and government quarters in the vicinity. That was when a new kind of clientele appeared; nearby hospitals and their never-ending supply of laundry helped keep businesses afloat, says Kumar.“We get clothes from GB Pant (GB Pant Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research), a few labs in the hospital complex and from some sections of the Maulana Azad Medical College. Bedsheets, pillow covers, towels, bibs, lab coats and uniforms -- we have to wash them all,” says Kumar. A normal day here starts at the break of dawn, when the delivery person drops off the laundry from hospitals. “Earlier, hospital laundry got piled up and was delivered once a week, but now the piles keep coming every day,” says Kumar.Around 4.30am, the laundry men go about separating the whites from the coloured clothes, after which they spray sanitizer on all the pieces and leave them for about an hour before washing them.“We dip the clothes and linen in sodium hypochlorite mixed with caustic soda, which helps disinfect and whiten the clothes, and then put them in washing machines with regular detergent and warm water. Around five machines are set aside for washing hospital linen and the surfaces of these machines are separately disinfected with 70% ethanol liquid,” explains Kumar.Once washed and dried, the clothes and linen are ironed and sprayed with a sanitizer once again before they are packed and sealed in separate plastic bags. The entire process takes about seven to eight hours, explains Kumar. “We used to receive clothes from these hospitals earlier as well, but then the process was not so detailed -- we would simply put the linen in the machines for washing and after drying, send them back in bundles. The hospitals are now requesting that each piece is sanitised and packed separately,” says Kumar.Sukhi Ram, another laundry man at the dhobi ghat near east Delhi’s Akshardham Metro station, says while they never received laundry from hospitals before the start of the pandemic, they have started doing so from Dr Hedgewar Arogya Sansthan, a designated Covid-19 hospital, as well as a few Delhi government dispensaries in the area and a few private hospitals in Ghaziabad and Noida.“We try to wear a mask and gloves while laundering the linen, but the gloves are too inconvenient. Water seeps in anyway and the soap makes the gloves slippery. That said, we do not compromise on safety. So, all the pieces are thoroughly cleaned,” Ram said.Although most of these hospitals have their in-house laundry services, the huge influx of patients and the high demand for bed linen meant that hospitals needed the dhobis and the dhobi ghats to keep their linens clean.A senior administrative officer at Lok Nayak Hospital, Delhi’s largest Covid-19 designated facility, says the hospital is washing and disinfecting all bed linen from corona wards and centres internally. Only a few items -- such as uniforms or linen from low-risk parts of the campus -- are sent to laundry services.“We have washing machines in the hospital where we disinfect, wash and then dry the linen. As far as I am aware, we are sending some piles of clothes, which are from the no-risk areas of the complex and medical college, to the laundry services. We do not want anyone to even inadvertently get exposed to any kind of infection,” he says, requesting anonymity.Dr PK Sharma, an epidemiologist and former municipal health officer at the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), explains that there is a possibility of infection spreading through bed linen, and precaution must be taken while handling such items.“First of all, the linen should be handled only with gloves. They should be collected and stored in air and water-resistant containers and after they reach the laundry, they should be dipped in disinfectant and compulsorily sun dried. The person handing over the linen and the person washing them must ensure that they have gloves and masks on,” Sharma said. The World Health Organization recommends that to prevent the spread of Covid-19, laundry items should first be dipped in a solution containing quaternary ammonia, and then washed in water of a temperature between 60 and 90 degrees Celsius. The detergent should ideally contain bleach and after wash, laundry baskets must be disinfected.These washermen say while the pandemic has come as a major blow to their livelihood, they are ready to provide their services in the fight against the virus. “Times are tough but that’s not just for us; the entire country is going through this. It is time for everyone to step up and contribute. We have our entire life ahead to make up for this loss. Our contribution is small but it will be significant when we look at the larger fight,” avers Dhani Ram, a 65-year-old washerman from dhobi ghat number-11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/with-hotels-shut-hospital-linen-keeping-dhobi-ghats-busy-but-workers-wary-of-infections/story-D0MR54wbZaWqvlh5f3f0MO.html
