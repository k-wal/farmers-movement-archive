14-07-2020||Gurugram||MCG will shift death, birth registration office to Sector 39||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has decided to shift its death and birth registration branch from its Civil Lines office to its Sector 39 office, amid complaints of violations of social distancing norms and the municipal staff not wearing masks. MCG’s death and birth registration branch had been working out of the MCG’s Civil Lines office since 2008, the year the civic body was created.Seven MCG officials have so far tested positive for Covid-19. Last week an internal complaint was made within the MCG, which stated that outside the death and birth certificates registration branch office in Civil Lines, there is a queue daily and virtually everybody flouts social distancing norms. The MCG officials also continue to overlook this with impunity. In addition, officials inside the branch were on occasions found to be not wearing masks despite dealing with more than 40-50 people on a daily basis. The MCG subsequently decided to shift the entire branch to its sector 39 office, from where its health department operates. Officials said that this was done to ensure that the health department officials keep a closer vigil on the death and birth registration branch officials. Another reason, sources said, was shifting of the branch to a remote part of the city would translate into lesser number of people approaching the MCG manually for procuring death or birth registration certificates, thereby reducing human interaction and possibilities of flouting social distancing norms. People will be encouraged to apply for the process online instead.“There are several reasons for shifting the office. A few officials of the death and health registration branch were already working at the sector 39 office. Hence, it made sense to shift the civil lines wing there as well . This way, health department officials can keep a constant check on them and ensure social distancing and the norms regarding wearing of masks are not flouted. In addition, due to the distance, we are anticipating the total number of visitors to the office will be much lower and their temperatures can also be measured,” said an MCG official, privy to the matter.Barring the MCG’s Civil Lines office, which is facing some technical issues, its sector 42, 39, and 34 offices are all being monitored with thermal scanning cameras. Thus the entry of MCG staff and visitors is largely being allowed in the Civil Lines office without temperature reading.As per MCG officials privy to the matter, furniture, files, and other electronic equipment is in the process of being transferred and the branch is expected to be operational by the end of this week.“Amidst the coronavirus outbreak our first and foremost priority is the safety of the public and our staff. Hence any step which has been undertaken is done so, keeping this is mind,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-will-shift-death-birth-registration-office-to-sector-39/story-BXv4eLdytzMslOalJIdHZJ.html
14-07-2020||Mumbai||EOW books two developers for duping home buyers of ₹12.5 crores||The housing fraud unit of economic offences wing (EOW) has registered a cheating complaint against two developers who allegedly accepted ₹12.50 crore from a Matunga-based businessman Bipin Savla, 58, and his two relatives under the pretext of selling them seven flats in their housing projects in Wadala and Bhandup. However, they were neither given possession nor their money was returned.Bipin Savla, 58, who is into share market trading, in his complaint (HT has a copy), has alleged that developers Kashyap Mehta and Atul Bharani in 2013 lured him and his two relatives into investing money in their housing projects in Wadala and Bhandup by buying flats offering returns on 12% interest rate.Mehta and Bharani are directors of Sunshine Housing Pvt. Ltd., Mayurpankh Fine Builders Pvt Ltd., Sunshine Trecon Pvt. Ltd and Sunshine Housing and Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. and the FIR names the two and their four companies as accused, the police said.Savla stated in the complaint that he and his two relatives since 2013 have invested total ₹12.51 crores for buying seven flats in Mehta and Bharani’s housing projects in Wadala and Bhandup. However, the two did not deliver the flats by the year 2016, as promised. When the complainants approached them, they agreed to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with them assuring them that the housing projects would be completed by June 2018, however, the two again ended up violating promises made in the MoU.Savla alleged, “The accused had accepted more than 20% of the money for his three flats, but did not make the agreement for the registration of the flats, did not accept funds in an independent bank account and did not pay him after selling the flats in open market, as promised in the MoU, hence, flouted rules under Maharashtra Ownership of Flats Act (MOFA).” The complainant also alleged that the accused transferred one housing project in Bhandup in which he was to buy flats, to his partner’s name.“The accused had accepted money from home buyers with pure intention of cheating,” Savla said.EOW officials were conducting a preliminary enquiry on Savla’s complaint for over a year’s time. “After finding material in the complaint in a preliminary enquiry an FIR has been registered at the Bhoiwada police station against Kashyap Mehta and Atul Bharani and their four companies under sections 409, 420 and 34 of Indian Penal Code and 13, 14, 3, 5 and 8 of MOFA,” said an EOW officer requesting anonymity.When contacted Kashyap Mehta he said he is no longer part of the Sunshine group and has nothing to do with the alleged fraud. Bharani was unable for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/eow-books-two-developers-for-duping-home-buyers-of-12-5-crores/story-jOEzlE6MyaO0cQM8NznsVL.html

The group demanded a meeting with TMC commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma, however, he was unavailable.“There are many private hospitals that have not been considered to be used as Covid facilities. Moreover, there aren’t enough testing centres that are easily accessible, nor are the government testing centres functioning free of cost.

It added that 82℅ of urban local bodies in Maharashtra have set up separate teams for the collection of contaminated Covid-19 waste.The affidavit was submitted in reply to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Dombivli resident Kishor Sohoni, who complained that though prevailing rules mandate scientific disposal of bio-medical waste, bio-medical waste generated at Covid-19 treatment centres in Kalyan was being dumped at Adharwadi dumping ground by garbage collectors.His PIL, filed through advocate Sadhana Kumar, stated that such dumping of contaminated waste was very dangerous, considering the spread and intensity of the Covid-19 infection.“During this pandemic, the direct disposal of bio-medical waste from Covid hospitals is a serious threat to human life and should be stopped immediately,” he said, adding, “Rigorous monitoring is required to ensure such waste does not end up infecting others, including garbage collectors.”MPCB has, however, maintained that no Covid-19 bio-medical waste was found dumped at Adharwadi dumping ground when Waghmare along with MPCB and Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) officials visited the site.The civic body has set up a dedicated site for disposal of bio-medical waste at Umbarde, for which a mechanism has been created to monitor the collection and disposal of Covid-19 bio-medical waste generated within the limits of the municipal corporation, the affidavit added.A bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Anuja Prabhudessai has now posted Sohoni’s PIL for hearing next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/30-facilities-set-up-in-maharashtra-for-scientific-disposal-of-covid-19-bio-medical-waste-mpcb/story-9nQiFbaQDJarJ3Yr5KkFkL.html

Based on his complaint, a case was registered at the Surajpur police station and Mohit, the prime suspect, and his two associates were arrested. But they were later let go on bail. On July 9, around 5.30pm, Durgesh was shot by two men on a motorcycle while he was tending to his shop outside AVJ Heights society.He was rushed to a nearby private hospital by the locals and was undergoing treatment since then, but he succumbed to injuries on Tuesday morning. His death has angered the other vendors in the area who claimed that the extortion racket was the reason for Durgesh’s murder. They also said this was a way to scare them into paying the protection money.The family alleged that they were constantly being pressured by the suspects and their acquaintances to withdraw the case Durgesh had filed.“They had been threatening us for almost two months but my father did not want to take back the case. He was against the extortion bid from the start and that is why he has been killed,” Raju, Durgesh’s son, said.Police have registered a case and a probe in the matter is underway.“Mohit is in police custody and we are interrogating him regarding the shooting. Arrests will be made soon,” deputy commissioner of police, zone 2, Harish Chander said.Police said they suspect him to be involved in the case but clarified that he was not one of the shooters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/family-blames-cop-s-son-for-murder-of-vegetable-vendor-alleges-extortion-bid/story-faN8dE90NcGB5gixpfY89N.html

Muslim leaders have, however, demanded that the government allow the markets in Mumbai to be opened for the sale of goats.In a meeting of senior ministers, officials on Tuesday, Thackeray reviewed the preparations and demands raised by the community for Eid on August 1. “The celebration this year shall be symbolic as has been in the case of other festivals over the last four months. Transportation and crowding may lead to the spread of the virus, and should be avoided,” Thackeray said.Home minister Anil Deshmukh also has appealed to the community to celebrate the custom of kurbani (sacrifice) online.“We welcome the government’s stand and are ready to observe it in a subdued manner as we did during the month of Ramzan and Ramzan Eid. However, the government has not clarified its stand on kurbani, which is an age-old custom. The government should allow the trading of goats at the BMC markets in each of the wards,” said Arif Naseem Khan, former minority welfare minister and Congress leader.During a meeting convened by Mumbai’s guardian minister Aslam Shaikh on Monday, government officials had floated the idea of a standard operating procedure (SOP) for the celebration, and markets for sacrificial goats.

However, only those can apply in this scheme, who get a registration done by paying Rs 20,000 plus goods and service tax via online, the officials said.Once the applications are received, the authority will examine them before calling the eligible applicants for interview. “We will conduct interview of applicants after examination of their forms every month,” said Maheshwari.The institutional plot scheme is a new scheme for IT and IT-enabled services, the officials said.

14-07-2020||Mumbai||HC awaits apex court decision for migrants before deciding on WB natives||Observing that as the Supreme Court is seized of the condition of migrant labourers stranded in Maharashtra, the Bombay high court has said that it will await further orders of the apex court before addressing the concerns of the petitioners. The petitioner has claimed that nearly 56,000 migrants wanting to go back to West Bengal are stranded as the state government is not providing sufficient special trains and buses for the same.The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Anuja Prabhudessai while hearing the public interest litigation filed by Centre for Indian Trade Union and others was informed by senior advocate Gayatri Singh that though the state in an earlier hearing had submitted that it had sent back all migrants desirous of going back to their hometowns and as there was no further demand it was not arranging Shramik special trains, there remained migrants especially those wanting to go to West Bengal who were still stranded.Singh drew the attention of the bench to a Supreme Court order relating to migrants especially those in Maharashtra and said that as nearly 56,000 migrants wanted to go back to West Bengal the court should direct the state to arrange for the same.However, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni informed the court that the last time a Shramik special train had been arranged for West Bengal it had very few migrants on it and hence there was no point in arranging for more trains.After hearing the submissions, the court observed that as the state was asked to respond to the interim applications filed by two organisations in the petition before the SC it was not keen on passing any orders. The court also made an observation on the condition in WB due to the Covid outbreak. “We do not consider it appropriate to pass any order at this stage for facilitating movement of alleged stranded migrant labours to West Bengal, as prayed for by Singh. In our view, it would only be just and appropriate not to dispose of the PIL at this stage and to await further orders that might be passed by the Supreme Court in respect of migrant labours,” said the chief justice and posted the PIL for hearing in the first week of August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-awaits-apex-court-decision-for-migrants-before-deciding-on-wb-natives/story-hfHUJvMTR1VgTrMVWsxT3K.html

The incident came to fore on Sunday when a video of the girl’s mother started doing the rounds of social media. She alleged foul play in her daughter’s death and said the school, located under the Sector 49 police jurisdiction, was behind the girl’s death. The family also said her hanging was a cover-up. In the video, the woman also requested the public and officials to take up the matter and act against the school. A suicide note had allegedly been found at the spot, in which the girl had taken allegedly responsibility for her act. The girl’s body was later cremated school authorities without informing the police.Though the school authorities claimed they had the parent’s consent to carry out the cremation, the parents on Monday claimed that they were “forced by the school to give the consent”.The family had later filed a complaint with the local police in Haryana and Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar.However, Noida police is yet to receive a formal complaint from them.“We have started a preliminary inquiry in the matter. ACP, women safety, had also visited the parents yesterday (Monday). On Tuesday, the family came to Noida and we spoke at length. We are working on taking statements from all family members, the family’s neighbours, and officials of the school,” Vrinda Shukla, deputy commissioner of police, women safety, said.She said police are trying to determine who is liable for her death and under what sections.“Even if this was a suicide, the school should have informed the local police. The physical evidence has been destroyed now,” the DCP said.She said experts have also been called in to match the handwriting from the suicide note with that of the girl’s to confirm its authenticity.“We know that she wouldn’t take her life. Something happened to her and the school is covering it up. We want action to be taken against them. But we neither have the means nor the resources to fight them. We are scared,” the mother said.The school authorities, however, said everything was done with the consent of the family and the allegations against them are baseless.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-cops-initiate-preliminary-inquiry-into-girl-s-death-at-boarding-school/story-DqCnXNUXe2P8YQOs0ncVJL.html

14-07-2020||Noida||New govt order allows markets to open on all five weekdays||In a breather to traders, the Uttar Pradesh government has allowed shops to remain open on all five weekdays and close only over the weekends.The state government on Tuesday issued fresh guidelines ordering all shops, markets, malls and administrative offices to remain closed from Friday 10pm to Monday 5am. The order, however, allows emergency services, grocery shops, etc., to open even on weekends.Following the nationwide lockdown, markets were allowed to be open from May 21 onwards, but only on alternate days based on the odd-even shop numbers system. By easing these restrictions, shopkeepers can now remain open for business for 20 days a month, as opposed to the earlier 11 days.“In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, all administrative offices across the state, apart from those involved in emergency services and banks, will remain closed on Saturday and Sunday. All rural and urban markets, shops, haats, grain markets, business centres, etc., will be close during this period (Friday 10pm to Monday 5am). They will be allowed to open from 9am to 9pm for the rest of the week. The weekend markets will also have to be open during weekdays only,” said an order signed by chief secretary Uttar Pradesh dated July 14.The new restriction plan allows public transport, goods transport, fuel stations near highways, IT and IT enabled services to operate without any restrictions and will also allow all domestic and international flights. “District magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar, Suhas LY, has informed that new guidelines issued with respect to weekend restrictions from the state government shall be applicable in the district from today. All concerned parties are requested to note and comply,” a statement from the district administration said on Tuesday.Meanwhile,traders’ organisation have welcomed the move stating that with more days for business, they expect revenue to rise.“It’s a good step as earlier we got only 11 days a month to open shops which will now be 20 days. The trade has suffered heavily due to the lockdown, and business is only 10-12 % of what it used to be before the lockdown began in March. We now expect business to increase to 25-30% of what it was before March. However, weekend closure is an awkward decision as the working class will face issues in making purchases, as most of them would do so during weekends,” Sushil Kumar Jain, president, Sector 18 market association, and head of the Confederation of All India Traders Association, Delhi-NCR, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/new-govt-order-allows-markets-to-open-on-all-five-weekdays/story-hnV9hiuirHCXEasmvjcW8J.html

14-07-2020||Chandigarh||Vehicle with artwork on its body can’t be denied registration: HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has ruled that a vehicle can’t be denied registration merely because there is artwork on its body. The bench of justice Jaishree Thakur directed the Chandigarh administration to register one such car, which was denied registration, within two weeks.The multicolour Ambassador Grand Harit-C-1800, belongs to a high court lawyer, Ranjit Malhotra, who had bought it from a counsellor of the European Union posted at Delhi in July 2019. He received the 2009 model Bharat Stage- III car in August, upon which he obtained a no-objection certificate from the registering authorities at Delhi and completed other formalities. But the Chandigarh authority refused to register it. The reason for purchasing the vehicle from Delhi was the art work done on the car’s body by a renowned Mexican artist, Senkoe, Malhotra had told court in his petition filed after the registration was denied. He also cited a vehicle being used by JW Marriot Hotel in Delhi, which has the face of painter Salvador Dali spray painted on it. Such cars are plying in Delhi without any hindrance, he had told court. The administration had argued that during inspection it was found that the colour of the original vehicle had been changed from white to multicolour. No vehicle can be altered so as to change the original specification made by the manufacturer, which in the instant case would be the colour of the vehicle, the UT had told court.“The reason for denying registration merely on the ground that there is art work done on the body of the vehicle, where the base remains white, defies logic. Any reasonable person can easily make out that a white car had some art work done upon it. Like a canvas with a spray of flowers. The base colour of the canvas would remain as it is,” the bench said.The bench observed that the car had not been subjected to any alteration as would change its basic structure, nor has there had been a change in any of its basic features. “No doubt the art work done upon it is colourful, but has it changed the basic structure of the car or has the vehicle been altered in any manner which is not permitted by virtue of Section 52 of the Act? The answer is in the negative,” the bench said. Section 52 of the Motor Vehicles Act 1988 bars any kind of “alteration” in the car.The court said any person who drives upon the GT Road would see slogans, quotations and colourful paint jobs done on back and front of trucks that ply from Jammu and Kashmir to Kanyakumari. “Some of the standard ones are ’OK TATA’, ’Horn Please’, ’Hum Do Hamare Do’, ’Mera Bharat Mahaan’, ’Use Dipper at Night’. The trucks are beautifully decorated with artwork done on some panel or the other,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/vehicle-with-artwork-on-its-body-can-t-be-denied-registration-hc/story-umXLm0leGiI67mropOWf5J.html

Later, the police claimed that Multani, son of a former IAS officer, had escaped from the police custody and his whereabouts were not known.In the last hearing, the CBI had refused to share the status report, which was returned by Punjab and Haryana High Court to the investigating agency in 2016, saying it was an “internal communication” between the CBI and the court.On Tuesday, seeking directions from the court to the CBI for handing over the documents, the Punjab Police said “status report is not an internal communication or privileged document between the high court and the CBI”. The matter will now come up for hearing on July 20 for final arguments and the CBI court is expected to pronounce its order on the matter.On May 6, a case was registered against Saini and seven others in Mohali on a complaint from Multani’s brother Palwinder Singh.On June 6, the Punjab Police moved an application in the CBI court, Chandigarh, seeking documents of the preliminary probe as the case was initially investigated by the CBI in 2007. In its reply, the CBI had said it keeps records only for five years. On June 8, the police filed another application seeking the status report that the high court had returned to the investigating agency in 2016 which also had the documents with it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/multani-abduction-case-cbi-deliberately-not-sharing-documents-says-punjab-police/story-xVWe6GPaOQicrN3vsorcDK.html
14-07-2020||City||Delhi: Lessons on gender sensitivity, life skills, sign language to be imparted in North body’s schools||New Delhi: From training teachers in dispelling myths related to transgender persons and include trans-children in classrooms to making students ready for life challenges, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation is gearing up for reforming the methods of imparting education in the over 700 schools run by it.At least 35 life and survival skills, such as reading maps, how to strike a conversation, road rules, how to be safe while using social media, seek help from strangers or respond to disasters, among others, will be made part of the curriculum taught in municipal schools, civic officials said.“The reforms are part of a larger initiative to make classrooms inclusive. So far, the course curriculum is literacy-based only and does not prepare students for the challenges of life. These skill sets are crucial for the holistic development of students that will help them become successful adults,” said Ira Singhal, deputy commissioner of the North body, who is leading the initiative.She added that it is an extensive exercise for which 75 ‘mentor teachers’ have been tasked with preparing lesson plans for tagging the skills with corresponding subjects.“We are preparing classroom plans on how to teach a particular skill and what chapter of a subject it could be tagged along with. Teachers will be given guidebooks for imparting these lessons as part of the course. Besides, we will also prepare short videos for the same, for which we have roped in a private player to provide technical support. The idea is to subtly introduce these skill sets in the course,” she said.Teachers are being trained virtually through webinars in the exercise. The skills will vary from learning how to manage time, money, visit a bank, know about helpline numbers in times of emergencies, such as police, fire and ambulance services, read maps for navigation, gender sensitisation, personal hygiene and how to cope with failure, and the like. The plan will be implemented in various stages and will take about a year to be introduced to all classes, while being evaluated in every phase.The North corporation has 714 primary schools under it where nearly 2.5 lakh children are imparted basic education from nursery up to class 5. Most of the children enrolled in these schools come from low-income groups. TRAINING OF TEACHERS, PRINCIPALS Apart from this, about 7,500 teachers and heads of the north body’s schools will also be trained on transgender sensitivity under the project titled ‘Purple Board’, to be launched Monday. The focus of the programme will be on dispelling myths around transpersons and sensitising teachers on how to make schools inclusive of trans and gender non-conforming students by addressing trans-phobia and dealing with trans-bullying.For this, the civic body has tied up with SPACE (Society for People’s Awareness, Care and Empowerment), an NGO working in the field of gender issues. “We will be training around 500 teachers and principals per day in two to three different batches for a month-and-a-half. We are glad that the civic body has engaged us in this programme, as this will be the first such initiative for municipal schools, where children are young and need to be dealt with sensitively from early on,” said Anjan Joshi, executive director, SPACE. He added that it is important to introduce schools to trans-identities, the terminologies associated with them and the needs and rights of such persons. “It is a matter of education and awareness. There have been many cases when transpersons have shared their experiences of being bullied, abused or mocked when they were merely class 2 or 3 students, not just at the hands of peers but even teachers at times. At such a young age, such experiences can deeply impact a child’s mind and how they begin to identify with their own selves. These are the issues that will be addressed through these training sessions,” he said.For instance, he added, there are many children who do not confirm to the gender identity they are assigned at birth, due to which they start having identity issues as they grow, which calls on the need for a gender-neutral atmosphere in schools such as in the case of gender-specific washrooms and uniforms, which must not be meant solely for the conventional gender identities.The NGO will conduct a refresher course for teachers once the schools reopen. Also, a session on gender issues will be organised for children, in which parents will also be engaged. Singhal said that so far, trans-children have been facing social boycott and have been deprived of an education. Even those who attend school for some years drop out at some point. Training is required to bring trans-children on the same platform as other students, she said.The Delhi government had last year launched a training curriculum for teachers to handle concerns of trans-students.TEACHERS, STUDENTS TO LEARN BASICS OF SIGN LANGUAGEIn another reform towards inclusive education, the civic body has been training teachers in the different aspects of disabilities and how to make children with special needs part of the same classroom.“It has been made compulsory for all teachers to learn the basics of sign language, after which they will help all students of classes 4 and 5 learn the same. This is crucial because children who have hearing disabilities are not able to communicate even with their peers, friends or parents, as nobody understands sign language except for them, which isolates them and affects their overall development. It will be a fun exercise for all regular students as well to learn sign language and be able to have a basic conversation with their peers when they are assimilated in the same classroom,” said Singhal. So far, there are around 1,000 children with special needs enrolled in the North body’s schools. The civic body, with the help of special educators, will also conduct an assessment of all students to identify undiagnosed disabilities, including learning disabilities, which are often left unidentified, so that early intervention could be made.

14-07-2020||City||Kejriwal hails govt school results, says AAP’s education model has made history||New Delhi: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s education model in the national capital has made “history” with the government schools posting their best ever pass percentage of 98% in CBSE Class 12 results announced on Monday. Also, for the fifth year in a row, the Delhi government schools had a better pass percentage than private schools. It was 5.9 percentage points more this year. Addressing a digital press conference, Kejriwal hailed the students for their performance and said that no government schools in any state have achieved such a great result in the last 70 years. “The private schools in Delhi have achieved 92.2% results, and government schools have received 97.92%, which is the highest among the government schools in the entire country. Examinations were conducted in a total of 916 schools of the Delhi government, out of which 396 schools have received 100% results,” he said.The chief minister said the AAP government in Delhi has completely changed the education system. “If the students, teachers, and principals are the same, how a revolution in the education system was brought about? It is because the politics of Delhi changed, it is you, the people, who voted for an honest government in Delhi. The AAP government believes that if we want to strengthen the future of the country, we have to invest the most in education. All that is changing is not because of us, it is because of the teachers, students, and parents. We have just changed the atmosphere, and we have given facilities where students can study and be taught, and the teachers can teach,” he said.According to the data provided by the Delhi government on Tuesday, the number of schools securing 100% pass percentage has risen to 396 this year from last year’s 203 schools. Similarly, 897 schools have secured above 90% results, higher than last year’s 732 schools. The 21 Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalayas (RPVV)-- the model schools of the Delhi government --- have recorded the pass percentage of 99.92%. Out of five Schools of Excellence (SoE) -- all-English medium schools of Delhi government --- three recorded 100% pass percentage. In a major improvement, the pass percentage of evening shift schools has also improved to 96.53% over last year’s 90%. In Delhi, around 150 government schools run in double shifts — for girls in the morning and boys in the evening.Though government schools posted a better result, Kejriwal said that there is no competition between private and government schools. “The government schools in Delhi were considered inferior and were looked down upon. People wanted to send their children to private schools. But today, the results have change this perception. Today, the students in government schools are feeling much more confident, and studying in government schools is considered a matter of pride.”Terming the Class 12 results of government schools encouraging, Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia said, “It is not only the pass percentage that is improving, but the marks scored by students are also constantly improving. That is determined by the Quality Index (QI), which reflects the performance of our students by checking and comparing the aggregate marks scored by them. The Average QI went up to 341.79 this year from 306 recorded last year and 291 in 2018.”Kejriwal also urged the students who could not clear the exams not to get disheartened. “I want to tell the 2% of children who have either failed or have got compartment, please do not be disheartened. We are with you. We will conduct extra classes for you, and I am sure that this 98% passing result will turn into 100% after we obtain the results of the compartment. The Delhi government is with you,” he said. The overall pass percentage in CBSE Class 12 exams is 88.78%, compared to last year’s 83.40%. The board had to cancel exams of 12 subjects across the country and 11 others in riot-hit north-east Delhi in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The students were evaluated on the basis of the average of marks in exams they took before the lockdown came into effect on March 25. The board also decided against releasing the merit list. considering the prevailing situation. Several government school principals said that their results have improved this year. Rajpal Singh, principal of RPVV in Dwarka, said, “The average score of our 137 students is 450.5 out of 600 this year. It means the majority of them have scored above 90%.”The AAP government in Delhi has been focusing on school education ever since they came to power in 2015. The pass percentage of the first batch of Class 12 students under the AAP government was 85.9% in 2016. It has improved over the years to 88.2% (2017), 90.6% (2018) and 94.24% (2019).Educationist Meeta Sengupta said the Delhi government has made two major changes in public education in the city -- invested a lot of money in improving infrastructure and motivated teachers. “They have tried to do many things that motivate and encourage parents, students and teachers. They brought an entrepreneurship angle to the classes. It’s an attitude. They have made an organised effort and translate which is commendable,” she said.NDMC and Navyug SchoolsThe schools run by New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) have also recorded an improvement in CBSE Class 12 results with the pass percentage increasing to 95.41% from last year’s 94.21%. The pass percentage of Navyug Schools have also increased to 98% this year from last year’s 97.6%.In a statement released on Tuesday, the NDMC said, “Regular mentoring and monitoring by the NDMC at all levels created an environment of accountability and responsibility. Subject wise enrichment sessions and visits by academic consultants/officers to observe different aspects of academics proved to be very effective. Simultaneously, attention was paid to ensure regularity and punctuality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-hails-govt-school-results-says-aap-s-education-model-has-made-history/story-nC7S14afnbiMe0gZyLT6wM.html

14-07-2020||Chandigarh||6 more Haryana districts attain critical tag as contagion statistics get grim||Six more districts in Haryana have joined Faridabad, Gurugram, Sonepat and Rewari this week for having more than 200 coronavirus active cases and more than 15 active cases per lakh population, both critical values as per the parameters recommended by the Union health ministry.Health officials said this indicated that contagion spread is picking up in other parts of the state besides the national capital region (NCR).The newly marked critical districts having over 200 active cases are Hisar, Rohtak and Ambala while Jhajjar, Mahendragrah, Panipat and Rohtak have bagged the critical tag for having more than 15 active cases per lakh population, as per the health department statistics.Another worrying aspect is that the doubling rate for infection, which is calculated over a seven-day period, has fallen below the critical value of less than 14 days in five districts for the first time since the outbreak. These are Hisar (10.3 days), Mahendergarh (13.8 days), Panipat (10.8 days), Rewari (11.1 days) and Sirsa (13.6 days).While the sample positivity rate, which reveals the number of positive cases per sample tested, has increased since July 5 in three NCR districts, there have been no new additions in the number of districts displaying critical value of over 6% positivity rate. The sample positivity rate in Faridabad has increased to 14.2% from 12.9%. In Rewari, it has gone up to 9.2% from 7% and in Sonepat, the increase is 6.9% from 6.8%. The rate, however, came down from 11.8% to 9.8% in Gurugram this week. Bhiwani with a sample positivity rate of 5.9% and Jhajjar with 5.5% are closing in to cross the 6% critical mark.However, additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora, said Haryana’s recovery rate of infected cases is over 75% and the fatality rate has come down to 1.38%. “Those two aspects and the fact that active cases are in and around 5,000 per day matter the most,” he said.Following central government’s diktat, the state government had increased the Standard Q Covid-19 antigen detection testing in the five troublesome NCR districts of Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonepat, Jhajjar and Rohtak. More than 15,000 antigen tests have been done in Gurugram with a positivity rate of 3.5%. The antigen positivity rate in Faridabad has been 8.4% while it is 4.9% in Sonepat, 2.3% in Jhajjar and 1.4% in Rohtak, as per the last week’s statistics.The ACS said the fact that the positivity rate is low in the NCR districts despite increased antigen testing is an encouraging sign. “Now, all the districts have started the antigen testing.

The Class 12 student from Delhi Public School, Vasant Kunj, said the marks had helped improve her aggregate to 94%.High or perfect scores in arts and literature unheard of till recent years are becoming a norm. Teachers from the capital’s top schools say it is because of multiple evaluation components – theory, practical, and internal assessments – that students score well in these subjects.Of the 65 students who scored 100 in various subjects in Amity International School, Mayur Vihar, this year, 33 got it in Painting and 18 in Sculpture. At DPS, Vasant Kunj, of the 27 students who secured 100 in various subjects, seven got it in Painting and at least 10 scored more than 95. Out of 16 students studying Painting at Springdales, Pusa Road, barring one student, all scored above 90.Ashok Ninawe, associate professor at the College of Art, Delhi, said high scores in Class 12 does not have any bearing on the quality of professionals who pass out of the institution. “Students scoring 100 in art is unusual. However, the course and evaluation of the board papers is basic. If students fulfil the elementary criteria, they can be awarded perfect scores. For pursuing a higher education degree in the subject which includes professional-level courses. Also, students have to pass an entrance exam which tests their capabilities at a different level. So it doesn’t affect the quality of students opting for the field after school,” said Ninawe.Students opting for Painting in Class 12 are evaluated on three components -- 30-mark theory paper, 70-mark practical examination which entails painting a theme-based composition on the spot, doing a still-life portrait of inanimate objects; and a 20-mark portfolio of work done in the two years of their higher secondary education.When asked what prompts evaluators to give perfect scores in art, teachers said for still-life sketching, shading, balance, and the precision helps students fetch marks. Ram Bali, who teaches at DPS, Vasant Kunj, said, “The assessment is done keeping in mind that they are students and not artists. As long as they get the basics right, they are likely to get perfect scores.”Bali said that when it came to the 25-mark painting composition, evaluators check if the theme of the topic matches with the different elements in the students’ paintings. For instance, if the topics ask for a painting of a summer vegetable market, students will have to paint vegetables available in the season and also take note of the clothes the human figures are wearing. Examiners look for the presence of at least three human figures, animals, and different elements in the painting.If a student’s portfolio is promising, teachers also ignore “silly mistakes” like leaving a white spot on the painting or the compromised quality of the paper, which sometimes affects the watercolour painting.“Painting anatomically correct human figures with multiple elements and suitable colour schemes as per the topic helps us score better,” said Sriya.Tuhin Bhattacharya, who teaches Painting at Amity, Mayur Vihar said, “In the 30-mark theory paper, there are different types of questions like whether the wheel in the Indian flag is Persian blue or Navy blue. If students go through the textbooks carefully, they will be able to answer the questions. For their portfolio, presentation matters as well. For instance, detailing on the mounds being used for the paintings can help them score better.”Of the 12.18 lakh students who registered to appear for the Class 12 CBSE examinations this year, over 1.10 lakh candidates had registered for Painting this year – indicating an interest among students towards the subject.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/students-making-a-perfect-mark-in-painting/story-x7dypnJ02hJd6F1s3I5K6K.html

The unit was allowed to operate only after the owner submitted the environmental compensation.” said Sandeep Bahl, PPCB superintending engineer.“A report regarding the same has been prepared and strict action will be taken against the firm,” said Bahl.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-dyeing-unit-faces-action-after-stp-found-non-functional/story-ykR7fgx4QBwYE8Z9DgsA8I.html
14-07-2020||City||DU final-year open-book exams from Aug 10 to 31||New Delhi: The Delhi University will conduct its final year open book examination between August 10 and 31, the timeline suggested by the Delhi High Court after the varsity submitted a date sheet for holding the exam.In an affidavit submitted on Tuesday, the university said it has decided to start the open book examination from August 17 and conclude the process by September 8. It had also said that the date sheets for the undergraduate courses has been finalised and those for the postgraduate courses will be declared before July 20.The high court is hearing a bunch of pleas by several students which had challenged the decision of the university to conduct the open book examination, stating that students do not have ample resources to appear in the exam.Responding to the DU affidavit, a bench of justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad said, “You were so confident about the conduct of exams. Now you have pushed it to mid-August. Why are you starting in August and why not July. When you were already prepared then why are you not conducting the exams now”?The bench said that the exams should be “compressed” and the declaration of results should be done at the earliest. It said that it was about the future of 2.7 lakh students and they cannot be made to wait till November 30. It asked Vinay Gupta, Dean of Examination, about the feasibility of changing the schedule.The court proposed that the first set of mock test should start from July 27 instead of July 31 and the second set of mock test should be conducted from August 1 instead of August 4. Gupta agreed to the changes while also agreeing that the online examination will be conducted from August 10 instead of August 18. He also agreed to concluding the exam by Aug 31, as proposed by the court, instead of September 8. The university, however, has not issued a fresh notification yet. The court asked the varsity to give a timeline for the conduct of the physical exams while also indicating the timeline for the declaration of the results of the online open book exams. The matter would be now heard on July 22.Earlier, explaining the challenges in the conduct of exams, DU’s counsel Sachin Datta told the court that there are certain problems such as data entry. He said that due to a large number of students, a lot of data has to be put online after the exams. He said that the students would be given additional time till July 22 to fill the forms.He also submitted that colleges and students would be able to access the exam portal created on the DU website to check their data like name, date of birth and other information. He said if they wanted to change or correct any data entry, the students will have to ask the college concerned.To a specific query from the court, Datta said that the physical and blended mode exams would be conducted two weeks after the open book papers.Students and teachers, however, persisted with their demand for cancellation of the examination. DU Executive Council member Rajesh Jha, who teaches at Rajdhani College, said, “Despite experiencing chaos, glitches, and crashes during previous mock tests and even leakage of personal data of students, the university has decided to go ahead with online open book exams. Students and teachers are opposed to online exams since it is anti-student and anti-social justice.”Students said the changes have only added to the uncertainty around the final-year exams. “The ongoing court cases were our last hope, now that the issue has become highly political. However, today’s hearing has disappointed all of us because shifting the exams earlier by mere 6-7 days does not solve any of our problems. We expected the court to direct DU to resort to alternative measures which are less discriminatory and far more justifiable in nature,” said Naman Biyani, a final-year student at the university.While the university has suggested students to use common service centres in their localities to write online exams in case they do not have the internet facility at home, the students have maintained that those who live in remote areas were at a disadvantage since there might not be electricity and internet connections in their localities.(With inputs from Kainat Sarfaraz)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/du-final-year-open-book-exams-from-aug-10-to-31/story-rGEoC2qUo9HQ6J9zJXueOJ.html
14-07-2020||Delhi||DDA approves extra FAR for warehouses, extends deadline for use conversion charges to Dec 31||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) Tuesday approved a slew of proposals to help the business community in the capital meet the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, apart from approving proposals to make its housing projects financially viable.The land-owning agency, during a meeting chaired by lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal, has approved a proposal to increase the ground coverage of warehouses in integrated freight complexes and wholesale markets from 30% to 40% and the floor area ratio (FAR) from 80% to 100%. This has been done as the demand for warehouses has increased as most people now prefer to do their shopping online in view of social distancing norms to contain the spread of Covid-19.A senior DDA official, on condition of anonymity, said, “Due to changing times and introduction of numerous online shopping sites, the demand for the ‘warehouse to home’ model of business has increased, and so has the need for warehouses for various commodities.” The proposal will now be placed in the public domain for suggestions/objections before it is notified.The DDA also approved a proposal to extend the deadline for payment of use conversion charges (which are to be paid by property owners for using a residential building for commercial purposes) and an additional FAR from June 28 to December 31, 2020. “Chaired @Official_dda Authority meeting. Sale of 50 per cent of EWS flats of DDA quota in group housing projects simplified to avoid double stamp duty thereby reducing cost & facilitating expeditious allotment,” Baijal later tweeted. A lot of commercial establishments were sealed in 2017 for misusing property use norms and these establishments were supposed to pay a use conversion charges to get the property de-sealed.The pandemic, DDA officials said, has adversely impacted the real estate sector. To make its housing problems, especially in situ redevelopment projects, financially viable, the DDA has decided to give additional FAR to the builder on the remunerative component.The senior official, quoted above, said this will help the DDA start work on 16 of its in situ redevelopment projects for which it is preparing detailed project reports. The DDA plans to redevelop 30 slum clusters as part of its in situ redevelopment policy.Currently, in an in situ the project, the developer is supposed to construct housing on 60% of the land and use remaining land for commercial purposes to recover the cost of the project. The DDA has decided that the maximum FAR on the remunerative component will now be 300, irrespective of the land use. The FAR earlier was 200.Another senior DDA official, also on condition of anonymity, said, “Developer entities will come forward for in situ projects only when they know they can recover the project cost. We are planning to tender five in situ redevelopment projects by the end of the year. This will help the developer entity recover the project cost.” The proposal will now be placed in the public domain for suggestions/objections before it is notified.The land-owning agency has further simplified the allotment process for houses in EWS (economic weaker section) category. This has been done to avoid double payment of stamp duty.Until now, 50% of EWS houses constructed by private developers were purchased by DDA for allotment to people in the EWS category. In the process, the stamp duty was being paid twice—once when the flats were sold to DDA by the builder, and then again by allottees when they purchased it from the DDA.“The burden of the dual stamp duty was getting transferred to the beneficiary and in the process the cost of flat was rising, which was defeating the sole purpose of affordable housing,” the second DDA official said.The DDA has now decided that the developer entity will be allowed to undertake actual transfer of property to the EWS allottee, once approved by the DDA, the second official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dda-approves-extra-far-for-warehouses-extends-deadline-for-use-conversion-charges-to-dec-31/story-VJvkFVRj4AHqEjWpuHTGjM.html

District health department nodal officer Dr TP Singh Sandhu confirmed that Mulakkal was found infected with the virus in a TrueNat test that records results faster than the RT-PCR test. Mulakkal’s public relations officer Father Peter Kavumpuram claimed that the former bishop’s health “was not so good”.Fr Kavumpuram said Mulakkal had met his lawyer Mandeep Singh Sachdeva on June 29 and 30. When the lawyer tested positive on July 2 and his daughters on July 5, the names of his contacts were listed. Mulakkal too was called for a check up, but tested negative on July 6 and was in home quarantine since. On July 12 night, he developed some symptoms and was taken to the civil hospital. Mulakkal has now tested positive for the virus, he said.On Monday, a special court in Kottayam that is hearing the nun rape case cancelled Mulakkal’s bail and issued non-bailable arrest warrants against him. The court posted the case for hearing on August 13. The case surfaced in 2018 after a 43-year-old nun had complained to the police in Kottayam that Mulakkal had raped her several times between 2014 and 2016. The nun is a member of the Missionaries of Jesus congregation based in Punjab.But Mulakkal denied the allegations saying he was implicated after he took action against her for financial irregularities in the convent. Later, a special investigation team was formed and it arrested him in September 2018. After spending 40 days in jail, he was granted bail. He was later removed from the post of the bishop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/day-after-losing-bail-former-jalandhar-bishop-mulakkal-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-x1cfpYdOhVBU3IRcvlp9fO.html

Its ground-breaking ceremony, however, was performed by then deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal in June 2016. The Rs 284 crore project (Rs 210 crore cost of the project and Rs 74 crore for 10 years’ maintenance), which included laying a sewerage system and sewage treatment plant for the cluster of Faridkot, Jaitu and Kotkapura, was scheduled to be completed in 18 months.It was jointly allotted to Mumbai-based construction companies, Shapoorji Pallonji Company Pvt Ltd and Khilari Infrastructure Pvt Ltd. Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon, political adviser to the CM, said that even after laying the foundation stone three times, funds were not released for the pipeline project. “In 2017, after putting a lot of efforts, the Congress government got Rs 125 crore approved from Housing and Urban Development Corporation for the project. The company has failed to complete the project on time. In the meantime, 250 notices were sent to the company and Rs 10 crore penalty was imposed for various reasons. The government has taken back the works laying of interlocking tiles and connecting houses to sewer lines from the private company. We will soon float fresh tenders for these works,” he added. Work on the project remained suspended for more than 13 months with the change of government in the state due to ‘payment issues’, it was restarted in January 2018. However, the contractors have missed the third extended deadline of June 30 to complete the work. Most roads in the city that were dug up to lay drainage pipes have not been levelled after laying the pipeline. The dug-up roads were covered at many places by just putting sand into them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/plagued-by-missed-deadlines-fresh-tenders-to-be-floated-for-faridkot-sewerage-project/story-B39JBqMRdJXFosx3dTowyN.html

The team led by Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul arrived in Ghaziabad on Tuesday and took a review of different strategies being adopted by the NCR districts of Uttar Pradesh.The visit came after Union Home Minister Amit Shah had held a video conference with UP and NCR officials in June 18 and called for a unified approach to deal with the Covid-19 outbreak. On Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also appreciated efforts of the Centre and Delhi government in containing the Covid pandemic outbreak and directed that a similar approach adopted in the entire NCR.“The Niti Aayog officials also called for a consolidated policy for NCR and asked officials to increase antigen testing in UP and work towards bringing down number of fatalities. We gave a presentation to the team about the recently conducted special surveillance drive in Meerut division and also appraised them about strategies we have adopted to bring down the case fatality rate, especially in the month of July,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, Ghaziabad district magistrate.The officials told the team that four districts of Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar, Meerut and Baghpat, under the Meerut division, had a case fatality rate of about 3.04% (124 deaths) in the month of June. This had come down to .7% (23 deaths) in the first 11 days of July.The team was also apprised that a total of 15,89,22 testing were conducted till July 12 and 8,684 cases turned positive with positivity rate of 5.46%. The recovery rate stood at 66.44%.“The team praised our district for two indicators — tests per million and case fatality rate. These are the two factors which are observed by the Centre. All the credit goes to our health teams. We have better TPM (tests per million) indicator than other districts in Delhi, UP and Haryana, besides keeping our case fatality rate low. We are already working on a strategy of ‘track, contain and treat’,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar.Till July 12, Gautam Budh Nagar district had conducted at least 45,902 tests, according to data prepared by Meerut division officers for the review meet..

We also told them that Khoda and Loni areas were affected by Covid-19 and we implemented the sector scheme to contain cases. So, such a scheme should also be adopted by bordering districts in Delhi in order to effectively check the spread of Covid-19,” Pandey added.The Ghaziabad health department officials told the team that they have adopted strategy for better identification of positive cases, their effective contact tracing with the help of police officers and early referral to Covid hospitals.“There were 51 deaths in the month of June. In July, however, there has just been seven deaths in the first 14 days. For better treatment of critical patients we have reserved 20% of ICU/ventilator beds in private hospitals and critical patients are immediately referred for treatment. We have roped in eight private hospitals, which have total of 544 beds,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad.According to the figures complied for the Niti Aayog team, the officials said that at present they have 3176 (L1 category), 3390 (L2/L3 category), 331 (ICU) and 2348 (oxygenated) beds which are operational in the four districts.The L1, L2 and L3 hospitals are dedicated facilities which have come up under UP government’s three-tier health structure to deal with Covid-19 cases.

Senior vice-president of the association, Gurcharan Singh Jamco, vice-president Satnam Singh Makkar, cashier Achhru Ram Gupta, secretary Harsimerjit Singh Lucky and joint secretary Valati Ram Durga also participated in the meeting.General Secretary of the association, Manjinder Singh Sachdeva, said, “The bicycle industry is facing crisis and will be able to survive and flourish only if the government bans import of cycles and its parts from China. This way, the government would also help the industry become ‘Aatma Nirbhar’.”Propaganda secretary RS Sarhali said, “There are few items on which ban cannot be imposed due to agreements which were made in the past. But, the government can increase duty/fee on import of such items. The Ludhiana industry is capable of manufacturing parts which are being imported from China and by imposing a ban, it will increase demand for local products.”Earlier, All India Cycle Manufacturers Association (AICMA) had sent a list of parts including reflectors and alloy rims currently being imported from China, to the government proposing the same to be placed under restricted category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-cycle-and-parts-manufacturers-body-calls-for-ban-on-import-of-chinese-products/story-LAVg9fQ8OTTjKKiqUoHp2J.html

It was on June 25 that high court had disposed of a plea of one Balvir Singh of Ludhiana, who alleged illegal mining and misuse of Sutlej embankment from ‘burji’ numbers 52/53 till ‘burji’ number 148 near villages Mattewara, Jhugian, Mangli, Ror, Boothgarh and Gadisheru in Ludhiana. A report was sought from both officers by July 15 after undertaking a visit to the spot.On Tuesday, the petitioner had alleged that there is concerted effort on the part of the government agencies to remove the evidence of illegal mining at the site. He had produced a video recording of events on various occasions between the last date of hearing and July 14.The Punjab government counsel had told the court that the deputy commissioner had personal inconvenience in visiting the spot and he would seek modification in the order to depute someone else. “We are not willing to accept that, more particularly, in the background of the accusation and allegations made against officials of the state in supporting the illegal miners for removal of the evidence available at the place. We feel that it is appropriate that the order dated June 25, 2020, shall be implemented in letter and spirit,” the court said, adding that the officers will visit the spot within four days and submit a report by July 22 and any failure in this will be viewed as contempt of the court’s order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-illegal-mining-hc-asks-dc-sessions-judge-to-visit-spot-submit-report-by-july-22-or-face-contempt/story-Z1UgHTKnFLWou394hCIE9L.html

14-07-2020||City||COVID-19 PILOT PROJECT: 500 undergo rapid antigen testing in Punjab, positivity rate 15.6%||Over 500 people have undergone Covid-19 rapid antigen testing in the five worst-affected districts of Punjab in the last five days as part of the state health department’s pilot project.Of the 504 symptomatic people tested in Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Mohali and Patiala districts, 79 tested positive for the coronavirus, with a positivity rate of 15.6%, health officials said.Antigen testing detects foreign substances found on or within the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the body through nasal swab samples. The test is performed outside the conventional laboratory setting and is used to obtain a diagnostic result in 30 minutes.Also, the swab samples of those tested negative for Covid-19 in the antigen test reports were sent to the virus research and diagnostic laboratories (VRDL) of the state for confirmatory RT-PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction) testing to check whether both the tests show same results.The RT-PCR is the most commonly used test for Covid-19. It is based on a process that repeatedly copies and amplifies the specific genetic fragments of the virus. The test is done in a lab and it takes 5-8 hours to test a sample. The state government started the antigen testing project on July 10, with 5,000 kits at its disposal. Nearly 1,000 testing kits were given to each of the select districts. “So far, 252 antigen tests have been done in Jalandhar, the highest among all the districts, followed 124 in Patiala, 66 in Ludhiana, 51 in Amritsar and 11 in Mohali. Eighteen people tested negative in antigen tests were found to be infected in RT-PCR tests,” state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said. “Also, some RT-PCR reports of people found negative in antigen testing are awaited. Since the antigen test results are available within 30 minutes, we are able to identify and isolate positive cases to prevent further transmission of the infectious disease,” Dr Bhaskar added.‘MORE ACCURATE THAN RAPID CARD TESTING’The health officials said the reports of antigen testing kits are showing more accurate results than those through rapid card testing, the testing technique which was discontinued by the state after contradictory reports surfaced.“So far, all those found positive in antigen testing have also been found infected in RT-PCR tests. The only drawback of this is that we are using antigen testing only on symptomatic people,” said Amritsar assistant civil surgeon Dr Amarjit Singh.“For cross-checking, we have also done RT-PCR tests on some people found infected in antigen testing and most of the reports were accurate,” Dr Bhaskar said.The state government will conduct antigen testing on the migrants coming back to the state in the wake of reopening of industries and for work in paddy fields.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-pilot-project-500-undergo-rapid-antigen-testing-in-punjab-positivity-rate-15-6/story-FzU4wLH0mtqzDHeeox9EhM.html

Foot-operated features are available on the lavatory and compartment doors, flush valves of lavatories as well as door latches. The coaches are in AC (air-conditioned) as well as non-AC segments. Also, forearm-operated handles have been fixed on the compartment doors of AC coaches. The handrails and latches are coated with copper which has anti-microbial properties that weaken the virus in a few hours. Besides, AC ducts of the coaches have been enabled with plasma equipment to sterilise the air and surfaces. The use of ionised air makes the coaches resistant to viruses and particulate matter, said railways general manager Ravinder Gupta. “Nano titanium dioxide coating has been applied on the coaches. The water-based coating kills viruses, bacteria, fungi and enhances indoor air quality. Titanium dioxide is considered to be a safe substance and is harmless to humans. The coating has been applied on washbasins, lavatories, seats, berths, snack tables, glass windows, floor and all surfaces that passengers come in contact with during their journey. Stickers have been pasted in the coaches as a reminder to passengers to observe precautionary measures. “These coaches may prove to be a milestone in passenger transportation by helping fight the deadly virus,” Gupta added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rcf-kapurthala-rolls-out-4-specially-designed-coaches-to-fight-covid-19/story-zKIGmB6QDUhXwGjXsfR21J.html

Dr VK Katyal, head of medicine department at the medical institute, said at least 50 other patients have pledged to donate plasma as well.“We are taking plasma from people aged between 18 and 60 based on their health conditions. We only take it from cured patients after two weeks of their recovery. We had conducted convalescent plasma therapy on three patients, of whom one tested negative later. One of them showed improvement, while the third one did not respond well. It is a promising therapy for severely ill patients, but there is no proof that it works for all. We are treating people with this therapy and we would be able to comment more on its efficacy after conducting trials on more than 100 patients,” Dr Katyal added.He said it was not an ‘ultimate cure’, but could help patients with moderate symptoms.“A plasma donor should have normal weight, haemoglobin level above 12 and no history of diabetes or hypertension. The therapy will be administered to those with respiratory rate higher than 30 (normal is 20), oxygen saturation less than 90% (normal is 95 to 100%), or those with pus in their lungs,” the doctor said. PGIMS to set up plasma bank Dr Katyal said PGIMS will be setting up a plasma bank which would become functional by next month.

With househelps are not coming in, it has again created a challenge for them. We are extending our full cooperation by allocating volunteers who bring medicines and provide medical help to them.”Manibhai Gujarati (70), a resident of Hadapsar, said, “Our main problem is food supplies as the tiffin owner has stopped his service due to the lockdown. The entire market is shut and there is not other option, but to cook. It is a very challenging task at this age. I live here alone and depend on my maid for all household chores. The lockdown was not needed. In most societies, neighbours are self-centred and do not care about the welfare of others.”Amol Kirtikar, a city resident who currently is in New Mexico, sought Patkar’s help for his mother. “My 72-year-old mother is in Pune, living alone with her caretaker. Our tiffin provider told us they were unable to obtain a police permit to deliver during the lockdown. So from tomorrow, we have no arrangements for food. Will you be able to help us find an arrangement that will work during the lockdown? I will be grateful ,” he said. Patkar ensured that the food arrangement was done.Mangalabai Kadam, a maid from Kasewadi said that she has been asked to stay at home during the lockdown period till further orders. “The economic situation is bad and we have no money left. If the lockdown continues, it might lead to penury. We need financial assistance from the government like monthly grocery and medicine allowance to survive,” she said.Pune District House Maids’ Association president Kiran Moghe, said, “The maids lack social protection and have been reduced to living in poverty amidst rising malnutrition and illness. This is a very scary scenario and minimum wages must be paid to the domestic workers and their health needs need to be taken care of by the government and the society as a whole.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/seniors-domestic-helps-irked-as-lockdown-brings-in-new-set-of-challenges/story-LARAosi1h0LGSZqn6wETuI.html

The members of Yuva, an NGO, staged a drama wherein an imposter ‘Kumbhkaran’ depicted the authorities and the other members tried to wake him up from deep slumber so the construction work could be expedited.Social activists Satpal Singh and Gurpal Singh Grewal said, “The residents are bearing the brunt of the delay. The project has missed several deadlines, but the work has still not been completed. This has resulted in traffic bottlenecks at the bridge.”Rahul Verma, member of an NGO, Sambhav, said, “The work is going on but the pace is too slow. The railways has almost completed its work but MC needs to expedite the construction of retaining wall and approach road at one side of the bridge.”Some residents also took to social media and took a dig at the authorities. Mayor Balkar Sandhu, who had earlier claimed that the bridge would be opened for traffic by the mid-August, could not be reached for comments. In July 2016, the railways department had closed one leg of Jagraon Bridge that lead to traffic chaos in the city. Since then, residents have been pressurising the district administration to expedite the construction work of the bridge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-ngos-observe-symbolic-protest-after-jagraon-bridge-misses-4th-deadline/story-h9cTntvseuBST3Ajm4jD0J.html

14-07-2020||City||Punjab: New curbs on gatherings dashes hopes of wedding industry revival||A day after the Punjab government has imposed a complete bar on all public gatherings while restricting social gatherings to five and marriages/other social functions to 30 instead of the current 50, city’s wedding organisers on Tuesday said that there is not even flicker of hope for the industry. The banquet hall owners said that the industry was already getting a tepid response from people when the government had restricted gatherings in marriage function to 50 and now this decision will force them to shut premises. President of Marriage Palace Welfare Association Amarjit Singh Sant said, “Even after weddings were allowed to recommence under strict guidelines, we received a poor response from people. With the new guidelines, the state government has dashed hopes of revival for the industry. The impact on the industry will be felt for years to come.”The owners said that with just 30 guests they would be able to recover their operational costs.According to the new rules, the management of marriage palaces/hotels shall be held responsible and shall face suspension of licence in case of violation of norms. Further, the management of marriage palaces/hotels/other commercial spaces will have to certify that adequate arrangements for ventilation of indoor spaces have been made.President of Hotels and Restaurants Association, Amarvir Singh said, “Banquet hall owners will have to incur more fixed charges than their profits. The government should rather announce that marriage functions are not allowed in palaces and hotels.”Owner of Kohinoor Hotel at Pakhowal road, Pritam Singh said, “It seems that the decision to open marriage palaces and banquet halls has been taken to collect revenue from owners.”Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal opposes new guidelinesState general secretary of Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal, Sunil Mehra, and district President, Arvinder Makkar slammed the state government by stating that 50 persons are allowed to travel in congested buses, but are allowed to gather in wedding functions.Mehra, however, applauded the government’s decision taken by state government wherein the government lifted home quarantine rule for those visiting state for less than 72 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-new-curbs-on-gatherings-dashes-hopes-of-wedding-industry-revival/story-gvjbxKI7wKcwgh6zKKCtoM.html
14-07-2020||Chandigarh||Akali Dal accuses Cong of teaming up with dera||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Tuesday said the Congress party has teamed up with Dera Sacha Sauda to take on the SAD in the 2022 assembly elections, in exchange of promise to absolve the Sirsa-based sect of sacrilege crimes.Addressing a press conference here, SAD leaders Balwinder Singh Bhunder, Prem Singh Chandumajra, Maheshinder Singh Grewal and Sikander Singh Maluka said the Congress government was in the process of weakening the sacrilege case under an understanding with the dera. “The Congress first pressured the dera and is now using it as a political tool against the SAD. However, by doing so, they have exposed themselves,” the SAD leaders said.“We would not allow the Congress party to do dirty politics on the issue of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib. The prime accused in the sacrilege case was murdered in jail because the Congress government did not want the truth to come out. The family of Behbal Kalan police firing case prime witness, who died by suicide, had held a Congress minister and the Faridkot Congress legislator responsible for his death. All this points to that the hands of Congress party are dirty,” the leaders said.Referring to media interactions by state Congress chief Sunil Jakhar and dera supporter Veerpal Kaur held in tandem, Akali MP Bhunder said Jakhar tried to cover up the failures of his government by launching a false and malicious campaign against the SAD, while Veerpal tried to spread a canard which was refuted by the very police officer she credited it to. “It seems Veerpal is also a Congress mole and playing to the tunes of the Congress party,” he said, adding that the party will take a legal recourse.Grewal said the Congress party was trying to cover up its failures and SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal had already performed ‘ardas’ that “nothing should remain” of those who had indulged in the acts of sacrilege as well as of those who were behind it. He also made it clear that the SAD didn’t take the support of the dera in the 2017 assembly elections.“Some SAD candidates had solicited the support of the dera in their individual capacity and later sought forgiveness from the Akal Takht. In contrast, Congress leaders, including MP Preneet Kaur, and Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, relatives of Manpreet Singh Badal, Kewal Singh Dhillon, Amrinder Singh Raja Warring and others never repented for visiting the dera headquarters seeking political support. He also pointed out that the father-in-law of the dera head’s daughter was a vice-president in Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/akali-dal-accuses-cong-of-teaming-up-with-dera/story-32pEYAo2pHLzelgtuR8JpM.html

14-07-2020||City||Police start reviewing security of Kashmir-based political leaders||After the killing of former BJP district president along with his father and brother in Bandipora last week, the police have started reviewing the security of leaders of different political parties based in Kashmir.Police said BJP leader Waseem Bari, his father Bashir Ahmad and brother Suhail Bashir were killed by two Lashkar militants in a pre-planned attack, despite them having a posse of ten security personnel, who have been arrested and dismissed from their services for being absent when the militants targeted the trio from a close range. Politicians from various mainstream parties have expressed concern over their security arrangements, especially in Kashmir. Two BJP leaders, including Yuwa Morcha’s Baramulla president Maroof Bhat and party vice-president from Kupwara Asif Ahmad, recently resigned from their posts, owing to the issue.A senior police officer confirmed that the security of politicians is being reviewed and could also be upgraded on the risk assessment of different leaders. “After the political killings in Bandipora, the security of party leaders is being again reviewed,” the officer said.Top BJP leaders like general secretary Ram Madhav and state president Ravinder Raina had also flagged the issue of security of their leaders before police officials.Confirming that two BJP leaders resigned from the party in Kashmir after the killing of Waseem Bari and his family members, BJP state spokesperson Altaf Thakur said, “Most of our workers have security, but leaders are still without security. The party leadership has taken up the issue with the government.”Thakur said they have been assured that within a week’s time the security of politicians will be reviewed. “The security of not only BJP leaders, but those affiliated with other political parties would also be reviewed or upgraded,” he said.Last month, Congress sarpanch from Anantnag Ajay Pandita was also killed by militants. The Congress had said that despite threat and requests he wasn’t provided any security cover.After the revocation of Article 370 last year, the security of many politicians affiliated with different parties was downsized or withdrawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-start-reviewing-security-of-kashmir-based-political-leaders/story-q0zBkOiesYwOcOWtlwlgYK.html

14-07-2020||City||Kashmir opens for tourism but residents scorn poor timing of move||While Kashmir is set to welcome tourists after the administration opened the sector on Tuesday, the valley residents have ridiculed the decision which has come when the region is witnessing an unabated spike in Covid-19 cases and re-imposition of lockdown restrictions.The tourism department officials said the protocol committees and health teams are on the ground, but they expect that it may take some time for trickling down of the message to potential visitors.“We have started getting congratulatory messages from the outside tour operators and everything is in place. Our officials are on the ground to make sure that every precaution is taken. However it may take at-least two weeks to one month for the tourists to start bookings,” said Kashmir tourism director Nisar Ahmad Wani.The Jammu and Kashmir administration on Sunday decided to open the tourism sector in a phased manner with effect from Tuesday, allowing only by-air arrival. All incoming tourists must have confirmed hotel bookings for the duration of their stay and confirmed return air tickets besides compulsory RT-PCR testing of everyone on arrival.Ironically, the order came on the same day when the administration imposed restrictions in parts of the valley, including Srinagar — the worst affected district— by designating over 88 containment zones amid a surge in coronavirus cases over the past few weeks. Earlier, the Amarnath pilgrimage was also given a go-ahead besides opening of parks.These decisions have been sharply castigated by people even associated with tourism.Ashfaq Siddiq Dug, president of Travel Agents Association of Kashmir, said it was an ill-timed move and an insult to the sensibilities of the locals.“It is a shame. How can I welcome tourists when the locals are being herded into their homes? How do you expect tourism to flourish in this scenario and how can we be sure if they are not carriers,” asked Dug.“The ground situation is not conducive. The decision to open the tourism sector is as good as building castles in the air. Probably it has a political angle to it to show to the world how much we are enthusiastic about starting tourism,” he said.The number of people infected with the disease in J&K has already crossed 10,800 with 187 fatalities — 170 in Kashmir and 17 in Jammu division till Monday evening.Moin-ul-Islam, an engineering student, questioned how locals will agree amid the dichotomy of the decisions. “This is why people don’t follow the guidelines. Locals asked to stay at home and tourists welcomed. How are we supposed to adhere to their orders,” he asked.Others jibed whether only locals were susceptible to the virus and the visitors were immune. “Does the virus become hyperactive and harmful when it comes to dealing with the natives and goes into hibernation mode with respect to the visitors and pilgrims? Has the critical thinking in Kashmir been quarantined or put in isolation? Or, may be, declared a containment zone,” said author and political commentator Gowhar Geelani on Twitter.The tourism director, however, defended the administrative decision saying that the people associated with the sector have been suffering losses. “Please ask those who are associated with tourism like pony riders, tourist guides and Shikara rowers whose families have been suffering from hunger. There are so many who really want it,” Wani said.“We are not saying that we will bring them without taking all the precautions. We will follow proper protocol,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kashmir-opens-for-tourism-but-residents-scorn-poor-timing-of-move/story-aGW4G4AO3mtpuw7KvBP3YP.html

14-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh residents rush to register their dogs fearing hefty fines||The hike in the penalty for non-registration of pet dogs has led to a 10-fold increase in the number of residents coming forward to complete the formalities, say Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) authorities. From 10 applications a day, the MC now gets around 100 forms a day for dog registration.The UT administration had hiked the penalty from Rs 500 to Rs 5,000, while notifying the Chandigarh Registration of Pet Dogs (Amendment) Bye-laws 2020 on July 2. The cost of registration had also been hiked from Rs 200 to Rs 500 per dog.The hike had been approved by the MC General House last year. ‘MOST APPLICATIONS FROM GOVT OFFICIALS’Dr Amrit Warring, medical officer health (MOH), MC, said, “While earlier, we got around 10 registration applications a day, we now get more 100 a day. This has happened after the 10-fold increase in the penalty. Interestingly, most of the new applications for dog registration are coming from government officials.”The MC has not only increased the penalty for non-registration, but, also increased the fine for repeat offences. If the violation is of a continuing nature, then an additional fine is imposed which may extend to Rs 200 for a maximum of seven days for which the breach continues. Earlier, the said fine was Rs 20.If a non-registered pet dog is seized or detained under the bylaws, the owner has to pay maintenance charges of Rs 1,000 instead of the earlier Rs 100 a day to claim the dog.“It is a welcome step we expect the trend to continue in coming months. People generally avoid registration, but, with stringent penalties, city residents are keener to register their dogs instead of paying hefty fines,” said Warring.The MC is building a database for the pet dogs. “With more people coming to register their dogs, our database will be better and indicate the status of dog population. We will see a better management of pet dogs now,” Warring said.As per the Chandigarh Registration of Pet Dogs Bylaws, it is mandatory for dog owners to register each pet at the MC office, once the canine is four months old. Only two dogs are allowed per family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-residents-rush-to-register-their-dogs-fearing-hefty-fines/story-TSwKDakDiLxx8zEYnUJ9GK.html

14-07-2020||Bhopal||Covid-19 situation in Madhya Pradesh aggravates, more than 5,000 cases in fortnight||Covid-19 situation in Madhya Pradesh has witnessed an alarming spike in the positive cases particularly in four cities of the state- Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior and Morena much to worry of the state government that drove chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to visit Gwalior-Chambal region a couple of days back to review the situation over there, as per the government’s data and officials.As the situation has aggravated Gwalior district administration announced on Monday night clamping curfew in the city for seven days while also ordering sealing of the border of the district. Indore on Monday announced rescheduling of opening of markets as per a left-right method meaning thereby the shops on one side of the road will be opened on one day to be followed by opening of shops on the other side of the road the next day, as per the administrative authorities in the districts. In Morena, collector Priyanka Das announced that until and unless positivity rate of samples was reduced to 4% from 10% the administration will not be able to allow opening of markets. “In the past seven days sampling reports 42% were tested positive including 40% from the urban area”, she said in a meeting. The grim and worsening situation in the state can be gauged from the fact that in the past 15 days the state has witnessed more than 5,000 new cases. On an average, this fortnight has seen almost 335 new cases every day or in other words almost 14 cases every hour. The exact number is 5021 to take the tally of the state Covid-19 cases to 18,207, as per the health department’s bulletin released on Monday night.In comparison, the state had seen 13186 Covid-19 positive cases till June 28 night. Thus on an average, the period of 101 days since Corona cases were first reported in the state on March 20, almost 131 positive cases were reported daily or more than five cases per hour. Thus, growth of Covid-19 cases went up by more than 250% during the past fortnight, as per the government’s data.Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior and Morena contributed 2903 Covid-19 positive cases to the total of 5,021 which is 57.81% of the total with Bhopal reporting the maximum number of cases- 850 followed by Indore with 737 cases, Gwalior- 665 and Morena-651.As per the health department’s bulletin, Gwalior became the third district in the state with maximum number of Covid positive cases- 1016 after Indore (5352) and Bhopal (3590). Morena in Gwalior-Chambal region closely follows Gwalior with 976 cases. There are 21 more districts in the state out of the total 52 which have Covid cases in three digits from 101 in Vidisha to 896 in Ujjain. WORRYING DEATH RATEAs per the health department’s data, in the past one fortnight the state witnessed 106 deaths. Thus, seven deaths were reported daily on an average whereas earlier in the 101-day period the state reported more than 5 deaths every day. The total deaths reported so far in the state is 663, as per the health department’s bulletin.Indore tops the death chart with 269 deaths followed by Bhopal (122), Ujjain (71), Burhanpur (23), Sagar (22), Khandwa (17), Jabalpur and Khargone (15 each), Dewas (10) and remaining in 29 districts. Though the death rate in the state has been reduced to 3.64% at present from once close to 5%, it’s still higher than the national average death rate- 2.61%. Ujjain continues to report the highest death rate among major cities in the state at 7.72% followed by Indore with 5.02%. Bhopal’s death rate among Covid-19 patients is 3.39%.Right to Information (RTI) activist Ajay Dubey said, “The situation is alarming given the fact the state government is manipulating the data on the patients and deaths. It has been seen that the government withholds the data on death to be released later. Also, the fact remains that the number of tests being conducted on suspected Covid patients is much less in comparison to what is required. That’s why the real situation is hardly reflected in the government’s bulletins.”Public health expert Amulya Nidhi said, “The state government claimed to have taken a number of measures to control the situation particularly in Indore and Bhopal but while situation is further aggravated in the two cities Gwalior-Chambal region became another big Covid hotspot. At the same time, Malwa-Nimad region and parts of Mahakoshal, Bundelkhand and central regions continue to pose a major challenge to the state government. The situation has worsened during the unlock period and the state government seems to have no idea how to control the situation.”Admitting that the Corona infection was on rise in the state health minister Prabhuram Choudhary who was assigned the portfolio of health department on Monday said, “This is why I have decided not to celebrate my birthday on Wednesday. However, the state government under the leadership of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan started a ‘Kill corona campaign’ from July 1 to control the situation in the entire state. I will review the situation and my priority is to upgrade the hospitals and other infrastructure of the public health system.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/covid-19-situation-in-madhya-pradesh-aggravates-more-than-5-000-cases-in-fortnight/story-JJEVpbWW227oeqCW5oEvLP.html
14-07-2020||City||Dera’s revelations exposed anti-Sikh face of Akali leadership: Jakhar||Chandigarh Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar on Tuesday said that Dera Sacha Sauda’s statement regarding its support to the Sukhbir Singh Badal-led Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in the 2017 state assembly polls has exposed the nexus between them.Jakhar said the existence of the nexus which was suspected by people so far has been proven to be true by the Sirsa-based dera’s admission that they voted for Akalis. “It is unfortunate that the SAD which proclaims itself as a Panthic outfit joined hands with the dera just for the sake of political power,” he told reporters here. He was accompanied by cooperation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa.The PPCC chief’s statement came a day after the dera’s state committee, in a press conference, termed the Punjab Police’s probe into alleged sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib as a conspiracy of the Amarinder Singh-led Congress government to defame the sect for political mileage. It also cited the dera’s call to its supporters to back the SAD in the previous polls as the probable reason behind the government action.Responding to dera’s statement, the PPCC chief accused the SAD of backstabbing the Panth by hobnobbing with Dera Sacha Sauda to remain in power. “The candid admission by dera followers has established beyond any doubt that a deal was struck between Sukhbir Badal and the dera chief as per which the latter was granted pardon and his movie was screened across the state,” he alleged.Jakhar also said the people of state in general, and Sikhs in particular, would never forgive Sukhbir Badal as the dera had never admitted till now about giving political support to any party. He said that Panthic organisations should come forward and demand excommunicating Sukhbir from Sikh faith for hobnobbing with these anti-Sikh forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dera-s-revelations-exposed-anti-sikh-face-of-akali-leadership-jakhar/story-DiShVAslOuLXkAZrXSGLUN.html

14-07-2020||Lucknow||UP Vidhan Sabha speaker dismisses pleas to disqualify two Cong MLAs||In a major relief to rebel Congress MLAs Aditi Singh and Rakesh Singh, Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly Speaker Hriday Narayan Dikshit on Monday rejected the Congress petition seeking their disqualification from UP assembly. The speaker dismissed the petitions against both the lawmakers saying they did not attract provisions of 10th schedule of Constitution of India and thus “lacked substance.”“After scrutinizing all the documents in the light of Supreme Court’s orders, I am of the view that Rae Bareli (Sadar) MLA Aditi Singh does not attract provisions of 10th schedule of the Constitution of India and hence cannot be disqualified for defection. The petition seeking her disqualification is therefore rejected for lacking force,” said Speaker in his 45-page order dated July 13, 2020.The Congress has seven members in the state assembly and much signification was being attached to the petitions seeking disqualification of two MLAs as they represented assembly segments of Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seat.Congress Legislature Party leader Aradhana Mishra had filed a petition on November 26, 2020 seeking Singh’s disqualification for attending special session of the state legislature convened on the occasion of 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi to discuss the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals on October 2, 2019. Singh while attending the special session in defiance of the whip had allegedly praised chief minister Yogi Adityanath in the house.In his order, speaker did not accept the Congress contention that by attending the special session, the Congress MLA had voluntarily given up her membership and said public representative was expected to put up point about development of the constituency and restriction of freedom expression of public representatives was not in accordance with the provisions of the constitution. He quoted the Supreme Court’s orders to make his point that only such issues could be brought under provisions of the 10th schedule of the Constitution that may be related to policies of a political party or that may decide the confidence in a government. Any observations about SDGs or Mahatama Gandhi’s birth anniversary did not attract the provisions of 10th schedule, he said.Speaker further observed that the whip issued by the then Congress Legislature Party leader Ajay Kumar Lallu on October 2, 2019 was not in accordance with the conditions laid down by the Supreme Court of India in Kihota Hollohan case (AIR 1993 SCC111). SC’s order quoted by the speaker reads “it would be appropriate that the direction or whip which results in such disqualification under paragraph 2(1)(b) is so worded as to clearly indicate that voting or abstaining from voting contrary to the said direction would result incurring the disqualification under paragraph 2 (1) (b) of the Tenth Schedule of so that the member concerned has knowledge of the consequences flowing from his conduct in voting or abstaining from voting contrary to such a direction.”Speaker said analysis of the facts mentioned in the SC verdict make it clear that the opponent (Aditi) could not be disqualified for attending special session of the house. He, however, rejected Aditi’s contention that the petition has been filed by the Indian National Congress that was a political party and not a person and thus was not in accordance with rules of the house. He quoted budget session and Covid-19 as valid reasons for turning down the petitioner’s plea that Aditi’s reply should not be placed on record in view of the delay. Speaker observed that the petition should have been filed under provisions of para 2 (1) (b) of the 10th schedule instead of para 2 (1) (A) of the 10th scheduled of the Constitution of India.On the other hand, the petition seeking disqualification of Rakesh Singh was filed alleging that the legislator worked for the BJP by attending BJP rallies and worked for the saffron party before and after filing of nomination for Lok Sabha election by his brother Dinesh Singh as a BJP candidate on April 15, 2019. Rejecting petition seeking disqualification of Rakesh Singh he observed that the points made by petitioner did not support the contention that the Congress MLA had voluntarily given up membership of the house. Dikshit said photographs given by the petitioner did not establish that the MLA’s vehicle was being used for BJP’s campaigning. He said photographs also did not prove that the MLA was working for the BJP on the day of polling for 2019 Lok Sabha elections.Congress to file appealLucknow: The Congress has decided to file an appeal against Speaker Hridaya Narain Dishit’s order rejecting party’s petitions seeking disqualification of two Rae Bareli MLAs Aditi Singh and Rakesh Singh.“Yes, we will file an appeal against the Speaker’s order that was undemocratic. Speaker is a member of the BJP and has apparently given his order under government’s pressure,” said Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) president Ajay Kumar Lallu. “We are exploring all options and an appeal will be filed soon,” said Lallu.Congress to file appeal in HCThe Congress has decided to file an appeal against Speaker Hridaya Narain Dishit’s order rejecting party’s petitions seeking disqualification of two Rae Bareli MLAs Aditi Singh and Rakesh Singh in Allahabad High Court.“Yes, we will file an appeal against the Speaker’s order that was undemocratic. Speaker is a member of the BJP and has apparently given his order under government’s pressure,” said Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) president Ajay Kumar Lallu. “We are exploring all options and an appeal at Allahabad HC will be filed soon,” said Lallu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-vidhan-sabha-speaker-dismisses-pleas-to-disqualify-two-cong-mlas/story-U5v5nSCUiPuotO9OUS2w9M.html

14-07-2020||Chandigarh||Supreme Court refuses to grant parole to self-styled godman Rampal from Haryana||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to grant parole to self-styled godman Rampal from Haryana, who is undergoing life imprisonment in murder cases.A bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and justices R Subhash Reddy and AS Bopanna dismissed the plea of Rampal seeking parole to attend the wedding of his granddaughter, scheduled on Wednesday.On October 17, 2018, engineer-turned self-styled godman Rampal and his 13 followers were sentenced to life imprisonment in a second case of murder registered at Barwala police station in Hisar district of Haryana on November 19, 2014.Rampal and his followers were convicted for murder, wrongful confinement of people and criminal conspiracy. A woman was found dead at Rampal’s ashram in Hisar district on November 19, 2014. Rampal was arrested the same day for murder and other charges were slapped on him. He was also sentenced for life in another case of murder on October 16, 2018, involving the death of four women and a child at the Hisar ashram on November 18, 2014.On October 11, 2018, Rampal and his followers had been convicted in two cases of murder and other offences, including wrongful confinement of his victims at his ashram in Hisar.He and his followers since their arrest in November 2014, were convicted after a four-year trial by the lower court in Haryana in 2018.The two murder cases against Rampal and his followers were filed at Barwala police station on November 19, 2014. Besides the murder charges, the Barwala police had also invoked the offence of wrongful confinement, among others, in the two FIRs.In November 2014, as the police arrested Rampal, holed up inside his ashram, his followers and devotees, numbering more than 15,000, surrounded the sprawling 12-acre complex to prevent his arrest. Six people — five women and an infant — were killed in the ensuing violence.Before becoming a self-styled godman, Rampal worked as a junior engineer in a Haryana government department for 15 years before quitting in May 1995. He later set up an ashram in Barwala area of Hisar and another one in Rohtak district and gradually gained popularity as a spiritual leader. He took to full-time preaching, touring villages and the cities across Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/supreme-court-refuses-to-grant-parole-to-self-styled-godman-rampal-from-haryana/story-JnV6v1CFVsNhLGyYJUrUQJ.html
14-07-2020||City||Chamba’s centuries-old Minjar Fair to be symbolic affair this year||Dharamshala Chamba’s famed Minjar festival, believed to have first started in the 10th century to mark the victory of King Sahila Varma over the king of Kangra, will just be a symbolic affair this year, due to the covid-19 pandemic and the resultant restrictions on gatherings. The centuries-old traditional Hindu fair symbolises the blossoming of maize in the historical town, located on the banks of the Ravi River. The fair is associated with the monsoon, in which the farmers pray for heavy rain for a good harvest, is scheduled from July 26 to August 2.Minjar itself refers to silk tassles, worn by locals on their dresses that glow like maize blossoms in the sun.“The Minjar fair will be celebrated symbolically sans festivities this year due to Covid-19 pandemic,” Chamba deputy commissioner Vivek Bhatia confirmed.The festival will begin on July 26 with a ceremonial Puja and offering of holy Minjars at the historic Laxmi Narayan and Raghuvira temples. There will be no cultural festivities and sports activities. The Chowgan (public promenade), the main venue of the fair, will remain closed for the general public. Only some local artists will sing traditional ‘Kunjri-Malhar’ at the town’s cultural hall that will be telecast live on the local cable network. “The festival will end on August 2 with the immersion of Minjars in the Ravi,” the DC added. Later, the palanquin of lord Raghuvira, the chief deity of the region, is led around the town in colourful procession on opening and closing day.THE SYMBOL OF COMMUNAL UNITYMinjar fair symbolises not just the blossoming of maize, but also the close ties between Hindus and Muslims. The festival starts after a Muslim Mirja family offers the first holy Minjar at Laxmi Narayan temple. Muslims do the embroidery on the Minjars, a tradition that has been followed sine the festival began. MANIMAHESH YATRA MAY ALSO BE SYMBOLICThe DC added that the annual Manimahesh Yatra, scheduled from August 12-25, may also be organized symbolically. Lakhs of pilgrims undertake the arduous 14-km yatra to oval-shaped glacial-fed Manimahesh Lake in tribal Bharmour sub-division, to catch a glimpse of Mount Kailash, believed to be the abode of Lord Shiva, and offer prayers. The lake is located at a height of 13,500-feet in the Pir Panjal mountain range of Himalayas. This year, however, pilgrims may not be allowed to visit the lake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chamba-s-centuries-old-minjar-fair-to-be-symbolic-affair-this-year/story-zMFWHf9i6WX9Pfo6Go9fKM.html

No quarantine, only undertaking needed||Chandigarh: Those coming to Punjab for less than 72 hours are now exempt from the mandatory home quarantine, and only need to submit a formal undertaking at the border check post.Announcing this relaxation for inbound domestic travellers, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said it had been decided to provide this concession to facilitate students wishing to come for examinations or business travellers etc, whose stay in the state is less than 72 hours from the time of their arrival. It has been decided to exempt such travellers from the 14-day mandatory home quarantine requirement that remains in place for domestic inbound travellers in Punjab, he said.The exempt travellers will, however, need to submit a formal undertaking with the officer in-charge (OIC) of the check post in a standard format provided on COVA app, which they would have to download on their phones. Besides entering their details in the app’s travellers’ information section, these persons would have to undertake that the COVA app will remain active throughout their period of stay in Punjab.UNDERTAKING THAT NOT FROM CONTAINMENT ZONEThe additional SOPs for such travellers requires them to voluntarily submit that they are not coming from any containment zone and undertake not to stay for more than 72 hours in Punjab from the time of arrival in the state.During this period, they shall commit to monitoring their health and maintaining distance from those around, and also interact with the assigned surveillance team in case they suffer from any symptoms consistent with Covid-19 and will immediately call 104.All due precautions would have to be strictly adhered to and non-adherence to wearing of mask/social distancing would make them liable to be acted upon under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code.ONLY EXEMPTION TO THE RULEIf within a week of return any such person is tested positive then he/she will have to immediately contact the Punjab government at 104 and assist them in contact tracing.While the Government of India had recently waived the requirement of home quarantine for domestic travellers and replaced the same with self-monitoring, Capt Amarinder Singh has made it clear that quarantine restrictions will continue to remain in place in Punjab on account of rising numbers. Today’s announcement is the only exemption to the rule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coming-to-punjab-for-less-than-72-hours-no-quarantine-only-undertaking-needed/story-PmJz2bsztJuzhcG5TvTODN.html
14-07-2020||Chandigarh||30 Youth Congress activists flout Covid-19 guidelines, hold cycle rally in Amritsar||Amritsar: A day after the Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government banned public gatherings in Punjab to check the spike in Covid-19 cases in the state, activists of his party’s youth wing took out a bicycle rally in Amritsar on Tuesday to protest the fuel price hike by the central government.Flouting the latest government guidelines, the cycle rally was organised by Amritsar South Youth Congress president Simranjit Singh Rajput. Unit vice-president Rajive Chhabra and Amritsar YC secretary Vivan Khurana, the son of District Congress Committee (urban) chief Jatinder Sonia also took part in the rally, which was taken out from Sultanwind Road to Sakattari Bagh.Before the start of the rally, 30 party activists gathered at the site, ignoring social-distancing norms.They did not have permission from the district administration to hold the rally.“We had taken the approval from our party leader Barinder Dhillon. But no permission was taken from the administration. We know that the chief minister issued new guidelines on Monday but our programme was planned. We took care of social distancing. Only 20 to 22 cycles were used for the rally,” Chhabra claimed.A child was also brought to the rally and made to wear a banner, criticising the fuel price hike by the BJP-led central government.The Amritsar (rural) police had booked 1,000 workers of the opposition Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) for holding protests on the same issue last week.

Mangla Prasad Mishra, the director in the directorate of public relations (DPR), in a letter to Wali the man’s state-level accreditation as a journalist, has been cancelled with effect from July 13, 2020, “as per accreditation rules due to his involvement in a crime.”In another letter to the chief secretary on Monday, Mishra said the allotment of a government bungalow to the man was cancelled as he was no longer a state-level accredited journalist.Five teenaged girls were found by a police patrolling team in an intoxicated state in Ratibad area at 3am on Sunday. During counselling by Childline, the girls revealed that the man used to call them to attend parties and raped them, said police.“More girls are expected to come… with their complaints as he has been raping the minor girls who are from the weaker section for a long time after forcing them to consume liquor,” Archana Sahay, Childline’s director, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/marriage-hall-owned-by-bhopal-rape-accused-razed-allotment-of-govt-bungalow-cancelled/story-PccL2mh7Ww9pEiVBjiiGnO.html
14-07-2020||Chandigarh||Pakistan govt lays astroturf in Kartarpur Sahib gurdwara to facilitate pilgrims in hot weather||Lahore: The Pakistan government has laid a 16,000-foot artificial turf in the courtyard of the Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara to facilitate bare-footed pilgrims walk on the marble floor in the scorching heat, a top official said on Monday.Sikh pilgrims from Pakistan have been visiting the gurdwara after it was reopened on June 29 following its closure for three months due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“Astroturf was laid on the marble floor of Gurdwara Darbar Sahib last week,” Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) spokesperson Amir Hashmi said.He said the gurdwara floor is carpeted with 16,000-ft turf in the courtyard to facilitate pilgrims as they have to walk bare-foot on the marble floor and in this hot weather, it is difficult to walk or sit on it.Indian pilgrims are currently not visiting the gurdwara as India temporarily suspended the pilgrimage and registration for the Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara on March 16 in view of the coronavirus outbreak.Pilgrims of all faiths from India are allowed to undertake round the year visa-free travel to the historic gurdwara in Pakistan’s Punjab province.NO GREEN SIGNAL FROM INDIA“Still there has been no green signal from India to allow Sikhs to visit the gurdwara,” Hashmi said, adding Pakistani Sikhs, however, are visiting it since June 29.Sikhs from Pakistan and India are allowed to visit the Darabar Sahib by following the standard operating protocol (SOPs) for social distancing. ETPB and Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee have made special arrangements for the safety of the pilgrims.Earlier, foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said that Pakistan had conveyed the Indian side about its readiness to reopen the corridor in connection with the occasion of the death anniversary of Sikh ruler Maharaja Ranjeet Singh on June 29.Sources in the government of India in New Delhi had said Pakistan was trying to create a mirage of goodwill by proposing to reopen the corridor on June 29.SHORT NOTICE OF TWO DAYSThe sources also wondered why Pakistan proposed to reopen it in such a short notice of two days while a bilateral agreement on the corridor provided for information to be shared by both sides at least seven days before the date of travel.The 4km-long Kartarpur Corridor provides visa-free access to Indian Sikh pilgrims to visit the gurdwara, the final resting place of Sikh faith’s founder Guru Nanak Dev, who had spent the last 18 years of his life in Kartarpur.In November last year, the two countries threw open the corridor linking Dera Baba Sahib in Gurdaspur in India and Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan, in a historic people-to-people initiative.Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara is located in Pakistan’s Narowal district across the Ravi river, about 4km from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pakistan-govt-lays-astroturf-in-kartarpur-sahib-gurdwara-to-facilitate-pilgrims-in-hot-weather/story-juaCtl6UIzgxrEjr2xmH3J.html

14-07-2020||City||‘Operation Lotus’ will not be successful in Maharashtra; backing BJP in 2014 was political ploy: Sharad Pawar||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, who is considered the architect of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, said that the “Bharatiya Janata Party-sponsored Operation Lotus” will not be successful in the state and that the Uddhav Thackeray-government will successfully complete its five-year term. Pawar termed ‘Operation Lotus’ a gross misuse of power and said that it is a means to weaken and destabilise a democratically elected government with the “use of central powers”.For the first time, Pawar also clarified on the NCP’s support to the BJP in 2014 and said it was a “political ploy”. He admitted that the step was taken to keep the Sena and BJP away. The clarification came in the third and the final part of his interview to Shiv Sena parliamentarian Sanjay Raut, for the latter’s mouthpiece Saamana. The interview was published on Monday.Pawar said that Operation Lotus will not have any impact in Maharashtra, when Raut, who is the executive editor of Saamana, asked him if the Maharashtra government, too, would collapse. “Some people from their [BJP] party have been saying this. First they said it’ll collapse in three months, then in six, and now some are betting on September, while others on October. I am confident that the Uddhav Thackeray government will complete its full term. Operation Lotus or anything else will have no impact here,” he said, adding that the parties can even contest the next Assembly elections together, if all goes well.The statement comes amid the political crisis in Rajasthan, where there are speculations that the Congress government under chief minister Ashok Gehlot may collapse.Speaking on his party’s outside support to BJP in 2014 to form the state government, the Maratha strongman said it was done to keep BJP in check by not allowing Sena to form a government with the national party.“I sincerely wished that Sena and BJP would not come together. But when I realised that Sena will go with the BJP, I made a statement that we will give them outside support. The reason behind it was that the BJP was in power in the Centre and with a CM in Maharashtra, they will not allow Sena or other parties to function in a democratic political setup. They would have sooner or later betrayed everyone and therefore this was a political ploy,” Pawar clarified.Interestingly, Raut did not quiz Pawar on his nephew and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s move to back former CM Devendra Fadnavis to form the 80-hour government, amid talks between the three parties in November last year.But Pawar dismissed claims of him and Fadnavis holding talks to form a government in the state.“Some BJP leaders spoke to my colleagues and me about the government formation, saying they didn’t want to go with the Shiv Sena. They said since I had good relations with the prime minister, I should intervene and give my approval. Hence, to avoid any confusion and perception about myself and my party, I met the PM at Parliament House and told him the NCP will not go with the BJP. If possible, we will form government with the Shiv Sena or sit in the Opposition, I told the PM,” Pawar said.He revealed that he told Raut, his Rajya Sabha colleague, about his intention about the meeting.Pawar also targeted Fadnavis and said that he did not think the latter had any say in the decision-making process at the national level. He added that people came to know who Fadnavis was only after he became the CM.When asked about the Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi being made to vacate her bungalow, Pawar said it was “low level politics”.“I don’t think this is cultured behaviour. Power should be used with humility. Such things happen when the arrogance of power gets into the head. Priyanka is the daughter of a former PM, who was assassinated. You may have political differences. But there is no wisdom in using power to harass political opponents. This is not vendetta politics but low-level politics,” he said.Pawar also expressed that the Opposition parties have the capability to provide an alternative to the nation.“Earlier this year, there were some meetings and the Opposition parties discussed some policies. But then the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country. Once this crisis is over, it will again gain momentum and I will take the initiative. Providing an alternative [for BJP] is the need of the hour,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/operation-lotus-will-not-be-successful-in-maharashtra-backing-bjp-in-2014-was-political-ploy-sharad-pawar/story-URLj6RvgXrEv5nhUYlBWSI.html
14-07-2020||City||300 fliers from Dubai claim they were made to wait at Mumbai airport for 10 hours||More than 300 Indians who landed in Mumbai from Dubai on an Emirates flight on Monday morning went through a harrowing experience after they were made to wait at the airport for around 10 hours . The flight landed at the city airport around 8am, but passengers were first made to wait inside the aircraft for around three hours and then made to sit in a room for around four hours without being given any reason. The fliers claimed they were later made to stand in a queue for immigration and other formalities for long and were able to leave for a Vashi hotel only by around 6pm. After they deboarded, they were not given any food at the airport, the passengers claimed. At night, the passengers were taken to a Thane hotel after many of them claimed that the hotel rooms were exorbitantly priced.Thane resident Anish Rane, who was stranded in Dubai for three months, said, “The crew made us wait inside the aircraft till around 11.15am stating that health officials were not available to conduct the mandatory tests. However, even after we de-boarded none of us were screened and entered the airport without any test.”An Airport Health Organisation (APHO) official said after passengers deboard, they go to the screening counter where the body temperature is automatically recorded and displayed on the monitors with the help of thermal cameras. “We no longer follow the earlier system of screening passengers with handheld thermometers. Once a passenger arrives at the screening counter, they submit their self-reporting forms (a copy of which is stamped and given back to passengers) and proceed for immigration formalities,” he said, adding that to prevent crowding at the counters, airlines make passengers wait inside the aircraft.Passengers said after the immigration, they were asked if any of them was feeling unwell or uneasy. They claimed that officials did not ensure that social distancing norms were followed in the queue for immigration and while the police completed their quarantine-related formalities.“Passengers were brushing against each other while standing in the queue, thereby increasing the risk of getting infected by Covid-19. I was tested negative for the virus before leaving from Dubai but how can we be sure about our safety if we come in close proximity with others who may have been infected?” said a passenger, who did not wish to be named. Khargar resident Aafaque Sheikh said the passengers received breakfast during the flight and were provided with water at the airport but . Sheikh said even after they left the airport, they were not given any clarity on where they would be quarantined.”They took us to a hotel on a state transport bus and charged us ₹320 for it. We were not given the option of choosing a hotel of our choice. There was no official on my bus and passengers could have fled,” he added. Additional municipal commissioner P Velarusu said that passengers are informed of bearing their own expenses when they book their travel. “It is only in exceptional cases [in case the fliers are labour class passengers] that we take the passengers to government hospitals. If a passenger hails from Thane or any other district then the decision of allotting them a hotel for their institutional quarantine is taken by their respective district collector,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/300-fliers-from-dubai-claim-they-were-made-to-wait-at-mumbai-airport-for-10-hours/story-UbSSVR8SsQ1U3zwqs1XhiL.html
14-07-2020||City||Maharashtra government appeals to citizens to file complaints about plasma sale||The state appealed to citizens to come forward and register complaints if they come across people or groups who offer plasma on sale for lakhs of rupees for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. The state is coming across several complaints of plasma sale and gangs that run fake fitness certificate rackets.Plasma therapy emerged as an effective method to treat Covid-19 patients, but owing to the paucity of plasma donors, some potential donors reportedly contacted the relatives of the patients and offered the plasma for lakhs of rupees, a statement issued by the state cyber cell revealed on Monday. The statement added that the rackets involved in such illegal practices are also creating fitness certificates of donors which are mandatory for plasma donation. Stating that cyber criminals could be behind such rackets, home minister Anil Deshmukh said, “There is also the possibility of plasma being sold through the dark web and other illegal channels. We urge the relatives of patients to undergo treatment only from recognised hospitals and doctors.”During plasma therapy, the antibody rich plasma extracted from a recovered patient is administered to a patient undergoing treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-government-appeals-to-citizens-to-file-complaints-about-plasma-sale/story-ctHzYUMeXhO4rluY9QbcuI.html

The step is taken to ensure that Covid-19 as well as Non-Covid patients receive treatment at reasonable rates amid the coronavirus outbreak.As per the new directions the hospital has to display all the beds available, including the 80% which is now under KDMC control and reveal how many of them are vacant, filled as well as the rates fixed by the government and the rates of the hospital on a board outside the hospital. Likewise, a patient and his/her relatives visiting the hospital need to be given detailed information about the charges during admission. “If a patient requests for a bed which is under the 80% category and if it is available, it will be mandatory for the hospital to treat the patient. Also, it will not be possible for hospitals to charge patients more than the rate fixed by the government for the treatment. There can be no discrimination against patients. The corporation already issued notices to two hospitals for charging exorbitant rates,”said Vijay Suryavanshi, commissioner, KDMC.Patients can complain about the exorbitant rates charged by the hospital or the unavailability of beds on 0251-2211866 in the war room of civic headquarters, KDMC said. Staffers who refuse to treat Covid-19 patients will also face action and lose their licences. Social activist Sreeniwas Ghanekar,52, who is also the founder of Alert Citizens’ Group, Kalyan, said,” We have been complaining about the unfair practices at hospitals and have asked the civic body to come up with some regulations on it. Now with the civic body deciding to take over 80% beds in the hospitals, we will also monitor the entire process and make sure people get treatment at reasonable rates within the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kalyan-dombivli-civic-body-brings-80-beds-in-all-private-hospitals-under-its-control/story-Mtv7x7GRbwLuQOpBv6c8oM.html

All nine wards within the corporation have received a mobile dispensary as a part of the initiative. Thane city also received its first set of antigen testing centre, with around 1 lakh testing kits. The four centres in different parts of the city will soon start operations. Thane city reported 333 new cases and seven deaths on Monday, after which the city’s total Covid-19 count surged to 12,957, while the death toll stands at 196. “We have to start the treatment of patients as soon as they are tested positive, to break the chain. Those with symptoms, especially, should be given treatment at the earliest. We also need to make sure that the virus is detected on time, for which these mobile dispensaries will prove to be beneficial and help in identifying those with fever and other Covid-19 symptoms,” said Eknath Shinde, Thane’s guardian minister and cabinet minister said at the flag off for the ‘Mission Zero’ initiative at TMC on Monday.Shinde also inaugurated the antigen testing centre at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital in Kalwa on Monday. Apart from the Kalwa hospital, two other private hospitals and a Covid care facility will also have these antigen testing centres.“These rapid antigen testing kits will be used for high risk patients from hots pots, containment zones and slum areas within Thane city,” said an official from the municipal corporation. Civic commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma said that the situation is not out of control in the city. “Although the numbers are increasing, we have not lost control of the situation yet. We have increased the number of testing which is also the reason behind the spike in the city’s positive cases. Almost 80% patients are asymptomatic and hence there is no need to panic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-on-mission-zero-gets-four-antigen-testing-centres/story-IbxYJ31SqXsQEVY1HyENDI.html
14-07-2020||Mumbai||IMA opposes move to make Covid-19 report must to buy remdesivir and tocilizumab||Days after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) made it mandatory for customers to show prescriptions and Covid-19 test report to buy remdesivir and tocilizumab drugs, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Monday wrote a letter to the state government criticising the apex drug regulating body’s decision. It said the move will make it more difficult for patients and their families to procure the drugs as a number of times test reports show false negatives or inconclusive results, and urged the body to make the drugs available with only prescription or recommendation from hospital.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageMembers of IMA said every day Maharashtra requires almost 1.5 lakh vials of remdesivir and that hospitals across the state are facing an acute shortage of the two drugs. Due to the sudden rise in demand for these drugs, suppliers are selling them to highest bidders, said IMA. According to patients and doctors, the drugs are available at five to 10 times the actual cost in the black market. A vial of remdesivir costs between ₹5,000 and ₹5,500 while that of tocilizumab is around ₹92,000.“These illegal activities are happening due to sudden rise in demand. Almost 20% patients need the drugs. At present, we have more than 1 lakh active patients. In addition to this, if we include around 5,000 patients with inconclusive reports, we have 25,000 patients who need remdesivir every day,” said Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president of IMA’s state wing. “As we give remdesivir six times a day, the state will require 1.5 lakh vials every day. But we don’t even get 75,000 vials a day,” he added.Remdesivir is the only drug approved by the United States food and drug administration for treating Covid-19 patients. While tocilizumab is still imported, remdesivir has now been certified to be manufactured by two Indian companies Cipla and Hetero Drugs.To address these issues, FDA has decided that these two injections will directly be supplied to hospitals. However, outside patients, who need to buy the said drugs, will have to show a prescription or a recommendation from hospital as well the Covid-19 report to place an order.“There are cases of false negative reporting where swab test reports show absence of the virus but the patients have all the symptoms. In such cases, we can’t let the patient die off. Thus, this new rule will further lead to the harassment of patients,” he said. DR Gahane, joint commissioner of the state’s food and drug administration, said they will look into the matter. “We are trying to track the nexus involved in illegal sale of the drugs. The rules are being strengthened to fill up the gaps and provide the drugs to needy patients,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ima-opposes-move-to-make-covid-report-must-to-buy-remdesivir-and-tocilizumab/story-v4Y8Fe6o65eOYJHtgWwI3K.html
14-07-2020||Mumbai||‘Senior citizens account for 22.5% of cases in city and 54.3% of deaths’||Senior citizens are the most vulnerable to Covid-19, confirms data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Of the 91,457 people diagnosed with Covid-19 in Mumbai till July 11, 22.5% (20,664) were aged 60 years and above. In the same period, of the 5,241 reported deaths in Mumbai, 54.3% (2,847) belonged to the same age group.Ramdas Chauhan, 71, a resident of Indira Nagar, was admitted to Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital (popularly known as Sion hospital) on June 28 after he tested positive for Covid-19. At the time, he had complained of minor breathlessness but his oxygen saturation was above 95%. Five days later, in the middle of the night, he had to be put on a ventilator because his oxygen levels had dropped to 75%.Chauhan’s family members blame the hospital for negligence, but the hospital says Chauhan’s underlying ailment – diabetes — aggravated his health condition unexpectedly. “Often, health conditions of senior citizens deteriorate faster within hours of admission, especially among patients with cardiac ailment, diabetes and hypertension. We have seen patients walk normally into the hospital, but within hours of admission, die due to sudden rise in complications,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, in-charge of Sion hospital.Medical experts say senior citizens are more susceptible to Covid-19 compared to other age groups because of already-weakened immunity. An advisory issued by the Union health ministry reads, “Elderly people are at a higher risk due to their decreased immunity and body reserves as well as multiple associated comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Also, the course of disease tends to be more severe in case of elderlies resulting in higher mortality.”BMC’s data shows that of the 200 patients between 90 and 100 years of age, 37 have died of the infection (fatality rate: 18.5%). Of the 1,893 Covid-19 patients who were in the age group of 80-90 years, 365 succumbed to the infection (fatality rate: 19.2%). There have been 6,058 patients aged 70 to 80 years, of whom, 928 have died of Covid-19 (fatality rate: 15.3%). Among Covid-19 patients aged between 60 and 70 years (12,513), 1,517 have succumbed (fatality rate: 12.1%).City doctors say senior citizens are now more vulnerable because lockdown restrictions have been eased and younger members of the household are stepping out, thus increasing the risk of infection.Dr Pratit Samdani, internal medicine expert at Breach Candy Hospital, said more than 80% senior citizens have comorbidities that make them vulnerable to Covid-19. “Almost 15% [of Covid-positive senior citizens] die mostly because of cytokine storms, when inflammation starts in organs,” he said.BMC has so far screened 575,476 people who are 60 years old and above across wards and found 2,437 have oxygen saturation below 95%. “We have isolated hundreds of senior citizens from slums to save them from getting infected in congested chawls. They have been kept in lodges, hotels, schools which has helped save lives,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer, BMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/senior-citizens-account-for-22-5-of-cases-in-city-and-54-3-of-deaths/story-BnfKxp1JOtCRCPOqSSZxEJ.html

14-07-2020||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: Teltumbde seeks bail, says no charge sheet in 90 days||Academic and activist Dr Anand Teltumbde, arrested in connection with Elgar Parishad case, has approached the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court for bail and challenged the court’s decision to give the NIA another 90 days to file a charge sheet against him.Teltumbde, an engineer and Indian Institute of Management (IIM) graduate who used to teach at the Indian Institute of Technology (Kharagpur) and at the Goa Institute of Management, was arrested after the Supreme Court refused to grant him protection. On April 14, Teltumbde surrendered before NIA in Mumbai. NIA had said it needed to probe Teltumbde’s alleged links with banned outfit Communist Party of India (CPI, Maoist).It has since been 91 days and no charge sheet has been filed, which qualifies Teltumbde for default bail. On Sunday, the special NIA court granted the NIA an extension of 90 days to file a charge sheet against Teltumbde.In his plea before the special NIA court, Teltumbde said he would like to challenge the order passed by the NIA court granting NIA an extension to file charge sheet. He pleaded that his application before the special court be taken on record and treated as an application for default bail.According to the prosecution, Teltumbde delivered a “provocative presentation” and speeches on December 31, 2017, during an event at Shaniwarwada in Pune which led to the violence at Bhima-Koregaon in January 2018, state-wide agitation and loss of life. NIA has alleged Teltumbde was the convenor of the programme and his call data records show he was in touch with the other arrested accused present at the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-teltumbde-seeks-bail-says-no-charge-sheet-in-90-days/story-3Y2iSdyBqtr0odqjTJkHUP.html
14-07-2020||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: Varavara Rao taken to Sir JJ Hospital; lawyers move high court||Telugu poet and activist Dr P Varavara Rao was shifted out of Taloja Jail to Sir JJ Hospital on Monday. Rao’s lawyers have also moved the Bombay high court (HC), citing concern for Rao’s deteriorating health in their appeal against the decision of the special court under National Investigation Agency (NIA) to reject his application for interim bail. Rao, 81, is under arrest for alleged links to the violence at Bhima-Koregaon on January 1, 2018.A source from Sir JJ Hospital confirmed Rao had been brought to the hospital for a medical evaluation. Rao’s daughter P Pavana said, “We have come to know through other sources that Rao was taken to hospital for testing on Monday morning. We have received information that the doctors would first conduct tests and later decide on his admission. However, there is no official communication from the authorities to the family.”Rao, who has been in jail for 22 months, had earlier sought interim bail on the grounds of failing health and susceptibility to Covid-19, but on June 26, the NIA court rejected his application. While Rao’s plea challenging this decision in HC is scheduled to be heard on July 17, his lawyers have sought an urgent hearing today after Rao’s family raised concerns about Rao’s health.On Saturday, Rao’s family spoke to him on the phone and found him delirious. A fellow inmate informed the family that Rao is unable to walk, brush his teeth or go to the bathroom on his own. The family has issued a press statement on Sunday detailing Rao’s medical condition.While opposing the interim bail application before the special court, NIA had stated that since Rao has been charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, there is no provision to grant him temporary bail. NIA had submitted that jail authorities could be directed to ensure Rao was provided proper medical attention, whenever required.According to Rao’s appeal, the special court had failed to consider that Rao, 81, had been admitted to Sir JJ Hospital on May 28 after he lost consciousness and was discharged in haste as his plea for interim bail was coming up for hearing. The appeal has sought calling of all records pertaining to the interim bail application (which was rejected by the special court) and says Rao should be granted interim bail because of his medical condition.On Saturday, Rao’s family was informed by a fellow inmate that Rao is unable to walk, brush his teeth or go to the bathroom on his own. The family issued a press statement on Sunday which detailed Rao’s condition. It said Rao may be suffering from a serious electrolyte imbalance which could result in brain damage, and therefore is in need of emergency healthcare. Meanwhile, another petition has been moved by Rao through advocates R Sathyanarayanan and Susan Abraham on Monday against the superintendent of Taloja Jail for not complying with the prescription of Sir JJ Hospital to conduct regular medical check-ups. As a result of this non-compliance, Rao’s health has further deteriorated, said the petition. The petition has also sought directions to the jail authorities to produce all of Rao’s medical reports and submit the courses of action adopted by them after June 2 to take care of Rao. Directions have also been sought to send Rao for medical check-up immediately to a private hospital for check-ups, at his expense. The petition is expected to come up for hearing later this month.(With inputs from Rupsa Chakraborty)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-varavara-rao-taken-to-sir-jj-hospital-lawyers-move-high-court/story-bWan5JRMruN4i7h8VHsCnL.html
14-07-2020||Mumbai||Interim relief to schools in Maharashtra to hold online sessions for Class 1 and 2 students||The Bombay high court (HC), as an interim relief, directed the state to not take any coercive action against schools that are conducting online classes in contravention of the June 15 government resolution (GR) which did not permit institutes to hold online classes upto Class 2. The court directed the state to file its response in a week and posted the matter for hearing on August 7.Meanwhile, the court also directed the schools from taking action against those students who do not wish to cannot attend online classes. A division bench of justice Ujjal Bhuyan and justice NR Borkar, while hearing a petition filed by Parents Teachers Associations of United Forum and two parents, was informed by advocate Swaraj Jadhav that the June 15 notification lacked scientific reasoning and also violated the fundamental right of children to education.Jadhav submitted that the two parents who petitioned were aggrieved by the restrictive guideline as their children were left without education, and hence the court should set aside the notification as it also put restrictions on the number of hours that the school could conduct online classes. Jadhav further submitted that as schools were willing to provide online classes for children of all age groups, the notification was discriminatory and hence should be set aside. The state, through additional government pleader Bhupesh Samant, however, opposed the petition and said that the decision in the notification was based on scientific reasoning and also meant to safeguard children studying in Class 1 and 2 from being exposed to the harmful effects of computers or mobile phones, through which the online classes would be conducted, Samant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/interim-relief-to-schools-in-maharashtra-to-hold-online-sessions-for-class-1-and-2-students/story-47fj2U34HN3Jg6WLrHiqeI.html
14-07-2020||Mumbai||Final-year exams can’t be held in Maharashtra: State body headed by CM||Days after the University Grants Commission (UGC) directed universities across India to conduct final-year exams by September-end, the state government on Monday, reiterated its stance that it is not in a position to hold the exams. The decision was taken in a meeting held by the state disaster management authority, headed by chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray.“Following the fresh guidelines from UGC on holding the final-year exams, we decided to discuss the matter again before the state’s disaster management authority. After reviewing the current Covid-19 situation, we came to the conclusion that the state is not in a position to conduct exams in the next two months,” state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant said.The CM asked officials in the meeting to see if the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, and the Disaster Management Act, which are invoked in the state to curb the spread of Covid-19 outbreak, can override all the other Acts pertaining to holding exams in the state. “The CM asked what’s the importance of these Acts if they can’t be implemented as per the situation,” a senior official who attended the meeting said.The state said it will inform UGC about its decision again. Samant said that conducting exams amid the Covid-19 outbreak would endanger the lives of students.“We urge the UGC, the human resource development ministry and Prime Minister Narendra Modi to accept our decision, as no one can guarantee that the 8.5 lakh students who will appear for the exams won’t get infected with the virus. Forcing students to appear for exams would mean that we are not concerned about their health and safety. Even the parents of students are opposed to holding exams now. Besides, the state never said that it will not conduct the exams, but is only saying that it is not possible to hold them currently or in the near future as many colleges are converted to Covid centres,” said Samant.He also questioned the status of students in the containment zones. “Over 1 crore people are in 12,419 containment zones. How will the students staying there give exams? The UGC guidelines should clarify such issues as well,” Samant told reporters.On July 6, UGC directed all universities to conduct the exams in online, offline or blended modes. Prior to the UGC’s directives, the state disaster management authority on June 18 decided to cancel the final-year exams for non-professional courses and recommended the central authorities to cancel the final-year exams of professional courses too, owing to the Covid-19 crisis.“The authority also noted that the number of infected patients in the state has increased much more since the time it held its last meeting on June 18. Even Bollywood actors and Raj Bhavan employees are getting infected despite remaining confined indoors. Then how can we say that the students won’t get infected with the virus,” said Samant. When asked if the state can award degrees to students without giving final-year exams, Samant said, “We are studying the technicalities and if required will again call for the disaster management authority’s meeting to take a further decision.” Maharashtra is not the only state that expressed inability to hold exams in the current Covid-19 scenario. Punjab, West Bengal, Delhi and Haryana too declared the cancellation of final-year exams. Thackeray is likely to speak to the CMs of these states. “The chief minister said we should talk to them and understand what are they doing about the UGC directive”, the official said.On July 11, UGC general secretary Rajnish Jain said the commission’s guidelines are binding on all the states. Officials also said the state is also waiting for the Bombay high court’s decision on a public interest litigation challenging the state’s decision to not hold final-year exams. The court will hear the matter on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/final-year-exams-can-t-be-held-in-maharashtra-state-body-headed-by-cm/story-uC9zuJRTF599Gi3rTd9rrN.html

The woman had recently courted controversy after a video of her stand-up act performed last year went viral, in which she has been accused of insulting Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Later, she apologised on social media and deleted the video. On Monday, Umesh Dada alias Imtiyaz Shaikh was arrested by Mumbai Police, informed home minister Anil Deshmukh through his Twitter handle. On Sunday, a YouTuber, Shubham Mishra, was arrested from Vadodara on charges of threatening and abusing her. Shaikh is a friend of Mishra.“We have taken suo motu action and have arrested Shaikh from Nallasopara. We are investigating who helped him make the video. We are probing if Mishra and he decided to put up the objectionable video together. He has been booked under sections 294, 354A, 354, 354D, 504 and 34, 505, 506, 509 of the Indian Penal Code and 67A of Information Technology Act.

14-07-2020||City||Covid-19 outbreak: Mumbai showing signs of recovery?||Even though the Covid-19 outbreak is yet to be contained, recent developments, from lower average growth rate to increase in doubling rate to 51 days, have brought a sigh of relief for frontline workers and civic authorities.The daily average cases in Mumbai went to as low as 759 and did not cross 1,500 since the first week of June, despite an increase in daily tests. The increase in doubling rate from 41 days on July 1 to 51 days as on Monday is a positive sign, said civic officials. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has attributed the increase in doubling rate to their ‘Mission Zero’ plan introduced on June 22. Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Chahal, said, “A study done by a group of professors stated that the city’s R0 measure (also known as the reproduction number, is a measure of how many people may be infected by one patient) has come down from 9 to 1.1. This is a good indication of our situation. Along with this, the biggest advantage of increasing doubling rate is we get availability of beds in terms of using those beds on rotation as cases take a longer time to double. We need 200 beds every day, considering the current daily average cases as 85% of those are asymptomatic and can be kept in non-hospital beds.”A senior civic official said, “When the plan was launched, the doubling rate of the city was 37 days. The aim was to increase it to 50 days in 2-3 weeks.” Mission Zero is a 35-day action plan to increase surveillance in areas, specifically six administrative wards that had a higher growth rate and bring down the number of daily cases reported in these areas.Along with this, the city’s recovery rate has also reached a high of 70%, whereas the recovery rate on July 1 was 57%. Of the 92,720 Covid cases in Mumbai as on Monday, 65,000 patients have already been treated and discharged. Experts, however, said a lot more needs to be done. Madhav Sathe, retired professor of microbiology at Nair Hospital, said, “The situation in Mumbai looks under control, but it is also important to contain the virus in the outskirts, Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Our recovery rate of 70% is a good sign for the city, but the city is not testing to its full capacity and should at least conduct 12,000-15,000 tests per day. The strength of private testing labs has also not been utilised fully. Our next aim should be to bring down the fatality rate to below 3% from the current 5.5%.” On Monday, Mumbai reported 1, 158 Covid-19 cases, taking the total to 94,146. Forty-seven deaths took the toll to 5,335, according to the state health department data. The data further states that 750 patients were recovered and discharged on Monday. A total of 65,622 patients have been treated and discharged by now. The active patients in the city are 22,900. The number of Covid tests done till Sunday is 3.96 lakh. Dharavi reported six new cases on Monday. The total cases in Dharavi reached 2,334. Of them, 2,039 have been discharged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-outbreak-mumbai-showing-signs-of-recovery/story-3UQmBjys918e4hUWCzgdxH.html

A total of 20,552 students appeared for the exams from the state. Pune division, which covers Maharashtra, Goa, Daman-Diu and Dadra Nagar Haveli, recorded a 90.24% success rate, ranking 10th among the 16 regions. The board did not release a merit list owing to cancellation of a few papers. Across the country, 157,934 students scored 90% and above, compared to 94,299 last year. Also, 38,686 students scored 95% and above across India, up from last year’s 17,693. As a few papers could not be conducted due to the Covid-19 outbreak, marks were given on the basis of average of the best scores in other papers. This was the first year of examinations after the board set up a Pune divisional office for the state. Until 2019, schools in the state were a part of the Chennai division. This year, students from 339 schools appeared for the exams from Pune division across 213 exam centres. Principals said they could see a significant improvement in the scores of students. J Mohanty, principal at DPS Nerul school, said the class average had increased to 91.7% from 90.4% in 2019. “Nearly 71% of the 299 students who had appeared for the exams scored 90% and above. Over the past few years, our school has been bettering its performance,” he said. Kala Gangadharan, principal at Rajhans Vidyalaya in Andheri, said the board’s move to include multiple-choice questions seems to have helped students in the science stream. “A large number of students who appear for the boards also write competitive exams like JEE. They are well-versed with the objective format and find it easy to score,” she said. “The result this year, amid all challenges and uncertainties, has come out well in time to everyone’s relief and with great amount of satisfaction to students and parents. Schools and parents must prepare their wards to accept the result in the context of the pandemic and help them now focus on the next step,” Jose Kurian, regional director (western zone II), DAV Public Schools.Despite his disability, 18-year-old scores 95.8%Varun Manoj, 18, secured 95.8% in his Class 12 boards and his excitement is evident. Born with optic atrophy, Varun did not let it affect his ability to do well. “I used a laptop for all my school work and various softwares to keep up with the studies,” said Varun, a student of Delhi Public School, Nerul. He added that apart from what was taught in class, he depended majorly on soft copies and audio books to catch up with what was taught in class everyday.While his school teachers and parents were a constant support, the gritty teenager also feels his decision to strike a balance between studies and his love for music helped him. “I love playing keyboards in my spare time and continued to do so. I would like to pursue a degree in Information Technology and I aspire to work with Microsoft in the future,” said Varun.TV actor juggles work and studies, scores 89.4%Anushka Sen, a student of Ryan International School, Kandivli, has been working in the TV and film industry since she was 9. Juggling between hectic work schedules and studies, she scored 89.4%. “I was shooting for a film in Jammu just before my exams so barely had any time to prepare. Despite that, I tried to work hard. I am used to managing both my studies and my work as I have worked on various TV serials and films in the past,” she said. Anushka wants to continue acting but she also plans to pursue a Bachelor in Mass Media. “I have learnt the practical aspect of this industry by working here for nearly nine years, but I want to learn the theory now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-scores-90-39-in-cbse-class-12-tests/story-Jn7zQg0J3CQOJXh03OvL4M.html
14-07-2020||Mumbai||20 lakh litres of milk unsold daily in state||Owing to lockdown which led to shutting down of industrial-commercial activities, the state has been reporting more than 20 lakh litres of excess milk each day. As opposed to the daily production of around 2 crore litre of milk each day, including 1.5 crore litre in the organised sector, the daily consumption has come down to about 1.75 crore litre, forcing milk brands to convert excess milk into skimmed milk powder (SMP).Every year between May and August, milk supply generally drops below the demand, owing to a decrease in production. However, this year companies are reporting excess milk owing to shutting down of hotel, confectionary and sweet industries as well as restrictions on the exports of the milk products.“This led to a demand-supply gap of more than 30 lakh litre at the initial stage of lockdown. It has now come down to more than 20 lakh litre. Milk brands, in both private and cooperative sectors, were forced to convert milk into SMP. The stock of SMP in Maharashtra has now piled up to 60,000 metric tonne. However, with the fall in its price, dairy brands may end up sustaining loss of ₹80-₹100 for each kilogram,” said Arun Narke, former president of Indian Dairy Association.Of the total 2 crore litre milk produced each day, organised sector comprising private, cooperative and government brands account for 1.25 crore litre. Of this, cooperative sector accounts for 39%, while private brands cover 60.95%. To safeguard the interest of farmers, the state government has announced procurement of excess milk in the public and cooperative sector and convert it into SMP. “We have procured 4.80 crore litre milk from farmers during lockdown at the cost of ₹25 for one litre. Our intervention resulted in retention of fair price. We expect the rate of SMP to increase in next few weeks,” said Naresh Gite, managing director, Maharashtra state cooperative dairy federation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/20-lakh-litres-of-milk-unsold-daily-in-state/story-ZrFt2QHwPV9qp3GvaE2ljP.html

Inspector Gyan Singh of Kanpur police, who is an investigating officer in the killing of eight policemen by Dubey and his associates, reached Mumbai on Sunday night, along with other police constables. On Monday, after Trivedi and his driver were produced in the Thane court around 2.45pm in connection with the cop killing case, the police were given transit remand till July 16. The two accused, who are not yet named in the first information report in the case, have been remanded in judicial custody till July 21.Defence lawyer Anil Jadhav said, “It is not safe to travel by road due to heavy rain as well the Covid-19 situation. Railway services are also not there for long distance travel, so the accused are afraid of traveling in a vehicle from Mumbai to Kanpur. They urge that they be taken to Uttar Pradesh by flight.” The court has allowed the same.Both the accused were tested for Covid-19 on Saturday and have tested negative, said Jadhav. Trivedi and Tiwari fled from UP soon Dubey and his associates killed eight policemen at Bikru village near Kanpur in the intervening night of July 2 and July 3. Both the accused came to Madhya Pradesh where, the police believe, they met Dubey. After that they went to Pune while hiding in a truck, and then took another truck to come to Thane. They were staying in Kolshet, said an officer from the anti-terrorism squad (ATS). Juhu unit of the Maharashtra ATS arrested Trivedi and Tiwari on Saturday morning following tip-off, following which the Uttar Pradesh Police was informed. UP state government had announced a reward of ₹50,000 in exchange for information on Trivedi’s whereabouts.Trivedi is suspected of being involved in the murder of UP minister Santosh Shukla, who was killed inside the Shivli police station in Kanpur in 2001. Dubey was the main accused in the case which saw 25 policemen, brought in as eyewitnesses, turn hostile in court. Dubey, a history-sheeter with around 60 criminal cases against him, was arrested in Ujjain on July 9. He was killed in an encounter on July 10 while being brought back to Kanpur by UP Police.Following Trivedi’s arrest, UP Police issued a press statement confirming that Trivedi was an associate of Dubey. “Following the arrest made by Maharashtra ATS, it has come to light that Arvind Trivedi is an old member of Vikas Dubey’s gang.

14-07-2020||Mumbai||12 connectors from Metros to railway stations||To ensure smoother connectivity once all the Metro corridors are operational, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is looking at establishing a dozen connectors between Metro stations and suburban railway stations. MMRDA recently invited bids for preparing detailed designs of interchanges proposed in the city.According to the tender, the authority is looking to connect Mankhurd railway station on harbour line to the upcoming Mankhurd station on Metro 2B (DN Nagar-Mandale), ILFS station on Metro 2B with the upcoming high-speed rail corridor, and Chembur station on Metro 2B with VNP and RC Marg Monorail station.It is also looking at easing commuter movement between Metro stations through the proposed interchange between Gandhi Nagar station of Metro 4 (Wadala-Kasarwadavali) to Kanjurmarg station of Metro 6 (Swami Samarth Nagar-Vikhroli), and Adarsh Nagar station of Metro 6 to Shastri Nagar station of Metro 2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar).RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, said, “MMRDA is looking at providing seamless connectivity to Mumbaiites. Establishing connectivity between all lines of Metro and other modes of transportation is a major step in the direction. The proposed interchanges will make journeys more comfortable for all.”To further last-mile connectivity in the city, MMRDA is also looking at multi-modal integration in all the upcoming Metro stations. For Metro 2A and 7 (Dahisar E-Andheri E), the authority is looking at spending ₹356.86 crore to make provision for bus-bays, cycle tracks, widened footpaths with street furniture and street-lights in all 30 stations. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is expected to bear 50% of the cost, and take over maintenance once operational.In its recent meeting, MMRDA also gave a nod to its policy of direct access to Metro stations. According to the policy, private developers, who are interested in direct connection to the nearest Metro station, can submit detailed technical proposals to MMRDA.Direct access is a worldwide concept that will enable first and last mile connectivity to Metro stations, an official from MMRDA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/12-connectors-from-metros-to-railway-stations/story-ymGzktEI1fXogVmmN4kh0O.html
14-07-2020||Mumbai||Coastal Road project: Will get nod under wildlife law before reclamation, says BMC||badri.chatterjee@hindustantimes.comThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on March 12, 2020, told the Supreme Court (SC) that they would obtain clearances under the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972 prior to commencing reclamation for the Coastal Road project that would potentially disturb coral habitat. The affidavit was received by the environmental groups, objecting to the project construction, on Saturday.The affidavit was in response to an interim application (IA) filed by Conservation Action Trust (CAT), activist Shweta Wagh, and others in February this year that sought a stay on ‘rapid’ reclamation activity that could ‘permanently destroy the city’s coastline. On June 8, the Bombay high court (HC) had dismissed another petition filed by 20 south Mumbai residents (Save Our Coast) that challenged reclamation during the Covid-19 lockdown. The Supreme Court will now hear the matter on July 16.BMC’s affidavit, submitted by the project’s chief engineer Vijay Nighot, rubbished claims made in the IA that corals had been destroyed while highlighting their presence was ‘miniscule’. BMC said pertinent sections of WPA do not apply to them in this case since the intertidal area was never declared a national park or a sanctuary. BMC, however, accepted to transplant the corals.“In any event, the petitioner (BMC) undertakes to obtain a WPA clearance prior to carrying out any reclamation activities that potentially disturb the corals present,” the submission read.Corals are marine invertebrates that attach themselves to rocky intertidal regions. They garner the same protection status as that of a tiger or an elephant (schedule 1) under WPA. Any clearance under the Act is issued by the state chief wildlife warden. The Maharashtra forest department said no proposal had been submitted by BMC so far for wildlife clearances. “BMC has been directed to take precautions during reclamation to ensure no corals are harmed,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (Mangrove cell).“None of the areas with coral presence have been touched so far. Wildlife clearance will be taken after basic reclamation is complete. The corals will be transplanted, and then those areas will be reclaimed. The MBMP is being carefully implemented,” Nighot said.However, Wagh alleged that BMC had already violated WPA as they were applying for clearance after basic reclamation was done. “Nobody knows the extent of damage already on site,” she said.For the past five months, over 40 of 90 hectare (ha) has been reclaimed for the 9.9-km current phase of the project, which is to be an eight-lane highway connecting Marine Drive to the southern tip of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, BMC said.BMC also submitted a September 2019 report by the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), Goa, that found the presence of six coral species along the south Mumbai coast, presence of dolphins, 17 bird species, and rich benthic marine life while developing the marine biodiversity conservation and monitoring plan (MBMP) for the project. NIO suggested a ₹2.9 crore budgetary plan for the MBMP including translocation of corals. However, BMC said the funds had not been allocated yet and it was the responsibility of project contractors.NIO has identified two species of corals of the Rhizangiidae family (Oulangia and one unidentified species) with 18 colonies across 0.251 square metres (almost 3-feet) in the Worli region of the project site. At Haji Ali, another species under the Dendrophylliidae family along with Rhizangiidae were identified across 1.1foot area. Remaining species of corals were identified 1.8 km away from the project site in Marine Drive. “Destruction of corals should be avoided: transplantation and restoration of corals inside proposed project site at suitable places is one of possible ways to conserve them while regular monitoring during project execution is necessary,” the NIO report said.Environmentalist Debi Goenka said the NIO study should have been done before environment clearance was granted and WPA needed to be obtained before construction began. “This was conveniently ignored by the Central and state committees that issued clearances to the project,” he said.On December 17, 2019, the SC had put on hold previous orders by the HC (from July 2019) that quashed coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) clearances to the civic body, and allowed reclamation of land but restricted BMC from carrying out any other development work. The HC’s order from July 16, 2019 while staying the project had said, “Notwithstanding the fact that corals presence is minuscule, the same shows that the ecosystem in the area (project zone) is conducive to corals. It establishes that the area is ecologically sensitive...we hold that BMC could not have commenced work without obtaining WPA permission.”THREAT TO MARINE LIFE: NIO REPORTNIO also said the presence of dolphins within a 10 km radius of the project site was threatened by increased turbidity and noise levels with vessel movement as a potential threat. Destruction of habitat and noise may affect foraging behaviour of 17 migratory and resident birds, and may move away from the project area. Disturbance in marine environments could lead to recurring cases of harmful algal and jellyfish blooms.MARINE BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, MONITORING PLAN FOR COASTAL ROAD· Destruction of corals should be avoided: Transplantation and restoration of corals inside proposed project site at suitable places is one of the possible ways to conserve them while regular monitoring during project execution is necessary· Regular observational monitoring, solid waste and oil pollution management, contingency plan for any incidences, participatory approach for sustainable resource utilisation and stakeholder management· On-site marine mammal observer has to be deployed to monitor the movement of important species· Vessel movement has to be regulated. It has to be halted at the sighting of any marine mammals in the active working zone· Management of plastic, marine litter, garbage· Several bivalve species of commercial importance in study area: Necessary to protect them by blocking certain areas as no harvest zone to protect, especially clams, oysters and shellfish(Source: National Institute of Oceanography, Goa Study)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/coastal-road-project-will-get-nod-under-wildlife-law-before-reclamation-says-bmc/story-UJHjogZr31f69tfuhJJEUM.html

14-07-2020||Mumbai||Consumers’ body directs hospital to pay ₹7.5L to diamond broker for negligence in treatment||The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) directed a city hospital to pay a compensation of ₹7.5 lakh to a 74-year-old diamond broker for medical negligence, which led to the loss of two fingers of his left hand.“A detailed review of the entire record reveals that it is a case of gross medical negligence, involving loss of body parts, business and mental agony to the complainant who is a senior citizen aged 74, during the course of treatment given in the respondent hospital,” said an NCDRC bench, comprising presiding member Prem Narain and member C Vishwanath, while holding Breach Candy Hospital liable to compensate Peddar Road resident Murlidhar Chhabria.On September 18, 2005, Chhabria was admitted to Breach Candy Hospital for coronary artery bypass graft, and two days later he underwent the surgery. A month later, he was required to get a re-suturing done after blood was found to be oozing from his chest.After the surgery, Chhabria was shifted to an intensive care unit (ICU), where his wife noticed that his left palm and fingers were burnt. The burn injuries were treated after he was discharged from the hospital, and on November 21, 2005, he was operated upon for the burns. To his shock, Chhabria found that his middle and little fingers had been amputated owing to development of gangrene.Following the incident, in 2006 he filed a complaint before the Maharashtra Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, alleging medical negligence on part of the hospital, which resulted in burning of his left hand and amputation of two fingers. He prayed for compensation worth ₹50 lakh on the grounds that being a diamond broker and an expert in the assortment of diamonds, the absence of fingers was not only a loss of body parts but also of earning capacity.The hospital denied the allegations and maintained that as no heaters were used in its operation theatres or ICUs, there was no question of the patient getting his hand burnt by accidentally touching one.The hospital claimed that the patient was also having a history of long-standing diabetes, which led to Tropical Diabetic Hand Syndrome (TDHS) and the symptoms of heater burn and TDHS are similar. It also filed an expert opinion to show that TDHS results in burning of hand and lead to gangrene.Accepting the stand of the hospital, on March 28, 2012, the state commission dismissed the complaint, observing that the treating doctors exercised due care and caution in operating and treating the diamond broker. Chhabria then moved NCDRC to appeal against the state commission’s decision.The national commission, however, refused to accept the hospital’s stand and said, “When there were no chances of any burn caused due to heaters in the OT [operation theatre]/ICU or of any cautery burns as alleged by the complainant, one does not understand as to why blisters on the hand were not taken seriously but only treated normally as burns over a long period of time.”It noted all along, the burn injury was mentioned in the hospital record as “burn injuries in the OT during bypass surgery.”“All through it was being treated as a case of burns having sensation in the hand and not a case of TDHS. Never the case was treated as TDHS,” said NCDRC, adding that the theory was introduced two years after treating the 74-year-old, and the “wisdom” about TDHS appeared for the first time in the affidavit in reply to the consumer’s complaint at the state commission.“Theory of TDHS has been floated only as a cover up to their medical negligence, resulting in permanent injury to the patient,” the bench observed, adding that the doctors who treated the diamond broker ought to have consulted a diabetologist and a dermatologist at the earliest and if proper diagnosis and treatment would have started earlier, the complainant could perhaps have been saved from permanent injury and damage.The bench further said that the amputation of finger ends involves loss of bone, a very serious consequence for the complainant, but no effort was made to properly diagnose the problem (the abnormal condition of the hand in time), ultimately leading to the amputation of finger ends.“This is certainly a case of gross medical negligence on the part of the respondent hospital and the complainant is to be compensated for loss of body parts, trauma, agony and source of livelihood.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/consumers-body-directs-hospital-to-pay-7-5l-to-diamond-broker-for-negligence-in-treatment/story-LU11g0pNwpnDFiMA0PvrGI.html

14-07-2020||Mumbai||Yes Bank case: ED files second charge sheet against Kapil, Dheeraj Wadhawan||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday filed a second charge sheet in the money laundering case at Yes Bank. The charge sheet is against 19 persons and entities and was filed before a special court under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), in Mumbai. An ED official confirmed the development and said the charge sheet was primarily against promoters of Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL), Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan, and firms floated by the accused to carry out money laundering. The charge sheet also names co-founder and former managing director of Yes Bank, Rana Kapoor, and members of his family, as well as chartered accountants Dularesh K Jain & Associates. The second charge sheet was filed after ED examined a number of witnesses including Yes Bank and DHFL employees. ED officials said that in addition to money laundering and receiving kickbacks from the Wadhawans, Kapoor had overruled Yes Bank’s advisory team, which had not approved a loan to Belief Realtors (a DHFL company) and the loan was disbursed on the same day it was sanctioned. Loans of Rs 300 crore, Rs 100 crore and Rs 232 crore were disbursed to companies indirectly controlled by Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan. Dularesh K Jain & Associates had given the end-user certificate but could not provide any explanation or documentation to justify the end use. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had registered a case in connection with suspicious loans granted by Yes Bank on March 7. Following this, ED arrested Kapoor on March 8, charging him with money laundering and alleging Yes Bank had bought debentures of DHFL worth Rs 3,700 crore, but without redeeming them till date. DHFL had paid a kickback of Rs 600 crore to Kapoor in the form of a loan to a company registered to Kapoor’s daughters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yes-bank-case-ed-files-second-charge-sheet-against-kapil-dheeraj-wadhawan/story-myrb7YTQatXVo6w0EDve0L.html

14-07-2020||Mumbai||Persons with disabilities could be promoted to Group A, B posts, state to frame policy soon||Maharashtra government will soon frame a policy for extending benefit of reservation in promotion to persons with disabilities (PwD) in Group A and Group B posts, an official informed the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court on Friday.Additional government pleader AM Deshpande informed the bench of justice Sunil Shukre and justice SM Modak that as of now no policy is in place to provide for reservation in promotion to PwD in Group A and Group B posts, but soon an appropriate decision will be taken for providing reservation in the promotion to PwD category in consultation with the Central government.He was responding to a petition filed by Ravindra Ukey, who is serving on a Group C post, as an extension officer in Nagpur zilla parishad. He had moved HC seeking orders to the state government to promote him to a Group B post, on the basis of a minimum of 3% reservation prescribed for persons with disabilities under section 33 of the Persons with Disabilities (equal opportunities, protection of rights and full participation) Act, 1995.He claimed that in 2016, Supreme Court had recognised the right of PwD to reservation in promotion, and therefore, he was entitled to promotion to a Group B post.HC, however, noticed that the Supreme Court itself has held that before the reservation under section 33 to an extent of a minimum 3% comes into operation, the government must complete the exercise for identification of the posts suitable for appointment of PwD.“So, it is clear that unless the identification exercise as prescribed under section 32 of the Act, 1995 is over, the mandate of section 33 providing for reservation of not less than 3% in various posts for persons with disabilities cannot come into operation,” said HC.HC dismissed Ukey’s petition saying no relief can be granted to the 50-year-old extension officer, as the promotional posts for PwD category have not been identified in Maharashtra as yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/persons-with-disabilities-could-be-promoted-to-group-a-b-posts-state-to-frame-policy-soon/story-QlGlFmwEJ6wqOI7FNGreYM.html

If any patient falls in the category where plasma can be given to stop the worsening of conditions, we may administer it with their consent,” said professor Ratti Ram Sharma, head of the department of transfusion medicine, PGIMER.The plasma is taken from patients who have recovered from Covid. The therapy works when the plasma containing antibodies is administered into critically ill patients. The donor should have had a prior diagnosis of Covid-19 with symptoms like fever and cough, and should have completely recovered with no symptoms for at least 28 days prior to donation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/trials-end-successfully-but-pgimer-to-continue-taking-plasma-donations/story-WoEaab9g5fh8eWQFBHygFJ.html

The man, identified as Bhavesh Kumar, had escaped from a police vehicle while he was being taken to jail from a local court on July 7. He had escaped from the vehicle when it slowed at a turn on the hilly road.Kumar was accused of raping a minor girl of his village and was an under-trial inmate in the Nainital jail. Police was searching for him since his escape. Vijay Mehta, station house officer, Tallital police station said, police got the information about Kumar’s body in jungle on Monday. “Soon a team of local police after efforts of several hours in going down inside the jungle in a gorge of about 1 km deep, reached the spot where he was found hanging from a tree. The body was in a decomposed state which suggested that he hanged self a few days ago,” said Mehta. The police officer said Kumar was wearing the same clothes on the day of his escape and was having the ‘handcuffs on his one hand.’“As the spot is very deep near the road, efforts are on to bring the body up after which it would be sent for post-mortem examination. Once its report comes, the cause of death would be ascertained. A probe in on in the case,” said Mehta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/man-accused-of-raping-minor-fleeing-police-custody-found-dead-in-uttarakhand-forest/story-w1uDg5yjL12ekBFxB3YYjM.html
14-07-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: A flower man and his new business||There’s a new guy in florist Muhammed Sadiq’s shop. He is without a face, and he’s without clothes. This morning, Mr Sadiq is dressing him up in front of his pavement stall, in full public view.“I got him for Rs 900,” says the youthful flower seller, who at 29 is a father of two kids, but looks like a teenager.The torso-length figure is a mannequin, and it is the symbol of the flower man’s determination to sail through the tough times caused by the coronavirus pandemic.“The flower business has come down by half,” he says, and surprisingly, the depressing news is conveyed with an infectious smile. The cheery faced Mr Sadiq doesn’t really sell bouquets, but threads the flowers all day long into garlands and gajras, here on this central Delhi pavement. A big part of his earnings come from weaving roses with currency notes—the kind of garlands chiefly used in weddings. In the BC (Before Corona) era, he would get steady assignments because “weddings happen all the time, even if they skyrocket only during the winter months”. But he theatrically shakes his head, and complains that “the frequency of weddings has gone down because of corona.”Whatever, Mr Sadiq isn’t the type of man who sits, complains and does nothing. Instead, he recently drove his scooty to nearby Karol Bagh market “to get ideas on what other additions I can make to my business.... and to find out how other people are managing to survive in these bad times.” Strolling about the market—“it didn’t have even half of its former energy”—he carefully observed the goings-on of the little shops and stalls lining the pathways. And suddenly, the penny dropped. “I decided to sell lowers in my stall.” And so he invested some of his hard-earned cash in buying a white plastic mannequin from Karol Bagh, along with the so-called lowers, or track pants, and excitedly returned to his stall. It now is a flower plus lowers shop, the only business in the area with such a unique combination.Still new into the world of clothing, it is taking Mr Sadiq some good amount of time and struggle to pull up these pants around the faceless figure’s legs.The morning is still young and nobody is around at the moment. The flower stall is tucked between a chai shop and a tailor’s establishment. It primarily consists of a wooden cot, already littered with flowers and threads, and a chipped Godrej cash box. This cot is a popular point for locals to gather. Within a few minutes, two elderly men come up with newspapers, sit on the edge of the cot, and start chatting about, what else, but coronavirus.Meanwhile, Mr Sadiq says that he will deck up his stall with the lowers only later in the morning. He leisurely settles down on the wooden cot, sits cross-legged and empties plastic packets filled with fresh flowers. He gets them daily from a supplier. A contended smile is glowing about his face, as if there could be nothing more satisfying in the world than to fiddle about with flowers.“I may or may not continue with lowers after coronavirus is gone, for it is only a side-business, but I will always be working with flowers,” he says, tucking a rose between his lips as he picks up a spool of thread.Meanwhile, the mannequin is standing on a corner of the cot, its body language as solemn as one of those ancient life-like sculptures in the National Museum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-flower-man-and-his-new-business/story-NFT8AdZAG7UZspFsrxyiuK.html

From June 1 to July 13, the state has recorded a whopping 193,269 cases, which 74.07% of the tally.The Maharashtra government announced gradual relaxations from June 3 as part of its Mission Begin Again. It provided relaxations for outdoor physical activities, including running, jogging, cycling, among others, from June 3. Subsequently, it opened up market areas, shops except for malls and shopping centres from June 5. It also allowed private offices to open for 10% of its staff from June 8.Maharashtra recorded its first case on March 9 and went on to record 302 cases in the month. In April, the state saw 10,198 cases, while in May, 57,157 cases were recorded. In June alone, the state saw 107,106 cases, which was 61.29% of the tally in the state till that period.

With the rising number of cases in Thane city, which now has 15,110 cases, the municipal corporation has taken up ‘Mission Zero’ on the lines of Mumbai city to contain the spread and bring down the numbers.State urban development department minister and Thane guardian minister Eknath Shinde said, “If we have to win this fight against coronavirus, we will have to chase the virus to break this chain of transmission.” Shinde was speaking while launching the programme, which entails involving citizen groups, NGOs, etc. Nine mobile dispensaries and nine zones have been created to check for suspected cases.After a spike in number of cases, Raigad district will now go into a complete lockdown from July 15. Guardian minister of the district, Aditi Tatkare, held a meeting with the district’s elected representatives and officials and announced the 10-day lockdown till July 24. The district had 8,865 cases and recorded 164 fatalities. Of the cases, 4,525 are active cases in the district. The growing number of Covid-19 cases has led most of the civic bodies in Maharashtra to enforce stricter lockdown restrictions that have been extended until July 19. Besides the municipal corporations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad Aurangabad, and Solapur have also extended the lockdown restrictions.Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Navi Mumbai — part of the densely populated MMR — have imposed a new round of lockdown restrictions until July 19. Similar steps have been taken by Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad Solapur, and Aurangabad municipal corporations. Latur district administration has also announced a 15-day lockdown from July 15. Looking at the rising cases, the state government has pushed back its plan to provide further relaxation, including opening up more private offices, easing public transport restrictions. Officials said that the municipal bodies in the MMR opposed the move to provide further relaxation. “The outbreak now is more in urban centres, especially in areas around Mumbai. If further relaxations are provided, movement of people would go up. Movement of people in and out of Mumbai would also increase, leading to the cases in Mumbai, which are stabilising now, to go up and create another cycle of outbreak. Therefore, it was put on hold earlier this month. Now, the focus is on containing the spread locally,” a senior bureaucrat said, requesting anonymity.Pune, on Monday, recorded 564 fresh cases, taking the city’s tally to 29,612. It also recorded 20 fatalities on Monday as its toll rose to 897. Pune’s adjoining Pimpri-Chinchwad recorded 367 new cases.

14-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram Police joins in efforts to trace contacts of Covid-19 positive patients||The Gurugram Police, on Monday, said that it has started tracing the contacts of the Covid-19 positive patients in the city and has traced nearly 126 people since last Wednesday. The police said they received a list of positive patients from the district health department last week, following which they started contact tracing on their own. The initiative was started on July 8 by the district police to ensure that all members in the families, friends’ circles and workplaces of confirmed Covid-19 positive patients are also tested and their contract tracing is completed within three days of confirmation. Earlier, contact tracing was conducted by officials of the district health department. Yashwant Yadav, in-charge, Covid Cell, said that they are contacting at least 20 people in each case after the status of the primary Covid-19 patient is confirmed. “We are trying to get details of the maximum number of people possible and their samples are collected to ensure they are not infecting others. This initiative will stop the spread of community transmission in the city,” he said.As a part of the process, the police are sending all the details to the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), which has been given the charge of maintaining the data provided by all the agencies involved in Covid-19 management in the city.The police said from the last two weeks, the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) has also started helping the officials of the district health department in contact tracing, in addition to supporting the rapid response team and the public health centres (PHCs) in urban areas. Police commissioner KK Rao said that they are conducting the investigation in each case. “In some cases, we are accessing CCTV footage to figure if the patient was hiding any information from the officials. With nearly 100 cases emerging daily, it is becoming challenging for officials to trace all the close contacts within the stipulated time,” he said.The Covid Cell of the Gurugram Police is also maintaining a record of geo-fencing, patients who cannot be traced, and all the close contacts of the positive patients.Rao said, presently, the focus is on extensive contact tracing, isolating confirmed cases, and testing of the all close contacts, all of which will reduce the chances of community spread. “Our teams are also home isolating close contacts of positive cases until their results come out,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-police-joins-in-efforts-to-trace-contacts-of-covid-positive-patients/story-MtlICPgUHhQuJXAyoG4obL.html

14-07-2020||Gurugram||Increased testing, bringing down fatality focus areas for NCR states||Haryana government officials on Monday said they have been following national capital Delhi’s example in trying to contain the Covid-19 pandemic and have majorly ramped up overall testing of cases while bringing down the fatality rate in Covid affected cities, like Gurugram.The announcement comes two days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi appreciated Delhi’s efforts in containing the Covid-19 outbreak and directed the National Capital Region (NCR) to adopt similar strategies.“We are following Delhi’s example here. We are testing more than Noida and Ghaziabad. The second round of serological survey is in progress. Antigen tests are being extensively done in large outbreak areas to break the chain of transmission,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.Delhi has adopted a series of measures like increased testing, strict enforcement of rules in containment zones and serological surveys to analyse the prevalence of infection. Earlier this month, Union home minister Amit Shah held a series of meetings with officials of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh giving a mandate to consider Delhi -NCR as one unit to cope with the Covid-19 public health emergency. In Gurugram too, since June 24, testing has been ramped up manifold. From conducting 1,000 tests on an average, the health department is now conducting 2,500-3000 tests daily. Till date, 55,714 tests have been conducted in the city. Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, on July 4 had said that Gurugram was conducting the highest number of tests among all the cities falling under the NCR. “A vigorous campaign is being run to identify persons infected with coronavirus. And we are testing higher than any other city in the NCR,” said Khatri, while addressing the press meet.In June, the test positivity rate of Gurugram was more than 40%. It had come down to 11% in July. On Monday 106 new cases were detected, taking the total tally of cases to 6,966. Out of this, at least 1,051 are active cases, while 5,808 have recovered. With two new deaths, the Covid-19 toll has reached 107, under which 70 deaths were due to co-morbid conditions. A senior Haryana government official, privy to the matter, said, “The state is sending daily updates of Covid-19 affected districts adjoining national capital – Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonepat – to the Central government for review. Daily occupancy of hospital beds, number of tests, deaths and positivity rate is being provided to the central team on a regular basis.” According to the official, Haryana has been doing well in controlling the Covid-19 numbers in Gurugram and Faridabad. “There is increased testing and intensified contact tracing. The focus is on conducting strict and better death audit to identify the cause of death and prevent fatality rate. We have been successfully doing that,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/increased-testing-bringing-down-fatality-focus-areas-for-ncr-states/story-qyQuvoi0CMAjotLzO6kjxK.html
14-07-2020||Gurugram||29-year-old woman found dead under suspicious circumstances in DLF Phase-3||A 29-year-old woman was found dead under suspicious circumstances at her rented accommodation in DLF Phase-3 on Saturday night. The police have booked her partner on charges of murder after the woman’s sister filed a police complaint on Sunday alleging foul play. The police said a preliminary probe suggests that the woman was strangled to death and the suspect tried to paint it as a suicide case. The suspect is yet to be arrested and raid are being conducted to nab him, said the police on Monday.According to the police, the woman, a native of Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh, was a former senior sales manager at a private company on Golf Course Extension Road and was staying with a room-mate in the city for the past one year. The police said the woman’s sister informed the police control room around 9pm on Saturday after her repeated phone calls to her went unanswered. A police team reached the spot and found the main gate of the house locked from outside. Police officials called the landlord to unlock the gate and found that the door to her room on the fourth floor was ajar.A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “The woman’s body was found on the floor. One end of a saree was tied to the ceiling fan while the other end was hanging. She was rushed to Civil Hospital, where doctors declared her dead on arrival. A note has been recovered from the spot that mentions the relationship of the woman with her partner. We are verifying the contents of the note. Her mobile phone is also missing.”The police said that the woman’s sister stated in the FIR that the handwriting on the note was not her sister’s. In the police complaint, the woman’s sister said that she had spoken to the victim in a video call at 8.48pm on Saturday. “During the conversation, she was crying and begging me to save her life. Suddenly, the call got disconnected. I tried calling her several times but her phone was switched off. Her partner had earlier harassed and physically tortured her. She was planning to move to Aligarh as she was stressed by their repeated fights and had also started packing her belongings. In the evening, she had spoken to my son and mentioned that her partner had been abusing her and that she felt threatened,” said the woman’s sister, adding that the victim had been in a relationship with her partner for over two years after her divorce. “The crime scene suggests that some evidence was tampered with. We are conducting raids to trace the woman’s partner to question him,” said the police official quoted above. A post-mortem examination was conducted by a medical board on Sunday and viscera samples have been sent to a forensic laboratory for examination. A case was registered against the suspect under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) at DLF Phase-3 police station on Sunday, said the police on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/29-year-old-woman-found-dead-under-suspicious-circumstances-in-dlf-phase-3/story-s7ONwUDkxG8CH5Yfo4eXrJ.html
14-07-2020||City||Noida begins drive to clean vacant plots||NOIDA: The Noida authority on Monday started a drive to clean all the vacant plots, which are filled with garbage and can turned into mosquito breeding sources during the ongoing rainy season. Residents have been complaining about such open spaces which have become an eyesore. The authority conducted a cleaning drive to in sectors 33, 37, 50, 51, 70, 71 and 88, among others, on Monday, officials said. The authority chief executive officer directed the staff to carry out cleaning drive in all sectors across the city, the officials said. Besides, the sanitation staff will also clean the waste lying on undesignated spaces in the city. The UP government has directed the authority to carry out an intensive cleaning drive so that the water-borne diseases can be contained during the ongoing rainy season, at a time when the rising number of Covid-19 cases has become a worry for the officials in the Gautam Budh Nagar district.According to the officials, most of the vacant plots which are right in the middle of developed sectors remain unclean because either they are yet to be allotted or their owners have failed to use them.Residents say they have complained about such open spaces several times. “We regularly keep complaining to the Noida authority that it should clean the vacant plots, which are full of waste and a centre for mosquito breeding. The authority should impose heavy penalty against the owners of such plots. And it should penalize its officials for not cleaning the plot owned by the authority. This issue of unclean vacant plots crops up every year during rainy season,” said PS Jain, president, Confederation of NCR residents’ welfare association (CONRWA), an umbrella body of RWAs.The authority’s health department has directed the engineers to ensure that all of their areas, including vacant plots, are cleaned properly so that they do not become hub of mosquito breeding and filth.“We are busy in a cleaning drive across the city. We are desilting drains, cleaning roads, all other public spaces, and particularly vacant plots to make sure the city remains clean,” said SC Mishra, senior project engineer of Noida authority who heads the health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-begins-drive-to-clean-vacant-plots/story-llzJtNCQ31FbSFXx5XKlHL.html
14-07-2020||City||Noida: District hospital sees 88% drop in out-patient footfalls due to Covid-19 crisis||NOIDA: Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the number of patients coming to the out-patient department (OPD) of district hospital in Sector 30 has dropped by 88% during April-June as compared to the figures of corresponding period last year. According to hospital authorities, while the average number of patients visiting OPD was around 3,500 between April and June last year, it was around 400 during the past three months.Dr VB Dhaka, chief medical superintendent (CMS) of district hospital, said that despite many departments in operation, the number of OPD patients has gone down drastically since the first phase of lockdown was announced. The hospital administration has mainly attributed the sharp drop in OPD patients to mass exodus of migrants and Covid-19 fear among the people. “At present, many departments like gynaecology, fever clinic, dental, ophthalmology, and paediatric are open in the hospital for patients. While the number of OPD patients recorded in June this year was 438, it was 385 and 409 in March and April, respectively,” Dhaka said.Dhaka further said that patients are refraining to come to the hospital as they fear of getting infection from the quarantine ward here. “The district hospital was supposed to be a ‘green zone’ hospital, meant for non-Covid patients. Since the 400-bed Covid-dedicated hospital has not yet started in Sector 39, we are unable to shift our quarantined patients there,” he said.The quarantine ward in the hospital has 50 beds, of which 42 are currently occupied, the authorities said.The chief medical superintendent also said that the mass exodus of workers from the district has resulted in the sharp decline in out-patient footfalls. “Most of the people who visit the district hospital are from lower economic strata. As many workers have returned to their native places during the Covid-19 crisis, the number of patients has gone down,” he said.When contacted, Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that the 400-bed Covid-dedicated hospital in Sector 39 will be operational in 10-15 days. “The additional principal secretary (health) will visit the hospital premises in a day or two. Once this hospital becomes operational, the district hospital will act as a complete non-Covid hospital,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-district-hospital-sees-88-drop-in-out-patient-footfalls-due-to-covid-19-crisis/story-vyVKkOqIoMPYlJSWJc2QMM.html

However, police officers rushed to the spot and told the agitated shopkeepers that the mall was temporarily closed for sanitisation purpose as someone from the mall had tested positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19). “The security guards told us that the mall had been closed and that we were not allowed to go in. We were enraged as no one from the mall’s management had bothered telling us about the closure in advance. All of our merchandise was inside the mall, and it was only after an hour that we were told that it was a temporary closed as someone had tested positive for Covid-19, a shop owner, who did not wish to be identified, said.The mall’s management did not answer calls on Monday despite several attempts.According to the police, which had rushed to the mall along with officials from the district administration in light of the gathering, one of the maintenance staff personnel had tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday. “According to the guidelines, any public establishment from where a positive case is reported has to be shut down for 48 hours for sanitisation purposes. That is why the mall has been temporarily closed as someone from the mall’s management tested positive for coronavirus. However, there was some confusion about the closure of the mall in the morning which was later clarified,” assistant commissioner of police, Rajneesh Verma, said.According to the police, the mall has been closed for two days so that it can be completely sanitised, and will open again on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/after-covid-19-case-emerges-at-noida-mall-confusion-over-closure-leaves-shop-owners-miffed/story-prrMNviGRBWG9FN5URl6iJ.html
14-07-2020||Gurugram||Health department to hire a private firm for second round of serological survey||The district health department on Monday said it is in the process of hiring a private health company to conduct the second round of serological survey with 2,000 antibody kits for studying the prevalence of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infection in the city. Health officials said that they need additional manpower to conduct the survey. As such, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) is likely to be signed between the district health department and Hindustan Wellness — a health consultant company — to conduct the coronavirus antibody test. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), Gurugram, said that with the expansion of the serological survey to 2,000 people in the second round, the plan is to get assistance in terms of manpower and machinery. “Members of the health department staff are already deployed to conduct designated duties, such as conducting the Reverse Transcription – Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests, the antigen tests and contact tracing. Currently, more than 60 lab technicians are involved in taking samples and conducting tests. To conduct a serological survey, an MoU will be signed with a private company after approval from the district administration.” According to Yadav, the plan is to conduct more than 400 people for the survey in a month. “To cover 2,000 people, the survey will take nearly four to five months to be completed,” said Yadav.A serological survey is a tool used by epidemiologists to study the prevalence of an infection within a community. The district health department conducted the first round of serological survey on June 24 at the CMO office in the old Civil Hospital. In the first round of the survey, 460 people were supposed to be covered. However, the health department has managed to draw 361 blood samples till now.Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, said, “In the first round, 361 blood samples have been tested for coronavirus antibody, of which 49 samples have tested positive for the virus. The remaining 99 tests of the first round will be conducted from Tuesday onwards.” Officials of the health department said the second round of serological survey will cover people from different backgrounds as per the guidelines of the Indian Council Medical Research (ICMR). The ICMR guidelines recommend people from 20 categories to be included in a serological survey. These include immunocompromised patients, healthcare workers, industrial workers, aviation staff, taxi and auto drivers, prisoners, staff members of urban local bodies (ULBs) and persons working with banks, post offices, courier agencies and telecom companies. A few vulnerable sections of the population, such as preoperative patients, pregnant women and elderly people are also included in the survey.Based on the guidelines, the population strata that need to be covered for the survey will be identified by the health department. Yadav said, “The plan regarding the population groups to be covered and the places where the testing camps are to be organised is being prepared by the health department. Even, consumables such as personal protective kits (PPEs) and antibody kits will be provided by us.” He added that the plan will be shared as soon as the MoU is signed after necessary permissions are obtained. The survey will involve the use of an improved enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa)-based antibody kit. For the test, five millilitres of blood will be collected, which will then be separated into blood and plasma. The plasma will be used to detect the antibodies developed against the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The IgG Elisa test has been approved by the ICMR because of its high sensitivity and specificity. Al least 50% of the kits will be used on patients, who have been tested positive within the last two weeks. The remaining kits will be used on those who have no history of contracting the Covid-19 infection. Studies show that the IgG (immunoglobulin G) antibodies typically start appearing after two weeks of the onset of infection. Even if patients have recovered, the antibodies can last for several months, thereby enabling health workers to detect the number of unreported cases. A representative from Hindustan Wellness said he will not be able to comment on the matter yet as the MoU is yet to be signed and is awaiting a nod from the district administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-department-to-hire-a-private-firm-for-second-round-of-serological-survey/story-UX6TBChdLdVlxiwAMRWEOL.html
14-07-2020||Gurugram||Post-lockdown, more visits to supermarkets and pharmacies, less to workspaces||Mobility data published by Google shows a gradual increase in public movement following easing of lockdown restrictions in Haryana starting in May .In Haryana, a majority of this increase was from people making more trips to the supermarkets and pharmacies, followed by recreational locations (including restaurants, cafés, and shopping centres) and transport hubs, data obtained from Google shows. Between April 26 and July 7, for example, visits to supermarkets and pharmacies (within Haryana) recorded a 45% increase, as per Google’s Community Mobility Reports. Trips to recreational locations rose 38 percent during the same period, while travel to transport hubs (such as bus stations) increased by 23 percent. Launched in April to depict changing mobility trends in a post-Covid world, Google reports calculate the increase (or decrease) in public mobility by comparing recent trends with those observed between January 3 and February 6 (which has been taken as the baseline period). The data only captures smartphone users who have allowed Google to track their location history.The latest mobility report, based on data up to July 7, shows that workplaces in Haryana have remained largely closed, with only a seven percent increase in trips to offices (since April 26). Visits to parks during this period were up by 16 percent, while visits to residential areas have reduced by 10 percent. However, visits to residential locations are still 12 percent higher than the median value (recorded during January 3 and February 6) indicating that at least a portion of the population is continuing to stay indoors. The same applies to Google’s other location categories as well -- while there has been an increase in public movement to recreational spaces in Haryana, for example, the average number of trips to restaurants, cafes and similar locations continues to be 48 percent less than in a pre-Covid world. Compared to pre-Covid data, visits to workspaces remain 35 percent lower, while visits to parks and public spaces remains 75 percent less than in January and February. Visits to key locations for public transport are still 43 percent less than they were before the outbreak. However, visits to supermarkets and pharmacies are just one percent lower than their median value, indicating that these activities have remained the same. Nationwide, Google’s data shows an 30 percent increase in trips to recreational destinations, 49 percent increase in trips to grocery stores and pharmacies, 20 percent to parks, 27 percent to transit stations and 6 percent to workplaces, along with a 7 percent increase in trips to residential areas (between April 26 and July 7).“We have heard from public health officials that this same type of aggregated, anonymised data could be helpful as they make critical decisions to combat Covid-19,” Google had said in a statement at the time of launching it’s mobility data in early April. “This dataset is intended to help remediate the impact of Covid-19. It shouldn’t be used for medical diagnostic, prognostic, or treatment purposes. It also isn’t intended to be used for guidance on personal travel plans,” the report for India states.Experts said that while the data can be valuable for policy makers, it must also be viewed with certain caveats. Divij Joshi, lawyer and policy expert at an international not-for-profit technology company, said, “Such kind of data could be used by authorities to see how and where people are moving. This could help them understand where social distancing measures need to be enforced more strictly. But the actual utility of the data is still to be seen. Also, Google has captured only those individuals who own smartphones and have allowed Google to track their location history.”Citizens using feature phones without internet connectivity have been left out of the purview of the data. “There is a large section of the population whose mobility patterns, if changing, has not been recorded. Smartphone penetration in India is only between 30 to 40 percent, so Google’s data set covers only a certain section of the population, with most smartphone users living in urban areas,” Joshi added. Google’s latest report (up to July 7), also clarifies this, stating, “The data represents a sample of our users. As with all samples, this may or may not represent the exact behaviour of a wider population.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/post-lockdown-more-visits-to-supermarkets-and-pharmacies-less-to-workspaces/story-UV7klSqkbNtvHk7XXD5RWI.html
14-07-2020||City||Noida police to have virtual interactions with complainants||Noida: The Gautam Budh Nagar police on Monday started a virtual meeting system for complainants to reduce human interactions in the wake of Covid-19 crisis.“The system will work through a software. When anyone goes to a police station to file their complaint, they can get in touch with senior officials through the virtual system. This will keep them from unnecessarily travelling to another office and reduce exposure,” said Akhilesh Kumar, joint commissioner of police (law and order).The idea has been implemented at eight of the 22 police stations, including Phase 3 and Rabupura stations, across the district and the software will be shared with the other police stations within a week, police officials said. The officials said that the preference has first been given to the rural belt because people there have to travel the most.“If there are any complaints or documents that have to be shared with senior officials, it can also be done through scanners. Normally, we meet the public between 11am and 12 noon. For now, we are using the time frame for virtual meetings also. In case the need arises, we can extend it in the future,” said Kumar.Kumar also said that the software would also be helpful for interdepartmental issues and meetings, and will benefit both police personnel and public.The basic complaint filing system will, however, continue the way it has been working, the officials said.Since the Covid-induced lockdown, senior police officials have been conducting meetings with other officials through video or telephonic conferencing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-police-to-have-virtual-interactions-with-complainants/story-n6jmE6De8yK8V8GDFGSabM.html

Health officials said that over the last few weeks, with the high movement of people many category-1 zones have also been converted into category-2 containment zones.“The rise in the number of category-2 containment zones is due to the high movement of people after the restrictions on mobility were slowly lifted (especially after Unlock 1.0 kicked in on July 1). Given this scenario, we have more instances of people from the same family, friend circle, or locality contracting the deadly virus. Hence, more than one case is being reported from the same residential pockets including high-rises,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.According to Uttar Pradesh government guidelines, category-1 containment zones are created in pockets with only one Covid-19 case, and the sealed areas are spread over a radius of 250 metres. On the other hand, the category-2 zones are created where more than one case is reported from a pocket, and an area spread over a 500-metre radius is sealed with a buffer area going up to a 250-metre radius.As per the daily health bulletin released by the state control room, as on July 13, the district has a total of 3,257 cases, including 120 reported in the last 24 hours. Till May 31, the district had only 305 cases, and nearly 2,971 cases were added to the district’s Covid-19 tally since June 1 alone. According to the health department data, Ghaziabad has witnessed an average of about 127 new Covid cases every day since June 12.So far, the state has 1,248 active cases, the second-highest figure in Uttar Pradesh after state capital Lucknow (which had a total of 1,460 active cases till Monday). As many as 1,966 patients have been cured of the infection discharged from various hospitals in the district, while 62 people have succumbed to the disease.“To contain the spread of the virus, our prime focus is on the containment zones where we have increased testing with rapid antigen kits. We also conducting surveillance drives in containment zones for early detection of influenza-like-illnesses (ILI) and and SARI cases. We have just finished with the 10-day long special surveillance drive on July 12. We are now going to rope in health workers for another round of surveillance in containment zones to check the rise in cases,” the CMO said.According to officials, between March 5 (when the first Covid-19 case surfaced in the district) and July 12, as many as 50, 000 samples have been tested in Ghaziabad. Of these, 19,000 samples were tested through rapid antigen testing that started here on June 26.The Ghaziabad administration on July 9 roped in police officers along with health department workers, administrative officers in order to intensify contact tracing in the district. The teams will get information about positive patients from the health department and will initiate contact tracing with the help of 18 nodal police officers appointed for areas under every police station in Ghaziabad.According to the latest list, localities such as Indirapuram, Vaishali, and Vasundhara, under the jurisdiction of Indirapuram police station, have about 223 overall active cases (till July 10), while localities like Arthala, Mohan Nagar, Karhera, Pasonda, Shalimar Garden etc, under the jurisdiction of Sahibabad police station, have about 184 active cases (till July 10).The locality of Khoda which was put under the administration’s ‘sector scheme’ has over 36 cases.In localities such as Vijay Nagar, Pratap Vihar, under the jurisdiction of Vijay Nagar police station, the overall cases are about 105.

The district administration has, however, issued no order despite the directions given by the UP government on Sunday. Our markets opened on an alternate day basis, and shop owners who were hoping that all markets will open on Monday were a dejected lot,” said Rajneesh Bansal, chairman, Turab Nagar Vyapar Mandal (a group of shopkeepers in the city).“The trader community is miffed with indecisiveness shown by the district administration. At least, there should have been some guidelines or directions given to us by the district administration, in case the state government has still not issued any official order for opening markets on all five days. All traders were eagerly waiting to open their shops, but many of them could not,” he added.Some traders even took to the streets in Sahibabad and raised slogans against the district officials as their shops were not allowed to open.Following the state government’s announcement on Sunday that allowed all markets to be open from 9am to 9pm except for on Saturday and Sunday, district magistrate (DM) Ajay Shankar Pandey did not roll out any directive on the opening of markets in Ghaziabad till Monday evening.When contacted, the DM said, “The previous orders will continue till the time we receive orders from the state government. The state chief secretary has told us that the order is in the process of getting prepared. So, we expect that it will get it by Monday night. The closing timing for all shops, in the meantime, will be 7.30pm ,” he added.On May 22, the Ghaziabad administration had issued orders for alternate opening of 34 major markets in different areas from 10am to 5pm. In subsequent orders on June 8, shops were allowed to open from 9am to 9pm. On July 2, the administration further revised timings for the shops (from 9am to 7.30pm), after the UP chief secretary on June 30 imposed night curfew from 8pm to 6am in six districts of Meerut division, which includes Ghaziabad. However, the extended night curfew restriction (8pm to 6am) in Meerut division were applicable only till July 10.“The deadline of 8pm to 6am curfew in Meerut division has ended now, but still traders have to shutdown shops at 7.30pm. Markets in Indirapuram and Vaishali did not open on Monday as their turn for opening falls on Tuesday. So, many traders lost one-day earnings despite the new directions issued by the state government. We tried to contact district officials as well, but no one responded to our calls,” said Pradeep Gupta, convener of Vyapari Ekta Samiti, Indirapuram.According to the May 22 directions, major markets in Indirapuram, Vaishali, Sahibabad, Bjaria, Gandhi Nagar, Nehru Nagar, Mohan Nagar, Shastri Nagar and Turab Nagar among others are allowed to be open on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.The markets which are allowed to open on Monday, Wednesday and Friday are Vasundhara, Kaushambi, Raj Nagar District Centre, Kavi Nagar, Rajendra Nagar, Shyam Park, Raj Nagar Extension, Navyug Market, Ambedkar Road and those in Delta Colonies of Ramprastha, Brij Vihar, Surya Nagar, and Chander Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-traders-confused-as-admin-does-not-issue-fresh-orders-allowing-all-markets-to-open-on-weekdays/story-d9ddSS0OfMPhNOdHHSx3QI.html
14-07-2020||Gurugram||Over 39,000 houses surveyed in Gurugram to check mosquito breeding||To prevent the emergence of vector-borne diseases amid the coronavirus disease outbreak, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has surveyed nearly 39,000 houses across the district since June 1, and issued notices to nearly 90 people for violations, a press release issued by the civic body on Monday stated.As per the MCG release, 171 officials of the civic body and the district health department, have been conducting door-to-door surveys in four teams to check for water stagnation in coolers, tanks, tyres, and pots among other things. During the door-to-door survey, which started early last month, the teams also sensitised residents about the possibility of larvae breeding in still water, and have issued notices to over 90 residents for not destroying potential mosquito breeding sources.In addition, these officials have also been provided with 49 fogging machines for conducting fumigation operations across the city.“The teams have surveyed 39,000 houses in the district so far. Chief medical officer of Gurugram Dr Virendra Yadav, and Dr Ashish Singla, medical officer of the MCG, have instructed all the team members to work actively for preventing the spread of vector-borne diseases such as dengue and malaria. They said that with the joint efforts of the MCG and health department, the city only reported 22 cases of dengue and 15 cases of malaria last year, which were much lower than in previous years. All efforts are ongoing to report similar results or even lower numbers this year as well,” said SS Rohilla, public relations officer (PRO), MCG. While only one case of plasmodium malaria has been reported so far, no cases of dengue have surfaced in Gurugram till now.In 2018, the city recorded 93 cases of dengue, 66 in 2017, 86 in 2016, and 451 in 2015. Similarly, the city had recorded 30 cases of malaria in 2018, 48 in 2017, 36 in 2016, and 44 in 2015.As per MCG officials, all mosquito hot spots will also be monitored through the MCG’s Geographical Information Survey (GIS) laboratory in Sector 34. They further said that while sensitising the residents, the survey teams also have told them to observe a “dry-day” on every Sunday and refrain from using water unless necessary to contain the spread of vector-borne diseases.The MCG has also once again put a cap of ₹600 on private hospitals for dengue testing. “ Like previous years, the MCG has issued directions to all private hospitals in the district that they cannot charge more than ₹ 600 for dengue tests, and if we receive a complaint in this regarding, strict action will be taken the violators,” said Rohilla.MCG officials also said that one gambusia fish hatchery has been set up in Wazirabad, and another one is being set up in Pataudi. “Gambusia fish feeds on mosquito larvae and hence, they are being bred on a large scale for anti-vector-borne operations, “ said Rohilla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/over-39-000-houses-surveyed-in-gurugram-to-check-mosquito-breeding/story-M9dCBovXs6wDNDyIZe4C7L.html

Of 93,107 students, 56,672 were boys and 36,435 girls. The pass percentage of girls (89.34%) is much better than the boys (82%) in the region. In terms of pass percentage, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan has the highest rate of 98.95%, followed by government-aided schools (98.05%), Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (97.54%), government schools (85.88) and private schools (85.42%). The Noida region includes three districts -- Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad and Bulandshahr.A student of Amity International School, Noida, Vidhi gives credit of her success to her consistent preparation. “I always ensured to clock at least six to seven hours for my studies on a regular basis. I personally feel that the moment you give up the process of doing and redoing in your studies, you will lag behind,” she said. Aiming to become an economist, Vidhi wants to pursue graduation in economics. “I think that in a country like India, good economic policies are the need of the hour and my dream is to make a better economic policy for India, to league it among the developed nations,” she said.She scored 100 out of 100 marks in both economics and English. While her score in business studies was 99, she got 98 and 95 in sculpture and accountancy, respectively.From Apeejay School in Noida Sector 16, Falguni Dhingra scored 98.8% marks in commerce stream, while Geeti Kabra scored 98.6% in science stream. The other highest scorers from the district include Gaurangi Batish (98.6% in Arts stream, Amity International School), Stuti Lohani (98.4% in Science stream, Amity International School), Ishita Agarwal and Ishita Pundir (both 98.4% in science stream, DPS Noida) and Ananya Meghani (98.4% in commerce stream). Meghani, who scored 99.75% in best of four subjects, said, “The key to my success lies in the unwavering support and pressure-free environment around me. As long as you embrace the root, which are your basic concepts, you are bound to reach greater heights.”Reacting about the success of the students, Amita Chauhan, chairperson of Amity International School, said that it is a very proud moment for the school that Vidhi and other students have performed really well. “We believe in nurturing talent and our students always make us proud with their success. The efforts of our teachers are also appreciable as they have brought out the best in our students with their hard work and constant efforts,” she said.Kamini Bhasin, principal of DPS Noida, said that her school has achieved an average aggregate of 90.4%, with the highest ever increase of 0.8% over last year’s aggregate. “The highest school aggregate is 98.6% with 100% students securing a first division. A phenomenal result of English saw 14 students securing a perfect score of 100 and 24 students with 99. Psychology and mathematics also saw nine and five students respectively securing a 100%. Such a high average aggregate is a vindication of the sustained effort and commitment of my students, teachers and parents who worked as a strong team,” she said.In Ghaziabad, Sanya Gandhi, student of Uttam School for Girls, made the city proud yet again when her result was out on Monday and she secured 98.8% in Class 12 examination. She had been a joint national topper in CBSE’s class 10 exam declared two years ago under the category of children with special needs.“The girl is very clear in her thought process. In class 10, she was aiming for civil services and she maintains the same focus as her career plans. She has scored better this time, even though she appeared for exams as a normal student. We are confident that the girl will go a long way to pursue her dreams,” said Sharmila Raheja, Sanya’s school principal.Sanya secured 100 marks each in psychology, political science, and economics, besides 99 in music and 95 in English.The girl is the only child of her parents and suffers damaged optic nerves since birth. Her disadvantage turned into fortune as she says it prevented her from getting attracted to the social media.“I am still focussed to compete for civil services. After class 12, I wish to join Hindu College, Delhi University. My friends and teachers have been very helpful and appreciative of my achievement,” she said.She is a motivational speaker and loves singing songs of singer Arijit Singh.Like Sanya, Somya Goel, a resident of Avantika locality in Ghaziabad, scored 99.2% marks in best five subjects and has future plans of becoming a historian. Student of Gurukul The School, NH-9, in Ghaziabad, she scored 99 marks each in English, history, political science, informatics practices and secured 100 marks in fine arts.“I had no fixed plans for study and it was more of quality studies which I took up during the entire year. I have planned to pursue doctorate in history and becoming a historian. I also wish to write book with combing history and international relations,” Somya said, adding that her parents who are into business and her class teachers had been very supportive throughout.“There was no outing or party and my mother has planned a party at home due to Coronavirus outbreak,” she added.Gaurav Bedi, principal of the school, said that the results have been outstanding as all the 122 students who appeared for the exams passed with first division.Riddhima Sharma, a resident of Vasundhra Sector 5 and a student of private school in Sahibabad, secured 99.6% marks in five subjects. She scored 100 marks each in psychology, geography, dance and Hindi, besides 98 in English.“I have a special liking for dance and theatre and have been a student of Bharatnatyam form of dance for about nine years now. I am still figuring out my future career plan but it would be something in field of mass communication where I can interact with people and help them out. Dance is close to my heart so I spent a lot of time during initial months of my semester. Later, I dedicated my time to quality study few months before the examinations were scheduled,” she said.Her father is into business and mother is a homemaker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-merit-list-this-time-girls-outshine-boys-in-cbse-class-12-exams-in-noida-region/story-xpWLJbSxUrwGfnxHmMMB1H.html
14-07-2020||Gurugram||Residents of large outbreak regions suffer as Municipal Corporation of Gurugram wrongly pastes home-isolation stickers||In some of the large outbreak regions (LORs) of the city, where rapid antigen testing camps are being organised by the district health department and the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), several residents have complained of incorrect home isolation stickers being pasted outside their homes despite them testing negative for Covid-19 or not visiting the camp at all.On June 26, Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, announced that eight municipal wards in the city have been identified as LORs, which have more than 60% of the total case load of the city. Since then, the district administration has severely restricted the movement of residents and vehicles in these areas and has been conducting rapid antigen testing camps to identify the spread of Covid-19. Currently, the LORs in the city include areas such as Dundahera Police Station Road, sectors 14, 15 and 21, Bhim Nagar, Sukhrali, Arjun Nagar, Jyoti Park, Madan Puri, Shiv Puri, Baldev Nagar, Shivaji Nagar, Hari Nagar, Shanti Nagar, Nathupur, among others. Restrictions in these areas will continue till July 14, after which a decision regarding their extension will be taken. Meanwhile, some residents of these areas have complained that the MCG has wrongly put up home-isolation stickers outside their houses, leading to confusion in the neighbourhood. This is not the first time that MCG has been accused of wrongly putting up stickers or making a clerical error on the stickers being put up.Earlier in April, HT reported that several Gurugram residents had complained that the civic body had mistakenly put up home-quarantine stickers despite their names being absent on the list of people who are supposed to be quarantined. Sector 14Last week, two residents of Sector 14, who are neighbours, went to get themselves tested at a local antigen testing camp. While one of them returned home with testing negative and the other tested positive for Covid-19. The next day, however, they alleged that MCG workers arrived at their doorstep and pasted home-isolation stickers outside both of their homes, stating that not just they but even some of their family members have tested positive for Covid-19. They alleged that many of their family members, who were identified as being positive by MCG, have not even visited the camp. The residents said the misleading stickers led to a massive confusion in the neighbourhood. “As a member of the local residents’ welfare association (RWA), I was helping with the arrangement of the camp. As a precautionary measure, I got myself tested. The result came out negative. Despite this, I found that the MCG had pasted a sticker declaring that I, along with six other members of my family, had tested positive for the virus. It created a lot of confusion among the residents of the neighbourhood. It was only after I complained to the district administration, the Gurugram Police, and MCG, that the matter was resolved,” said Sanjeev Aggarwal, a resident of Sector 14.Aggarwal’s neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, said that although he alone had tested positive for the virus, the MCG declared three other members of his family to be positive as well. “My result came back positive during testing. My wife and two kids, who also got themselves tested at the camp, were found to be negative. The following day, the MCG had pasted a sticker, declaring all four of us to be positive. I only informed the local RWA but did not press the matter beyond a point as I did not want to draw attention to the fact that I have tested positive. None of my relatives are aware of my positive result and, due to the social stigma attached to the disease, I am not pushing the matter further,” said Aggarwal’s neighbour.NathupurIn Nathupur village, a similar incident took place, when a local resident tested positive. The civic body mistakenly pasted a home-isolation sticker outside the home of another person, who shared the same name but had not visited the camp at all. “It was when I received calls from my neighbours asking about my well-being that I realised something was amiss. The MCG had pasted a home-isolation sticker outside my house and declared that I had tested positive for the virus, despite the fact that I had not visited the camp at all. I immediately informed the locals and MCG officials, who were carrying out the tests about the error. They informed me that the sticker was meant for another person bearing the same name and attributed the mistake to a clerical error,” said the Nathupur resident, who wished to remain anonymous. Health department reactsWhen asked about these alleged clerical errors, MCG officials said they get data from the district health department based on which they paste stickers outside the residences of those who test positive for the virus at the rapid antigen testing camps. “We have been receiving some complaints about incorrect stickers being pasted. We have rectified our mistakes after cross-checking with the district health department. We get the data from the district health department and simply paste the stickers outside people’s home. We are only assisting the health department for organising these camps. They (the district health department) have a greater role to play in this initiative,” said an official in MCG’s health branch, who is privy to the matter.“During large-scale testing, a few inaccuracies are bound to occur. Regardless, wherever complaints of incorrect stickers have been made by residents, we have either removed them or put them up at the correct address with the proper details,” said Dr Virendra Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/residents-of-large-outbreak-regions-suffer-as-municipal-corporation-of-gurugram-wrongly-pastes-home-isolation-stickers/story-APdCaD56E0NQRsx1bhblUJ.html
14-07-2020||Chandigarh||Anomaly detected in 15 Karnal mills’ stocks during physical verification||Two days before the deadline of returning rice to the government, officials detected anomaly in the stocks of 15 mills in Karnal during the physical verification conducted on the orders of deputy commissioner (DC). Stock at 41 mills was physically verified by a team led by additional deputy commissioner Ashok Bansal, which found five mills short of 100 to 1,400 quintals of rice. Two mills did not disclose the details, while one was found locked.The development has raised questions on the government’s Custom Milling Policy as these mills were verified thrice since the procurement was done in November last year. ADC Bansal said, “We have provided the report of all 41 rice mills to the DC. While the stock at five rice mills was below the record, stock at 10 mills was found to be surplus.” He did not disclose the gap in the paddy allotted to the mill and their current stock. The officials did not even recommend action against the mills with the gap below 100 quintals.As many as 139 mills were authorised for the procurement and milling of rice for government agencies and 11.47 lakh MT paddy was given to them for the purpose. Officials associated with the investigation said rice worth over Rs 260 crore is yet to be returned by 41 mills to the government’s food and supplies department, deadline of which is July 15. Soon after reports of irregularities in stocks at two rice mills had emerged, Karnal DC ordered physical verification of all such mills in the district. “We have completed the physical verification of 45 rice mills. We have recommended attachment of properties of 16 mills which returned less than 60% rice,” said Karnal district food and supplies controller Nishant Rathi. He did not disclose the figures of the missing rice citing confidentiality, but made it clear that the government had all rights to make recovery from erring mills by attaching the properties of their owners and guarantors. DC Nishant Yadav said, “We have written to the government to attach the properties of eight rice mills and these will be blacklisted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/anomaly-detected-in-15-karnal-mills-stocks-during-physical-verification/story-H8UY3a4qrdDbNxN6pclUoM.html
14-07-2020||Chandigarh||Recovery of environmental compensation from polluting units remains a challenge for HPCB||Despite National Green Tribunal’s (NGT’s) clear guidelines, polluting units in Haryana aren’t complying with the environmental standards and making recovery of compensation an uphill task for the state pollution control board.A consolidated report of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) submitted to the NGT mentions the non-compliance of erring units.In its November 2019 orders, the NGT had made it clear that meaningful action has to be taken by the state pollution control boards against the polluting units and the environmental compensation should be recovered as the cost of restoration of the damage to the environment, otherwise there will be no meaningful environmental governance.As per a report of Haryana pollution control board, there are 129 industries in three clusters — 72 in Faridabad, 30 in Gurugram and 27 in Panipat — which have not been complying with the environmental standards for the last five years.The board claimed that 76 units, including 45 in Faridabad, 21 in Gurugram and 10 in Panipat, were facing closure over their non-compliance.As per the report, of Rs 1.53 crore imposed on the erring units in Faridabad, the state pollution control board could recover only Rs 19.53 lakh. In Panipat, Rs 70-lakh fine has been slapped on eight polluting units, of which only Rs 25.47 lakh could be recovered from three units.However, the environmental compensation to be paid by the polluting units in Gurugram was not mentioned in the report.S Narayanan, member secretary, Haryana State Pollution Control Board, said, “The recovery of environmental compensation must be in process and I will get it examined again.”“But the erring units will not be allowed to reopen until they clear the dues. A committee in the state headquarters will probe every case individually and impose the penalty as per the CPCB guidelines,” he added.On why the environmental compensation imposed on the erring units in Gurugram was not mentioned, Narayanan said, “It may not be immediately issued, but is usually done in all cases without any exception.”It is pertinent to mention here that in the reports of polluted industrial areas or clusters monitored in 2018 by the CPCB, Gurugram was at the ninth spot, Panipat at 11th and Faridabad at 63rd. As per the scores, Gurugram and Panipat are in the category of critically polluted areas, whereas Faridabad is a severely polluted area.In the November 2019 orders regarding the status of compliance of orders and recovery of environment compensation from the polluting units in red and orange zones, the NGT had sought the consolidated status report from the pollution control board of the state.As per the information, the NGT is likely to hear the matter next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/recovery-of-environmental-compensation-from-polluting-units-remains-a-challenge-for-hpcb/story-dpNgHxdBHE6sLW1H1gztEN.html
14-07-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana: Over 1,100 farmers apply for construction of water recharge shafts||In Haryana, 1,177 farmers have so far applied for the construction of recharge shafts under the ‘Mera Pani Meri Virasat’ scheme aimed at protecting the depleting groundwater table through crop diversification.A recharge shaft is an artificial structure for recharging the aquifers. These will be used in flood-prone areas and will culminate at the first stage of the sandy soil. Additional chief secretary, agriculture, Sanjeev Kaushal, said 182 farmers in Ratia, 76 in Siwan, and 231 in Guhla have so far applied for the construction of recharge shafts. Similarly, 55 farmers have applied in Pipli, 426 in Shahbad, 47 in Babain, 108 in Ismailabad, and 52 in Sirsa.He said the state government had increased the number of shafts to be put up from 300 in three blocks to 1,000 in eight blocks where the groundwater level is below 40 metre. The project would cost around ₹ 32.33 crore. Kaushal said water-stressed and flood-prone Shahbad, Guhla and Ratia blocks have been selected on pilot basis for the construction of 100 recharge shaft structures. He said a farmer would have to pay 10% of the total cost or a maximum of ₹10,000 as contribution for construction of recharge structure at the time of submission of application or he may give his consent to maintain the structure, in which case, the total cost of the structure would be borne by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-over-1-100-farmers-apply-for-construction-of-water-recharge-shafts/story-XoQXavRYwzaIFgFnmm2QTM.html

However, their Wagon R car was hit by a BMW at the intersection around 3.30 am on Saturday, injuring all three. The blood packets were also damaged in the accident. It was not immediately clear if the baby could have been saved if the toddler would have got the blood transfusion since she was already critical. The driver of the errant vehicle, a 27-year-old used car dealer, was caught near the accident spot, Rajender Dubey, the assistant commissioner of police (Barakhamba Road), said.“The driver, Shahzaib Sheikh, told us he was test-driving a used BMW that had recently been sold to his garage,” the ACP said. Sheikh has been arrested and booked for rash driving and causing grievous hurt by an act endangering the lives of others.The baby was born at Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital in East Delhi on July 5. She was her parents’ first child. They family lives in Trilokpuri and her father is a painting contractor.“Soon after her birth, we got to know she had a low haemoglobin level. Doctors advised us to arrange blood to save her,” the baby’s uncle, Shakti Singh, who runs a catering business, said.“When we contacted Indian Red Cross Society, they asked us to collect blood on Friday night. We told them that my wife could donate in return the next day,” Shakti said.Shakti, his wife and his sister left the Indian Red Cross Society with blood packets early Saturday in their Wagon R car and set out for LBS Hospital.“While we were crossing the traffic intersection of Bhagwan Das Road and Tilak Marg, a white car suddenly hit our car from the passenger side. The BMW was being driven dangerously and at a very high speed,” Shakti said.Shakti, in his statement to the police, said the errant driver escaped from the spot but the ACP said that a PCR team stationed nearby soon caught the driver.At the accident spot, an injured Shakti and his sister were stuck inside the car while his wife was thrown on the road. “The packets fell out of the car onto the road and were damaged,” Shakti said.When the police arrived, Shakti said he urged them to let him take the blood to the hospital, but the police rushed him to a hospital given his injuries. “The packets were destroyed,” a police investigator said.While Shakti was discharged the same day, his wife and sister remain hospitalised. “My wife is in a serious condition as she has severe internal bleeding,” Shakti said.The worst news came five hours later, around 8.30am on Saturday. “My niece had passed away,” Shakti said.As for the accused driver, the police said they were yet to ascertain why he was taking a test drive at that hour and what led to the mishap. “While the initial probe has suggested that he wasn’t drunk at the time of the accident, we are awaiting his blood test reports to be sure,” ACP Dubey said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/baby-dies-after-family-bringing-her-blood-meets-with-accident/story-lBvcPFNlQH95Y5EZgfB3KP.html

Noida police, however, said they had not received a complaint yet..According to the family members, the incident took place around 5.30am on July 3 when they received a call from their eldest daughter’s boarding school that is under Sector 49 police station’s jurisdiction.“They wouldn’t tell us anything. They simply asked us to come there at the earliest. We immediately rushed to the spot. What we saw there filled us with horror. Our daughter’s body was hanging from a fan. It had turned blue. The hostel management took our phones away and told us that she had taken her own life. They even claimed that she had left a suicide note behind,” said the girl’s mother.The family, however,say that they have strong reasons to believe that their daughter did not kill herself and there is foul play involved. They said she might have been murdered and the school was trying to stage it as a suicide to cover up the matter. They further alleged that the school forced them to sign a non-disclosure and the body was cremated, without the police being informed.The matter came to light after a video of the girl’s mother recounting the entire incident went viral.According to the mother, her daughter was in Class 10 and was studying at the school along with her younger sister and brother. The family had dropped the kids off at school on June 18 for their final exams In the alleged suicide note recovered from the spot, the girl has apparently stated that no one should be blamed for her actions.The Noida schoolon their part, however, denied all allegations of foul play.“Her body was found hanging. She and her siblings had been dropped off by the family here and even after all exams were postponed, they did not take the kids back, saying that they were better off here. She had a fight with her younger sister and was troubled with problems at home. The situation was explained to the family when they came and everything happened with their consent. These allegations are baseless,” said a member of the school management committee.Noida police said they were looking into the matter.“We have contacted the school as well as the family. A suicide note was recovered and all evidence is being examined. We will register a case as soon as the family files a complaint with us. We will also send an assistant commissioner of police ranked officer to speak with them if needed,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Kumar Ranvijay Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-school-teen-death-family-suspect-foul-play-write-to-haryana-cm/story-vKTnS8MsrbUGH9c6mZKoLI.html
14-07-2020||Education||CBSE 12th results 2020: Students scoring 95% plus double this year||Compared to last year, the number of students scoring 95% and above has increased by 118.6% and those getting 90% and above by 67.48% this year in the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class 12 results announced on Monday. A total of 38,686 students have scored 95% and above marks in aggregate of all subjects, up by 118.6% from 17,693 in 2019. As many as 1,57,934 students have scored 90% and above, 67.48% higher than last year’s tally of 94,299.CBSE’s controller exam Sanyam Bhardwaj said the change in the exam pattern this year led to an increase in the number of those scoring 90% and 95% marks. “The change in exam pattern helped a lot of students to score better. We introduced 25% objective-type questions in all the subjects and had also given 33% internal choice in the exams. Also, we had released the datesheet earlier than previous years. It also helped the students prepare better,” he said.Read More: Delhi University cutoffs likely to be higher this timeSeveral school principals, however, said the new evaluation policy adopted by the CBSE in view of the Covid-19 pandemic also helped students in scoring more marks. This year, the students were evaluated on the basis of the average of marks in exams they had appeared for before the lockdown was announced to contain the pandemic in March.Manju Sethi, principal of Bluebells School International, said, “Although the changed exam pattern helped students to score more, there is also a high probability that many students have benefited by the changes in the evaluation process. There is a possibility that some students had already appeared in the exams of subjects of their strength before the lockdown was announced and scored better in those subjects. For papers that couldnt be conducted, the students were evaluated on the basis of the average of the exams they appeared for. So, it helped the students.” The board had to cancel the exams of 12 subjects this year including Business Studies, Home Science, Sociology, Computer Science, Hindi and Information Technology, among others. A large section of students in many schools has scored between 90-100 per cent marks. For instance, Delhi Public School (DPS) in Vasant Kunj saw over 22% of Class 12 students scoring more than 95% marks. Of the 466 students who appeared for their Class 12 papers this year, all passed and 242 students (51.93%) scored more than 90%, the school said. For Amity International School in Mayur Vihar, 146 out of the 389 students who appeared for the exams, scored more than 95%. Divya Bhatia, principal of Amity International School in Saket, said, “There is a marginal percentage increase in the number of students scoring above 90% in our school.”Several government schools have also recorded unprecedented scores of 90% and 95% this year. Head of a government school in Dwarka, said, “The average score of our 137 students is 450.5 out of 600 this year. It means the majority of them have scored above 90%.”Head of a Delhi government’s School of Excellence said 60 out of 143 of their students have scored more than 90% marks. “Many students who were supposed to score 88%-89% also crossed the 90% threshold after being evaluated on the basis of average marks of exams they had appeared for,” he said. Under the children with disabilities category, as many as 243 scored 90% and above marks; 42 have scored 95% and more, results data showed. “From CBSE to state boards, students are being given higher marks. Unless DU devises another way of conducting admissions instead of cut-offs, there won’t be any change for the students but ideally, higher education should not be dependent upon these scores,” said Sanghamitra Ghosh, former principal of Mother’s International School, who has been working in the education sector for three decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cbse-results-students-scoring-95-plus-double/story-H8uxRyby549blSQi9qV2YK.html
14-07-2020||Delhi||Lok Nayak hospital to house Delhi’s second plasma bank||Delhi’s biggest treatment facility for Covid-19 patients – the 2,000-bed Lok Nayak hospital – will house the city’s second convalescent plasma bank, the government announced on Monday. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will inaugurate it on Tuesday.The Delhi government had inaugurated the country’s first plasma bank at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences in south Delhi’s Vasant Kunj on July 2. The Delhi government-run Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, a dedicated Covid-19 treatment hospital, has also begun work to set up the third plasma bank.Lok Nayak hospital has already set up an apheresis machine, which is used to separate the blood components. The collection of plasma from recovered patients will start this week, the hospital said. The hospital has already discharged over 3,600 Covid-19 patients, many of whom will be eligible to make plasma donations.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know today“The plasmapheresis machine has already been set up and will start collecting plasma from recovered patients from Monday. Within a week, we will be able to set up a bank as well to store this plasma,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak hospital.Convalescent plasma therapy uses the blood component plasma — rich in virus-fighting antibodies from patients who have recovered from the infection — to aid the immune system of Covid patients. It is still an experimental therapy that has been approved by the health ministry for use in moderate patients, whose need for oxygen increases despite providing oxygen support and steroids.Lok Nayak was the first government hospital in the country to administer convalescent plasma therapy in April as part of the COPLA trial being conducted by the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, which houses the first plasma bank of Delhi. Under the trial at Lok Nayak hospital, 14 patients received convalescent plasma and 15 patients received fresh frozen plasma with no therapeutic benefits, to study the efficacy of the therapy for Covid-19.Also read: Coronavirus pandemic is going to get worse and worse and worse, says WHO chiefThe study showed that those who received plasma fared better with their respiratory rate coming down, oxygen saturation improving and their sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score reducing, a yardstick that predicts ICU mortality.The duration of ICU stay and hospitalisation also came down in the patients who received convalescent plasma. For the second phase of the trial, 200 patients each from Lok Nayak hospital and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital will receive plasma therapy. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “ILBS was a good start but all hospitals in the city cannot rely on one organisation for the plasma. I think, at least the bigger hospitals -- both government and private -- should start asking their own patients to come back and donate plasma. People will also be more comfortable coming back to the same hospital and have a feeling of social service helping the health hub that helped them recover. Even we have started asking our patients to come back and donate. We started collecting plasma two or three days ago and are using it for our own patients,” said Dr Neeraj Gupta, professor of pulmonary medicine at Safdarjung hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lok-nayak-hospital-to-house-delhi-s-second-plasma-bank/story-RtUVzWhcedVb60iCozvnrO.html
14-07-2020||Delhi||As recovery rate improves in Delhi, 72% Covid beds free||With the recovery rate steadily rising in Delhi, the availability of Covid-19 beds in Delhi’s hospitals for the first time touched 72% in the second week of this month (July 6-12). The bed availability during the second week of June (June 8-14) was only 44%, government data showed on Monday.“The numbers mean that today, more patients are being discharged than admitted in hospitals. As many as 72% of the total beds are now available and vacant in Delhi, as opposed to 65% last week. More beds are being added every week and these are reserved for patients with moderate to severe symptoms,” a media advisor to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Monday.The number of available beds continues to rise with nearly 200 more getting vacant on Monday. Government reports showed that as on Monday, as many as 11,130 Covid beds in hospitals were vacant against the total of 15,359 beds. Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayOn Sunday, 10,938 beds were available, the number on Saturday was 10,751 and 10,631 on Friday. Availability of Covid-19 beds in Delhi had crossed the 10,000-mark for the first time on July 6, when 10,051 beds were vacant.Gauging the favourable conditions and easy availability of beds, the government has put on hold a plan to convert stadiums such as Talkatora and Pragati Maidan and more banquet halls into makeshift hospitals.“Delhi’s recovery rate is 79.98% now, which is better than the national average of 62.93%. Plasma therapy has helped in improving the recovery rate as well as reducing the fatality rate which has declined to 3% now from 3.64% between June 22 and July 5. It is because of these positive indices that we do not immediately requite the creation of more large scale Covid facilities,” said a senior government official.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Apart from attaching at least five hotels with hospitals, the government has attached eight banquet halls with big Covid-19 hospitals for them to be converted into Covid facilities. In addition, there is the 10,000-bed Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre and Hospital in the south district and the 500-bed Covid care centre in CWG village in east district. Besides, another 1,000-bed hospital has been built near Dhaula Kuan by DRDO. All of these are currently being largely underutilised due to lack of patients. The Sardar Patel centre in Chhatarpur, for example, has only 180 of its 10,000 beds occupied so far. At least 2,000 beds have been set up and are ready at the centre.On Monday, 1,246 cases were reported, while 1,344 people recovered. There have been a total of 113,740 cases, of which almost 91,312 have recovered. Of the active cases, 11,170 are under home isolation.An analysis of the bed occupancy on a weekly basis shows that in the first week of June around 215 more beds were being occupied by new patients on an average every day. In the second week of June, this came down to 171. A reverse trend began on June 22 when the number of those who recovered exceeded those who were admitted. From July 5 to July 12, as many as 139 beds were vacated by recovered patients on an average every day.The government, however, has no plans to de-escalate the preparations made for Covid-19 treatment. Government officials had told HT that even though the number of the number of hospitalisations has gone down, the numbers may rise again just as it happened in Mumbai and other places across the world. Also read: Coronavirus pandemic is going to get worse and worse and worse, says WHO chiefExperts agreed it would be premature to scale down the number of Covid beds.Assuming the initial trends of the sero-surveillance data to be true, es, Delhi is a long way away from herd immunity. “There were reports that there is a 15% prevalence of the antibodies against Covid-19 in Delhi. This is not enough for herd immunity, which can protect those who are uninfected. Besides, we don’t even know whether the antibodies are enough to prevent a second infection — studies have shown that antibody levels are lower in asymptomatic patients and those with mild symptoms. Plus, we also don’t know how long the antibodies last in a person. The infection is spreading in the other parts of the country and there is a possibility of resurgence in Delhi,” Dr Arun Gupta, president of the Delhi Medical Council, had told HT last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-recovery-rate-improves-72-covid-beds-free/story-LS49tjYDvg0xKNQTyJJTDK.html
14-07-2020||Delhi||25-year-old man stabbed 28 times by minors in Delhi’s Raghubir Nagar||Three juveniles allegedly stabbed a 25-year-old man 28 times in public view in the chest and neck, after he repeatedly objected to the trio speeding on motorcycles and performing stunts in west Delhi’s Raghubir Nagar. A video of the murder that was caught on tape was also widely circulated.In the video, the trio is seen stabbing the man as locals and vehicles pass by without intervening. Senior police officers said they have apprehended the three juveniles.According to the police, the incident took place on July 8. They identified the man who died as one Manish Kumar, who worked as a driver and lived in a slum cluster in Raghubir Nagar.The police said that on July 8, they received information from Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Hospital that a man had been admitted with multiple stab wounds. “A police team that reached the hospital found that the man had at least 28 stab wounds, six of them fatal, and had been pronounced dead on arrival. We registered a case of murder and started investigating,” a police officer who did not wish to be named said. Deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit said that during the preliminary probe, they found that the man had been attacked by three boys aged between 15-17 years. “During the investigation, we checked CCTV camera footage from the crime spot and found that the murder had been caught on tape,” he said.Purohit said they circulated still shots of the three suspects from the video in the area and showed them to the locals. “We formed multiple teams. Local enquiries revealed that all the three were juveniles. We found that one of the juveniles had a spat with Manish Kumar after he objected to the boy riding a motorcycle at high speed and asked him to not perform stunts in that area,” the DCP said.He said further enquiry revealed that Kumar had thrashed the juvenile around 15 days ago when he didn’t pay any heed to his objections. “We found that to take revenge, the juvenile spoke to two of his friends, and on July 8, when the trio found Manish Kumar alone in R block of Raghubir Nagar, they attacked him. They stabbed him 28 times in the chest and neck,” the officer said. With the help of locals and informers, the teams identified the three juveniles and apprehended them the same night, the DCP said, adding that they also recovered two knives used in the murder. The police have not found any previous criminal record for the three juvenile and a probe is underway, officers said.One of Manish’s relatives told the police that hours before his murder, he had been called by another of his friends from the area, who is also a driver.“We also suspect his involvement and are verifying his role in the murder. Manish’s family members told us that Manish had been telling these juveniles to not ride motorcycles at high speed as they could hurt someone. He also has three children; the youngest is a one-and-a-half-year-old girsl. He was concerned about them,” a police officer said. Manish’s family members did not respond to HT for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-25-year-old-man-stabbed-28-times-by-minors-in-raghubir-nagar/story-z2IVBc0eone1tJk7MXWmXO.html

According to NDMC officials, it is a pilot project and more such machines will be installed if this trial is successful. An NDMC official said that this device is designed to reduce air pollution by spraying atomised water into the atmosphere so that dust and pollution particles are cleared from the environment and the concentration of PM10 and PM2.5 is reduced.PM2.5 are ultra-fine particles that can enter the lungs and bloodstream and are the most prominent pollutant in Delhi-NCR as well as in other major cities across the country. PM10 particles are coarser, with a diameter of 10 microns. The Air Quality Index reading of Delhi on Monday was 72, which is in the satisfactory category.“The anti-smog gun is designed to create an ultra-fine fog, comprising very fine water droplets (less than 10-micron in size). These tiny water droplets will be spread over a sizeable area with the help of a high-speed fan, which can absorb even the smallest dust particles in the air,” an NDMC statement read. NDMC chairman Dharmendra inaugurated the machine in the presence of the secretary of NDMC Amit Singla. According to the statement, the anti-smog gun has a ‘throw distance’ of 100 metres with the size of water droplets ranging between 30 microns and 50 microns that could cover an area between 27,000 square metres and 37,000 square metres. The cost of the machine is Rs13 lakh and it will be operated by a wired remote control system.As per a study of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), the pollution level in Delhi-NCR, which had come down by at least 79% during the initial phase of the lockdown, registered a comeback with the city reopening in the fourth phase of the lockdown May-end. Of the six megacities, where PM2.5 levels were studied during this period, Delhi had seen the steepest rise (4-8 times), as compared to other cities (2-6 times), an analysis by CSE showed.Experts, however, expressed doubts over the success of the anti-smog gun. Shambhavi Shukla, programme officer, air pollution, CSE said that while it might suppress or settle the pollutants for some time, it was not a long-term solution.“Such machines may suppress smaller particles like PM2.5 over a small area for a certain time, but they are not a long-term solution. The only way out is to control the sources of pollution. We also have to see how much water they would consume and how long they would be able to control the smog or smaller particles because their effects wear out quickly,” Shukla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ndmc-installs-anti-smog-gun-in-connaught-place-to-reduce-pollution/story-FDYU5mi1XyFfAFLxXhiJQI.html

14-07-2020||Pune||Congress targets NCP over former PMC chief’s transfer||The Congress Party’s local unit, on Monday, targeted its state alliance partner, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), over the sudden transfer of Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad, “without any valid reason”.Congress city unit president Ramesh Bagwe said, “Gaikwad’s transfer was shocking. As our party is ruling in the state, it is wrong to make any comment; but without any valid reason, the commissioner got transferred. He was working satisfactory and hardly had five-to-six months as municipal commissioner.”Without naming any party or leader, Bagwe added, “We need to fight against Covid-19 and not do politics. There was a good image of the government handling Covid-19 among the citizens, but the commissioner’s transfer has given the wrong message.”Sanjay Balgude, secretary, Maharashtra Pradesh Congress, strongly criticised the NCP over the transfer of Gaikwad.Balgude said, “I personally don’t have any relations or contact with Gaikwad, but overall, there was a good image. He just got transferred to the PMC and within a month, faced the Covid-19 pandemic. He increased the city’s health capacity.”Balgude added, “The lockdown decision is really not satisfactory. If Gaikwad raised any objections, it should have been accepted with an open mind as he was speaking from the citizen’s perspective. Covid-19 is going to live long and we cannot force citizens to stay within their homes every few days. People are committing suicide due to financial crisis.”Balgude further said, “We are living in a democratic process. If the state government claims that Gaikwad has been transferred because the Covid-19 cases increased in the city, the same principle should be applicable in other cities and districts, and all administrative heads, where cases have increased, should be transferred. The government cannot make a different law only for Pune and Mumbai.”Nationalist congress party city unit president Chetan Tupe denied to make any comment on it and said it was administrative issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/congress-targets-ncp-over-former-pmc-chief-s-transfer/story-o311a4FM7895o2btzzMz3K.html

14-07-2020||Pune||10-12% of Covid-19 cases reported in district are from rural areas: Collector||After the lockdown orders in both Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad to contain the spread of Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 (coronavirus) infection, the district administration is now working on war-footing to ensure that the same situation does not arise in rural Pune.The district collector has been meeting village sarpanches and also Covid-19 care facilities created at the rural parts of the district.Naval Kishore Ram, district collector, said, “Almost 10-12 per cent of the cases reported from the district are from the rural areas. We are worried that this ratio might change and that more cases may start coming up from rural areas too.”“We are focusing on contact tracing at least 20 people for every positive person. We have started decentralized swab collection too,” he said.As of July 12, as per the district health office, out of the 38,502 positive cases, 3,593 are from rural areas and out of the 1,075 deaths, 94 are from rural areas.Haveli which is also one of the largest talukas in the district is also one of the most affected areas. Out of the 1,989 cases that have been reported from all the 13 talukas, 803 are from Haveli alone including also 15 deaths. Followed by Khed (252), Mulshi (205) and Junnar (132) which also have some of the major industries.Ayush Prasad, zilla parishad, chief executive officer, said, “All the cases reported in rural areas are of those who are either travelling to the city for providing essential services or live in the bordering areas of the city or along the highway.”“There is a nominal local transmission, it would not be accurate to say that there is a rise in the number of cases as it is in proportion to the rise in the number of cases found across the district. Out of the 1,405-gram panchayats, 290 are affected,” he said.“We are now increasing our testing capacity and contact tracing. The lockdown in both these civic bodies will have a impact on rise in cases in rural Pune. We are treating the entire village as a containment zone even if we find more than five cases,” said Prasad.The collector in his meeting with officials from ZP laid down a multi-level pronged strategy to keep a check on the rising cases. The steps include ramping up testing from eight-nine contacts to 21 contacts. All high-risk contacts who could have possibly come in contact with the positive person in the past ten days are searched for and then tested while all the low-risk contacts are quarantined. Almost 1.55 lakh people are quarantined at the same time right now across the rural areas. A contact tracing team will be placed at each village level which was earlier only at taluka level.Every contact traced is also cross-checked with those recorded as a comorbid patient and then tested accordingly.Taluka haveli which is one of the worst affected will get 12 more hospitals which would be dedicated Covid-19 care centres for those showing moderate symptoms which will add 1700 more beds.For emergency care, the administration has hired 1,389 medical professionals and will be adding 23 more ambulances to the existing 41 ambulances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/10-12-of-covid-19-cases-reported-in-district-are-from-rural-areas-collector/story-Z906lbyWT4gEiMvFnwOiIM.html
14-07-2020||Pune||NIA claims two arrested from Pune had links with ISIS||The two persons arrested from Pune by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) had landed on their radar over suspicion of trying to recruit youth for terrorist organisation ISIS and procuring weapons, according to a statement issued by NIA Delhi.The woman was identified as Sadiya Anwar Sheikh (22), a resident of Phulenagar area of Yerawada; and Nabeel S Khatri (27), a resident of Kondhwa.“It has also come to light that along with Jahanzeb Sami and Abdullah Basith, accused Khatri was also actively involved in the planning to carry out violent terrorist attacks in India by arranging logistic support such as procurement of weapons, fake SIM cards, assembling of improvised explosive devices to further the activities of ISIS in India,” read the statement. The two were found to be in touch with accused from a case that NIA Delhi is investigating. The case is related to the link of two persons from Kashmir with members of Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP). NIA had arrested a Kashmiri couple identified as Jahanzeb Sami Wani and his wife Hina Bashir Beigh from Jamianagar, Okhla Vihar, Delhi in the case in March.The Kashmiri couple had first landed on NIA radar for links with a man identified as Abdullah Basith who is lodged in Tihar jail in another NIA case, according to the statement.While Khatri is a gym trainer in Pune, Sadiya is a second year student of Mass Communication in Baramati, according to the NIA statement.“The investigation has revealed that accused Sadiya Sheikh was continuously in touch with Jahanzeb Sami, Hina Bashir Beigh and Abdullah Basith on various secure messaging applications and deliberating on as to how to propagate the ideology of ISIS and further its activities in India. They were trying to build up a cadre of ISIS in India by recruiting gullible youth for terrorist activities,” read the statement.Sadiya was detained by Jammu and Kashmir police in January 2018 when she was 18 years old. The ATS unit in Pune had also apprehended her in 2015 when she was a minor as she was suspected to have inclination towards joining ISIS through online radicalisation. After her return to Pune in 2018, she was subjected to a “re-radicalisation” process.The two were lodged in Faraskhana police station lock-up on Sunday night and flown to Delhi for further investigation on Monday.

14-07-2020||Pune||Baba Adhav: Ensure food, employment for low income groups||Social worker Baba Adhav has been working for unorganised sectors for the past many decades. Speaking to Abhay Khairnar, the medical graduate said that the Covid-19 crisis will remain for a long period and the authorities should ensure that employment and basic needs of lower income groups are met before announcing lockdownIs lockdown necessary in Pune?It is true that Covid-19 is a global pandemic, but lockdown should be announced only after planning. Authorities should ensure access to food and employment for people from low income group before lockdown is implemented.Was the decision made by guardian minister Ajit Pawar and Pune district administration is in consultation with experts?It is a one-sided decision made without consulting people who represent the society. Ideally, the government should form a citizen action committee and consult it before taking these decisions. The citizen committee should have representation from all sections of society. I have been told that the lockdown decision was made without even taking elected members into confidence. Formation of a citizen action committee is a must.Senior leader Sharad Pawar is in favour of resuming business activity. Do you think the lockdown decision made by guardian minister is against the sentiment of people? While we are seeing a spike in Covid-19 cases in the city, lockdown always has an adverse impact on people working in unorganised sectors. I had appealed to Sharad Pawar to include autorickshaw drivers, domestic helpers and vegetable vendors in the essential services category like nurses and doctors. The government should support these people as they are working for the common people.Suggestion to handle Covid-19 crisis as per your medical qualification and work in social service sector.During the Second World War, the government made the rationing programme that guaranteed food for all. Likewise, authorities should ensure that citizens get food and employment. As the Covid-19 situation would remain for a long period, instead of taking interim steps, the government must consult experts and frame long-term policy for handling the crisis. At the city and local level, citizen action committees should be formed and their opinions must be considered while taking any major decisions.Your observations on the impact of lockdown on domestic helpers, auto drivers and unorganised sectors.The people belonging to these sectors are finding it difficult to make ends meet due to lockdown. Many domestic helpers are either lost job or their salaries are cut as housing societies have banned their entry. Those running small businesses are also badly affected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ensure-food-employment-for-low-income-groups-before-announcing-lockdown/story-MFLHpKEOxcDeAvkkqZLeuJ.html
