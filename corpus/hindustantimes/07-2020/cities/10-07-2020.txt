This circular, however, only gives relief to students who have tested positive and are under quarantine or after one or more family members have tested positive for the virus. All other students will have to physically report to their allotted colleges by July 14.“In view of various representations from candidates who cannot physically join the allotted college, it is hereby decided by the authority that if the candidate or his/her parents have tested positive for Covid-19 and are currently in quarantine, they should send their scanned documents to the allotted college for confirming the admissions,” stated the circular signed by CET cell commissioner Sandeep Kadam. The circular further states that allotted colleges will verify documents of students online and accordingly confirm seats.“I am currently working at a civic hospital in Mumbai, while my allotted college is in Nanded district. The travel will have to be arranged by me and that will be expensive considering the travel restrictions in place. We have repeatedly requested the CET cell to allow us to complete the process online, but have been denied the option, which is unfair,” said a student on condition of anonymity.Officials from the state CET cell said their decision as announced in the latest circular stands final and students will have to abide by the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-positive-mbbs-students-can-confirm-postgraduate-admission-online/story-Uwvb5yAeruJZepbKPSLxeI.html

10-07-2020||Mumbai||Final-year exams: Aaditya Thackeray called decision ‘absurd’, urges UGC, HRD ministry to not make it ‘silly ego issue’||Maharashtra cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray has criticised the Centre’s decision to hold final-year exams amid the increasing number of Covid-19 cases across the country. Aaditya, who also heads the Shiv Sena’s youth wing, Yuva Sena, called the decision “absolutely absurd” and urged the University Grants Commission (UGC) not to make it a “silly ego issue”.Yuva Sena had opposed the decision earlier in the week and asked the Union minister of Human Resource Development (HRD) Ramesh Pokhriyal to reconsider. Aaditya’s attack on the Centre occurred the same day Congress leader Rahul Gandhi criticised the move and said it would be “unfair to hold exams during a pandemic”.In a series of tweets, Thackeray took on the Union government asked if the Centre realises that Covid-19 cases in the country are still on the rise. He said that the students would experience mental stress and face the highest risk of contracting the disease.“The decision of the HRD Ministry of Union Govt, and the UGC is absolutely absurd and probably from an alternate universe. I urge UGC to not make this a silly issue of egos and realise that lakhs of lives of students, teachers, non teaching staff are at stake. Unless the HRD Ministry and UGC take responsibility for the health of each student appearing for exams, one wonders what is the guarantee apart from just that the ministry and UGC don’t realise the growing number of cases in India… It seems that while the entire country- Union Govt, State Govts, ULBs and Panchayats are trying to manage covid, reduce new cases and save lives, the HRD Ministry and UGC wants to just do the opposite,” Thackeray tweeted.Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray has already decided to cancel final-year exams while giving students the option of voluntary exams for better grades. Students who choose not to answer the exams will be graded based on their performance in the previous academic year and internal assessment.Earlier this week, Yuva Sena secretary Varun Sardesai wrote to the HRD minister on the issue. “When exams were originally scheduled, Covid cases were far lesser, and it [the pandemic] had not reached all parts of our country. The cases have been steadily rising, and we cannot be sure they will decline by September,” Sardesai said in his letter. “Lakhs of final-year students have secured jobs through campus placements or enrolled in private Indian universities or foreign universities. Exams in September would mean they effectively lose all these opportunities,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/final-year-exams-aaditya-thackeray-called-decision-absurd-urges-ugc-hrd-ministry-to-not-make-it-silly-ego-issue/story-wpxx0MxwtIcCCD3fv124IN.html

It raises the issue of confiscation of farmland of scores of Sikh farmers living in Uttar Pardesh by Yogi Adityanath-led state government.Strongly lodging protest against the UP government’s move, the editorial reads, “Seizing land of the Sikhs by the government is not an action that has been taken all of a sudden. This is the policy of the government to eliminate the Sikhs….This environment of alienation has given rise to demand of independent territory for Sikhs. As suppression on Sikhs increases, the demand for independent territory will get more intensified.”“Today they have seized farmland and tomorrow they take over outlets, factories and other Sikh establishment, if we keep mum,” it further reads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/suppression-of-sikhs-will-intensify-separate-territory-demand-sgpc-magazine/story-KqL122iBhIzjsljUh5yhxI.html
10-07-2020||Mumbai||HC asks Thane civic body to grant additional TDR of 6,913sqm to developer||In a major relief for a Thane developer, the Bombay high court (HC) last week directed the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) to grant the additional transferable developer rights (TDR) of 6,913 square metres (sqm) in lieu of construction of two development plan (DP) roads for the use of citizens.The developer, M/s Siddhi Real Estate Developers, moved HC in 2015, after the civic body refused to grant the TDR.The petitioner developed a residential project, Highland Residency, at Dhokali in Thane. As two DP roads – one 25-metres-wide and the other 15-metres-wide – passed through the project spread over 85,778 square metres, TMC in 2001 sanctioned the plans for the project on the condition that the developer shall construct the roads and handover them over to the civic body.Later, TMC decided to construct the 25-metre-wide road through its public works department, and asked the developer to deposit ₹31.67 lakh for the road’s construction, which the developer paid between 2005 and 2007.The developer later constructed the 15-metre-wide road too and handed over both the roads to TMC and the civic body’s name was registered in the record of rights as owner of the area of the roads, 6,913 sqm.In 2014, the TMC, however, refused to compensate the developer by granting him TDR in lieu of the area consumed for the DP roads. The civic body maintained that that there was no provision in the Development Control Regulations (DCR), 1994, to grant TDR for the consideration paid towards the construction of the first DP Road. It claimed that the roads were approach roads for the project, and the developer was bound to construct it for the benefit of flat purchasers.However, a HC bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice BP Colabawalla found both the reasons legally unsustainable. The bench said that merely because TMC constructed the first DP road on its own, it would not disentitle the developer from claiming TDR for its construction as a public amenity.The bench said this is because section 126(1)(b) of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966, contemplates that when an owner also develops a public amenity at his cost, he would be entitled to additional floor space index or TDR.“In the facts of the present case, even though the construction of the first DP road was done by the public works department of TMC, the same was admittedly done entirely at the cost of the petitioner.”The bench said the roads were neither access roads nor an alternative access for the residential project, but were roads reserved in the DP for Thane city and despite passing through the residential project, are used by the public at large.The bench said even if one of the roads was assumed to be an alternative means of access, as envisaged in Regulation 47 of the development control regulations for Thane city, it does not contemplate that the same would be free of cost or without any compensation to the land holder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-asks-thane-civic-body-to-grant-additional-tdr-of-6-913sqm-to-developer/story-6MgBKBVUcmMnlE0rALLSQM.html
10-07-2020||Mumbai||Questioning Vikas Dubey encounter would demoralise cops: Sena||Shiv Sena on Friday backed the encounter of gangster Vikas Dubey by the Uttar Pradesh police. Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that he does not support any fake encounter, but no questions should be raised on the encounter as it would demoralise the police.Dubey’s henchmen killed eight police policemen, including a deputy superintendent of police, on July 2 when they went to arrest the gangster in connection with an attempt to murder case. The gangster from Kanpur was arrested from Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh on Thursday.On Friday, while the convoy was on its way to Kanpur, it allegedly met with an accident in which one of the vehicles in the special task force (STF) overturned. The police said that Dubey tried to escape and snatched a weapon from one of the policemen. He then ran to a nearby field and was asked to surrender, which he refused to do, they added. There was an exchange of fire and he was killed, the police said.Sena leader Raut said that the encounter was “bound to happen” and called it a “revenge” of the policemen for the martyrdom of the eight policemen. “I have never supported a fake encounter and will never do so. But if policemen are killed, if there is no fear of the police uniform, there would not be law and order in the country… When such an incident happens where policemen are killed, it impacts the image of the state. Then there is no other option left for the police and the government but to act in this manner against such a don. If this encounter is not backed, it would demoralise the police. No political party should take such a stand [opposing the encounter], Raut told TV reporters in Mumbai.The Sena leader blamed the entire politics for the creation of goons like Dubey and no single party or government should be held responsible. He added that the killings of policemen in Kanpur would become a “matter of prestige” for any government. “Whether you call fake encounter or anything else, but the police always avenge the murder of their colleagues. The incident should not be politicised. It would demoralise the police,” he added. He added that a probe can be conducted to ascertain the facts on how Dubey fled UP and entered another state.He dismissed the theories that Dubey was silenced in a fake encounter so that he does not name any key persons backing him. “I do not think so. The is revenge taken by the police. Every gangster has several secrets, why only Vikas Dubey. How many will you kill?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/questioning-vikas-dubey-encounter-would-demoralise-cops-sena/story-okw5rf1gwm8QuhYZDTXsoO.html
10-07-2020||Mumbai||PMC Bank fraud: Court rejects bail pleas of Rakesh, Sarang Wadhawan||A city civil and sessions court refused to grant bail to HDIL promoters Rakesh Wadhawan and his son Sarang who have been accused in the multi-crore Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank fraud case. The court said the two accused are trying to shift the burden on bank officials and may threaten witnesses.The duo had approached the sessions court for bail on the grounds that the charges of cheating the bank is not applicable for the accused. As per the prosecution case, PMC Bank granted loans to realty group HDIL without following due process. The principal loan amount of ₹2,400 crore snowballed into ₹6,670 crore as HDIL failed to repay multiple loans between 2008 and 2019. However, senior management of PMC Bank covered up the irregularities to avoid scrutiny by the Reserve Bank of India.The Economic Offences Wing (EOW), in it charge sheet, claimed that Rakesh Wadhawan is the key accused in the fraud as the ‘patriarch’ of HDIL’s business. Wadhawan plotted the fraud and obtained loans from the bank with the help of other accused, the agency alleged.In their bail plea, Wadhawans claimed that the loan was taken in the form of overdraft and that they had submitted 32 title deeds of properties in return, which show they had intention to repay the loan. Lawyers for Wadhawans also claimed that the loan amount calculated by the prosecution is not correct and claimed that the allegations of cheating should be against bank officials.Special public prosecutor Ajay Misar objected to the plea and submitted that Wadhawans, along with the bank’s chairman Waryam Singh and other Board of Directors are the masterminds and key beneficiaries in the ₹6,670-crore fraud. Misar further submitted that Wadhawans commanded control over the financial affairs of the PMC Bank.The prosecution alleged that Wadhawans conspired with bank’s managing director Joy Thomas along with Singh and other Board of Directors, and did not pay outstanding dues, which is calculated as ₹2,400 crore. The prosecution further submitted that adequate properties were not mortgaged by Wadhawans and that those properties furnished as mortgage against overdraft facilities did not possess bonafide titles.After hearing both sides, the session judge rejected Wadhawans’ plea for bail and observed, “They cannot shirk their involvement by contending that the offence is committed by the officials of PMC Bank and they have no role in it. There is evidence to infer the involvement of applicants (Wadhawans) in the offence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pmc-bank-fraud-court-rejects-bail-pleas-of-rakesh-sarang-wadhawan/story-iIaQCC4nu16XgfkwxT48bJ.html
10-07-2020||Mumbai||Contractor expelled, MMRDA gives Metro-7 works at higher costs||Months after a contractor was ousted over delayed works of the Mumbai Metro-7 (Dahisar East-Andheri East), the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) awarded contracts at costs higher than what it had estimated for the pending works. In February 2020, MMRDA had invited bids for pending works of line-7 in two separate tenders - for the 6.25km viaduct and for four station works. While MMRDA had estimated viaduct works at ₹149.45 crores, the works were awarded to J Kumar Infraprojects Ltd at ₹174.76 crores, 16.93% higher than the estimated cost. For the station works, MMRDA had estimated the cost to be ₹103.89 crores, which was awarded to NCC Limited at a cost of ₹127.78 crores, 22.9% higher than the estimated cost. According to the minutes of the executive committee meeting, uploaded on Wednesday, the higher estimates were studied carefully by the general consultants. The authority has also quoted various reasons for the higher costs including a shorter deadline for the contractors which would mean deploying more machinery and manpower on the site. BG Pawar, joint metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA said, “The works were awarded after the meeting was conducted via video-conferencing. The contractors have also started work on-ground.” J Kumar has also been awarded the works of the Sewri-Worli elevated corridor, which recently got a CRZ nod. In January 2020, Simplex infrastructure was ousted over delayed works. The company had been awarded the contract in May 2016 and the works were expected to be completed in a 30-month period by November 2018. The company was issued several notices and letters over slow progress of works, MMRDA stated. The authority had also ousted a joint venture of RCC-MBZ over slow-progress of Metro-2B (DN Nagar to Mandale). The tender process of 2B is in the process, Pawar added. Metro-7 is being implemented at a cost of ₹6,208 crores and is now expected to be operational by April 2021. Box: MMRDA spent ₹53 crore on Covid centres MMRDA spent ₹53 crore for constructing the Covid hospital in Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), as per a Right To Information (RTI) query filed activist Anil Galgali. According to the RTI, MMRDA spent ₹14.21 crore for constructing Phase-1 of the hospital and it spent ₹21.55 crore for Phase-2. Both the phases have been handed over to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/contractor-expelled-mmrda-gives-metro-7-works-at-higher-costs/story-Y234e6m1qbRSna1jPUfm1L.html
10-07-2020||Mumbai||9 DCPs transferred, this time after CM nod||Four days after Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s order of transferring 10 deputy commissioner of police (DCPs) was overturned with immediate effect by the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO), a fresh list of transfers was issued by the home department on Friday, this time with an approval from CMO.It is being said that the fresh shuffling of nine DCPs, which includes three Indian police service (IPS) officers,was prepared keeping the CMO in the loop.The previous staying of DCPs’ transfer order had indicated strong discontent among the ruling partners — Congress and NCP — over several decisions taken by Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.In the fresh list of transfers which is approved by the CMO, most of the names and postings are from the same list which was cancelled by the CM earlier. Only some DCPs have been given different posting. For instance, DCP Zone 7, Paramjit Dahiya, an IPS officer has been moved to zone 3, which covers areas such as Nagpada, Byculla, Tardeo, Mahalaxmi and most importantly Worli, under which the tourism and environment minister Aaditya Thackeray’s constituency falls. This post was vacant after previous DCP Abhinash Kumar was promoted to deputy inspector general (DIG) of police-rank. DCP (headquarter-1), N Ambika was given an additional charge of DCP zone-3 in previous transfer.As per the home department’s order, DCP (protection) Prashant Kadam has been moved to Dahiya’s place in zone 7. DCP special branch-1, Ganesh Shinde has been transferred to ports zone, which was earlier held by DCP Rashmi Karandikar. She has now been entrusted with DCP, cyber police’s task. Previous DCP of cyber, Vishal Thakur has been moved to Zone 11, whose DCP Mohan Dahikar has now been shifted to Tardeo local arms division. Previous DCP at this post, Nandkumar Thakur has now been moved to the crime branch, while the crime branch DCP Shahaji Umap has been transferred to special branch-1. Umap would also hold additional charge of DCP protection and DCP security. IPS Pranaya Ashok who was holding charge of DCP (operations) has now been shifted to zone 5. This post was lying vacant after previous DCP Niyati Dave Thakur took over a new assignment in the central deputation. DCP zone 1 Sangramsinh Nishandar, who was previously transferred to DCP operation’s post, has not been included in the fresh list of transfer.CM Thackeray had ordered on Sunday to scrap the order of transfers of the ten deputy commissioners in Mumbai. The orders, issued by Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, on July 2. Though the orders were given go-ahead by home minister Anil Deshmukh, they were reportedly issued without keeping the CM in the loop.“Though there are police establishment boards at the state and commissionerate levels and the police commissioner has powers to transfer deputy commissioners, the transfer of senior officers from the civil services never takes place without informing the CM. Moreover, in the appointment of such an important post in Mumbai, where ruling Shiv Sena has its interest, the earlier transfer orders were a surprise for us too. The transfer of the DCP to zone-3 was the triggering point as the area covers the constituency of Aaditya Thackeray. The fresh order issued has no significant changes to it, but the political message sent out is important,” a senior officer said.Deshmukh had said on Sunday, “the orders of transfers of DCPs issued by Mumbai Police commissioner has been cancelled by me and the CM after due deliberation. The reports about the rift between three ruling parties are baseless.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/9-dcps-transferred-this-time-after-cm-nod/story-3kODTkNyij8mcbZPpSVblJ.html

We will win the Baroda bypoll with a huge majority in the same way we won the Jind byelection, where the Congress candidate was reduced to the third position. I will represent Baroda until the election is conducted. I am sure that the people will elect our nominee as we have delivered a transparent and corruption free government in the state,” the CM said.Khattar hit out at the previous Congress government in the state and termed it synonymous of corruption. “Hooda and Randeep Surjewala should wash their hands and mouths with ‘Gangajal’ and join some other party. If the Congress wants to do a new experiment, they should pitch their strongest candidate in the Baroda bypoll,” he added.Former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Sunday had dared Khattar to contest the Baroda byelection, saying he is ready to face him in the fray.Baroda assembly seat in Sonepat district fell vacant in April following the demise of sitting Congress MLA Sri Krishan Hooda. No poll date has been announced as yet.Khattar said the state government has suffered a revenue loss of ₹ 5,000 crore in the last three months and has received ₹ 290 crore through Covid relief fund. He said 300 government employees have deposited a month’s salary in the relief fund.Khattar meets senior BJP leaders in DelhiThe CM visited New Delhi on Thursday to meet a section of central BJP leaders, including party president JP Nadda. On Friday morning, he called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to apprise him of the Covid-19 situation in the state. He then came to Rohtak, where he addressed a meeting of party workers to discuss the Baroda bypolls. Khattar went back to Delhi in the evening and will be visiting Karnal on Saturday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/khattar-hits-back-at-hooda-asks-cong-to-field-its-strongest-leader-in-baroda-bypoll/story-iuXlKe4eaJybeAWjRjNpkI.html

10-07-2020||Chandigarh||2015 SACRILEGE CASES: CBI puts Punjab govt on notice, asks it to file reply by July 20||Acting on an appeal filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for restraining the special investigating team (SIT) constituted by the state government for investigating the Behbal Kalan and Bargari sacrilege cases of 2015, the special CBI judge, Gurkirpal Singh Sekhon, on Friday put state on notice and asked it to file a reply by July 20, the next date of hearing.On July 8, the CBI moved a Mohali court urging it to stop DIG Ranbir Singh Khatra-led special investigation team from carrying out “parallel probe” in sacrilege cases. The move came two days after the SIT named named Sirsa dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh as an accused in the 2015 theft of a ‘bir’ (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib. The CBI plea claimed that the agency is still conducting probe in these cases and there can’t be two simultaneous investigations by two agencies in same cases.The judge observed that “in a single criminal incident, investigations are being conducted by two agencies i.e. by the CBI and the Punjab Police SIT, which is not permissible under the statutory provisions of law”. After hearing the arguments, the CBI judge directed the central probe agency to supply the copies of special leave petition (SLP) and review petition filed in the Supreme Court to the counsels for state as well as accused and complainants.The reply filed by advocate R K Handa, who appeared on Friday itself and has filed the power of attorney on the behalf of the accused, namely Sukhjinder Singh and SS Kler, and Gagan Pardeep Singh Bal, the counsels for the complainants made similar requests to the court for adjournment for filing the reply to the application filed by the CBI seeking stay on probe being conducted by SIT. The court observed that ‘the counsels for the accused have strongly pressed upon for passing any interim order in the favour of the CBI, accused by restraining the SIT to proceed further in the further investigation, which is to be conducted by them in these cases. Gagan Pardeep Singh Bal, counsel for the complainants, argued that about five years had already passed but due to the internal fight between the CBI and the Punjab Police/State of Punjab, no relief has been granted to the complainant party till date and has strongly prayed to expedite the proceedings of these closure reports. The court ordered that all the parties, who have not filed the reply to the application filed by the CBI, will file the replies in this Court on July 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2015-sacrilege-cases-cbi-puts-punjab-govt-on-notice-asks-it-to-file-reply-by-july-20/story-otLgYBFrw3Xu3FtgGSm8JJ.html

At the time of the transfer of the property, they had to pay to the administration one-third of the unearned increase in the value (the difference between the price paid by the original allottee/lessee and the market value/collector rate of the site at the time of permission of transfer).The new relaxation will be applicable only if the allottees have paid fully the cost of the plot to the administration.“There was strong opposition from the allottees, and many people had even approached the courts. Now, the administration has made the necessary relaxations,” said a senior UT official. EVen the courts had asked UT to relax the rules.The major beneficiaries of the new order are the allottees in defence sectors of 33, 34 and 35 that were allotted to defence personnel. “These were also known as defence colonies. The order will also benefit those group housing societies where plots were allotted on a freehold basis but on concessional rates,” said Sanjay Arora, a city-based realtor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-revokes-conditions-on-resale-of-defence-colony-properties/story-sW6Khmgz3DAGOcH5HQhvkK.html
10-07-2020||City||Delhi Police’s PCR vans to be fitted with cameras; control room to get live feed||New Delhi: Last December, when three teenagers from central Delhi’s Turkman Gate were killed in a road accident near the Maulana Azad Medical College, nearly 800 people staged a protest and blocked traffic for seven hours, alleging that the trio’s two-wheeler was rammed “deliberately” from behind by a police patrol vehicle giving them chase. Even though senior police officers told the crowd that their records do not show any police van in that area at the time of the accident, the agitators did not buy their version and demanded video proof for the claims, which the police did not have. The protesters dispersed only when a “thorough investigation” was promised.In the December 16, 2012 gang-rape case as well, there had been allegations from the public against the Delhi Police that the PCR van reached the spot late. In addition, agitators had alleged that the officials of two police stations had argued over territorial jurisdiction of the spot where the 23-year-old paramedic student and her friend were thrown out of a moving bus, after she was gang-raped and tortured by five men and a juvenile.To deal with allegations of foul play, inaction and delayed response against personnel deployed in patrolling vehicles, commonly known as PCR vans, which come up time and again, the Delhi Police have decided to install cameras in the vans so that the footage may be used as evidence to counter such charges, senior officials who are in the know of the initiative said.In all, the city police have an almost 800-strong fleet of PCR vans against their sanctioned strength of 1,000. The prime objective of the PCRs is to patrol the streets and be the first responders to distress calls or at crime scenes. However, as street crimes such as robbery and snatching have become a headache for the force’s top brass, PCR personnel have been given the added responsibility of curbing street crimes by chasing and catching criminals.“The availability of video footage from their vehicles will make their operations smooth and more effective. The cameras shall be equipped with the facility to send live feed to the centralised police command and communication room, which may be used to ascertain the routes the suspect is taking during the chase. Accordingly, the nearest patrol vans and police staff can be alerted and involved in the operation to nab the suspect,” said special commissioner of police (operations) Muktesh Chandra.Each police control room (PCR) van will have two high-definition cameras – one of them will be static while the other one will be movable so that officials can change its view and focus as per the demand of the situation. “The cameras will be placed in such a way that they can capture everything happening at its front as well as the rear side,” added Chandra.Police statistics show that as many as 299 criminals – including 39 snatchers, 27 robbers, 53 bootleggers and 43 thieves – were arrested by personnel deployed in PCR vans between January 1 and June 28 this year. They seized nearly 50,000 liquor bottles, 57 stolen mobile phones, eight illegal guns with 17 cartridges and 10 knives from the arrested persons.According to deputy commissioner of police (PCR) Sharat Sinha, the cameras in the PCR vans will help the police record the crime scene as well as the gathering of people and areas around the spot, all in digital format. “The video footage can also be used as digital evidence and make the case stronger against the accused. It will help us address allegations of inaction or excesses made against PCR personnel,” said DCP Sinha.The initiative is still in the planning stage and the tendering process is likely to be started soon, said senior officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-police-s-pcr-vans-to-be-fitted-with-cameras-control-room-to-get-live-feed/story-r2CxUkkTg3DpmjSJTSazhM.html
10-07-2020||City||12 child workers rescued from Gandhi Nagar||New Delhi: The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) on Friday rescued 12 children illegally engaged at a garments factory and a mechanic workshop from east Delhi’s Gandhi Nagar. The children were working without masks in unsafe and unhygienic conditions, the commission said in a statement. A team of the commission led by its member Roop Sudesh Vimal, along with officials of Delhi Police, labour department, SDM Vivek Vihar and NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan conducted the rescue operation. The DCPCR and Delhi Police have sealed the establishments and the contractor has been arrested, it said. A DCPCR member said the statements of the rescued children will be recorded at the SDM’s office, followed by medical tests, including Covid. The children will be produced before a Child Welfare Committee (CWC) for further proceedings and rehabilitated. “The commission is in process of evolving a comprehensive long-term strategy to make Delhi Child Labour Free by 2023,” said Anurag Kundu, chairperson, DCPCR. Kundu urged citizens to proactively report instances of child labour. He said with the outbreak of Covid-19 and the lockdown, there has been a drastic impact on the income of families. According to a joint report by UNICEF and International Labour Organisation (ILO), released to mark the World Day Against Child Labour on June 12, loss of employment and rising poverty is likely to force more children to seek exploitative and hazardous jobs as families use every available means to survive. Delhi minister for social welfare and women and child development (WCD) Rajendra Pal Gautum said that such coordinated joint efforts will help eradicate the malpractice of child labour in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/12-child-workers-rescued-from-gandhi-nagar/story-XEi9vzdJxd4mRsAd3pwE0K.html
10-07-2020||Chandigarh||ARMS ACT CASE: Moose Wala fails to join probe despite court orders||Defying the court orders, Punjabi singer Shubhdeep Singh, alias Sidhu Moose Wala, has failed join Sangrur police investigation in an Arms Act case.While granting interim bail to Moose Wala on June 30, the court directed the singer to join the investigation before the investigating officer or the SHO within seven days from date of issuing orders. As per the court’s direction, Moose Wala was to join the investigation by July 6. On May 4, Barnala police booked Moose Wala and eight others for violating curfew after a video of him firing an official assault rifle went viral on social media. Seven cops, including a DSP, have been suspended in the matter.On May 5, Sangrur police booked the singer, his friends and some cops after another video surfaced where he was seen firing from a private pistol at Ladda Kothi shooting range. Police stations in Barnala and Sangrur added provisions of the Arms Act in the first information reports (FIR) on May 18.The next hearing in the case is schedule for July 15, in which the court has asked the police submit the report with regard to the joining of the investigation by Moose Wala.One of the officials privy to the investigation said: “Even the special investigation team (SIT) looking into the matter has misinterpreted the court orders, giving more time to Moose Wala to join investigation by July 15. The orders clearly mentioned that he was to join investigation within stipulated time period of seven days.”“No summon has been issued to the singer even by the SIT even after he jumped the deadline,” he added. Superintendent of police, Punjab Bureau of Investigation, Gurmeet Singh said the singer has not reported before the investigation team as yet. “Though he missed the deadline, the singer is likely to join the investigation before hearing of the case. We will submit the report in the court accordingly,” he said.IG Patiala range Jatinder Aulakh could not be contacted.The court also directed Moose Wala to make himself available in the investigation of the case, as and when required, and not tamper with the prosecution evidence, besides restricting the applicant to leave the country without prior permission of the court.Going through the judicial file, the court also observed that “the video shown by the prosecution in the court, which had gone viral on social media and which was also one of the basis of registration of FIR makes it look like an event organised by the police itself and even a proper green carpet has been laid out on the ground”. Raising questions over police theory, the court said when the firing event was organised by the police and the police themselves helped the accused in firing weapons at a police firing range.The court had further observed that it seems that only when the video was circulated on the social media, FIR was registered by the police to save their face.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/arms-act-case-moose-wala-fails-to-join-probe-despite-court-orders/story-MZk4tJ9ptowwgQ2SSVf8hM.html

10-07-2020||Chandigarh||MULTANI DISAPPEARANCE CASE: Being lured by Pinki at Chahal’s behest to depose against Saini: UT ex-cops||In a new twist in the 32-year-old disappearance case of a CITCO employee, Balwant Singh Multani, registered against former Punjab director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini, two retired inspectors of the Chandigarh Police, also co-accused in the case, came out with audio recordings that they were being lured to give statement against Saini by dismissed Punjab Police cop Gurmeet Singh “Pinki” at the behest of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s political advisor Bharat Inder Singh Chahal.In their complaint to Punjab Police director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta and his Chandigarh counterpart Sanjay Beniwal, retired inspectors Anokh Singh and Jagir Singh claimed that they were invited by Pinki at his farmhouse near Landran on June 3 and 6 where he offered jobs of sub-inspector in Punjab Police to their children on behalf of Chahal. Pinki, a dismissed inspector of Punjab Police who was once close to Saini, is the second witness in the case registered at the Mataur police station in Mohali on May 6. His interview to a private channel in 2015, in which he said he had seen Saini torturing Multani, also finds mention in the FIR registered against ex-DGP and eight retired officials of Chandigarh Police.The case pertains to kidnapping of Multani, son of an ex-IAS officer, who was allegedly tortured and went missing after he was picked up by Chandigarh Police after a terrorist attack on Saini in 1991 when he was the Chandigarh SSP.In the audio recordings, the transcript of which has been submitted along with a written complaint, Pinki is heard telling the ex-cops that the case was registered against Saini as Chahal wanted to avenge his humiliation as he (Saini) had booked him in a corruption case when he was the vigilance chief. “Bharat is a sachaa-pakka (true to his words) jatt and he wants to avenge the torture which he met during his probe by the vigilance bureau. You are not the targets as revenge has to be taken from Saini only. He had promise me to settle my son also and has asked me to convey to you that your children would also get jobs in the police,” Pinki is heard telling both the ex-cops in the audio CD.Pinki is heard mentioning that Bharat has already settled scores with ex-SSPs of vigilance bureau, Surjeet Singh Grewal and Shiv Kumar and Grewal, who are in jail for the past two years. The ex-inspectors have also given affidavits of the CDs authentication, which they claimed were recorded during their two meetings with Pinki on June 3 and June 6.“We knew Pinki already and started getting offers via common persons. We recorded this conversation because we were suspicious that he may use our presence at his farmhouse to influence the case as he was the main witness. He even assured us that he will call Chahal in the next meeting,” Anokh Singh said.Pinki also told them that the head of the SIT conducting probe against Saini and others, IPS officer Harmandeep Singh Hans, was a “shareef afsar” and would follow Chahal to record their statement as they want. Pinki did not reply to repeated calls and text messages. Chahal, when contacted, said he did not know any Pinky. “Which Pinky you are referring to? I don’t know any pinki shinki,” said Chahal, when asked for his reference in the audio. Pinki also claimed in the audio that first witness in the case GK Maan, who had been claiming that she had met Multani in the Sector 17 Police station in an injured condition, was lying.The retired inspectors have demanded a fair probe into the audio recordings, saying that they were being framed in the 32-year old case because Chahal wants to settle scores with Saini.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/multani-disappearance-case-being-lured-by-pinki-at-chahal-s-behest-to-depose-against-saini-ut-ex-cops/story-cX1NQOIInZpzTKSGZvYvlL.html

He added that it was also need of the hour to declare results to enable the students to choose their desired courses in higher education in a timely manner.“For example if any student has appeared in the examinations in only three subjects, the average of the marks obtained in the best two performing subjects will be awarded in the subjects for which examinations have not been conducted,” said Singla said while elaborating best performing subjects formula.He added that the marks of practical subjects and on the job training, for vocational subjects will also be awarded on this basis.Singla said that in case of open-school students, the board will declare the results on the basis of credit carry formula. Students will be awarded average marks on the basis of the marks obtained by them in the subjects (credit carry formula), which were passed by them in earlier sessions.“The students, who were to appear under golden/final chance category of the PSEB for reappear or compartment, will also be awarded average marks on the basis of the subjects earlier passed by them,” he clarified.He added that for students having pending chances for division improvement or reappear and submitted fees for only one paper which was not conducted, additional chance will be given in the future without paying extra fees and separate date sheet will be issued later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-cancels-pending-exams-of-class-12-open-school/story-dXavaE7jrH5n9g1fhGjyoK.html

Senior doctor Dr Salim Wani, who recently recovered from the disease, donated his plasma early this week to encourage others to do the same.“SKIMS has started CPT for critically ill patients as one of the modalities of supportive treatment of the deadly infection that has been approved by central government as well as ICMR. SKIMS Institutional Ethics Committee had also given a nod for the treatment. The Jammu and Kashmir administration has also been apprised of the recent developments at SKIMS where critically sick patients received the therapy on compassionate grounds,” said SKIMS director A G Ahangar.He said Dr Sajad Bhat, a third year resident (general medicine), was the first one to donate plasma for the noble cause at SKIMS, which was done in collaboration with blood transfusion and immune-hematology department.“This mode of treatment is being enhanced and more manpower is being adjusted for this service, based on the clinical judgment and status of the patients in need,” Ahangar added.Stating that recovered patients can be the saviours of humanity amid this crisis, the SKIMS director said, “The patients who have recovered from Covid-19 should come forward for plasma donation. The management team for CPT would screen these donors and the recipients based on the scientific principles of the quantum of the antibodies detected in the donors.”He said given the surge in cases, CPT has tremendous scope in saving lives. “This has been debated thoroughly by the members of the recently constituted apex advisory committee for Covid-19 management protocols in J&K,” he added.The medical institute has also set up a helpline for patients and donors for the plasma therapy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/srinagar-hospital-starts-plasma-therapy-to-treat-covid-19-patients/story-sYTkWRykRdr1HUtzF7TTdP.html
10-07-2020||City||As cases jump in Kashmir, experts warn of collapsing healthcare systems sans lockdown||With no let-up Covid-19 cases in Kashmir, health experts have warned that hospitals could “crumble under pressure” if the administration doesn’t go for another lockdown soon.In the past week, more than 1,000 cases have been reported from different districts of Kashmir and every day five to six people succumb to the disease in hospitals, which many doctors have termed as an alarming situation, especially when patients reach hospitals with the signs of bilateral pneumonia.Some doctors have already written to the administration for imposition of a phased lockdown in the valley to bring down the cases. Head of social and preventive medicine department Dr Salim Khan said the current spike in moderate to severe Covid-19 cases and rising number of deaths is an indication that we are moving towards a catastrophic phase of no return with considerable quantum of severe morbidity, while our hospitals continue to get overwhelmed at this incipient stage. “This could lead to considerable mortality within and outside hospitals. We have very limited resources in the government sector to cater to severe cases with no back up from the private sector,” he cautioned.Khan, who is also the nodal officer for Covid-19, said all covid-dedicated hospitals are fully occupied with moderate to severe cases in majority. “The chest diseases hospital in Srinagar has over 75% cases with moderate and severe conditions and 5-10% critical patients,” he said.“There is an urgent need to revisit the lockdown relaxation policy and a strict re-enforcement of the same is quintessential if we have to salvage our limited health resources. Else, no effort will be sufficient to prevent deaths among the vulnerable population,” he warned.Besides Khan, at least a dozen health experts and medicos working in different hospitals across Kashmir have flagged the issue and asked people to take it seriously.“Now we are in the more serious stage, but there is no lockdown. With people not following SOPs like wearing masks in public, the outcome could be catastrophic,” said a senior consultant posted at Government Medical College and Hospital in Baramulla.“We get around a dozen cases with pneumonia and other symptoms related to Covid-19. We send them to Srinagar hospitals, but they are not admitted as they are not tested prior to it. Compared to the past, we are getting many more suspected cases,” the senior consultant revealed.“Despite these warnings, neither people nor top administrative officials seem to have taken the issue seriously as the latter recently decided to open parks and gardens in the city,” said Mir Faheem, a Srinagar resident.Meanwhile, when asked why Kashmir had far more cases than Jammu division, Kashmir health services director Dr Samir Mattoo said, “Travellers (returnees) to Kashmir are far more and our testing rate is also very high. These are the basic reasons for more positive cases in the valley.”A senior doctor from Jammu said, “The population of Kashmir is more than Jammu’s and the regions bear different climatic conditions. Lifestyle disorders are higher in the valley. As per a study, Kashmiris tend to have higher cholesterol levels than their counterparts in Jammu and the valley people are more habitual of smoking.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-cases-jump-in-kashmir-experts-warn-of-collapsing-healthcare-systems-sans-lockdown/story-QogPCwQw2KyQkfWaaTwNHO.html

While a hue and cry was raised that the retaining wall of the approach road had been damaged, National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) officials said only a chute drain was damaged due to heavy rainfall and no damage had been reported to the retaining wall of the bridge. The damaged portion has been repaired, officials said. Social activist Gurnoor Singh, who had highlighted the issue on Thursday, said, “The retaining wall was also damaged as the soil underneath the road eroded. Fortunately, any major tragedy was averted. An inquiry should be marked in the case as the damage has been caused due to the inferior quality material used by the contractor.”NHAI officials however said that it was a minor incident, which is normally reported during monsoon. The rain chutes are established to drain out water from the bridge and rainwater might have eroded the soil underneath the chute, they said.Yogesh Chandra, NHAI project director, said, “No damage was reported to the retaining wall and the rain chute was repaired by Thursday night. The bridge is open for traffic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sherpur-chowk-flyover-crater-in-retaining-wall-repaired-only-rain-chute-damaged-say-nhai-officials/story-SoMjOJfiEd7T2zGrV2bZWJ.html

A detailed order is awaited.The petition filed by Aditya Kashyap and five other students alleges that the varsity has asked them to deposit full semester fee of ₹1.13 lakh by July 10 which was beyond tuition fee. They had submitted that around 50 percent of the same is being charged towards allied fee for campus development fund, moot court fees, examination fee, library and hostel fee even as students are not residing there since March.It was stated that RGNUL is getting huge grants from Punjab and as per records, there is FDR of ₹48 crore available with the varsity. RGNUL waived off rent up to 25 percent to shops, canteen, mess etc, but students are being charged fully along with late fee. However, when approached, the varsity did not take into account the grievance of students, the court was informed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-notice-to-punjab-law-varsity-over-fee-collection/story-SSfoHUf4OZDdVZusKRS86M.html

It is estimated that about 90% of these can be attributed to unsafe water supply, sanitation and hygiene, and is mostly concentrated in developing countries.During monsoons, blockage and overflow of sewage pipes is a major source of contamination of drinking water supply. Further, the resulting stagnant waters act as breeding grounds for mosquitoes leading to increased risks of diseases such as dengue and malaria.Therefore, people should take preventive measures like ensuring that water does not accumulate in and around their houses.Moreover, water storage tanks may be a major source of contamination and their periodic maintenance and disinfection is necessary to preserve water quality. Experts from GADVASU have recommended that the water tanks be sanitised at least twice a year, and water should be periodically tested for the presence of bacteria and other contaminants.In addition, water purifiers or filters installed in houses should be of good quality. There should be proper maintenance of filters that may act as a potential source of microbial contamination of water, if not cleaned properly from time to time.In case of any doubt, the water sample should be got tested from authorised laboratories. Such facility is also available at the school of public health and zoonoses in the university. Thus, a significant amount of disease can be prevented through better access to safe water supply, adequate sanitation facilities and better hygiene practices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hygienic-conditions-necessary-to-prevent-waterborne-diseases-ludhiana-vet-varsity-experts/story-nwuk4hBevToH2rxtbYNuuI.html
10-07-2020||Chandigarh||Readers’ take: With pet care comes responsibility||Officials should be accountableThe administration should build more dog shelters with catcher teams doing rounds of sectors to capture strays and pets that have bitten people previously but are not controlled by the owners. The animals should also be neutered and accountability of officials in charge fixed if the dog population increases and hefty fines imposed on pet owners not following rules. Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, MohaliTrack stray dogsThe UT administration’s new notification on rules and regulations for pet dogs in the city – with a manifold increase in application fee and penalty for non registration of pets and maintenance charges – appears to be a move to generate more revenues by the fund- starved authorities. All the clauses in the notifications pertain to pet dogs and not stray dogs, which actually rule the streets of the city. Most of the pet lovers have got their animals registered, vaccinated and take care of their medical needs through veterinary facilities in and around the city. There are likely be some cases of dog bites by pet dogs, but such occurrences are far and few and mostly stem from disputes between neighbours. The real problem in the city is that of stray dogs and their increasing numbers. Municipal authorities wake up once in a while, when cases of dog bites are repeated and the public makes a hue and cry about it, but things go back to normal once again. The authorities should start tracking all strays by putting collars on them with magnetic chips or GPS like device to keep their numbers under control. Suresh Verma, ChandigarhClean up after pets Making registration of pet dogs compulsory with heavy penalty for those not abiding by the rules is doubtlessly right. It is also advisable that dog owners muzzle the pet and carry bags and scoops to pick up the animal’s excreta. Surprisingly, however, controlling the dog population remains a continuous challenge for the administration.Surinder Paul Wadhwa, Mohali.Pets need to be exercised tooIn revised rules for pets, prohibiting owners from taking pet dogs to parks/gardens/public places I feel is totally unfair to the poor dogs. As much as it’s important for humans to maintain their health, dogs require proper physical exercise daily. If not done so they will develop health issues and anxiety/depression. It can also make them more aggressive. This is denial of their rights. Walking dogs on narrow pavements is difficult due to other pedestrians and sometimes many people are scared of dogs. The solution is with the pet owners who should religiously follow rules by carrying a scoop and disposable bag with them to remove the excreta of the dog and deposit it in the garbage. A leash should be carried to ensure the safety of people in the park. Also, separate timings can be set for allowing dogs into parks. It’s all about co-existence. We can choose to live in harmony with other species and not act selfishly. Prabhjot Kaur Bawa, Chandigarh.More dog shelters pleaseOne needs to be very responsible to own a pet and ensure that the animal causes no harm to others and is well trained. As for strays, they need to be vaccinated so that they do not bite people and expose them to high risk of rabies etc. A separate authority should be set up to look into the matter. Dog shelter homes should be opened by government to provide food and shelter to street dogs. Shweta Kapoor, Ludhiana MC needs more funds, staff to sort out problem The municipal corporation must be given adequate funds and staff to sterilise dogs and eliminate those that attack people. The authorities should also ensure that hospitals are well equipped to deal with increasing dog-bite cases. Dog pounds must be created. Those who wish to adopt young pups can do so from these pounds on reasonable payment. The money thus collected can be used to run these pounds. Human lives are precious and laws should be amended to ensure no one faces the risk of dog attacks.Vijay Malia, ChandigarhPeople need to be trained in pet etiquetteOnly by making the registration of pet dogs compulsory we will not be able to save the tricity from going to hell in a handbasket. As responsible dog owners people should be imparted training in pet etiquette before owning one. Classes should be mandatory and conducted by experts in the field. Stray dogs should not only be caught and sterilised but also sent to shelters. They should not be released at spots where they were caught. Sunil Chopra, LudhianaOwners need to keep pets under controlThere should be strict rules of dog ownership like not letting unleashed dogs out in the open or leaving them alone at home when the owner goes to work or leaves town. It has been seen that often in multistorey housing owners tie up their dogs in a common area or entrance point causing inconvenience to the rest the residents. Fines must be imposed on those who don’t keep their dogs within specified boundaries. The government should ban feeding of stray dogs and ensure the animals are sterilised. Well maintained dog shelters should be set up to ensure that the animals are looked after well in the owners’ absence. A separate cell should be formed to look after the stray dogs and to keep an eye on rule violators. Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliInvolve PETA, RWAs in drives A toll-free number should be set up to help citizens report strays. Regular vaccination campaigns should be undertaken with support from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Strays should be taken to shelters and cared for. Special teams should be allocated sector wise for strict implementation of laws and take the help of RWAs. All rules should be enforced strictly.Priyam Aggarwal, ChandigarhDog lovers should not inconvenience othersA stiff penalty for registering pets will hardly serve the purpose of controlling the dog population. What the MC authorities can do in this scenario, is to stop registering pet dogs if the owner is living in flats or in houses measuring less than 10 marla. Keeping pet dogs is no doubt a noble gesture but it must not inconvenience people. In Manimajra’s Modern Housing Complex about a 100 pet dogs, mostly unregistered are taken out for walks and defecate and urinate regularly in the lanes, but the owners do not bother to clean up after them. SC Luthra, ChandigarhStrays need chips on collars/ID numbersThe bylaws for registration of pet dogs aptly put the onus for their vaccination and training on owners. Pets ‘imprisoned’ in small society-flats should be rescued. Civic authorities must own liability as ‘owner’ of the strays who need identity numbers/chips on collars. There have been instances galore of crowds reacting to or even assaulting staff deputed for corralling stray dogs for sterilisation. They require adequate protection. However, neutering is not enough to contain the dog population that often attacks pedestrians. I have been compelled in the past to rescue a little girl, surrounded by ferocious dogs, crying inconsolably. The elderly too are afraid of going for walks with the strays around. Since the VVIPs are isolated/protected from the strays, they are oblivious of the gravity of the menace. An equitable mix of regular culling and sterilisation of dogs can assure people of their safety.Lalit BharadwajNo anti-rabies vaccines availableThe area around the tricity has no facilities for dog sterilisation, especially in Dera Bassi and Zirakpur, where over 1,200 dog-bite incidents took place last year. Anti-rabies vaccine is normally out of stock in sectors 16, 19, 38(W), Chandigarh, Kharar, Mohali and Dera Bassi hospitals and most clinics. Even the orders of the Punjab governor and Chandigarh administrator of July 12 last year, failed to spur the UT bureaucrats to undertake urgent measures to prevent cases of dog bite. The Panchkula MC has taken the lead by establishing a kennel house in Sukhdarshanpur village, near Barwala, which is a welcome step and the Chandigarh administration should request for permissions to use it, irrespective of the territorial areas of governance. Rajiv Boolchand Jain, Zirakpur, PunjabWhy is admin going after pet dogs?Pet dogs have the right to exercise. Why is the MC going after pets when they have been incompetent in resolving the stray dog menace? In the locality I live in there is a small block with multiple packs of strays which keep breeding even though many of them get killed in accidents or starve to death. There is urgent need to isolate them in shelters and neuter them with a proper adoption programme and care by volunteers. The MC seems to have given up as of now as laws and the present infrastructure is majorly flawed.

10-07-2020||City||As Punjab records 70 dengue cases in 30 days, state may not be prepared for another outbreak||At a time when the state is already grappling with Covid-19 outbreak, the health department is facing yet another challenge — dengue.Punjab has seen 70 dengue cases in the last 30 days, while National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) has recorded 45 cases of malaria in the same period in the state.As monsoon has already hit the region, cases of dengue fever, an illness caused by a viral infection transmitted by the Aedes mosquito, have started creeping up. The disease currently has no cure.“In the last 30 days, 70 people were tested positive for dengue and 45 for malaria. Compared to corresponding period last year, the situation is under control as 120 dengue and 150 malaria cases were reported back then. Nearly 10,400 cases of dengue and 1,100 of malaria were recorded in 2019. Till now, no death due to the illness has occurred in the state,” said Dr Gagandeep Singh Grover, Punjab programme officer for NVBDCP.He added, “Out of the 70 dengue cases, nearly 45 are from Ferozepur district. Most of the malaria cases have been reported from Bathinda, Mohali and Hoshiarpur. No clustering of dengue and malaria has been found in any district and orders have been given to health officials to start surveillance and preparations to handle the outbreak.”As the Punjab health department’s focus right now is combating Covid-19, the state is ill-equipped and not ready to handle yet another outbreak with the limited resources. Since most government hospitals are treating Covid-19 patients, special dengue wards are yet to be set up in most districts. Also, health department officials and civic bodies across the state are yet to start fogging.Besides Apheresis machines, most government hospitals do not have sufficient number of Apheresis medical kits, which are used to treat critical dengue patients.Lockdown measures may also be contributing to increased mosquito larvae in areas such as unmanned construction sites, where pools of stagnant water form due to rains, creating the perfect breeding site for these mosquitoes.Amritsar civil surgeon Dr Navdeep Singh said, “A majority of health officials are assigned Covid-19 related duties, but we will soon call a meeting for checking dengue preparations. We will ask municipal corporations to start fogging at the earliest. Also, we will set up dengue wards in local hospitals where Covid-19 patients are not being treated, to control the outbreak.”When asked about the state’s preparedness against dengue outbreak, Dr Grover said, “It is true that the health department is focusing on controlling coronavirus disease, but preparations are on to handle other diseases. Since most health teams are engaged in Covid-19 duties, we are planning to hire more manpower for dengue control. We have sufficient funds and required equipment has been procured at state headquarters and we will soon distribute them in the districts.”“Also, regular meetings are being conducted and wards have been set up in several areas. We have also prepared 8 to 9 lakh testing slides for malaria and dengue,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-punjab-records-70-dengue-cases-in-30-days-state-may-not-be-prepared-for-another-outbreak/story-WkH6Qs9zbsBFje6sRQfluK.html

10-07-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Part of southern bypass road near Ferozepur road caves in||Five days after a major portion of Kaka Marriage Palace road caved in, a part of the southern bypass road caved-in near Ferozepur road on Friday.No casualty was reported but, a 10-feet long and two-feet wide crater was formed at the spot.Public works department (PWD) officials said the soil underneath the road might have eroded after the city received heavy rainfall over the last few days, causing the road to cave in.PWD superintending engineer Kulwant Singh said, “We have inspected the area and field staff is working to repair the road and it will be done by Saturday.”Chanpreet Singh, a resident of Model Town extension, said, “The condition of roads in the city is deteriorating but authorities are paying no heed to the problem. The administration should find a solution for the problem as roads cave-in every year and lives of commuters are being put at risk.”Waterlogged underpass gives commuters tough timeEven after a day has passed since the city received heavy rainfall, the underpass of the southern bypass below Ferozepur road is still waterlogged.While traffic jams are being witnessed at the site, few vehicles also developed snags in a bid to cross the inundated flyover. A social activist, Gurkaran Tinna, raised the issue on social media on Friday. PWD executive engineer, Davinder Pal said, “The wires of motor pumps installed under the bypass to pump out the rain water have been stolen, due to which we have made temporary arrangements to pump out the water. The pumps can be repaired only after draining out the water and it will take around two days to streamline the situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-part-of-southern-bypass-road-near-ferozepur-road-caves-in/story-3UCfkD42nyVBxxTeVLlPBL.html
10-07-2020||City||Forced to change vocation, local gym owners struggle to make ends meet||Lockdown, loss of income and liabilities are forcing gym owners to change their course of life as they struggle to earn bread and butter for their families. Running their own establishment (gymnasium) in the pre-lockdown period, the owners are now left with no other option but to take up jobs, either permanent or commission-based, to meet the expenses and support their families at this time of crisis. The gym owners’ associations have been protesting against the central government lately, stating that every other sector such as markets, banks, government offices have been opened, but gyms are not under their purview, due to which owners and their staff are struggling to survive.Once an owner, 48-year-old Jagdish now does supervising jobA gym owner in Model Town Extension, 48-year-old Jagdish Singh, who had been running his facility in a rented accomodation for the last 13 years, is now working as a supervisor in a gym machines’ manufacturing unit in Janta Nagar and has to perform odd commission-based jobs for earning a livelihood for his family. “I was running out of ways to stay afloat. I had to find some job for myself as my wife, two children and parents are dependent on me. My younger brother who once worked in the quality control department of a hosiery unit also lost his job in the first two months of the lockdown. Though gyms are closed, we still have to pay school fees, electricity charges and other bills. I also take up commission-based jobs like getting orders for the factory owners so that I could meet the household expenses,” he said. “The government should pay heed to the crisis being faced by gym owners and allow them to open. A middle-class family does not have that much savings on which it can survive such a prolonged lockdown. I had a choice to sell steroids and other gym products to customers like many others are doing, but it is not good for the health of customers, so I chose to look for a job,” Jagdish added. Baljinder is back to square oneSimilar is the plight of Baljinder Singh, 33, who ran a gym in a rented accommodation in Ramgarh village. Now, he has moved back to work as a design engineer in an auto-part manufacturing factory, six years after he had left the job and to pursue his aspirations. “I was shattered after the lockdown was announced and it was extended subsequently. I was fortunate enough to get my job back after six years, but I am forced to work on a meagre salary as compared to what I used to earn through the gymnasium,” he said. “I used to earn profit of around ₹35,000 to ₹40,000 after meeting all my expenses including rent, electricity bill and salaries of staff. But now, I am earning only ₹15,000. After paying the rent of my gym, I am left with only Rs 5,000. I have a family to feed, which includes my parents, a sister, wife and my 18-month-old son. My ailing father, who works as a machine operator in a factory, had to retire this year, but he continued with his job to support me at this time of difficulty,” Baljinder added.He said there were more than 700 gyms in the city and “everyone, including the owners, staffers and trainers, are now struggling in one way or another”. Even if the gyms are allowed to open, the future of this sector will remain bleak, but it will give us a ray of hope and business will slowly come back on track, he added. Till now, no relief has been announced by the government for the gym owners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/forced-to-change-vocation-local-gym-owners-struggle-to-make-ends-meet/story-mwxe4Irj64XFl6wbNMCISI.html

10-07-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab challenges high court order on private school fee payment||Punjab government on Friday challenged the judgment of the high court (HC) in the matter pertaining to payment of school fees for the lockdown period.In a Letter Patents Appeal (LPA), filed under Order 41, Rule 5, read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the state government has sought a stay on the operation of the single judge order and judgement of June 30 “in the interest of justice and fair play.” In the ruling, a single judge of the HC had given relief to the private schools to effectively collect all types of fee irrespective of whether or not it offered online classes.Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had earlier expressed concern over private schools charging fee from students even when no online or offline classes were held in wake of the Covid-19 lockdown. The matter had come up for discussion at Wednesday’s cabinet meeting and advocate general Atul Nanda had been asked to file the LPA in the HC.The LPA points out that the private schools, despite pleading financial hardship and incapacity to meet their expenditures, did not place on record any evidence or material to prove the same. It was further noted that the HC, in its ruling, had completely ignored the fact that the Punjab government had been constrained to issue orders directing private schools to charge only “tuition fee” (in respect of online education provided by them), in order to mitigate the emergent hardship faced by the parents due to the Covid-19 crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-challenges-high-court-order-on-private-school-fee-payment/story-bSCmlV02ENTbXFBv2sEHOP.html
10-07-2020||City||Passport office to handle appointments via video calls||In view of the rising Covid-19 cases, the regional passport office in Ludhiana will be handling enquiry appointments through only WhatsApp video calls. The applicants will no longer have to appear in person for the interview and a four-members team will conduct it via video call. The applicants can send the required documents via email or post. If required the authorities will also verify the documents submitted by the applicant and if any document is found fake, then the applicant will not be considered eligible to get the passport.The passport office in Ludhiana receives a footfall of 4,000 applicants on a daily basis. Regional deputy passport officer Amit Kumar Rawat said, “The idea is to ensure the safety of people and the staff working at the passport office. A dedicated team will handle the enquiry appointment process through video calls and this way public dealing to some extent can be avoided.”“For senior citizens, children and pregnant women who are at a higher risk, we are issuing VIP coupons and conducting the entire process before 9 am, he said. Surinder Singh, an applicant who has recently applied for a passport said, “I have filled the form online yesterday and received a message of appointment for next week. The authorities have also said that they will conduct the interview through video call and asked me to stay home. This is a good move by the passport office.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/passport-office-to-handle-appointments-via-video-calls/story-JtuFgmvP7D7ZvbaLPibuHO.html

Now as the VB was about to bring conclusive results, the probe got transferred to local police which seems to have happened for the first time in the history of Punjab Police.”“I request the CM to personally intervene into the matter and transfer the probe back to the VB or order a judicial probe under the supervision of a sitting judge of the Punjab and Haryana high court,” Aujla said.Social activists and family members of the victims have also shown disapproval over the transfer of probe and claimed that the move was made with a clear motive to give clean chit to the accused.The scam had surfaced in June when at least four patients, who were found positive by the private labs, turned out to be negative in retesting conducted at GMC, Amritsar.The VB had registered a case against four doctors on attempt to murder, fraud, criminal conspiracy and corruption charges on June 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fake-covid-19-reports-row-over-transfer-of-probe-from-vb-to-amritsar-police-deepens/story-6wirR414zV8bzvHedyd4MP.html
10-07-2020||Mumbai||Green ministry confirms faster forest clearances for state agencies||The Union environment ministry has confirmed that it will be easier for state bodies working on national highway projects to garner faster forest clearances.The ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) responded to the Maharashtra forest department’s query, which was received by them on Thursday, said, forest officials.“Contents of the MoRTH letter have been confirmed and ratified by the environment ministry, making this a norm. Those state agencies executing national highway projects on behalf of road transport projects are exempted from the mandate under FC Act,” said Sanjeev Gaur, additional principal chief conservator of forest and nodal officer, Maharashtra forest department.HT reported on Wednesday that the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) had expressed its intention to make it easier for state bodies to garner faster forest clearances on national highway projects. On June 30, MoRTH issued a letter to all state governments informing them agencies like the state public works department working on national highway development projects be exempted from purchasing non-forest land in lieu of forest area being diverted. This is mandatory for state agencies as per the Forest Conservation (FC) Act, 1980. Instead, MoRTH said agencies, working on the Centre’s highway projects, be allowed to carry out compensatory afforestation (CA) on degraded forest land, which applies to certain small projects. MoRTH said the decision was taken in consultation with the Union environment ministry. However, the Maharashtra forest department had asked MoEFCC to clarify and issue formal instructions last week.According to MoEFCC’s annual report 2019-20, released on June 8, 11,467 hectares (ha) of forest land was diverted for non-forest projects between January 1 and November 6, 2019, in India under the FC Act. Of this, 227 were road projects that accounted for the diversion of 1,488 ha.MoEFCC in its letter, which HT reviewed, shared the minutes of the meeting conducted on June 24 including MoEFCC, MoRTH and National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). Since Central bodies like MoRTH and NHAI are already exempted from the rule (purchasing non-forest area for loss of forest cover), state bodies should use the name ‘MoRTH’ as ‘user agency’ while applying for clearances on MoEFCC’s Parivesh portal - a web-based application for monitoring and submission of project proposals. “As the user agency is MoRTH, the dispensation of CA over double the degraded forest land, instead of equivalent non-forest land will be available in such cases,” MoEFCC’s decision said.“This will only help expedite the approval process for forest land diversion and avoid unnecessary delay in identification for transfer of non-forest land for state agencies, which used to stall on-ground work by months before this decision,” said Sanjeev Kumar, chief engineer, MoRTH.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/green-ministry-confirms-faster-forest-clearances-for-state-agencies/story-rsrCJoscGrOQWPAZWjGHyM.html

We began the herbal roads programme in 2018 by making 18 roads (total length 187 km) in the state herbal by planting 6,690 saplings. Then the following year, a total of 16,029 saplings were planted on 53 roadsides (total length 311 km). This time the programme will be replicated in all the 175 PWD divisions of the state,” said deputy chief minister and PWD minister, Keshav Prasad Maurya in a statement.The department is planting Mashaparni (Blue Wiss), Saptparni (Seven Leaf tree), Ratnajot (Jatropha), Sahjan (Drumstick tree), Mentha, Lemon Grass, Bhringraj (False Daisy), kapur (Camphor), Brahmi, Aonla (Indian Gooseberry), Harsingar (Night Jasmine), Mandukparni (Spade Leaf), Vach (Flag Root), Giloy, Sindwar (Chaste tree), Tulsi, Ashwagandha, turmeric and several others plants and shrubs. All these plants have varied medicinal uses.“After this year’s drive ends, nearly 1,300 km of roads in UP would become herbal roads and the total length of the herbal green belt would be 2,600 km as it would stretch on both sides of the roads,” said a PWD officer.At least one road in each district would become a herbal road and all saplings that require protection from animals would have tree-guards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-speeds-up-herbal-belt-project/story-AUMK1FwXX19uCD7B9fkOaI.html

We will contest the anticipatory bail if Saini applies for it after the police add Section 302 (murder) of IPC or any other criminal charge in the FIR.”Multani, an employee of the Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation, was allegedly picked up by two officers in 1991 after a terrorist attack on Saini, the then Chandigarh SSP. Four cops in his security posse had been killed in the attack. Police later claimed that Multani had escaped from the custody of the Qadian police. The case was registered against Saini on May 6 this year. Multani’s brother, Palwinder, who is the complainant in the case, had filed for transfer of the case from the court of ADJ Monika Goyal citing unfair and biased trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/multani-disappearance-case-give-3-day-notice-to-saini-before-adding-murder-charges-in-fir-mohali-court-tells-police/story-9f4AItU5XIC5GsW2t2rNFK.html

In an earlier hearing on June 30, Choudhary had submitted that in light of Supreme Court directions to decongest jails to avoid the spread of the coronavirus among inmates and in light of her comorbid condition Bharadwaj had sought interim bail before the special NIA court but it was refused on May 29, hence she approached the HC.The NIA had however submitted that Bharadwaj was using her co-morbid condition and the SC directions as an excuse to get bail as the UAP Act under which she is booked did not have provision for bail. The NIA had assured the court that Bharadwaj was getting proper medical facilities in the jail and was also provided with the medication she had been taking since 20 years and hence her application should be rejected.On Friday, after the state reiterated the submissions of NIA in the previous hearing, the court sought to know from the authorities the conditions of inmates in the jail. The court directed the prison authorities and state to submit an affidavit regarding enlisting the condition of inmates in Byculla women’s prison and posted the matter for hearing on July 17.Bharadwaj along with five others had been arrested by Pune police in August 2018 on her alleged role in the Elgar Parishad event after which violence broke out during Bhima Koregaon programme and resulted in the death of one and left several persons injured. Pune police alleged that Bharadwaj along with other activists which included Arun Ferreira, Varavara Rao, Surendra Gadling, Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, Shoma Sen, Gautam Navlakha, Dr Anand Teltumbde and Mahesh Raut were working of the banned CPI (Maoist) group and had conspired and instigated the people which led to the violence at Bhima Koregaon on January 1, 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-hc-seeks-details-of-jail-where-sudha-bharadwaj-is-lodged/story-bgtOMlRNaNjS23ixCAKbkM.html

10-07-2020||Chandigarh||‘Offence serious’: CBI court denies bail to suspended SHO Jaswinder Kaur||A special CBI court on Saturday dismissed the anticipatory bail application of suspended Jaswinder Kaur, who is accused in a graft case. Stating that Kaur, being a public servant, has been charged with an offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, which is a serious crime, the court dismissed her application.The CBI in its reply to the bail plea has sought her thorough custodial interrogation to unearth the “larger conspiracy”.“At this point of time, when the investigation is in progress, very clinching and important material has been pointed out by the learned public prosecutor appearing for the CBI,” said Sushil Kumar Garg, special judge, CBI.He observed that the telephonic conversation on record spoke for itself, subject to the verification of its authenticity in the course of the investigation. As on date, there is no reason for me to disbelieve the case put up by the complainant.“It would be too far-fetched for this court to take the view that the accused, Jaswinder Kaur, has been falsely involved in the offence… the allegations levelled (by Kaur) do not inspire any confidence, yet the materials on record do prima facie indicate her involvement,” the court held.The Manimajra SHO, along with an alleged conduit, Bhagwan Singh, was booked under Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 7 and 7A of the Prevention of Corruption Act on June 29 on charges of seeking Rs 5 lakh bribe from a Manimajra resident, Gurdeep Singh. Gurdeep had told the CBI that he had already paid Rs 2 lakh to Jaswinder for not lodging a cheating case against him and was to pay Rs 3 lakh more.Fearing arrest, Kaur had filed an anticipatory bail application in the CBI court on Thursday. SHO’S CONTENTIONClaiming false implication, Kaur had said that the amount recovered was actually compromise money and not bribe.She had said that as part of the compromise done on June 21, Gurdeep was to refund Rs 28 lakh to one Randhir Singh, who had accused the former of duping him, his wife and one Narpinder Singh, all residents of Sangrur, on pretext of providing them government jobs.A compromise document was signed by Gurdeep, Randhir, Narpinder, and the mediator, Bhagwan Singh, following which a DDR entry was made about this.CBI’S RESPONSEIn its reply to the bail application, the CBI said the SHO took Gurdeep’s signatures under pressure on a blank paper and the compromise was written on it later.One of the constables, Sarabjeet Singh, even revealed this in his statement before the judicial magistrate. The CCTV footage of Manimajra police station from June 21 corroborated Sarabjit’s statement.The CBI also stated that Kaur “deliberately and intentionally absconded” despite being asked twice to join the investigation.“She was informed in person by CBI team, which conducted search at her house in Zirakpur to join investigation at CBI Office, Sector 30A, on June 30. She was also informed telephonically in the morning of June 30, to attend the CBI office at 12pm. But she deliberately and intentionally absconded and did not join investigation in order to avoid confrontation with accused Bhagwan Singh,” the investigating agency said.CBI stated that she even created false evidence in a DDR at the Manimajra police station that she had returned from CBI Office, Sector 30.“If she was not having any role, she should have joined the investigation at the first instance, but she did not do so and in fact absconded,” the CBI stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/offence-serious-cbi-denies-bail-to-suspended-sho-jaswinder-kaur/story-9dpJ6ktQTQM8nB2rJ1oodK.html

10-07-2020||City||HC refuses to stay Haryana govt’s notification on crop diversification||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday refused to stay a government notification asking gram panchayats in some parts of Haryana not to sow paddy on the village common land.The high court bench of justice Rajiv Sharma and justice HS Sidhu directed the Haryana government to take steps to revive, preserve and conserve water bodies in the state and boost the re-charge mechanism for the protection of these water bodies.The order came on the plea of Jasbir Singh and others from Kurukshetra who had challenged the May 20 orders of principal secretary, development and panchayat department and subsequent orders of deputy commissioner, Kurukshetra, asking panchayats not to sow paddy on village common land. The orders were issued for implementation of crop diversification under the scheme ‘Mera Paani Meri Virasat’ and prohibited panchayats from cultivating paddy and raising nursery in agricultural fields. “There is over exploitation of groundwater leading to grave threat to aquifers of Indo-Gangetic plains due to excessive/intensive pumping of water. There will be rapid desertification of fertile land leading to dust storms blowing away the top soil,” the bench said, adding that the excessive exploitation of ground water is a threat to environment and ecology. The bench lauded the steps taken by the state government on diversification of crops. It, however, said the aquifers are “over stressed/extremely stressed” and if the remedial measures are not taken, it will lead to classification of certain over exploited blocks/zones as “dark zones”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-refuses-to-stay-haryana-govt-s-notification-on-crop-diversification/story-cV28tBuUGxesw6lm0Amd7I.html

10-07-2020||City||Consider district-level regulatory authority to deal with unscrupulous travel agents: HC to Haryana||The Punjab and Haryana high court has suggested the Haryana government to consider a regulatory authority in each district to check cheating cases by unscrupulous travel agents.The high court bench of justice Arun Monga requested the home secretary and the director general of police to have a meeting to explore the possibility of preventing illegal immigration/human trafficking. “..they may constitute some kind of regulatory body and/or nominate an officer in every district who would have to necessarily issue an accreditation certificate as a pre-requisite to every agent claiming to be in business of immigration/naturalization and/or offering overseas jobs to the public at large in their state,” the bench said, adding that accredited agents list can be uploaded on the website so that a background check can be carried out on their genuineness/credentials, before anyone hires their services.The order came on the bail plea of a travel agent, who was accused of sending a Kurukshetra resident abroad illegally for an amount of ₹20 lakh. The court termed the content of the FIR ‘no less chilling and shuddering than a goosebumps giving’ and observed that factual narrative of the FIR and the ordeal suffered by the complainant, is a sordid tale on how unscrupulous immigration agents deceive gullible Indians who are aspirants of overseas jobs.As per the FIR, the agent took ₹10 lakh from the complainant and the remaining money was to be paid on his successful arrival in USA. The complainant reached South America instead of the United States. He was made to take a flight from Delhi to Sao Paulo in Brazil and then to Ecuador (South America). He travelled from Ecuador in a bus to Columbia (South America) and then by sailing in a boat to Capurgana (Colombia).There he was bunched with illegal immigrants, who then trekked the thick forests of Panama (Central America), where they stayed for five days and another 24 days in an army camp before travelling to Nicaragua (Central America) and onward to Honduras (Central America) from where he was taken to Mexico for entering the United States of America. When the complainant reached the USA, he was arrested in California for illegally entering the country and lodged in a jail in Georgia. For ten months, he continued to languish in Georgia prison but due to Covid-19 outbreak and was deported to plug the community spread of coronavirus infection in jails. The FIR was lodged after his return to India in May this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/consider-district-level-regulatory-authority-to-deal-with-unscrupulous-travel-agents-hc-to-haryana/story-m8fCsSj43gxTKfdZzeGngP.html

10-07-2020||Chandigarh||Christian Medical College, Ludhiana, starts testing for bleeding disorder caused by low levels of clotting protein||Ludhiana: Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), Ludhiana, has announced the started testing to diagnose patients suffering from a bleeding disorder called von Willebrand disease (VWD).VWD is the commonest form of bleeding disorder in the world with a prevalence of 1 in 100 people. Though most of this are milder forms, patients may not get diagnosed. This occurs equally in males and females and 95% of females having this disease, present with menorrhagia or heavy menstrual loss. Due to the lack of availability of this test, few patients have been diagnosed.Dr William Bhatti, director, CMC, said that he is “delighted that this test is now available in Ludhiana”. Earlier, patients had to be referred to Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), as it was the only other institution having this facility in North India.TRAINING AND ACCURATE DIAGNOSISDr Poojitha Byreddy and Markas Masih from the clinical haematology department, were sent to CMC, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, for training, before the Covid-19 lockdown.On their return, they mastered the techniques to establish the procedure at CMC, Ludhiana, over the past few months. The lab is now able to perform von Willebrand’s antigen test and RiCof on an automated platform. The two tests are important to diagnose this disease.It is important to process the sample immediately and maintain below freezing temperatures, to analyse the samples in bulk. Sending the unprocessed samples, in room temperature, to outstation private labs is not a suitable alternative.The VWD patients can also be often misdiagnosed as mild haemophilia A. This facility will accurately diagnose and give the necessary treatments.Dr Kavita Bhatti, head of the gynaecology department, said this disorder is under diagnosed in India, which has a significant impact on the health and socio-economic status of affected patients, especially post-pubertal females.Medical superintendent Dr Anil Luther termed it a welcome addition on the 10th year of establishing the comprehensive haemophilia care set-up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/christian-medical-college-ludhiana-starts-testing-for-bleeding-disorder-caused-by-low-levels-of-clotting-protein/story-6Y6bgWODGhJ2RpXN2QugyH.html

10-07-2020||Chandigarh||Central University of Punjab, Bathinda, cancels exams after hackers access question bank||Bathinda: Central University of Punjab (CUP), Bathinda, has cancelled 13 exams held from July 6-8 after it found that its question bank had been hacked.Vice-chancellor RK Kohli said on Friday that the system was found compromised on Wednesday and all 13 exams conducted from July 6-8 were cancelled. “Teachers have been asked to prepare question papers for all subjects and new dates of tests will be announced soon,” he said.Kohli said the matter came to light after a few faculty members and his office received an email from an unknown person, claiming that the question bank had been hacked. “The email was sent from ProtonMail, an end-to-end encrypted and paid email service, where a link was given. Clicking on it gives access to all questions. It is a serious matter and a police complaint was lodged on Thursday,” the vice-chancellor said.According to police sources, ProtonMail is a highly sophisticated cyber platform where it is difficult to identify the email sender.In view of the Covid-19 outbreak, the university had decided to conduct examinations online where only the schedule was released and students had the flexibility to choose dates to write their tests while sitting at home.ONLINE MODE ADOPTED DUE TO PANDEMICUniversity sources said the unidentified email sender had stated that the “online examination application (developed by CUP) is faulty and a number of students were unable to sit for the test”.However, faculty members said the online mode of examination was optional for students and most of them had enrolled for it.Previously, the exams were conducted on the campus by using intranet. To facilitate students during the pandemic, this year the online mode was adopted by the CUP.The university administration said two mock exams were conducted successfully to check firewall efficiency.The vice-chancellor said that to upload question papers, online access to the question bank was given to teachers. The system was password-enabled but it was compromised at some unknown level, he added.10 STUDENTS FROM ONE STATESCORED EXCEPTIONALLY WELLInterestingly, the university administration has zeroed down on a group of 8-10 students from a particular state who secured exceptionally well in the semester tests conducted on the first three days.“It was found that these students had average marks in the previous semesters but in this session of online exams, they scored more than 92%, much higher than other students. We have shared these details with the police for cyber scrutiny of the matter,” Kohli said.Registrar Kanwar Pal Singh Mundra had earlier stated that a mock test was successful and out of 500 students, about 400 had participated from home without much difficulty.Deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Aswant Dhaliwal, the investigating officer, said the police is probing the matter from all angles and are checking if the hacker is associated with the university or a trained individual or a part of a team behind the crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/central-university-of-punjab-bathinda-cancels-exams-after-hackers-access-question-bank/story-QZ91rYPf7Gdvxx2lfuMtEP.html

10-07-2020||Noida||SC disposes plea seeking release of Noida ex-engineer||The Supreme Court Friday disposed of a plea seeking release of Noida’s former chief engineer Yadav Singh from alleged illegal custody of the CBI in a corruption case after being informed that the Allahabad High Court has already granted him bail on Thursday.A bench of Justices R F Nariman, Navin Sinha and B R Gavai recorded the statement of Singh’s lawyers on the high court bail order and said the petition has now become infructuous and disposed of the matter.A division bench of the high court had granted the bail while hearing a habeas corpus (produce the detained person before court) petition seeking Singh’s release from the alleged illegal CBI custody.The CBI counsel had told the high court Wednesday that the delay in filing of charge sheet was not intentional as courts were closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.Rejecting the argument, the high court said the probe agency’s claim was not justified, and directed that the petitioner be set free forthwith on fulfilling the conditions to be laid down by the special court.The top court had on July 8 asked the high court to decide the plea seeking release of Singh and pass appropriate orders.Singh, former chief maintenance engineer in Noida, is in judicial custody since February 11, 2020 after the CBI arrested him in the third case of corruption registered against him on January 17, 2018.His son, Sunny, had approached the Lucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court with a habeas corpus petition alleging that Yadav Singh has been wrongly incarcerated as only 60 days of judicial custody is permissible under Section 167 (2) of Code of Criminal Procedure and that the duration expired on April 10, 2020.Sunny contended that the CBI failed to file charge sheet within the statutory period of 60 days but the trial court rejected the prayer for default bail.On May 6, the Lucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court has “dismissed as withdrawn” the habeas corpus petition seeking Singh’s release as the CBI raised objections on the court’s territorial jurisdiction but granted liberty to the petitioner to move a fresh petition before its principal bench.Besides the latest corruption case wherein Yadav Singh is accused of favouring companies of his friends and associates in doling out lucrative contracts in Noida, the CBI had booked him in two other corruption cases.These cases pertain to misusing his official position to favour firms in awarding contracts worth over Rs 1,000 crore in Noida and amassing illegitimate assets worth over Rs 23 crore.The agency had produced 62-year old Yadav Singh before the Ghaziabad Special court after his arrest which sent him to judicial custody. His bail petition was rejected by the special court on April 17, 2020.Before the Lucknow bench of the High Court, the CBI had contended that the territorial jurisdiction over Ghaziabad Special court is of Allahabad High Court hence, the matter should be heard by it and not by its Lucknow Bench. The agency had also argued that there was no question of illegal detention as the accused was produced before the special court which remanded him to judicial custody. It said the accused was not in CBI custody.During the course of enquiry, the agency had found that he had allegedly favoured five companies belonging to his friends, associates and family members in awarding huge contracts in Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/sc-disposes-plea-seeking-release-of-noida-ex-engineer/story-5pOkyDUO9L3HzsvTo7xm2I.html
10-07-2020||Chandigarh||Swiss govt issues notices for sharing of bank details of Haryana Congress leader Kuldeep Bishnoi, wife||New Delhi/Berne: Switzerland government has issued public notices for sharing of details with India about Swiss bank accounts and other financial assets of Congress leader Kuldeep Bishnoi and his wife Renuka following receipt of an “administrative assistance”request from the Indian authorities.The Bishnois have been asked to reply within 10 days to exercise their right to appeal against sharing of information as per the Swiss laws, according to two notices published in Switzerland’s latest federal gazette, dated July 7, in Berne.Similar notices have also been issued for Grande Maison Ltd and Hollyport Ltd -- two British Virgin Islands-based companies suspected to have links with the Bishnoi family.Both the companies were incorporated on the same day on July 19, 1996, and also figured in the Panama Papers, a leaked list of entities based in tax havens. According to official records, both the companies were struck off from the registry of companies in April 2016 after remaining inactive since August 2014.Repeated queries sent by PTI to Bishnoi, a sitting MLA in the Haryana assembly, and his office remained unanswered.In the notices, Bishnoi, his wife and the two firms were asked to appoint a representative within 10 days to assert their right to be heard against the “administrative assistance” proposed by Switzerland’s Federal Tax Administration.Such assistance includes sharing of banking and other details of the individual or the company having accounts with banks or other financial institutions in Switzerland.While the notices did not disclose any details about the probe, such notices are typically issued by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration after receipt of a request by a foreign jurisdiction along with prima facie evidence of suspected tax evasion or other financial wrongdoings.If the person or company fails to provide a valid reason against the administrative assistance, the details are subsequently shared by the tax department with the requesting authority.While an automatic exchange of information framework is in place between India and Switzerland since last year, sharing of details for older cases also takes place under the mutual “administrative assistance” pact between the two countries on submission of a request along with satisfactory prima-facie evidence of financial wrongdoings.FACING PROBE BY IT DEPARTMENTBishnoi has been facing probe by multiple agencies including the income tax department, which had conducted raids at various places linked to him in July last year.The tax department had also attached a five-star hotel in a prime business area of Gurugram, while designating that as a ‘benami’ or unaccounted property of the Bishnoi family. It was alleged at that time that the shareholding in the hotel was routed through a front entity registered in British Virgin Islands.The tax department had also said in August 2019 that foreign assets worth over Rs 200 crore allegedly linked to Bishnoi and his family were detected and being probed.At that time, the Congress had alleged that the tax department’s move was politically motivated ahead of assembly elections in the state.Bishnoi, the son of former Haryana chief minister Bhajan Lal, eventually won the election from the state’s Adampur assembly seat in October 2019.The tax department had also said that foreign holdings of Bishnoi and his family had “remained hidden for decades” under complex multi-layered structures through companies located in countries such as the British Virgin Islands, Panama, the UK and the UAE.“These structures have involved various front men and corporations across continents,” it had said, while alleging that the black money generated in India was stashed abroad in the form of lavish properties in the names of foreign trusts and companies located in tax havens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/swiss-govt-issues-notices-for-sharing-of-bank-details-of-haryana-congress-leader-kuldeep-bishnoi-wife/story-Ez7UDQ4n2NHzEn0cXEtmBN.html

10-07-2020||Bangalore||Air pollution increases risk of Covid-19, deaths: Study||Air pollution in Bengaluru is linked to the loss of an estimated 6,300 lives in the first half of 2020 and 3.7 per cent decline in the city’s annual GDP despite strictly enforcing COVID-19 related lockdown, a study has revealed.According to a new online tool by IQAir AirVisual and Greenpeace-Southeast Asia, research shows that long-term air pollution exposure increases the risk of severe COVID-19 infections and death. “Air pollution in Bengaluru is linked to the loss of an estimated 6,300 lives in the first half of 2020 despite a strict COVID-related lockdown,” the two organisations claimed in a statement. It is also revealed that air pollution took a major toll on the citys economy at a cost of approximately Rs 6,973 crore over the last six months, an equivalent of 3.7% of Bengalurus total annual GDP, the statement said. The study claimed that the health damage from air pollution is expected to cost 1-5.8% of cities GDP in the major metropolitan cities of the world in the first half of this year. Of all the 28 cities studied, Delhi bears the highest economic cost of air pollution as a percentage of GDP due to the impacts of PM2.5 and NO2 pollution. While some cities have seen a temporary return of blue skies as a result of COVID-19 related restrictions, these gains were reversed as soon as lockdowns ended, the organisations observed. “... Chronic air pollution exposure is associated with diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic lung disease. Patients with these conditions are at a greater risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19,” they claimed. The study observed that it is more important than ever that investments are directed towards green, just and sustainable sectors of society. “Now is the time for a rapid shift away from polluting fossil fuels for our health, community, and for our economies, Greenpeace India’s Avinash Chanchal was quoted as saying.

10-07-2020||Delhi||Unlock education: College students turn teachers for underprivileged kids||Absence of physical classes, delayed examination, and the perpetual anxiety of future is making many youngsters worried. But some youngsters, when made to stay indoors during the lockdown, chose to channelise their energies via internet and educate the underprivileged kids. Involved in social welfare, these youngsters are from Delhi University and other varsities, across India. These college students are volunteers of a project, Teach From Home, which is an initiative of the not-for-profit organisation, World Youth Council (WYC), and aims to provide quality education to slum kids. Urvashi Goyal, founder of WYC, says, “Each volunteer dedicatedly teaches one to four children at a time, giving them the much needed individual support and guidance, for at least three days in a week. We have around 3,000 volunteers with us pan India.” Mehak Garg, a student of Lady Shri Ram College, DU, says, “When the lockdown started, the situation was obviously bleak, and as a college student I was stressed about my future and further studies. Then I came across this project and soon it turned into a ray of hope for me. It helped me realise that even in this situation I can help people in my own way. I started as a volunteer, and now I’m managing a whole project. The programme has helped me realise how technology can be used to help the underprivileged students get access to quality, continued education, even in these trying times. It feels so good!” Most college students associated with this initiative say that they took up the volunteering work since they want to give back to the society. And in the process, everyone has gained a unique experience. “Being involved in this project increased my productivity during lockdown,” says Diya Padhi, a student of Dyal Singh College, DU, adding, “Never thought that teaching underprivileged children would be so much fun! They are extremely talented, and never made me feel that I was miles away from them. I could feel the warmth and respect from their side whenever I taught the class. And being part of this initiative also improved my communication skills, and made me realise that it’s our responsibility to work for the betterment of the society.”“Being part of this initiative has also improved my communication skills, and made me realise that it’s our responsibility to work for the betterment of the society.”  – Diya Padhi, student, Dyal Singh College The project that started this April has now 2,000 volunteers imparting education to 2,500 children through online mediums such as Google Meet, WhatsApp and YouTube. Manika Katyal, another student of Lady Shri Ram College, says, “My experience has so far been really amazing. I’ve always been passionate about teaching. Interacting with students is therapeutic for me and adds bliss to my day, and these classes have given me so much experience as well.”The school students who are able to learn due to this project are elated to meet their young educators through internet. Ritika, a 16-year-old Delhiite who studies in class XII, says, “I was not able to attend school during the lockdown, but now I get to learn a lot in these classes. Online classes have benefited me a lot. I like my online teachers because they are very cool, may be because they are in college.”Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/unlock-education-college-students-turn-teachers-for-underprivileged-kids/story-ZfrFzDHhVSOi1BlV1T3PgN.html

10-07-2020||City||Dialysis patients oppose move to turn Kalyan hospital into Covid-19 facility||More than 200 dialysis patients of Dr CB Vaidya Memorial Hospital in Kalyan (West) have opposed Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation’s (KDMC’s) decision to use the hospital as a Covid-19 facility from Thursday. KDMC additional commissioner Sunil Pawar said, ”We directed our patients to other hospitals, but they complained of lack of proper treatment. We will inquire into it and take the necessary steps if required.” Several dialysis patients as well as residents living nearby, gathered outside the private hospital on Thursday and questioned how non-Covid patients, especially those undergoing dialysis, will seek treatment now, while the residents were worried to have a Covid-19 hospital in their area.“The decision to take over the hospital for the treatment of Covid-19 patients left us completely clueless about our treatments. One patient was discharged a few days back and asked to undergo treatment at another hospital in Dombivli but died owing to lack of proper treatment. There are more than 200 dialysis and chemotherapy patients in the hospital. Now they all have to seek treatment elsewhere,” said Vidya Fadtale, 47, a dialysis patient, who was undergoing treatment at the hospital from the past three years.Locals also met KDMC officials as well as Thane collector, Kalyan parliamentarian Shrikant Shinde and other local politicians over the issue. Around 16 societies from the area sent a letter to civic body chief Vijay Suryavanshi with their signatures explaining their fears over turning the hospital into a Covid-19 facility. In a letter written to the civic body chief, residents said Tilak chowk houses around 20,000 people and the roads in the area are very narrow.“If ambulances keep visiting the area, it will be very difficult for residents to step out. We all are in a state of panic as the hospital has been taken over for Covid-19 patients. There are several hospitals in the city which are not located in residential areas and have better facilities. The civic body should choose such hospitals for Covid care, “said Nitin Paudwal, 51, a resident of Shrikant building in Tilak Chowk.Kalyan doctors’ army spokesperson Prashant Patil said, “KDMC health department officials along with a microbiologist conduct a thorough survey before a hospital is finalised to be used as a Covid-19 facility. They check if the hospital has the facility and the necessary manpower and then give a nod.”KDMC recorded 580 Covid-19 cases on Thursday, taking the total number of cases to 10,931. The six deaths reported on Thursday took the fatalities to 164.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dialysis-patients-oppose-move-to-turn-kalyan-hospital-into-covid-19-facility/story-6TfZAxchS8shgLPXoYSguM.html

10-07-2020||Mumbai||Biologists urge CBSE to reconsider deletion of chapters on evolution and ecology||Two days after the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) announced its decision to reduce 30% of its curriculum due to disruption in academic activities owing to Covid-19 pandemic, the Indian Society of Evolutionary Biologists (ISEB) on Thursday released a statement expressing concern that chapters on evolution and ecology from biology curricula for Classes 10 to 12 was dropped for the academic year 2020-21.Members of ISEB, which is based out of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research-Mohali, said detailed knowledge in diverse areas of ecology and evolution — species interactions, population dynamics, transmission dynamics of pathogens — is required to understand every aspect of a zoonotic pandemic including the Covid-19 outbreak that the world is currently facing.“Public health in general leans very heavily on many aspects of evolution and ecology, including human ecology, in addition to classical medical science,” reads the statement by ISEB executive council.As part of the reduction, entire chapters on the living world (systematics), reproduction in organisms, evolution, ecosystem, and environmental issues from the biology syllabus will be removed.“This pandemic has tragically highlighted the consequences of our neglect of evolution and ecology in school and higher education in India…A direct consequence of our neglect of ecology and evolution is the relative paucity of epidemiologists in India. This renders the removal of most of evolution and ecology, including systematics and the diversity of life not only dangerously tragic, but ironic as well,” reads the statement.ISEB has appealed to the board to reconsider the deletion of entire chapters on ecology and evolution, and instead “trim advanced sub-topics from most chapters across the curriculum”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/biologists-urge-cbse-to-reconsider-deletion-of-chapters-on-evolution-and-ecology/story-cWOkemhMjTKdyPTgs3g3VN.html
10-07-2020||Mumbai||State brings Maratha-linked bodies under deputy CM Pawar||After aggressive reactions and agitations from the Maratha community, the state government on Thursday brought two institutions related to their welfare under direct control of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and also released ₹7.95 crore towards pending fellowships of students from the community.The state also announced restoration of autonomy of Sarthi (Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research, Training and Human Development Institute), the institute established for educational, social and financial development of the community.Community members had held agitations across the state, demanding adequate financial assistance to Sarthi and restoration of its autonomy. They had also raised doubts whether the government was intending to shut the institute down. After their differences with Bahujan Kalyan minister Vijay Wadettiwar over releasing funds to Sarthi last week, Pawar convened a meeting with them at Mantralaya on Thursday. Besides Pawar and Wadettiwar, minority development minister Nawab Malik attended the meeting with community leader and BJP MP Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje, Rajendra Kondhare and Vinayak Mete, among others.Pawar, in a press conference after the meeting, announced the release of the dues of old funds meant for Sarthi with immediate effect. “Sarthi is governed by the Bahujan Kalyan department, while the Annasaheb Patil Financial Development Corporation is controlled by the skill development corporation. We have decided to bring both of them under the planning department for better management of funds. The autonomy of Sarthi will be restored soon as these decisions get the formal nod from the cabinet,” Pawar said. Kondhare said, “Students from the community appearing for UPSC, MPSC and banking exams are funded by Sarthi, besides the fellowship given to PhD and MPhil students. The funds meant for these expenditures were not released by the government, leading to hardship of students. There were a few misconceptions among Maratha leaders about the functioning of the government. We are happy that all our demands were admitted by the government.”A few community members resorted to sloganeering during the meeting as Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje, who is a direct descendant of Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji, was allegedly made to sit in the third row. An organisation representing the community also started an agitation in Aurangabad over the “humiliating treatment” meted out to their leader. The MP later clarified the agitation was out of misunderstanding and he was satisfied with government decisions.Box A day after five Shiv Sena corporators from Parner municipal council in Ahmednagar district returned to their party on Wednesday, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said their induction in the NCP was done out of misunderstanding. “During my tour to Baramati, I was introduced to the corporators by our local MLA Nilesh Lanke, saying they were independent corporators and wanted to join our party. Believing the MLA, I formally welcomed them by making them wear scarves with the party symbol. When I learnt that they were elected representatives of the Sena, I realised my mistake and decided to send them back to their party,” he said on Thursday.Pawar said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray did not say anything to him and he shares cordial relations with his boss in the cabinet. Pawar said the corporators were planning to join the BJP. He also said that it has been decided not poach to workers from among the ruling parties.The defection had led to tension between the Sena and NCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-brings-maratha-linked-bodies-under-deputy-cm-pawar/story-kjnyL8Exq2UEN5YMnmAZjO.html
10-07-2020||Mumbai||Nirupam raises doubts over Uddhav land deal for new bungalow; Sena rubbishes it||Congress leader and former Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam on Thursday sought an investigation into the deal for the plot for Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray’s new bungalow opposite Matoshree at Kala Nagar in Bandra. The Shiv Sena has rubbished the allegations.Nirupam alleged that Rajbhushan Dixit, who sold the plot for Matoshree, has been facing probes by the Central Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement Directorate in money laundering cases. “The plot opposite Matoshree and in the close vicinity of Bandra-Kurla Complex was bought just for ₹5.8 crore in 2016. There is possibility of a cash transaction besides the cheque payment of ₹5.8 crore. Such a prime plot could not be sold for such a low price. I am not saying there was anything wrong in the deal, but just drawing the attention of the central agencies to it,” he said.Dixit is one of the directors of Sterling Biotech, which has been accused of money laundering to the tune of ₹14,000 crore. Shiv Sena’s South Mumbai MP Arvind Sawant said: “Nirupam is not taken seriously even in his own party. Why should we pay heed to what he says? He is not toeing his own party line and the stand taken by party leader Rahul Gandhi. He should not forget that the Sena gave him his political break by making him an MP. Secondly, the land deals in Mumbai are linked to the existing ready reckoner rates. What is there to investigate?” Nirupam had opposed the Congress’s joining hands with the Sena in the state. After his removal as the Mumbai unit chief in March 2019, the leader has not been very active in the party’s affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/nirupam-raises-doubts-over-uddhav-land-deal-for-new-bungalow-sena-rubbishes-it/story-Mt0vTRcUD8aQSVYGjgAtHM.html
10-07-2020||Mumbai||Yes Bank scam: ED attaches ₹2,600-crore properties of DHFL and Rana Kapoor||Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials on Thursday attached properties worth ₹2,600 crore belonging to Rana Kapoor and Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited’s (DHFL) Dheeraj and Kapil Wadhawan in connection with the ₹3,642-crore Yes Bank money laundering case. Among these were apartments in Mumbai owned by Kapoor and two land parcels in Pune owned by the Wadhawans. Director of ED, SK Mishra has confirmed the development.Altogether, properties with a current market value of ₹1,200 crore, belonging to Kapoor; and properties worth approximately ₹1,400 crore belonging to DHFL, have been attached by ED so far. “The properties include 12 apartments and land parcels in New York, London, Australia, Mumbai, Delhi and Pune,” said an ED official on condition of anonymity. The attachment drive is likely to continue as more properties of the accused are under scanner, the ED official added. Kapoor is the co-founder and former managing director of Yes Bank. Dheeraj and Kapil Wadhawans are promoters of DHFL.ED has attached 12 flats in Khar; one flat in New York; two flats in London; property in Australia, two land parcels in Pune and Mulshi; five luxury vehicles and 344 bank accounts belonging to the Wadhawans and others. The valuation of these assets is worth ₹1,411.9 crore. The agency has also attached a building at Cumballa Hill, three duplex apartments at Nepean Sea Road, a flat at Nariman Point, eight flats in Worli and a bungalow in New Delhi’s Amrita Shergill Marg, all of which are owned by Kapoor and others.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had registered a case on March 7, in connection with suspicious loans granted by Yes Bank and an alleged arrangement between Kapoor and Wadhwans. Kapoor is being probed for suspected money laundering using over 100 shell companies and for engendering massive non-performing assets (NPAs), which led to a moratorium on Yes Bank by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).Kapoor was arrested on March 8 after ED charged him with money laundering. Kapoor also allegedly bought debentures worth ₹3,700 crore of DHFL, which have not been redeemed till date and against which the Wadhawans allegedly paid a kickback of ₹600 crore to Kapoor, in the form of a loan to a company registered to Kapoor’s daughters. The loan was given against properties whose value was shown to be ₹750 crore even though their market value was ₹40 crore.ED has alleged that during his tenure, Kapoor sanctioned loans worth ₹30,000 crore out which accounts worth ₹20,000 crore have turned into NPAs. Kapoor also allegedly accepted illegal gratification while granting loans and money was diverted through these companies. In a charge sheet filed on May 6, ED said, “Kapoor, with an intent to create an elaborate ecosystem for diversion and laundering of funds, had created multiple entities in India and abroad. These companies were acting as a vehicle of money laundering and placement of funds, and the family members and close associates were put in as directors of these firms.”The charge sheet – filed against Kapoor, his wife Bindu, daughters Rakhee, Roshni and Radha along with entities allegedly associated – pegged the fraud at ₹5,050 crore. The agency had also provisionally attached 59 expensive paintings, including one by artist MF Husain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yes-bank-scam-ed-attaches-2-600-crore-properties-of-dhfl-and-rana-kapoor/story-wKXSCPVK3CszfsxUHcHweO.html

Also, as prescribed, most of the passengers already carry these items with them,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/now-masks-gloves-available-at-railway-stations-under-ambala-division/story-esFYadpQNM2wkQ1DldTk4O.html

Many are also operated on feeder routes.“Passengers travelling on BEST buses have increased steadily, since they first became operational after the lockdown was announced in March. With local trains not operating, BEST buses have become the primary mode of commute in the city. We are also operating feeder buses to facilitate travel for essential workers from railway stations,” said a senior official from BEST.After the state went into lockdown in March, dedicated buses ferried only those in essential services. However, later the state and railways permitted locals for essential workers. After the state announced Mission Begin Again in June, BEST introduced 2,132 buses in the city on June 8, following which more than 14 lakh passengers travelled on the buses in the first three days. Only 30 passengers are allowed on one bus, of which 25 can be seated.

10-07-2020||Mumbai||Royal Bengal tiger dies at SGNP||Anand, a 10-year-old male captive Royal Bengal tiger, died at the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) on Thursday. The tiger, a star attraction of SGNP’s tiger safari, was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in early July and was also suffering from a kidney ailment. SGNP is now home to five Royal Bengal tigers – four females and a male – one of whom is the 20-year-old Basanti who is Anand’s mother.Anand, born and bred in SGNP, died at 5am on Thursday morning. “The post mortem by a team of veterinarians revealed that he died due to cancer-related complications such as progressive cachexia [loss of body condition] and multi organ failure,” said Vijay Barabde, range forest officer and superintendent of the lion and tiger safari at SGNP. In July, Anand had been diagnosed with a rare form of malignant cancer and showed symptoms similar to those exhibited by his brother Yash, who died in May 2019 due to a soft tissue muscular tumour known as rhabdomyosarcoma. Barabde said Anand had stopped eating solid food 10 days ago. “He had become weak and his diet for the last 10 days was restricted to chicken soup. The kidney ailment had also worsened. The most recent blood test results showed that his serum creatinine count was 40, while 5-6 is considered normal for tigers. Anand’s death is a big loss,” said Barabde.SGNP’s senior veterinarian Dr. Shailesh Pethe said, “Anand had been diagnosed with an extremely rare form of malignant cancer. Prima facie it looks like rhabdomyosarcoma, but it is yet to be confirmed. Last year, we had observed similar legions for Yash. Anand’s samples were taken for histopathological examination. Preliminary assessment showed it was cancer, but since it is an extremely rare form, it will take some time to identify the exact subtype.” Mumbai Veterinary College (MVC) said owing to shortage of staff due to the outbreak of Covid-19, it would take at least four to five days for the results to come in.Meanwhile, the tiger’s remains were consigned to flames after the post mortem on Thursday.In June, veterinarians at SGNP had identified a lump in Anand’s jaw and an unusual growth on the left side of his lower lip. “Anand’s blood test had revealed he was suffering from a chronic renal disease while a malignant tumour was identified after a biopsy was conducted by MVC authorities,” said Dr. Pethe.The average lifespan of tigers in captivity is between 14 and 16 years, said Dr. Pethe. At present, SGNP is home to five Royal Bengal tigers, including four females and a male. Sultan, who is four-and-a-half-years-old and the lone male Royal Bengal tiger, was brought to SGNP from Gorewada rescue centre in Nagpur last December. In August 2019, twin Royal Bengal tigresses were brought to SGNP from Pench Tiger Reserve in Nagpur. Park officials christened them Bijlee and Mastani. The other female tigers are Laxmi (10) and Basanti (20), who has mothered four cubs (Yash, Anand, Laxmi and Puja). “Basanti has become old and infirm. She is suffering from chronic knee and leg pain, which has largely restricted her movement,” said Barabde. Following Anand’s death, Laxmi is the only one surviving of Basanti’s litter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/royal-bengal-tiger-dies-at-sgnp/story-Mkvtr3KbGmeYiCVA2kaNqO.html
10-07-2020||Mumbai||PG medical, dental aspirants ask Maharashtra CET cell to accept fees online||After weeks of delay, the state common entrance test (CET) cell released the second seat allotment list for postgraduate medical and dental students late on Monday night. Many students, however, are facing admission-related challenges owing to the Covid-19 outbreak and are urging the state to permit them to complete the admission procedure, including payment of fee, online. The deadline for completing the admission confirmation process is July 14.State CET cell commissioner Sandeep Kadam did not answer HT’s calls or messages to clarify on the issue.While the admission rules state that students have to submit documents and their fees by physically being present at the allotted college in order to confirm their seat, in a circular released in the third week of April, the state CET cell requested the medical and dental institutes to share contact details of staffers handling admissions. It further requested colleges to make arrangements for a payment portal, so that students can pay the fees and confirm admissions once the seat allotment list is released. However, there’s been no update on the same as yet.Since Tuesday, a host of students approached the common entrance test (CET) cell, stating that they cannot report to their allotted colleges to confirm their admissions as many are either tested positive for Covid-19, or have a family member who is coronavirus-positive and is therefore under quarantine.“My father and I tested positive for Covid-19 in the last week of June and are currently at a quarantine facility. As per rules, aspirants need to visit the allotted college to submit all the required documents along with fees to confirm admissions. But we are helpless in the current situation,” said a student.He added that many aspirants, most of them being final-year MBBS students who have been working at civic hospitals across the state for the past three months and contracted the virus in the line of duty, requested the state CET cell to allow the completion of the process online instead of being physically present at colleges.Students who are allotted a seat in another city are more worried.“The day the list was released [Monday] I was feeling unwell. On Wednesday, my test result came positive for Covid-19. Now my parents’ test results are also positive, and all of us are home quarantined. None of us can go to the college to complete the admission process, and the CET cell should allow us to do so online,” said a student who is allotted a college in Pune.Students claim that they would have to spend huge amounts to complete the admission procedure by going to the college.“My allotted college is closer to Mumbai, and I reside in Jalna, where the authorities imposed a complete lockdown from June. To confirm my seat, I’ll have to hire a private vehicle and the entire journey will cost me at least ₹25,000-30,000. The CET cell needs to take all of these factors into consideration and allow the acceptance of fees online,” said another student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pg-medical-dental-aspirants-ask-maharashtra-cet-cell-to-accept-fees-online/story-Eg9cHphpfj5mRXdhNtzkOI.html
10-07-2020||City||Awaiting state policy to hold exams for PG medical students: Maharashtra University of Health Sciences||The Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) informed the Bombay high court (HC) that it is awaiting the state government’s policy to conduct the final-year exams of postgraduate (PG) medical students, after one of the aspirants approached HC, seeking directions to the authorities to declare the exam dates and conduct the final-year exams of Doctorate of medicine (MD) and Master of Surgery (MS) courses. The state informed the court on Thursday that as the students and examiners were involved in Covid-19 duties, a policy was being framed to ensure that the future of the students did not suffer.A division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice VG Bisht, while hearing a petition filed by Dr Nishant Gabbur through video conferencing, was informed by advocates Vishwanath Patil and Kewal Ahya that the MS (general surgery) aspirant from Akkalkot, Solapur, who is pursuing the course from Seth GS Medical College in Parel appeared for the entrance test held for DM/MCh (Doctorate of Medicine/Masters in Surgery) courses conducted by the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, on June 21. Patil submitted that Gabbur secured the second place in the all-India ranking in general category for neurosurgery, and on June 30, was granted a provisional appointment/ admission letter by the Chadigarh-based institute. After Gabbur informed the institute that he was facing a difficulty in joining the course because the state was yet to conduct the final-year exams, it allowed him to join by July 6.Patil further submitted that Gabbur and another student, Ajinkya Rewatkar, who secured a seat in All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, for MCh Neurosurgery, wrote to the MUHS, seeking to secure their future, but as there was no response, Gabbur was left with no option but to approach HC.“The petitioner is caught in a dilemma and a situation which is beyond his control, as the MUHS decided to postpone the graduate and PG examinations that were to be held on June 18. MUHS has not resolved the situation, thereby hanging the career of the petitioner at jeopardy, with the risk of losing one entire year and the entire process of preparation and reappearing for entrance tests.”Patil submitted that like Gabbur, there were hundreds of postgraduate medical students, who were placed in a similar situation, and hence the court should issue directions to MUHS to ensure that the future of such students was secured.Assistant government pleader Jyoti Chavan submitted that as PG students were involved in Covid-19 duties, the government was holding meetings to frame a policy for conducting final-year exams for PG medical courses. Chavan then sought time on the grounds that the process involved preparation of schedule, to ensure that all safety norms were adhered to, and the state would inform the court about it in the next hearing.After hearing the submissions the court observed that all steps taken by MUHS and PGIMER would be bound by the decision of the court and posted the matter for hearing on July 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/awaiting-state-policy-to-hold-exams-for-pg-medical-students-maharashtra-university-of-health-sciences/story-W3kO81NGeoXHiKqwiA5smI.html
10-07-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra to spend ₹326 crore more on Ambedkar memorial||The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, which recently gave a nod to raise the height of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar’s statue for the memorial at Indu Mills in Mumbai, also plans to spend ₹326 crore more on it. The total cost of the project, being implemented by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), now stands at ₹1,089.95 crore, a significant rise from its previous cost of ₹763.05 crore, approved in January 2018.In a meeting held earlier this week, MMRDA approved the revised cost. It also gave a post-facto approval for its ₹15,819-crore budget for 2020-21, officials confirmed.In January 2020, the Maharashtra cabinet gave its nod to raise the height of the statue to 350ft from 250ft, with a 100ft pedestal. The total height of the structure, to be made in bronze, will now be 450ft. The project cost has also escalated owing to delayed implementation and changes in plan. The estimated cost of the statue was earlier ₹152.38 crore, which has now increased to ₹409.80 crore. The cost of the pedestal has also increased to ₹236 crore from ₹222 crore. Another ₹300 crore is expected to be spent on other works, which include a library, a replica of the historic Chavdar pond in Raigad, numerous viewing points and a parking lot. A senior official from MMRDA said the cost can vary, after a detailed design is prepared. The authority is in the process of getting various permissions, including coastal regulatory zone, height clearance, fire brigade and environment approval for the project. The groundbreaking for the project was done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in October 2015, but five years later, the work is still to pick up pace. The project is now expected to be completed by April 2022.On Tuesday, the authority gave a post-facto approval to its 2020-21 budget of ₹15,819 crore, of which ₹14,741.50 crore is expected to be spent on major Metro projects in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). The authority is implementing a master plan of 337-km of Metro network in MMR. Another ₹52.95 crore is expected to be spent on the Mumbai Urban Development Project (MUDP). It is also expected to spend around ₹54.70 crore on various studies and surveys.A senior MMRDA official said, “The budget is in effect from April 1 every year.

10-07-2020||City||Maharashtra can’t conduct final-year exams, but awaiting UGC’s response: Education minister||Days after the University Grants Commission (UGC) said that all universities across India will have to conduct the end-of-term exams for final-year students by September, the Maharashtra state education department on Thursday, reiterating its stand, said that examinations will be not held owing to the Covid-19 outbreak.However, the state will wait for some few days to hear from UGC over its decision before making it binding on universities across the state. “We have made our stand on conducting the exams very clear to the UGC as well as the Union HRD [human resource and development] ministry. But if they still insist on conducting the exams, we have requested UGC to clarify on the steps over holding exams in such a situation,” said state minister of higher and technical education Uday Samant.He added that the state, in a letter addressed to UGC, Samant asked if students, who currently reside in containment zones, will have to give exams, and if they do, will they have to remain in quarantine thereafter. The state also sought clarity on the paper-setting process, especially since the representative group for university teachers announced that by conducting exams, lives of students and teachers will be put in jeopardy.“Once the UGC responds, the state will announce its decision. We assure students that they will not have to wait till September to know the final outcome of the decision. We will end the confusion soon,” said Samant.In a virtual press conference, Samant said in a collective meeting on July 4, vice-chancellors (VCs) from all the 13 universities in the state reiterated that they are in no position to hold the final-year exams in online, offline or blended modes by September in accordance with the UGC decision. He added that the minutes of the meeting with the VCs were shared with the government on Thursday.The VCs instead recommended that all final-year students be promoted on the same formula applied for the promotion of students of other years. “The state has since April clarified that conducting exams for around 8 to 10 lakh students is impossible, especially since Maharashtra has and continues to be the epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak. Our decision has been based on the recommendations made by the VCs of state universities, keeping in mind the health and safety of staff and students,” said Samant. The VCs also suggested that students with backlogs (ATKTs) should also be promoted based on their performance in the previous semesters.“The VCs also said that instead of asking students to give a written undertaking stating if they wish to appear for the exams later or altogether skip it, all the students should be given a chance to better their grades later this year, when it becomes possible to hold exams in a safe environment. For now, however, all the students should be promoted, the VCs recommended,” said Samant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-can-t-conduct-final-year-exams-but-awaiting-ugc-s-response-education-minister/story-EcZVKWmyAeOf6GC032zTEI.html

10-07-2020||Mumbai||State set to give ₹1,000-crore boost to stuck SRA projects||The Maharashtra government is set to pump in around ₹700 crore-₹1,000 crore as ‘stress funds’ to revive slum projects which are stuck due to monetary issues. Around 370 projects have been put on hold as builders do not have money to complete the projects, leaving the slum-dwellers in a lurch.According to state housing minister Jitendra Awhad the step is being taken to boost the realty sector. “This stress fund will help to revive slum rehabilitation projects which are stuck, and give relief to both the slum-dwellers and builders,” said Awhad. He said the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) will tie up with the State Bank of India (SBI) in this venture. Currently, there are 3.5 lakh houses being constructed under SRA, of which majority of projects are in limbo. “The realty sector, especially the projects under SRA scheme, was facing monetary issues and Covid-19 has worsened the situation. This stress fund will provide some respite to the builders,” said Nayan Shah, president of Maharashtra Chambers of Housing Industry (CREDAI-MCHI). Real estate lawyer Vinod Sampat said, “Just pumping in funds will not serve any purpose as SRA scheme suffers from corruption and large scale manipulation. These need to be addressed.”With only 2.06 lakh families getting new apartments over 23 years, the SRA scheme to free Mumbai of slums seems to heading nowhere. SRA said there are 12.50 lakh slums with 62 lakh residents in the city. If the current speed is maintained wherein an average of 8,963 families get homes every year, it will take more than a century to rehabilitate all existing slum-dwellers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-set-to-give-1-000-crore-boost-to-stuck-sra-projects/story-ga7SofKkqoCBfJTnh6m6KL.html

In April, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation had announced that as frontline workers battling Covid-19, doctors would be eligible for an incentive of Rs 300 per day. Those quarantined at Taj Mahal Palace hotel had received the incentive for the period when they were in quarantine.However, resident doctors at Nair Hospital, found the daily incentive missing when they received their salaries on Thursday. “We were told that those who were quarantined would not receive the incentive as they were not on duty. However, earlier, quarantine was considered as duty. This is very demoralising,” said a resident doctor from the hospital. Members of the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD), have written to the Directorate of Medical Education and Research, demanding quarantine periods be considered as part of duty and the daily incentive be resumed. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the matter will be discussed with deans of hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/did-not-receive-covid-19-incentive-in-salary-said-mumbai-s-resident-doctors/story-0SeUu5nS4KW1pfdrPxDTIL.html
10-07-2020||Mumbai||MUTP-3: State deal to give fillip to MMR’s rly connect||In a boost to suburban railway connectivity between the city and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) through a new suburban railway corridor, the Maharashtra government and Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC) on Thursday signed a financial agreement for projects under Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP) 3. The projects, for which the Subsidiary Finance Agreement (SFA) has been signed, include a new suburban railway corridor between Panvel and Karjat railway stations for an estimated cost of ₹2,783 crore, procurement of 47 air-conditioned (AC) local trains worth ₹3,491 crore; quadrupling of railway line between Virar and Dahanu railway station for ₹3,578 crore; elevated railway corridor between Airoli and Kalwa railway stations for ₹476 crore; control on midsection trespassing for ₹551 crore; and technical support for ₹69 crore. The overall cost of the project is ₹10,947 crore and will be funded on a 50:50 ratio between the state government and Indian Railways. MUTP-3 got nod from the Centre in 2016 and has a completion deadline of 2022. The state government had, in August 2019, termed the projects under MUTP-3 as essential to the state. “A financial agreement was signed with the state government. It includes projects of MUTP-3,” said RS Khurana, chairman and managing director of MRVC.The agreement will also involve funding from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco).The work on midsection trespass control on the railway lines has started and MRVC has started the process of tendering for other projects. Land acquisition for the projects started in 2019 while on-ground work is likely to start after monsoon this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mutp-3-state-deal-to-give-fillip-to-mmr-s-rly-connect/story-wIqICkTc8aFN7k2KUwYkaL.html

However, ICMR later restricted the tests to government hospitals and private laboratories that are accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL). This restricted the availability of the test to metros and major cities in the state, according to the Maharashtra chapter of IMA. “A large number of private pathology laboratories from Maharashtra, run by duly qualified and medical council-registered pathologists applied for permission immediately. However, these laboratories were denied permission to conduct testing owing to the lack of NABL accreditation,” said Avinash Bhondwe, president of IMA’s state wing.IMA claims there are only 48 NABL-accredited laboratories and these are mainly in big cities as opposed to more than 5,000 laboratories run by qualified private pathologists and microbiologists. “They possess postgraduate qualifications in pathology/ microbiology and are registered under Maharashtra Medical Council. These laboratories are all over Maharashtra including in small towns as well as talukas,” said Bhondwe in a statement.Despite repeated attempts, Vyas was unavailable for a comment.Rapid antigen kits, also known as Standard Q Covid-19 Ag detection, provide results in only 30 minutes, which helps decide further course of treatment for serious patients at the earliest. Allowing private laboratories to do the test would widen the network of testing to include remote areas and at affordable costs, claimed IMA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/permit-all-pathologists-microbiologists-to-conduct-rapid-antigen-tests-maharashtra-doctors-body-tells-icmr/story-GB7bHtlDWuiWv6nxRpw9rJ.html
10-07-2020||Mumbai||Safety of wildlife can’t be ignored for road projects, NGT tells Centre||The Centre has been informed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that it cannot ignore or compromise the safety of wildlife while developing new road projects through tiger corridors in Maharashtra. The NGT principal bench headed by chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel on Tuesday said the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) cannot proceed with projects along tiger corridors in Maharashtra unless they comply with safety guidelines as per the National Tiger Conservation Authority’s (NTCA) action plan.“It is necessary to take precautions in view of the potential of affecting wildlife. If project proponents wish to proceed with a project, they cannot do so without taking safety precautions for protection of wildlife,” the bench said in its order published on Thursday and disposed the matter. NGT has been hearing the matter for the past two-and-a-half years after taking cognisance of a news report in 2018.Principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) Nitin Kakodkar explained that the matter involved nine existing road projects in Chandrapur around the buffer areas of Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) where dispersal of tigers has been identified. These included five national highway (NH) projects and three state highway projects (principally declared as NH). “These are all existing roads that needed expansion. Mitigation measures were crucial and required in each case as identified by NTCA to maintain functional connectivity of tiger corridors,” he said.Chandrapur has the most dense tiger population with over 170 of the 312 tigers in Maharashtra. In February 2019, the tribunal had directed the Union environment ministry to prepare an action plan and oversee its execution. The plan was prepared by NTCA in August 2019 identifying mitigation measures to be implemented over a period of seven years across five phases (underpasses at several locations) along nine roads. Subsequently MoRTH accepted some measures, but later on October 17, 2019, they said they would not be able fund additional expenditure over ₹100.81 crore for proposed mitigation structures. In addition, MoRTH requested the Maharashtra government and forest department to fund remaining expenditure for two roads — Mul Chandarpur and Bamni-Navegaon (NH 930 & NH 353B). NGT, in its order in January this year, had not accepted MoRTH’s submissions highlighting that the mitigation measures were ‘binding’ on them and needed to be ‘duly adopted’. The bench also directed NTCA to submit a revised mitigation plan reducing implementation period to three years. The plan was submitted on April 15, 2020 stating that MoRTH had not accepted conditions for the two roads.“We note that MoRTH has stated that the ministry cannot fund any additional expenditure for the mitigation measures. We are unable to accept such a plea for the reasons already mentioned. Accordingly, the project proponent may proceed only subject to the action plan prepared by the NTCA,” the NGT order from Wednesday said.A Srivastava, chief engineer (Maharashtra regional office), MoRTH, said, “The cost of building underpasses along some of the other tiger corridors was coming to roughly ₹1,100 crore; and our work involved only basic expansion, not four-lane mega projects. None of our activities would disrupt wildlife, and the intention was to improve connectivity to Naxal-affected areas by improving the condition of the highways on the request of the state government.”For this very reason, the state government should also contribute, said Srivastava. “The response from Maharashtra is still awaited. We will be taking a call on what is to be done based on the latest order,” he said.Tiger density is maximum across corridors where these nine roads are located in Chandrapur. Human-tiger conflict had caused around 140 human deaths since 2007, said Kishor Rithe, member of the recently constituted State Board for Wildlife. “This was mainly due to landscape connectivity issues and habitat fragmentation. In such a situation, mitigation measures are essential with appropriate structures (overpasses and underpasses). The user agency must be open-minded towards wildlife conservation. Here they are more concerned about spending money, making it doubtful whether appropriate mitigation structures would actually ever be built.”WHAT’S HAPPENING NOW?HT reported on Wednesday that MoRTH had expressed its intention to make it easier for state bodies to garner faster forest clearances pertaining to national highway projects. On June 30, MoRTH issued a letter to all state governments informing them that state bodies like the public works department working on Central government projects such as national highway development be exempted from purchasing non-forest land in lieu of forest area being diverted. This is mandatory for state agencies as per the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. Instead, MoRTH said state agencies be allowed to carry out compensatory afforestation on degraded forest land, which is applicable to certain small projects. MoRTH said the decision was taken in consultation with the Union environment ministry. However, the latter is yet to respond to queries raised on this by the Maharashtra forest department on this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/safety-of-wildlife-can-t-be-ignored-for-road-projects-ngt-tells-centre/story-CRMFsu3o5itFxKzagjMC8M.html

However, the main accused is still at large. The arrested accused, Umesh Jadhav, a 35-year-old beggar, has been remanded in seven days police custody. “Jadhav’s image was captured on Tuesday evening when the incident took place. He was standing outside. The hunt for the main accused who had entered the premises and damaged pots is still on,” said Vinoy Kumar Choubey, additional director general (law and order), Mumbai Police. Jadhav, a pavement dweller from Parel TT area, has not yet revealed any clear reason as to why he helped his partner vandalise the heritage place. Police are interrogating him to know the whereabouts of the wanted accused. “The main accused’s image got captured in the CCTV installed at the house while he was damaging flower pots in the compound of the house,” said an officer.The police would add section 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in the case since Jadhav neither entered the premises nor did he damage the property, and was only present at the spot along with the main accused, said a police officer. Earlier, a case was registered under sections 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of ₹50 or more) and 447 (criminal trespass) of the IPC based on the complaint of one of the three grandsons of Dr Ambedkar who reside in the house.On Tuesday evening around 5.30pm, the accused first threw stones at glass window panels of Rajgruh and then entered through the gate. He was barefoot and damaged flower pots. CCTV cameras were not damaged, a senior police officer said.The guard at Rajgruh is said to be the witness in the case.The two-storeyed heritage house of Dr Ambedkar has a museum where his books are kept along with his portrait, ashes and vessels and other artefacts.Ambedkar’s daughter-in-law and three grandsons Prakash, Bhimrao and Anadrao live at the bungalow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rajgruh-vandalism-35-year-old-arrested-main-accused-still-on-the-run/story-gyvEd8xL6hRBgZlIjILzEP.html
10-07-2020||Mumbai||170 schools in Gadchiroli, 20 in Chandrapur finally reopen for senior secondary students||More than three months after schools in the state closed due to the Covid-19 outbreak, they have slowly begun reopening from this week. From July 6, nearly 190 schools from Chandrapur and Gadchiroli districts reopened physically.“Nearly 20 schools in Chandrapur and 170 in Gadchiroli have physically reopened. As per the standard operating procedures (SOP) issued by the state education department, schools can reopen in places where there is not a single case of Covid-19 for the last one month,” said an official from the education department. With most parts of the two districts having poor internet access and issues with connectivity, the reopening of schools means that students can finally learn after a long gap. Karamveer Vidyalaya in Warora taluka of Chandrapur, which reopened for Classes 9 and 10, the first day of school was marked with thermal screening of teachers and students and ensuring that children follow social distancing norms.“We first held a meeting of the school management committee and took all parents into confidence. After taking all the necessary precautions, we finally started classes for the higher standards as allowed by the SOPs,” said Balu Bhoyar, principal. The school has 54 students in Class 9 and 10. In several parts of Chandrapur, teachers have also started an initiative called Shikshan Aaplya Dari (Education at your doorstep) through which they travel to small villages and hamlets to teach students in the neighbourhood. “Many of our teachers are part of the initiative, and we are happy that students’ learning is not going to stop,” said Bhoyar. For schools in Gadchiroli, a phased reopening was planned, said Ashwini Sonavane, block education officer, Bhamragad, which is a remote taluka in the district, with a large tribal population.“For students here, no school for such a long time meant a threat of dropouts, and we did not wish to take that risk. Instead of waiting to reopen at once, we worked out a plan for phased reopening. At the moment, we have started small study groups with four students and a teacher, which can assemble in the village for two hours a day,” Sonavane added. With the state’s publishing bureau Balbharti ensuring that students received copies of their textbooks soon after the new academic year began on June 15, the teaching efforts of schools in remote areas could kick-off, she said. As per the SOPs, schools can first start Classes 9, 10, and 12 in July, followed by Classes 6 to 8 from August, and Classes 1-5 from September. The final decision of starting schools, even in such areas, would rest with the local administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/170-schools-in-gadchiroli-20-in-chandrapur-finally-reopen-for-senior-secondary-students/story-7MDWY0EJg333DNMLIoo9mM.html
10-07-2020||Mumbai||Name patients for others’ safety, PIL urges HC||A student of the Government Law College at Mumbai and a farmer from Solapur district have moved the Bombay high court (HC) seeking direction to the authorities to disclose identities of Covid-19 patients “so that others who have come in their contact can take appropriate precautionary steps to protect themselves from the deadly virus”.The PIL filed by law student Vaishnavi Gholave and agriculturist Mahesh Gadekar is likely to come up for hearing on Friday.In the PIL filed through advocate Vinod Sangvikar they have contended that many a times the people infected with Covid-19 are unable to recognise and give complete information of the people who had come into their contact, because of which not all suspects could be traced and treated in time.They have cited the example of a meat seller from Murali Peth in Solapur who tested positive and it was reported that around 1,000 people had come in contact with him. “But the meat seller did not know the names of all his customers. He did not know where they lived,” said the PIL. It said that since there are around 25 meat sellers in Murarji Peth and the name of the infected meat seller was not disclosed, people did not know whether they had been exposed to the virus, thus failing to take precautionary measures.The petitioners added that when there is such a serious risk to the community at large, it is necessary to disclose names of patients so that the people who came in contact with them are aware and can come forward to take appropriate precautions; first, by isolating themselves and thereby preventing further spread, and secondly, by immediately taking treatment.The PIL said that while the number of Covid-19 patients is increasing rapidly in Maharashtra, the government has maintained it has not so far reached the third stage of large-scale community spread where the source of the infection becomes untraceable and the spread becomes extremely contagious and difficult to control, and added that “if we continue to maintain secrecy about the identity of the patients we will soon reach that stage too”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/name-patients-for-others-safety-pil-urges-hc/story-gernBeJFYlVboZhQhMx3VI.html
10-07-2020||Mumbai||Cases of lockdown violations drop; Maharashtra Police claims citizens more cooperative||Four days after Maharashtra Police collected ₹53 lakh in a single day from those found violating lockdown regulations, both, the number of cases registered and fines collected, has come down drastically. Between July 8 and 9, police in the state registered only 315 cases as compared to an average of over 1,000 cases per day. From March 22, when the lockdown was imposed across the state, till July 8, Maharashtra Police collected a total of ₹11,54,63,987 in fines from lockdown violators. Between July 8 and 9, the amount collected rose to by just ₹18,300, according to data shared by Maharashtra Police.The data also shows that no arrests were made for lockdown regulations on July 9, while only three vehicles were impounded. Since the start of the lockdown till July 8, Maharashtra Police have arrested 29,793 violators and seized 88,783 vehicles in total.Vinayak Deshmukh, assistant inspector general of police (law and order), attributed the drastic decrease in cases and fines collected to citizens cooperating with lockdown regulations. “People have become more aware and are cooperating with us in Maharashtra,” said Deshmukh.Neither the Maharashtra director general of police nor the inspector general of police (law and order) responded to HT’s calls and messages. However, Thane police commissioner Vivek Phansalkar said, “We have continued to take strict action against people who are found unnecessarily loitering, and the cases have not gone down in Thane.”Mumbai Police spokesperson and deputy commissioner of police, Pranaya Ashok said, “Initially, we had to be very strict on anyone found violating lockdown regulations. Nakabandhis and patrolling are still on, but people have become much more aware and are cooperating with us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cases-of-lockdown-violations-drop-maharashtra-police-claims-citizens-more-cooperative/story-ppg7CbIRzSZorcKx0ZO0xM.html
10-07-2020||Mumbai||Spread awareness about field hospitals: CM to BMC||Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday expressed concern over people’s lack of confidence in the hospitals temporarily constructed in open fields in Mumbai. The state government has developed six field Covid-19 hospitals, but according to officials, citizens often refuse to get admitted there and instead demand beds in government-run or private hospitals. Thackeray directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to make efforts to inform people that these field hospitals are as good as any other government or private hospital in the city.Thackeray had called two meetings to take stock of the situation and review measures taken by the civic body to contain the spread of Covid-19 in Mumbai.“The CM gets calls from people that they want a bed in a regular hospital and not in the field hospitals. This is despite developing good-quality field hospitals. Thackeray instructed BMC to start taking efforts to build confidence among people so that they won’t hesitate to receive treatment at these hospitals, and the load on the regular government and private hospitals can be reduced,” said a senior official who attended the meeting.BMC commissioner IS Chahal said people’s reluctance is because they have never experienced treatment at such facilities. “We have outsourced expert doctors, intensivists, clinical staff, and others for these hospitals and are spending much on them. To deal with the issue, I have directed officials to occupy ICU beds in these hospitals first and let them experience the facilities developed there. This will help in clearing misconceptions, and awareness among people will increase,” said Chahal.In Mumbai, six field hospitals have been developed at Mahalaxmi Racecourse, NSCI-Worli, Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), Mulund, NESCO-Goregoan, and Dahisar.The number of cases in Mumbai has reached 89,124 after 1,268 new cases were recorded on Thursday. The city’s death toll jumped to 5,132 after 68 deaths were reported the same day.The CM directed BMC to set up a mechanism for optimum use of ambulances provided by the state and private donors. “We must have a monitoring system for use of ambulances so that the people will be able to get the benefit of these facilities in time,” Thackeray said.He said that the healthcare facilities have been augmented, and now they need a proper plan for their systematic use. “For instance, we have taken 80% of beds at 35 private hospitals. Now all these hospitals should put up a notice board with daily occupancy so that all those in need can get a bed,” the CM said.In the second meeting, Thackeray sought help from NGOs to contain the Covid spread and reduce case mortality rate. He said that if NGOs can help in conducting surveys and send symptomatic patients to dedicated Covid centers, then treatment can be started in the golden hour and lives can be saved. He said that NGOs can also help in clearing misconceptions about keeping patients in isolation.Chahal said that previously, BMC used to give beds only to those patients who had Covid test reports, but now they have started giving beds even to those who have symptoms but no test report. “This is showing results as it helps to bring down Covid deaths in the city. By the end of this month, you will see a drastic change in the number of Covid-related deaths. Even today, we have 1,158 patients who were admitted without having a Covid test report,” the municipal commissioner said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/spread-awareness-about-field-hospitals-cm-to-bmc/story-tF5VKyAqY3Sl5B5nnPLo0M.html
10-07-2020||Mumbai||One-third of Covid deaths a result of delay in admission or reporting: Maharashtra task force||As the city’s Covid toll crossed the 5,000-mark, members of the state task force said one-third of the deaths are due to late admission or late reporting of symptomatic cases, stressing the need to remove the social stigma attached to the virus for early detection.Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state Covid-19 task force, said, “While one of the primary causes of Covid deaths is co-morbidities, probably one-third of the Covid deaths in the city are due to delayed diagnosis of symptomatic cases or late admission, which delays treatment and reduces the chances of survival.”“Covid is an unpredictable virus. Some of the most important symptoms we had seen were lack of smell and taste. Now, new symptoms such as backache, chills and severe pain in the calves have surfaced. An aggressive support system such as timely oxygen supply is very important. More effective medicines are available now. However, early detection and prompt treatment has a huge impact on the fatality rate.”The city’s fatality rate as of Wednesday was 5.7%. The rise in Covid deaths initially was also because of mismanagement and unavailability of beds. “All patients should be treated as suspected Covid cases. Every hospital should be prompt in treatment, right from the time the patient is in ambulance to the hospital bed. Once they are sorted as Covid positives, they can be transferred to dedicated Covid centres. The patient should not be made to run around for Covid or non-Covid complications. This has reduced to an extent with the surplus beds for Covid patients.”Daksha Shah, deputy executive health officer, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), said, “In some cases, in which patients die within 24 hours of admission, they might have delayed seeking care due to fear of isolation or social stigma. It is utmost important to get care from the time the symptoms start to appear.”Senior civic officials said the first 24 hours are very crucial for a symptomatic patient. They also said that in multiple cases, patients have hidden symptoms for days. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), said on Monday, “A major cause for concern among Covid-19 patients is the delay in reporting symptoms to the health centres. The first 24 hours since the start of symptoms are critical and immediate medical attention has helped. However, there are many cases where patients don’t tell their family members or seek medical treatment in time, which should not be the case.”Experts emphasise on social awareness among residents of housing societies and slum areas to support families of Covid patients. Joshi said, “Residents of housing areas should cooperate and treat Covid patients in their society well, mentally as well as physically.”Meanwhile, on Thursday, Mumbai reported 1,268 cases, taking the total to 89,124. The city saw 68 deaths, which took the toll to 5,132, according to the state health department data. A total of 957 patients recovered and were discharged on Thursday. A total of 60,195 patients have so far been treated and discharged. The city has 23,785 active cases.According to BMC’s data, of the 68 deaths, three were of patients below 43 years of age, 22 were of patients above 60 years, and 22 were aged 40 to 60. The recovery rate in Mumbai has now gone up to 67%. The city’s doubling rate is 47 days. The total number of Covid tests done till Wednesday is 3.74 lakh. Meanwhile, Dharavi reported nine new cases on Thursday. The number of total cases is 2,347, of which 1,815 patients have been discharged and 291 are active.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/one-third-of-covid-deaths-a-result-of-delay-in-admission-or-reporting-maharashtra-task-force/story-YfsA3NDVIz93znvghUtkmN.html
10-07-2020||City||Thane Covid hospital mix-up case: 2 doctors transferred, 4 nurses terminated||Two doctors from the Covid hospital set up at Global Impact Hub in Kalwa were transferred while four nurses were terminated from service after a mix-up between two patients on Thursday. The action was taken after a report of the inquiry committee stated that while there were no lapses in the treatment of both patients, the entire mix-up was the result of mistakes in the documentation, said Dr Vipin Sharma, Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) commissioner.The family of a patient from Kopri was given the body of a 72-year-old man on July 3, while their 67-year-old father was still alive. After performing the final rites for the man, on July 6 they were informed that he was still alive and in the ICU. He died on July 7.TMC had set up a three-member enquiry committee to investigate the cause of the mix-up.“As per the enquiry report, there was no negligence in the medical treatment given to the two patients. The mix-up was in the documentation process, for which we have taken proper action. Dr. Yogesh Sharma, the dean, and Dr Pramod Borgave, the doctor in charge of the ICU were transferred to their original posts at Chattrapati Shivaji Hospital, while the four nurses [involved in the case] were terminated from service,” said Sharma.Deputy municipal commissioner Vishwanath Kelkar has been given full-time charge of the hospital for better communication with patients, to avoid such confusion in the future.“The 67-year-old patient was already in the ICU, while the 72-year-old was shifted after his condition worsened. We regret the incident and would like to apologise to the families and ensure that such an incident is not repeated,” the TMC chief added.The family has claimed that the action is not enough. The son of the 72-year-old man who died, said, “We could not see our father, nor give him a proper funeral. We were not even aware of what was happening. Merely transferring the doctor is not enough. We demand substantial action so that no other family has to go through this again.”As per the report, when the 72-year-old patient was admitted on June 29, he was given an admit card with his name. Apart from the name on his admit card, all case papers in regards to his treatment are missing.The report states that the nurses who got the patient admitted in the ward, registered him under the name of the 67-year-old patient and therefore, his case history was entered under the name of the 67-year-old.However, there is no mention of the 72-year-old’s case history in the file of the other patient. The hospital has two case papers in the name of one patient.Sharma informed that he will personally ensure that proper death certificates are issued to both the families of the deceased.The issue was taken up by Niranjan Dawkhare, city president of BJP after the family of the 72-year-old patient claimed that he was untraceable early this week. Dawkhare and other BJP leaders had met Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari who asked the chief minister for quick action in the case.3-way registration of patients to avoid confusionThe civic commissioner informed that to avoid any confusion in the future, patients will be registered in three ways. “The Aadhaar card and Pan card details of the patients will be noted. A photo of the patient will be taken and attached to his case file. In case of death, relatives will be asked to identify the victim. Each patient will also have a wrist tag,” Sharma said.

10-07-2020||Delhi||SC pulls up Maharashtra government on migrant issue, asks for fresh affidavit||The government is duty-bound to find out problems faced by migrant workers and do the needful, the Supreme Court (SC) said on Thursday, taking exception to the stance of the Maharashtra government on the issue of migrant workers.A three-judge bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said that the claims made by the state in its affidavit cannot be accepted at face value.The court referred to applications filed by two non-profit organisations, Sarva Hara Jan Andolan and Delhi Sharmik Sangathan, on July 7, which detailed the difficulties faced by migrant workers in Maharashtra. The applications gave information about people who were still attempting to return to their home states.“We do not appreciate the tenor and the claims made in the affidavit filed on behalf of the state of Maharashtra. The present is not an adversarial litigation and it is the duty of the state to find out shortcomings and lapses wherever and to do the needful,” the court said, adding that the state cannot claim it will take action only if provided with information regarding such lapses.The Maharashtra government had mentioned in its affidavit, that none of the migrant workers who are in the state are desirous of returning home since lockdown restrictions were lifted, and there are employment opportunities.“Ask Maharashtra to file a proper affidavit. Your [Maharashtra] affidavit is adversarial. This is not an adversarial case,” justice MR Shah told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who is representing the state.The next hearing has been scheduled for July 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sc-pulls-up-maharashtra-government-on-migrant-issue-asks-for-fresh-affidavit/story-7qO6dv9sLpRedHFOVBBWAI.html
10-07-2020||City||Family claims Kalyan hospital mixed up patient’s Covid test report||The family of a 35-year-old woman has alleged that a hospital in Kalyan has mixed up her Covid-19 test results with those of a 45-year-old infected patient, and sent her for Covid treatment to another hospital.The family realised there was a mix-up when the medical store where they went to buy some injections pointed out that the age of the patient mentioned on the test report does not match the age mentioned on the woman’s Aadhaar card. The woman’s brother has since filed a complaint with Mahatma Phule police station and the Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation’s health department.“My sister was ill on July 3 and we took her to a private hospital in Kalyan. On July 4, the hospital asked her to get tested for Covid-19. On July 5, the hospital claimed her report to be positive and asked us to take her to another private hospital in Kalyan, saying her case was severe,” the woman’s brother mentioned in his complaint.“At the hospital, we were asked to buy an injection worth ₹45,000. I somehow managed to get it from Mumbai as it was not available in Kalyan. Later, they asked us to buy six injections worth ₹35,000,” he said.On Wednesday, the hospital asked the family to get another injection worth ₹45,000. This time, the medical store asked for the patient’s Covid test report and her Aadhaar card copy.“The hospital provided me with a copy of her test report. When we gave it to the medical store, they found the report to be false as it carried the age of the patient as 45 years while my sister’s age according to her Aadhaar card is 35. I realised that the report provided to us was of another patient who had a name similar to my sister’s,” said the brother.The family is now worried about the woman’s health as she was given injections for Covid infection, even though she is not infected.“We want the authorities to take action against the hospital for sending my sister for treatment without checking her reports. We have already paid around ₹1.5 lakh for treatment,” the brother said.After receiving the complaint, KDMC commissioner Vijay Suryavanshi said he would enquire into the matter. “We have received a complaint from the family and will set up an enquiry on the same. Required action will be taken, “said Suryavanshi.The private hospital administration did not respond to calls from HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/family-claims-kalyan-hospital-mixed-up-patient-s-covid-test-report/story-NhRM5U4Mbk2V9q4gRsS8tL.html

The active cases in the state now stand at 93,652. The state also reported 219 new fatalities, pushing the toll up to 9,667. Mumbai recorded 1,268 new cases and 68 fatalities, which took its tally to 89,124 and toll to 5,132. The active cases in Mumbai stand at 23,785.Pune, meanwhile, continued to record more than 1,000 new cases daily, with 1,130 fresh cases taking the city’s tally to 25,758. It also recorded 18 fatalities on Thursday as its toll rose to 814. Pune’s adjoining Pimpri-Chinchwad recorded 413 new cases. Nashik city recorded 173 cases, while Jalgaon district recorded 110 new infections, 147 cases were reported from Pune district and 122 from Aurangabad city.The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), excluding Mumbai, continued to contribute a chunk of the daily cases, with 40.96% of the total cases recorded in the state. Kalyan-Dombivli recorded 743 fresh infections on Thursday, Thane city 369, Navi Mumbai 251, Thane district 285, Ulhasnagar 171, Mira-Bhayander, Vasai-Virar 222, Raigad 274, Panvel 193. Bhiwandi-Nizampur and Palghar recorded 50 and 49 new cases respectively.The region has seen a surge in cases and has nearly doubled its tally in the past 15 days. Of the 70,538 total cases in MMR (excluding Mumbai) till July 9, 34,386 cases have come in the past 15 days alone. The number of cases that increased in the past fortnight account for 48.74% of the total cases recorded. The region has so far recorded 1,786 fatalities.The MMR includes Thane district, Thane city, Kalyan-Dombivli, Navi Mumbai, Ulhasnagar, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Mira-Bhayander, Palghar and Vasai-Virar.According to the state health department’s daily bulletin, till June 1, cases in MMR were 12,160. The cases shot up over four times in one month to 49,943 on July 1. During this period, the state government had started its ‘Mission Begin Again’ and provided several relaxations, including freeing up movement of people, the opening of businesses, industries, shops, etc.Amid the rise in the number of cases in MMR, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting with commissioners of civic bodies in the region and termed the situation a “concern”. This was Thackeray’s second interaction with the civic chiefs in under two weeks.Expressing dissatisfaction over the health infrastructure in many cities in MMR, Thackeray has directed their civic chiefs to follow the example of Mumbai and ramp up health facilities for Covid-19 cases. The CM, during a video conference with civic chiefs of eight municipal corporations in MMR on Thursday, has asked to set up field hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients and suspected contacts on an urgent basis.While the number of patients in Mumbai is steady for the last few weeks, it’s on the rise in other eight municipal corporations in the MMR. In some of the corporation areas, the case fatality rate (CFR) too is high. As of July 6, Thane cases rose to 9,300 and reported 243 deaths with the rise of percentage in state tally of cases to 5.67%, from 5.35% on June 8. During the same period, Kalyan Dombivli’s share rose to 5.12% from 2.13%, while Mira-Bhayandar rose to 2.3% from 1.07% in terms of positive cases. The CFR in Bhiwandi on July 6 was as high as 5.23%, though other corporations in the area could bring it down to register below the state average.Among all municipal corporations in MMR, KDMC is second highest in daily cases after Mumbai and has reported more than 600 cases a day over the past few weeks. The corporation has not been able to augment its health infrastructure to take up the additional projected load of cases during monsoon.While addressing the commissioners, Thackeray said that some civic bodies in the MMR could not set up jumbo facilities like those established in Mumbai. “We have been pressing for jumbo facilities to tackle the projected rise in cases over the last four months. The number of cases is expected to rise during monsoon, but the civic bodies in the rest of Mumbai have been lagging behind. They should start setting up field hospitals on a war footing with the help of industries, companies, and institutions if needed,” he said.CM’s principal advisor Ajoy Mehta said that the spike in the cases in rest of the MMR is a matter of concern for not only the state, but also for the country. He asked civic chiefs for aggressive tracing, institutional isolation and ramping up facilities for Covid and non-Covid patients. He too asked civic bodies to seek help from the companies and industries in augmentation of the medical facilities.Thackeray has also directed them to ensure that facilities are well-equipped with a drainage system, toilets, drinking water besides the facilities of ICU and dialysis. The CM also asked them to ensure to stock adequate medicines to cope with the potential surge in cases during monsoon. He has also directed corporations for the community participation in their fight against the pandemic. The corporations have also been asked to constitute surveillance committees, involving NGOs and local youths, who can help them in surveillance and treatment.Navi Mumbai municipal commissioner Annasaheb Misal said, “We already have ramped up our infrastructure and have set up a 1,200-bed facility at the exhibition centre. Our testing rate is 16,608 per million, much above the Central government’s parameters. This has helped us in improving the doubling rate to 33 days from 6 days a few weeks ago.” Meanwhile, the state also recorded 4,067 patients discharged, taking the total number of patients who have recovered to 1,27,259. The recovery rate in the state stands at 55.19%. The state has so far tested 12,22,487 samples and has a positivity rate of 18.86%, the state health department data said. Currently, 6,49,263 people are in home quarantine and 48,191 people are in institutional quarantine, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-covid-tally-up-to-230-599-mmr-accounts-for-major-share/story-faHF8PXELmAIRv9JIR9UHI.html
10-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC to remodel 8 tanks at Sec-39 waterworks to double storage||For doubling the water storage capacity at the Sector 39 waterworks, the municipal corporation (MC) will be remodelling and restructuring the existing eight water tanks instead of their initial plan of constructing an additional one.The augmentation of the water storage capacity will minimise the shortage of water in the city during summer and minimise supply disruption from Kajauli waterworks.As per the new plan, for the implementation of which a work tender was floated on Thursday, construction of a new raw water tank had been dropped. The project will cost ₹38 crore and will be completed within 24 months from the allotment of the work.In the initial plan, which was approved by the MC General House, it was planned that the storage capacity will be enhanced from 48 million gallons to 92 million gallons (MG) by remodelling tank number 1 to 5, and constructing one new raw water tank of capacity of 5.07MG.However, after a detailed survey it was decided that remodelling of existing tanks 1 to 8 would be sufficient to increase the required capacity to 92MG, and the construction of a new tank was not required.DEAD STORAGE TO BE UTILIZED“The changed plan will save land. After remodelling existing tanks, approximately 9MG unutilized dead storage of existing tanks will be utilised,” said an MC official.MC had earlier approved the ₹38-crore for the water storage project, but with only ₹27 crore available for the capital head, the project couldn’t be started. The UT administration was also approached to fill in the ₹11-crore gap, which was not approved. Then the MC approached the Chandigarh Smart City Limited for filling in the fund gap. On June 10, CSCL approved ₹11 crore for the augmentation of water storage.The Sector 39 waterworks reservoir receives supply from the Kajauli waterworks. Its capacity is inadequate and the water stored in the morning is supplied in the evening, while the evening storage is supplied in the morning. With the peak water demand in summers touching 120-125 MG daily, the current availability of 90-95 MGD was found inadequate and increased storage capacity was required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-to-remodel-8-tanks-at-sec-39-waterworks-to-double-storage/story-kxkFttjoNqMiKdmyHqQhhO.html

Outside what used to be his workspace, where he would book clients for weddings and his team members would gather to practise musical numbers, Surjit Singh now keeps containers full of bottle gourd, tomatoes and potatoes.He has to now get up as early as 4 am to go to the mandi and buy vegetables. The family is surviving on whatever little he manages to earn, which he says is “enough for our meals.”DEFAULTING ON RENTThe losses have been enormous. “We had received bookings worth Rs 4 lakh to Rs 5 lakh for March, April and May. But because of the Covid-19 outbreak, all events were cancelled and I have been left bankrupt. I have not paid rent of around Rs 30,000 for stores where the band’s musical instruments are kept,” he adds.Walk into one of the rooms and you see scarlet uniforms of the band members piled up in one corner next to trumpets and drums, all gathering dust in a room that is under lock and key since March 22, the day lockdown begin in Chandigarh.Dharamvir Chihan, 47, owner of Durga Band, too, has had his finances drained because of a year’s advance payment of Rs 16 lakh to 20 men working for him. All of them have left for their homes.“In this business, agreements are signed in advance and a huge percentage of payments are made at the beginning of the financial year. I had just paid my workers in advance when the lockdown was announced, because of which bookings of Rs 6 lakh to Rs 7 lakh were cancelled,” he says.Every year Chihan’s band signs contracts to perform at about a 100 weddings, with business peaking from October to February and then from March to May.Chihan has also defaulted on his monthly rent of Rs 20,000 for storage space for musical equipment other items belonging to the band. “What is bothering me is the uncertainty. No one knows when things will normalise. I have a brother and only know how to work in a band. Where will we get the money to start another business?”Sustained by hopeAmit Kapoor, owner of Mohali Based Harish band has also started selling vegetables. About 25 of his bookings were cancelled due to the lockdown. His band members and other workers, too, have left for their hometowns and villages.“We are hoping that work will restart from Janamashtami in August. Or else, we will have to change what we do. As of now I will continue to sell vegetables. I have to feed my children.”His only concern is that if the pandemic continues he will not have any money left to care for his family and six horses they own and hire out for wedding processions.There is no hope in Sanjay Sihaan’s voice when the owner of Krishna Band of Chandigarh says, “there is no business.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/weddings-to-vegetables-life-strikes-a-discordant-note-for-band-owners-in-panchkula/story-hyw2DT5Rt2g8pv3xIeOEUI.html
10-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram gathers details on Covid-19 medicines to prevent black-marketing||In order to ensure sufficient stock and prevent black marketing, the district drug control department is seeking details from private hospitals in the city regarding the availability of approved Covid-19 medicines and injectables in their pharmacies. With major private hospitals fast running out of the injectable generic antiviral drug remdesivir, being administered on moderately ill patients, the department is now seeking details of the other two drugs — favipiravir and tocilizumab — used for treating the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. While favipiravir is a pill-based drug, tocilizumab, on the other hand, is an injectable like remdesivir. Amandeep Chauhan, district drug control officer said, “Hospitals have been directed to share the details of the Covid-19 drugs stock available in their pharmacies. Since tocilizumab is an expensive drug, with one vial of 400mg costing Rs 40,000, only selected big hospitals stock it. As per the data shared by the hospitals so far, there are currently only 10-12 vials in the city.” Chauhan added, favipiravir is an oral drug which is the most widely used antiviral medicine for Covid-19 patients. “It is a 200mg tablet used to treat mild to moderate cases. Like in cases of remdesivir and tocilizumab, a written consent from the patient or his family member is taken before it is prescribed. Each strip has 35 tablets, which costs around Rs 3,500,” said Chauhan, mentioning that there are 400 strips currently available with three to four big private hospitals, where maximum Covid-19 patients are being treated.According to him, the department is taking the details regarding the medicines to prevent its black-marketing. The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (enforcement division) has already directed all state drug controllers to ensure remdesivir and other drugs are not sold in the black market. As reported by HT, city hospitals do not have enough stock of remdesivir. Hospitals are directly availing the drug from manufacturers. Currently, there are 25 vials of remdesivir available in the city with each vial costing about Rs 5,400. “The data collected from Gurugram is being directly sent to the Haryana Drug Control office. If there is unavailability of stock or insufficient stock, our team is trying to arrange it,” said Chauhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/drug-control-department-gathers-details-on-covid-19-medicines-to-prevent-black-marketing/story-AC5BF0ziOIYuWlUlw1DihM.html
10-07-2020||Delhi||Govt set to hire 151 more ambulances, give monetary incentives to drivers & paramedics||The Delhi government is all set to hire 151 ambulances by next week, thereby scaling up the size of the city’s public ambulance fleet on dedicated Covid-19 service to around 750, a senior government official said on Thursday.The official further said that the government also has plans to rope in a private enterprise to get another 400 vehicles to start an app-based taxi ambulances scheme and implement a scheme to provide incentives to ambulance staff. These initiatives are part of the agenda for the next cabinet meeting.Government records showed that on March 31, there were 134 ambulances in the city government’s fleet which were pressed into dedicated Covid-19 duty. The number rose to 163 by April 30; to 357 on May 30 and it jumped to 602 as on June 30.Other than the government ones, private hospitals and enterprises in the city operate around 600 more ambulances, which can be availed by patients on a chargeable basis. The government ambulance service is free of cost.“Since the beginning of the lockdown, the government has focused its energies on augmenting the fleet size of ambulances pressed into Covid-19 management. In three months, we have succeeded in reducing the response time per call significantly. Also, we have been able to ensure that people can depend on the government ambulance system without any stress,” said Jasmine Shah, vice-chairperson of the Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi, an advisory body to the Delhi government.Government records accessed by HT showed that the response time for ambulances has reduced from 55 minutes per call on May 31 to less than 30 minutes per call on July 7.Between July 1 and July 7, the city government’s helplines received 972 calls per day, which had to be transferred to the department managing ambulances, records showed. These are calls that largely pertain to movement of patients between hospitals; from hospitals to hotels engaged in covid service;from covid health centres to hospitals and from residence of patients to hospitals, health centres and test centres.A senior government official said: “The decisions to hire 151 ambulances, press into service taxi ambulances and notification of the incentive scheme is in the pipeline and will be taken up during the next meeting of the Delhi cabinet that is likely to happen in the next three days. Once approved, the new decisions are likely to be implemented by next week,” said the senior government official.Under the incentive scheme, which is in the pipeline, ambulance and paramedics officials will be rewarded Rs 100 extra from every third call onwards that they attend in their 12-hours shift. “This initiative was drafted by the government to acknowledge the high-risk nature of the service provided by the ambulance drivers and paramedics,” said Shah.After attending a call, every ambulance has to undergo a sanitisation process which alone takes around two hours, said an official in the health department, adding that in a 12-hour shift one ambulance usually able to cater to a maximum of four calls.Till June 30, the government also had an arrangement with a popular cab aggregator service for providing taxi ambulances through their mobile application. Now, the government has planned to rope in a separate company that shall provide 400 vehicles to be used as taxi ambulances, a service which can be accessed through a mobile application, said another government official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-set-to-hire-151-more-ambulances-give-monetary-incentives-to-drivers-paramedics/story-en8fywJuE2LMk33cPyTDgI.html

The proposal is likely to be tabled in the next cabinet meeting, the date for which is yet to be finalised.But before this hospital is opened, the government will start another of its new hospital in Burari for Covid-19 patients. The facility, which has a capacity of 700 beds, will start with 450 beds from next week.“In the case of Burari hospital, only the fire safety clearance is awaited. We are expecting to start 450 beds for Covid-19 patients there from around next week. In Ambedkar Nagar, fire safety clearance will take a few more days, so we are expecting to start 200 beds in that facility by the end of this month,” said an official from deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia’s office. Sisodia is also presently Delhi’s health minister.Government officials, however, clarified that neither the Burari nor the Ambedkar Nagar facilities will have ICU beds. In both hospitals, arrangements have been made for medical and supporting staff, officials said.“Some of these beds will have oxygen supply and oxygen cylinders, but no ICU bed is being readied in these two facilities yet,” a government official said.In Burari, 250 beds will have oxygen support. “Every third bed here will have an oxygen supply attached to it. Around 125 beds have oxygen supply, and 125 will be provided through oxygen cylinders,” the official said.The hospital in Ambedkar Nagar was approved in 2013 at a cost of Rs 125.9 crore by the Congress government. While initially it planned to house 200 beds, the Aam Aadmi Party government increased the capacity to 600.Residents of Ambedkar Nagar said the hospital would benefit not just them but also those in nearby areas such as Sangam Vihar, Deoli, Khanpur, Madangir and Dakshinpuri.“Right now, we just have Batra hospital, which is a private facility. For Covid-19 treatment, there was no government facility in the area. This would help many get free treatment if it is opened,” said Satish, who goes by his first name and is a resident of E-Block.Lalit Kant, a scientist and former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at ICMR, said the government must focus on increasing ICU beds and ventilator beds. “On Thursday, there were more than 10,300 beds vacant in various hospitals in Delhi. But almost 66% ICU beds in private hospitals and 40% in government hospitals are already occupied. So, the authorities should scale up ICU beds and ventilator beds,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/200-beds-in-ambedkar-nagar-hospital-to-open-by-month-end-450-beds-in-burari-likely-to-start-from-next-week/story-IUYf6SDNQJtrEjeKY5hdiI.html
10-07-2020||Delhi||RWAs, market associations, taxi and auto unions to help implement revised Covid management plan||To implement the Delhi government’s revised Covid-19 response plan, which was notified on July 8, the district administrations are planning to rope in residents’ welfare associations, market associations and auto and taxi unions in the Capital.As per the revised plan, Special Surveillance Groups (SSGs) comprising domestic help, drivers of autorickshaws, taxis and good carriers, daily wagers such as plumbers, electricians, carpenters and mechanics, and those working at stores selling essential supplies have to be screened for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Some district magistrates HT spoke to said that they have already been screening some categories of SSGs such as those working as help in markets and homes. During the door-to-door survey undertaken by the district administrations, a senior official said, a sizeable population, especially those living in the lower-income group neighbourhoods or clusters, was screened.“But now, we will scale it up and rope in RWAs, market associations and transport unions to cover a large number of people and also create awareness about Covid-19. We have mobile testing vans, which we will deploy for testing,” a district magistrate said, requesting anonymity.The revised order, issued by the government’s Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), directs the district administration to enlist all SSGs with the help of RWAs, municipal corporations, the police, etc.While RWAs in the city have welcomed the move, they asserted that they had been asking the government to screen people involved in the informal sector since May, when it allowed electricians, plumbers, domestic help to resume work. Atul Goyal, the president of United Residents Joint Action (URJA) said, “We were criticised when we asked for something similar two months ago, though some RWAs did take excessive measures. If the government had undertaken this measure earlier, it would have helped contain the spread of the disease. RWAs played a crucial role in effective enforcement of the lockdown. The government should have taken RWAs in confidence regarding its Covid-19 management plan. But better late than never.”According to some RWAs, this step will be of little use now as the infection is widespread and cases, including isolated cases, are being reported now. “Covid-19 cases are being reported from every colony. It is very late now. But whatever help is required, we will provide it to the government,” BS Vohra, the president of East Delhi RWA front, said.As for the screening of SSGs, another district magistrate who requested anonymity said that those involved in surveillance work such as Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) and ANMs (auxiliary nurse midwives) are aware of localities where a large population of autorickshaw or e-rickshaw drivers and domestic help lives. As per the revised Covid-19 response plan, major groups of SSGs in the districts have to be “compulsorily covered”.“We have been doing door-to-door screening and our special focus has been low-income group areas or clusters. We know the areas where a large number of these people live. Now we will do more focused screening and testing. We will make a list of people working in residential colonies with the help of RWAs and ask them to encourage people to get themselves screened and tested if they have any symptoms,” the district magistrate said.All individuals belonging to the special surveillance groups also have to be screened and their health records fed into a separate database.If any individual from a special surveillance group is found positive for Covid-19, a system has to be set up to enable tracing all people in the locality who have come in contact with the patient and assign them 15 days’ home isolation.With a majority of activities allowed in Unlock 2.0, the demand for autorickshaws, e-rickshaws and goods carriers has gone up. With Metro service yet to restart and buses not allowed to ferry more than 20 passengers at a time, a sizeable population is dependent on auto-rickshaws and e-rickshaws for their daily commute.“Auto or e-rickshaw drivers are part of a high-risk group as they ferry a lot of passengers daily. While we have been screening a majority of other SSGs, we have not covered this segment. We are preparing a plan under which our teams will visit the taxi and auto stands and screen these people. We will take help from the auto and taxi unions to ensure a large percentage of them get screened and, if required, tested,” a district surveillance officer said on condition of anonymity.Welcoming the government’s decision, auto and taxi unions in the city said that special camps should be held for testing at railway stations and the airport. Rajender Soni, the general secretary of Delhi Auto-rickshaw Sangh and Delhi Pradesh Taxi Union, said, “Our people are vulnerable as we come in contact with a lot of people daily. We have been demanding special screening of auto and taxi drives so that those testing positive for Covid-19 can get timely treatment. We welcome the government’s decision.”The Delhi government spokesperson did not respond for comment despite repeated calls and messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/rwas-market-associations-taxi-and-auto-unions-to-help-implement-revised-covid-management-plan/story-SHL9OUGGiy8wjhSlHJV8PP.html
10-07-2020||Delhi||60 Malaysians who attended Tablighi Jamaat meet freed; 76 others get bail||A Delhi court on Thursday freed 60 Malaysians and another court allowed bail to 76 other foreigners who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi’s Nizammudin in violation of the lockdown and other government orders that banned religious congregations in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.In the court of metropolitan magistrate Siddharth Malik, the 60 Malaysians agreed to a plea bargain where they accepted the mild charges against them, in return for their freedom on a payment of a ₹7,000 fine against each of them, said their lawyer S Hari Haran. A plea bargain is an arrangement between the prosecutor and accused whereby the latter pleads guilty to a lesser charge in exchange for a more lenient sentence, or an agreement to drop other charges.During the cognisance of the charge sheets on July 6, the court was informed by the Investigating Officer (IO) that initially the accused were also investigated for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and criminal conspiracy to endanger life or personal safety of others. “However, till date during investigation no evidence has come against the foreigners for these,” the court noted in its July 6 order.Instead, they have plead guilty to the violations of the Epidemic Diseases Act, Disaster Management Act, prohibitory orders, disobeying orders from a public servant and other sections of the Indian Penal Code, all of which attracts a maximum of six months in prison. The Centre had already cancelled their visa and blacklisted them.According to Hari Haran, the complainants in the case--Sub-Divisional Magistrate of Lajpat Nagar, Additional Commissioner of Police at Lajpat Nagar and Inspector at Nizamuddin—did not object to their plea bargain applications.During the hearing, the foreigners were produced before the court and the concerned officials of their embassy were also present, said the counsel. Hari Haran told the court that the alleged offences were committed inadvertently and not without any mal intention and would not be repeated.The judge initially proposed a fine Rs 15,000 on each, which was brought down to Rs 7,000 after the lawyer pointed out that some of them were students and retired persons and won’t be able to afford it. Earlier, they were granted bail on July 7 on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 10,000 each.Meanwhile, Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Gurmohina Kaur also granted bail to 76 other foreigners from eight countries on a personal bond of ₹10,000 each. Their advocates, Ashima Mandala and Mandakini Singh, said the accused have also moved for a plea bargain. The police had filed charge sheets against 956 foreigners from 36 countries. They were also accused for offences under IPC sections 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 271 (Disobedience to quarantine rule).On Wednesday, the court had granted bail to 91 foreigners from 21 countries, who were charge sheeted for attending congregation.With Thursday’s order, 167 foreign nationals have been granted bail in the last two days.In another case, a sessions court in Mewat has upheld a trial court order striking down IPC sections 269 and 270 and specific sections of the Foreigners Act on 57 foreigners who had also attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation.The court of additional sessions judge (ASJ), Mewat, Prashant Rana in its July 6 order said that none of the accused knew that they had coronavirus infection. “Their testing was conducted after the registration of first information report. Even the investigating officer came to know about the infection of nine accused two days after the registration of FIR. Offences under sections 269 and 270 IPC were added merely on the basis of apprehensions and imaginations of the investigating officer,’’ the court said.The ASJ held that all the foreigners had valid passport and tourist visas.The court also asked the authorities to ensure safe return of the foreigners to their countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/60-malaysians-who-attended-tablighi-jamaat-meet-freed-76-others-get-bail/story-C3J4ZbYca6vqwadbjKcdfJ.html
10-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi dispensaries, polyclinics to start rapid antigen tests||The Delhi government on Thursday directed its dispensaries and polyclinics to begin testing for Covid-19 using the antigen-based method. The test will be available at the centres between 9am and 12 noon on working days, according to the order issued by Delhi’s director general of health services Dr Nutan Mundeja.An antigen is a foreign molecule that induces an immune response in the body, especially the production of antibodies, and detecting its presence determines a present infection.“With nearly 2,500 cases being reported each day, there are expected to be at least seven to eight direct and high-risk contacts (at home and workplace). Aggressive contact tracing and testing holds the key to ensure that the infection in controlled in its tracks effectively. This means we consistently need to test at least 20,000 people each day. Since the contacts can be in any part of the city depending on the movement of the patient, the testing facility will be made available at all identified dispensaries and polyclinics between 9am and 12 noon on all working days,” the order reads.The Delhi government runs over 250 dispensaries and 25 polyclinics.The focus will be on high-risk groups, such as those above the age of 65, patients undergoing chemotherapy, and those who are immunocompromised (such as HIV patients).Those with symptoms who test negative have to get an RT-PCR test done to rule out false negatives.The central district will also run a campaign to test rickshaw, auto, taxi and goods carrying truck drivers. Southeast district will set up a camp near Kotla Mubarakpur to ensure labourers and masons get tested. The North and East districts have to set up testing centres in Azadpur and Ghazipur mandi to test vendors and labour workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-dispensaries-polyclinics-to-start-rapid-antigen-tests/story-MqeLduYnF9gQjjnQb6KcpJ.html
10-07-2020||Delhi||BJP asks AAP to provide relief to traders on electricity charges||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s Delhi unit on Thursday reiterated its demand that the Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government provide relief to traders in the city by waiving off fixed charges on electricity.In a video-conference held with traders’ associations in the Capital, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta discussed the issues faced by the trading community due to the lockdown.Gupta said all the commercial establishments were closed during the lockdown, but still the discoms had sent provisional bills to traders and also charged fixed charges.Shri Adesh Gupta said the behaviour of the Delhi Government towards the interests of the people of Delhi had been very irresponsible even in times of crisis. The Delhi government did not take any action even on the problem of huge electricity bills given by discoms, he said.Gupta said, “Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal shouldn’t have imposed a financial burden on the people of Delhi. He should have provided maximum relief in the hour of this crisis. We demand that the government should direct discoms to remove fixed charges.”Training his guns at the Delhi CM, Gupta said, “Before becoming Delhi CM, Kejriwal used to protest against the previous government for increased electricity bills. Today, when people need relief in electricity bills, he should do something…We demand that subsidies should be restored, fixed charges should be withdrawn and actual bills should be sent after taking meter reading and withdrawal of electricity disconnection notices.”The AAP government did not respond to requests for a comment on the BJP’s charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-asks-aap-to-provide-relief-to-traders-on-electricity-charges/story-c0heeCgiPRj3j880vzFPUM.html
10-07-2020||Noida||Police roped in for contact tracing of Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad||Nearly four months after the first coronavirus (Covid-19) disease case emerged in the district, officials have decided to adopt a robust system of contact tracing of patients. Based on suggestions by the Uttar Pradesh government-appointed nodal officers, a three-member team has been formed under every police station area for effective contact tracing.Under the new system, three-member teams, comprising an official each from the health department, the administration and the police, have been formed, which will be notified if there is any positive case under the jurisdiction of the 18 police stations across the district.“Under the new system, the concerned officials will be connected to a social media group. Once we find a positive patient, we will immediately flash the information to the concerned social media group of the concerned police station area. From there, teams will contact the patient and ensure they are taken to the appropriate Covid hospital, and will also trace their contacts. This system will be more effective with the help of police presence,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.At present, a team of five-six doctors were stationed at the IDSP lab at the MMG Hospital, who contact positive patients and scrutinize their contact history.“In the earlier system, there was no physical contact with the positive patient and we had to rely on information supplied by him/her. Now, the teams will not only contact the patient but can physically go to meet the patient and take up their contact history in detail. Police presence will ensure that help of electronic surveillance is also taken up for contact tracing. Earlier, we took the police’s help in selected instances and only our team of doctors was in touch with the patient over the phone,” Dr Gupta added.The contact tracing is an important tool in checking the spread of the coronavirus disease, as it helps find out people who came in contact with the positive patient. It becomes vital as all the contacts need to be ascertained, verified and also tested, in case they contracted the virus from the positive patient.According to officials, the Ghaziabad district has an average of four-five contacts per positive patient. Sources in the health department said they have a list of about 81 patients who were tested positive but either provided wrong addresses or wrong contact numbers.“There are about 81 entries of such patients over the state portal. We are trying to trace them and will also take the police’s help in finding them. It could also be possible that they were residents of places outside the district and got themselves tested here,” the source said.Following the new contact tracing arrangement, the Ghaziabad police Thursday evening appointed 18 police officers as nodal officers who will be coordinating with the newly-formed teams. “The three-member team will also have one of our police officers, who have been designated as nodal officers, one each, for all 18 police station areas in the district. The task of the team will be to get in touch with patients and take up their contact history, besides getting them admitted to Covid hospitals and ensuring that sampling of the contacts is initiated at the earliest,” said Gyanendra Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (crime).“At present, we have a list of about 100 patients who need to be searched and could not be located as they provided wrong addresses or incorrect mobile numbers. We will also take the help of electronic surveillance to trace them and legal action will also be initiated against them for hiding their health status,” he added.Earlier in April, the Ghaziabad health department took the help of the police’s electronic surveillance methods for contact tracing after several employees of a Noida-based company – Ceasefire – came out positive and about 17 of them were listed as residents of Ghaziabad.The other major use of the police and electronic surveillance methods came into picture when the health department sought the help of tracing those who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat religious congregation in Delhi in March and had their addresses listed in Ghaziabad district. The event had turned out to become a super-spreader for Covid-19 across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-police-roped-in-for-contact-tracing-of-covid-19-cases/story-4w0gIQ3ERG4UGchwkoCKvN.html
10-07-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Reflected aesthetics||Some places evoke ethereal poems that have never been written, but which you’ve always been looking for in poetry anthologies.One of them is just here, in your own city, an auto ride away from home. Walking around this unnamed lake in central Delhi’s Sunder Nursery is like stepping into a nazm or a ghazal, the kind that could have been composed by a Ghalib of Delhi or a Hafez of Shiraz.This morning, the Nursery’s sprawling gardens are empty but for a few morning walkers from nearby Nizamuddin East, and a handful of gardeners. The place is looking like a Hindi movie set, in which you feel like singing and dancing with your lover. The hedges are crammed with dazzlingly colored flowers. Peacocks are brazenly flitting past pathways, like highway trucks. Birds are perched on the higher branches of a leafless tree.Yes, all of this is very beautiful — but it pales against the haunting beauty of the lake. Something seems to pierce through the surface —recalling the fate of the great Titanic. On approaching, one realizes that it is the reflection of the Lakkarwala Burj, the old monument that stands beside it.There are a few experiences in Delhi that you have to be part of at least once. A stroll about this lake is one of them. The adjacent Burj, and its reflection flickering in the water, appears to be a relationship that has been going on for hundreds of years. Which is an illusion. The early Mughal-era monument has been here since 16th century but the lake is new—it came into the world some years ago, as part of the Nursery’s ambitious renovation by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture.With grebes and spot billed ducks nesting by its edges, the lake was created around the lowest point in the Nursery to enable its utilitarian use as an rain water harvesting facility. Indeed, Sunder Nursery is like a panoramic painting in which a landscape of flowers, trees and monuments are crisscrossed with streams and channels.“We have a series of water bodies here,” confirms Ratish Nanda, CEO, Aga Khan Trust for Culture, India, explaining that the aquatic network starts with small channels in the eastern part of the complex, mimicking the river landscape and vegetation, and expands into a central lake, having lots of fish now, and finally drains into the large lake at the end of the central vista—which is the object of our affection.Water was an essential part of the Mughal landscape, Mr Nanda reminds. Of course, most of the 20 monuments in the Nursery date from the Mughal times. And Humayun’s Tomb, the first truly grand Mughal mausoleum in India, is just across the lane.Now, suddenly, a splashing sound. The image of the stone edifice that was so gloriously shimmering on the lake’s surface instantly disappears, as if somebody had spilled water color on a painting. A young gardener is wading towards the fountain installed in the center of the lake—to clean it of the floating algae and leaves.The monument soon returns to claim its place in the water.The Lakkarwala Burj’s imagery on the lake is not an accidental beauty. “It’s the doing of Shaheer Sir,” Mr Nanda says, referring to Muhammed Shaheer, the architect who designed the new Sunder Nursery. He died in 2015, three years before the parks were thrown open to the public. “He was an incredible landscape architect, who always wanted everything perfect,” says Mr Nanda. “He spent many days examining the vantage points to figure out how the reflections (of the monument as well as of the surrounding trees) would fall on the new lake.”There are steps leading into the water, and apparently are popular as a seating space among the visitors. But a true delight is availed only by walking around the lake. Like a parikrama that devotees perform by circling around Hindu temples, this circumambulation is an apt homage to a late architect’s passion for beauty and history. As well as a salutation to aesthetics that is as fragile as it is lasting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/reflected-aesthetics/story-zuy29uoJ9ktnMVpPs41jBK.html

The residents in the areas claimed that despite years of complaining, the civic body authorities have failed to find a solution and they are forced to face waterlogging troubles in just a few hours of rain.Waterlogging was witnessed at different points of the city including civil lines, Model town extension, Rishi Nagar, Chandigarh Road, Ferozepur Road, area near the clock tower, Janakpuri among other areas. The waterlogged roads also resulted in traffic jams at Ferozepur road, railway station road, SalemTabri among other areas.One of the residents of the Chhawani Mohalla area, Maninder Singh said, “The Domoria bridge area gets waterlogged every time, the city witnesses rainfall. It becomes difficult to cross the road, but the authorities are paying no heed to the problem. The councillor and MC officials are aware of the issue, but nothing has been done so far.”Potholed roads and traffic jams added to the woes of the residents, who have been demanding respite for a long time.“Deep potholes can be witnessed at Model Town Jawaddi road and Dugri road and it becomes even difficult to spot those after the roads get waterlogged,” said Dilpreet Singh, a resident of Dugri area.MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “The chronic areas have been identified in the city and a team has also been deputed at those spots to drain out the accumulated rainwater. The water accumulates in low lying areas, but the situation has improved from the past years.”Resident files complaint with CM officeIrked over rainwater accumulation at Chandigarh road, a resident of the Urban Estate Premjit Singh has given a complaint at the chief minister’s office.In the complaint, Singh stated, “We had purchased a house in one of the posh areas of the city, but waterlogging at Chandigarh road is taking a toll on the residents. Sewer water enters the houses and even the parks in the area are inundated after a brief spell of rain. Despite complaints submitted with the MC, no action has been taken in this regard till now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/heavy-rainfall-leaves-ludhiana-roads-waterlogged-commuters-face-tough-time/story-EhG0AZw4fLQl7kpZlEnRoK.html
10-07-2020||Pune||Pune RTO fixes fare charges, initiates action against ‘fake ambulances’||After the Pune Regional Transport Office (RTO) lodged an FIR against an ambulance service operator for overcharging a Covid positive patient, the RTO has revised fare charges for service providers in order to prevent patients from being fleeced. The transport office has also initiated a special drive on ‘fake ambulances’ running on the city roads.The revised fare rates decided by the RTO are applicable across the Pune district and it is mandatory for the service provider to display the rate card inside the vehicle. Rates are applicable from the boarding of the patient in the ambulance to the return journey of the driver. It is mandatory to have a GPS system in the ambulance. In addition, after every ride, the ambulance service provider must sanitise the vehicle from inside and out.The vehicle which was used in this case for transportation of the patient was actually a mobile van clinic turned into an ambulance without legal registration at Pune RTO. The ambulance driver charged Rs 8,000 for a 7 km journey from Bibwewadi to Karvenagar area.“When we got to know about the incident and got instructions from the Pune district collector to enquire about the issue, immediately a team of RTO inspectors was deployed to investigate. To our notice, it came that the vehicle which was used for transportation is not actually an ambulance but registered as a mobile clinic with the Pune RTO. The major difference in both the vehicles is that, for an ambulance, RTO tax needs to be paid every year and for this mobile clinic one-time tax is paid which is beneficiary for the owner. So we have seized the vehicle and lodged an FIR against the owner,” said Pune regional transport officer Ajit Shinde.The FIR has been lodged at the Bibwewadi police station against ‘Sanjivani ambulance services’ booked under relevant sections of the Disaster Management Act and the Motor Vehicle Act.“Currently there are only 21 registered mobile clinics vans under the Pune RTO and through this case, it has come to light some private players are using mobile clinic vans as an ambulance. So we are now going to deploy a special squad for checking of mobile clinics and other suspected ambulances across the city. And if anyone is committing such an offence then they will face the action. Also, Pune RTO has fixed the rates of the ambulance services in the city and if any ambulance service provider is overcharging from public then police complaint will be lodged against them,” added Shinde.BOXThe standard rates for Ambulance services set by the RTOType of ambulance Vehicle Maruti Van ambulance vehicleRate for first 2 hours or 25 kms Rs 500Rate per km (after 2 hours) Rs 11Rate per hour for waiting Rs 100Type of ambulance Vehicle Tata Sumo / Matador Van or similar type of ambulance vehicle build over the chassisRate for first 2 hours or 25 kms Rs 600Rate per km (after 2 hours) Rs 12Rate per hour for waiting Rs 125Type of ambulance Vehicle Tata 407 / Swaraj Mazada or similar type of ambulance vehicle build over the chassisRate for first 2 hours or 25 kms Rs 900Rate per km (after 2 hours) Rs 13Rate per hour for waiting Rs 150Helpline number on which patients can contact if ambulance service providers overcharge: 020-26058080 / 26058090||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-rto-fixes-fare-charges-initiates-action-against-fake-ambulances/story-ozKG43DPMsVy82TZV6YsBJ.html
10-07-2020||Pune||11 of 15 PMC ward offices report 1,000+ coronavirus cases||The Sars-COV2 virus that spreads Covid-19 is taking the entire city quickly into its grip with 11 of 15 wards registering over 1,000 positive cases. According to epidemiologists, this is an indication that the virus is spreading in most areas of the city as against only select areas that were hotspots earlier.During the lockdown after the city reported its first case on March 9, the positive cases were mainly concentrated in five regional ward offices including Bhavani peth, Kasaba Vishrambaug, Dhole Patil road, Ghole road and Yerwada-Kalas. Within these wards, only slums were the main hotspots throwing Covid cases.Interestingly, the wards which were earlier on top with maximum cases have come down with fewer per cent of cases being reported now. On the other hand, wards such as Kothrud, Aundh-Baner, which were in the green zone, have a higher rate of positive cases now.Despite the city already touching 24,168 cases till Wednesday, the administration and the health department has refused to acknowledge the community spread of virus.Divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar said, “The cases are now coming from all over the city. We do not go into technical things like whether it is community spread or not but it is true that large number of persons are becoming positive despite them not having contact with positive patients.”As per data shared by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), among the 10 ward offices to have crossed 2000-mark are Dhole Patil road and Kasaba Vishrambaug while regional ward offices which crossed the thousand figures are Yerawada, Hadapsar-Mundhwa, Bhavani peth, Ghole road, Sinhagad road, Wanowrie, Bibwewadi and Dhankawadi-Sahakarnagar. Another regional ward office, Warje-Karvenagar was at 997 cases and has crossed the 1000-mark by Thursday.Pune civic chief Shekhar Gaikwad said, “As unlock started and citizens movement increased, it was expected that the positive cases number would increase. Even it is true that cases are emerging in non-containment zones. The PMC is revisiting containment zones repeatedly and have given instructions to the regional ward offices to take calls at the local level and seal the buildings and lanes which are getting the maximum positive cases.”With the rising number of cases, there’s a growing demand for beds in hospitals amid complaints of unavailability.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sandeep Khardekar said, “We are demanding the PMC to introduce lock down again as the Covid-19 positive cases have emerged speedily in the past few days. I firmly believe that lockdown should be lifted slowly. Earlier, Kothrud and Aundh areas were in green zones but now they are becoming hotspots as citizens are not following rules and roaming without masks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/11-of-15-pmc-ward-offices-report-1-000-cases/story-cPZRSVJAogbvqcwWncpmdM.html

10-07-2020||Pune||Pune police on lookout for RTI activist booked for Rs 2 crore extortion||Ravindra Barhate, a right to information (RTI) activist, once known for going after land-related deals through RTI, is now himself in trouble after the police have filed a first information report (FIR) against him.The city police are currently searching for Barhate after his name was listed in the five people accused of extortion worth Rs 2 crore of a builder named Sudhir Karnataki.Barhate was booked along with a journalist, a suspended constable, a woman who alleged sexual assault by Karnataki, a local goon in a case registered at Kothrud police station.“He has filed for anticipatory bail. The court decision will be issued tomorrow (Friday) in the matter. He is currently eluding arrest. If the anticipatory bail is rejected and once we track him, we will be able to arrest him,” said Pornima Gaikwad, deputy commissioner of police, zone 3, Pune.According to the complainant, Barhate was among the five people who approached him and demanded Rs 2 crore extortion money along with a piece of land in Bhawani peth. The complainant has submitted that an allegedly false case of sexual assault was registered against, him by the woman among the group of five, as he failed to pay the money.However, this is not the first case against Barhate who also has a real estate business in the city.In 2016, a case of extortion was filed against Barhate at Bund Garden police station for alleged extortion worth Rs 5 crore. The complaint in the matter was lodged by city-based realtor Hemant Gavande, who happened to be whistleblower in Eknath Khade’s MIDC land case which forced the BJP leader to give up his ministership during 2016.Barhate had allegedly acquired information about Gavande’s projects through RTI and claimed that the land Gavande had developed belonged to the Agriculture College, Pune. The builder had alleged that Barhate had demanded Rs 5 crore in exchange for the withdrawal of the complaint.Barhate was often seen with Khadse when the latter was opposition leader in Maharashtra and alleged of 116 land scams collectively worth Rs 80,000 in the national media in 2014.In 2016, Barhate had raised government land grabbing allegation against the Panchshil Tech Park in which NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s daughter Supriya Sule was minority stakeholder. The police later filed a complaint against the realtorThe Panchshil realty group is owned by Atul and Sagar Chordia brothers who are also known for their partnership with US President Donald Trump’s realty project - Trump Towers - in Pune.In October 2018, BJP MLA Yogesh Tilekar was booked in a case of extortion of Rs 50 lakh registered at Kondhwa police station. The complaint was lodged by Barhate in the capacity of a manager at a local fibre optics company called Evision Teleinfra Private Limited.After the case, Senior police inspector Milind Gaikwad of Kondhwa police station was transferred from his position, leading to a protest outside the police station.Incidentally, the case was registered around two months after the owner of Evision Teleinfra Private Limited, Rahul Bhaskar Gangote, had approached the police with a similar extortion complaint against MLA and Shiv Sena leader Vinayak Nimhan.Members or supporters of a political party masquerading as RTI activists is not unheard of. However, some were pioneers of the act while the others are now following.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rti-activist-booked-for-rs-2-crore-extortion-has-multiple-cases-against-him/story-YbsDA76K8Ojkwe70VuXEJP.html
