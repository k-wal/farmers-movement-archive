Starting Monday, students of Class 10, studying in English and Marathi mediums, and students of Class 12, enrolled in the science stream, will get to watch six hours of educational content on the Jio mobile application. While the facility is currently limited to Jio users, the department said that it will be extended to all networks in the coming weeks. “The department will also roll out nine more channels for other classes and mediums so that students can benefit from it. These will be available 24x7, and students can view them as per their convenience,” said state education minister Varsha Gaikwad.Students can find a detailed timetable of the video classes on the official website of the Maharashtra State Council of Educational Research and Training (MSCERT) – maa.ac.in.On June 15, the state education department launched the new academic year for state board schools. Currently, most schools are conducting online classes for students, and in places where there is no access to technology, textbooks are being delivered to students’ homes.Teachers said that while internet-based channels are useful, they will not help in cases where there is no access. “Ultimately, all these channels also need an internet connection and good network. Some students who have no access to online classes will not be able to access these channels,” said a teacher of a city-based school.As per data released by the education department, nearly 26% of students in the state have no access to mobile phones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/education-department-launches-3-online-video-channels-9-more-in-the-pipeline/story-5FEgJjMtkO3UReiozfD2HI.html

A small crater has developed in the middle of the concrete road, while the layer beneath has flown in the nullah. The crater is temporarily filled with sand and the road is open for traffic.Santosh Kadam, chief of regional disaster management cell (RDMC), said, “The Khartan road opposite Thane College caved in around 11.30am on Sunday. A small crater has developed on the surface, while a patch of 20-feet base course of the road beneath the top layer has flown into the nullah. The road is above a nullah and near to the creek, thus due to the force of the water it caved in.”The work of repairing the road was undertaken. “We got two to three trucks of sand and filled the base of the road temporarily to fill the crater. The road has been open for traffic now,” he said.Meanwhile, a nullah wall also collapsed near MH High School in Thane, however, no one was injured in the incident. Waterlogging was also observed in a few places in the city.Kadam added, “A ten-feet nullah wall behind MH Highschool in Naupada fell due to heavy rain. A huge tree near the wall was in a dangerous condition and fell, taking the wall with itself in the nullah. Another nullah wall, 12 feet in height too fell in Chirag Nagar area,” Kadam informed.A portion of plaster and few bricks of Chitra Mahal Building in Rashid Compound Mumbra too collapsed though there were no injuries.Nineteen complaints of tree fall were reported in which two houses and five cars were damaged. Waterlogging was also seen in areas like Kopri, Dharmaveer Nagar, Vandana Society, Rajeev Gandhi Compound, Samata Nagar, Batwadi in Kisannagar, Jambli Naka and Majiwada.Heavy rains lashed Thane since Sunday morning.

05-07-2020||City||RT-PCR test positivity rate rises at alarming rate in Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad A large number of patients testing negative during rapid antigen testing have started testing positive during a follow up RT-PCR test in Ghaziabad, setting off alarm bells among district healthcare officials.According to health officials, the primary positivity rate for Covid-19 during antigen testing is about 3.52%, while subsequent positivity through RT-PCR tests is about 10.07% so far in the district.The Ghaziabad district at present has a total of 2,205 Covid-19 cases,and has witnessed 62 deaths. At least 843 people have been discharged from various hospitals and the district has 1,118 active cases, the highest across Uttar Pradesh as on July 4. The district was initially provided with 8,000 antigen kits on June 24, 11,000 more kits being provided for enhanced testing which started two days later.“So far, we have done 7,063 antigen sampling and 249 of these results were found positive, which puts the positivity rate at around 3.52% . When we took samples of 6,814 instances for getting confirmation of true negative, we found that 140 samples out of 1390 reports received so far, tested positive through RT-PCR test. The positivity rate jumped to about 10.07% , which is alarming,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.Approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), antigen tests look for specific protein associated with the Sars-Cov-2 virus, the pathogen that causes Covid-19. The new test, developed by a South Korean company, is highly specific (99.3% to 100%) — meaning a positive result on the test is a “true positive” and does not need any confirmatory test.The sensitivity is between 50.6% to 84% depending on the viral load, meaning those who test negative might still have the infection and are advised to go for a test through the more reliable RT-PCR method if they show symptoms of the disease.“A person testing negative during antigen testing isn’t necessarily virus-free. The subsequent sampling result (for finding true negative) shows that 10.07% persons are testing positive through the RT-PCR test. The infection, though mild, is a cause of concern if every 10 out of 100 tests that we do turn positive. The pending 5,424 samples that have gone for testing may have a similar positivity rate,” CMO added.The antigen testing at present is taken up primarily in trans-Hindon areas, which have a major share of containment zones.“We have also asked 12 teams to check the identity proofs and mobile number of persons whose xx tests are being done. The teams have been told to note down the ID proof numbers as well as ask the person to call them in order to verify his number. This is because we are not able to reach about 5 to 10% people whose tests were done. Their mobiles are either switched off or numbers found to be incorrect,” CMO added.With rise in number of cases, district officials are also now scampering to open up one more L1 hospital at IMS, Dasna, which is will have 325 beds. The district officials earlier this week had inaugurated a 250-bed Divyajyoti Hospital at Niwari and a Covid facility at SRM College campus, with 300 beds.According to the figures available with the state control room, the district till May 31 had 305 cases. The figures went up to 1,615 cases by June 30. During the first four days of July, at least 408 more cases have been added to the tally, with an average of little over 100 cases per day.The discharge rate is still on the lower side and this is the reasons why the health department is keen on opening more L1 Covid hospitals. The officials expect that after implementation of the new discharge guidelines, the discharge rate will rise.As per the new discharge guidelines issued on June 19, if an asymptomatic patient shows no symptoms, he/she can be discharged without undergoing any tests on the tenth day from the date of admission. But, such patients will have to remain in home quarantine for seven days after discharge from hospital.According to officials, the recovery rate of L1 category patients ranges from 8-16 days while L2 and L3 patients, having moderate to critical conditions, need full recovery before they can be discharged.“With rise in rate of positivity, there is another issue which has cropped up. Since Unlock 1, there have been a huge number of people going to different markets, workplace among other places. So, finding the source of infection is getting complicated with a rise in number of cases,” a health department official said. Earlier, there was major contribution of cross-border infection coming in from Delhi. “But now, cases are being found locally as people move about freely,” said the officer from the health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rt-pcr-test-positivity-rate-rises-at-alarming-rate-in-ghaziabad/story-rj6B4J4MjTh5gPdGbVVjfM.html

05-07-2020||City||Gurugram: SGT hospital gets nod for RT-PCR tests for Covid-19||Gurugram: The SGT Medical College Hospital and Research Institute in Chandu Budhera, located on the outskirts of Gurugram, will soon initiate reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests on its campus. The college had been awaiting approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) since the last couple of months, which was granted Friday. RT-PCR tests are used for detecting Sars-Cov-2 (the virus that causes the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease) in suspected patients and are often considered the gold standard in front-line testing for Covid-19, as per experts.Dr Mukesh Sharma, microbiologist, SGT College, said the college would be initiating the process soon. “We have received all necessary permissions from Chandigarh and the ICMR. Our lab can test up to 300-400 samples every day,” said Sharma. He added that he’d be visiting the chief medical officer (CMO) on Monday to apprise him of the development, before the college starts with the testing process.In its approval letter, the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, said that the college had been permitted to carry out the testing for Covid-19 by RT-PCR after it was found to have existing infrastructure, facilities for testing, and trained manpower, Eighty beds are reserved in the college for Covid-19 patients. Earlier, a quarantine facility was also set up for overseas travellers. Currently, at least four Covid-19 patients are admitted at SGT.A government lab for RT-PCR testing is already running at the Civil Hospital in Sector 10. The lab has a capacity for 300 samples. Besides these, the government lab at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) Rohtak, and seven private labs are available for testing in the city.Gurugram chief medical officer Dr Virender Yadav said the health department was making all efforts to ramp up testing. He said trial runs for the upcoming second RT-PCR lab at the Civil Hospital were underway and the facility could start full-fledged anytime this week. “With the second lab, we would have an in-house capacity of 500 samples. We want that sooner or later, all samples are tested at government facilities entirely. We are prepared for it and reports are already coming in within 24 hours now,” said Yadav.The health department is also carrying out antigen tests across different pockets of Gurugram. The department aims to scale up antigen testing up to 2,000 in coming days, said Yadav. Besides RT-PCR and antigen testing, the health department has also been using the TrueNat test for critical cases and pregnant women, who delivered through caesarean sections. It is also used for Covid-19 detection in people who are brought dead to the hospital. Like RT-PCR, throat and nasal swabs are collected for TruNat test in the viral transport medium (VTM) with virus lysis buffer, which inactivates the virus, after which the test is conducted on RT-PCR chips. These chips are inserted inside the TrueNat diagnostic tool.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-sgt-hospital-gets-nod-for-rt-pcr-tests-for-covid-19/story-ubE3avSolu81yDbcG8rH8I.html

05-07-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai may get heavy rain today, says IMD||Incessant downpour over the weekend led to the second highest 24-hour July rain over the past five years in the city.After three days of heavy to very heavy rain, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) revised its forecast for Monday by issuing a yellow alert for all Konkan districts, including Mumbai, and predicted the possibility of heavy rain across isolated areas. Earlier, the weather bureau had not issued any warning for Monday. “Models have indicated moderate rain with intermittent heavy rain to continue on Monday but the intensity of rain is likely to be lesser than Friday to Sunday,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD.Between 8.30am on Saturday and 8.30am on Sunday, the Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded 200.8mm rain, falling under the ‘very heavy’ category.Last year, the city had recorded 375.2mm rain on July 2, which is the highest 24-hour July rain since 2015. In 2018, it was 184.3mm on July 10, 163.4mm in 2017 on July 18, 114.5mm in 2016 on July 30, and 61mm in 2015 on July 21.Over the past decade, however, more rain was recorded in 2013 (215.6mm on July 24) and 2014 (207.2mm on July 3). The all-time high 24-hour July rain was recorded on July 27, 2005 that led to 944.2mm.Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 129.6mm rain between 8.30am Saturday and 8.30am Sunday.On Sunday, the suburbs woke up to intense heavy rain with 95.4mm over a span of 3-hours (8.30am to 11.30am) that later increased to 103.9mm over 12 hours (8.30am to 8.30pm). South Mumbai recorded intermittent light showers of 11.2mm during the same time. Majority of Sunday’s rain was concentrated towards parts of the suburbs, central Mumbai, and outskirts of the city. Thane recorded 179.4mm rain.Over the past 60 hours (8.30am Friday to 8.30pm Sunday), Mumbai suburbs recorded 461.7mm rain while south Mumbai recorded 309.2mm rain.Thane recorded the highest rain across the Konkan region and the state over 24-hours at 377mm, which falls under the exceptionally heavy category.IMD classifies 15.6-64.4 mm as moderate rain while 64.5-115.5 mm rain as heavy, 115.6-204.4 mm as very heavy, and over 204.5 mm as extremely heavy rain.“North Konkan, including Mumbai, witnessed an active phase of the southwest monsoon over the past three days with continuous showers and extremely heavy rain in some areas. The impact of widespread rain activity led to overall excess rainfall for majority of the weather stations,” Hosalikar.Mumbai suburbs currently recorded 15% excess rain for the season while south Mumbai has recorded excess of 29%. The city has so far recorded 489mm rain (from July 1 to July 5, 8.30pm), which is 58% of the month’s average rainfall (840.7mm). The city had recorded 395mm rain in June, which was the lowest monthly rain in five years. However, with continuous downpour, the city has so far (from June 1 to July 5, 8.30pm) received almost 38% of its seasonal average rain (883.5mm of 2,317mm).Independent meteorologists said weather systems responsible for heavy rain over Mumbai were expected to move northwards towards south Gujarat leading to decline in rain intensity for the city. “Massive cloud bands in the Arabian Sea, as a result of the offshore trough, along with strong westerly winds led to these rains over three days. Now, there are chances of intermittent moderate showers for Mumbai on Monday while major rain intensity will be felt in Gujarat coast owing to a low-pressure system in Arabian Sea located close to Gujarat,” said Professor Sridhar Balasubramanian, department of Mechanical Engineering and IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-may-get-heavy-rain-today-says-imd/story-xDPPgCnmcZFqTq3QMO1vFM.html
05-07-2020||City||DTCP recommends FIR against developer for non-functional lifts in Gurugram society||Gurugram:The department of town and country planning (DTCP) on Saturday recommended that a case be registered against promoters the and maintenance agency of SARE Homes project in sector 92 for failing to maintain the lifts, and violating license conditions, among other issues. It also decided to initiate action against residents who were not paying maintenance charges . District town planner RS Bhath said that a notice was issued to the developer earlier to ensure that repair works were done by Saturday, but they failed to do so. “The department is constrained to recommend an FIR be registered against the stakeholders responsible for this issue as lives of residents could be in danger. I will be sending the documents in this regard to concerned police station by Sunday evening. The matter is also under the notice of director, town and country planning, “ he said. As per the phase-3 residents association, the developer handed over 400 flats out of the 828. At present, 250 families are living in towers 1 to 7 and in 14. “Every tower has two lifts and one of these are not working in each tower. The annual maintenance contract expired on February 28 along with the no-objection certificate. The fire equipment too are not working,” said Aditya Jakhar, president of the association. Jakhar alleged that residents often got stuck in the lifts. “And neither is the sewage treatment plant functional nor is the rainwater harvesting system working. Authorities must act against the developer,” he said. Pravin Malik, president, SARE Homes RWA phases 1 and 2, said, “The authorities must monetize the bank guarantees offered by the developer to complete the leftover work.” Referring to the demands by residents, Bhath said that all issues would be considered to find a solution. “We have called for action even against those project residents who have not been paying the common area maintenance charges (CAM),” he said.A spokesperson for SARE Home Developers said that the phase 3 residents were paying CAM of ₹2.08 to the third party maintenance agency but that residents were not paying the annual maintenance charge (AMC) of around ₹11 lakh for the lifts.“The AMC of lifts and other equipment like STP etc were paid last year and now have to be renewed. To avoid disruption of services and to insulate them from company issues, it was mutually decided that residents pay directly to the facility services provider. Same has been functioning well for phase 1&2. However, phase 3 residents are insisting that the company pay the AMC. However, Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (H-Rera) has freezed the accounts of the company. A mitigation plan for same has been submitted to H-Rera and they have been requested to release some funds towards renewal of AMC,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dtcp-recommends-fir-against-developer-for-non-functional-lifts-in-gurugram-society/story-iTVyJE5ZxQgC47tT8WaqZO.html
05-07-2020||City||Noida: Developers get six months more to deliver flats||NOIDA: In the wake of Covid-19 pandemic, the Uttar Pradesh government has given six months more to the developers of the group housing projects, which are covered under the zero period policy. Now, such developers can deliver the flats to homebuyers by the end of December next year instead of earlier deadline of June 30, 2021.The developers had demanded the additional time so that they can finish their projects while taking benefits of the ‘interest waiver’ policy. Under zero period policy, a builder can claim interest and penalty waivers for the period when construction at a realty project was disrupted due to legal issues. In December last year, the government had launched the scheme in order to give interest waivers to builders. “We will provide the builders six months’ additional time as per the state government’s directions,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer, Noida authority. The move is aimed to benefit over one lakh apartment buyers in the twin cities of Noida and Greater Noida, officials said.There are at least 100 housing projects in Noida alone, which were mired by court cases between farmers and the Noida authority that delayed the projects. “We had demanded from the government to give us more time to deliver the housing projects because the construction was affected due to lockdown restrictions for the past three months. Now, the developers can finish their projects in the stipulated time period,” said RK Arora, UP president of National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO), a developers’ group.The authority had allotted the housing land to developers after accepting 10% of the land cost. The remaining 90% land cost is paid in instalments in seven years. The authority also charges 9.5% interest on the remaining land dues, the officials said. But due to slowdown in the real estate sector, the developers have failed to pay dues on time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-developers-get-six-months-more-to-deliver-flats/story-9z0nmZFjTh9B21vAfDUmGK.html

Taking cognizance of the incident, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed the district magistrate and the senior superintendent of police to rush to the spot and submit a report by Sunday night.Officials of the fire department said the factory had a mass of hydrocarbons and manufactured items stocked at the complex which caught fire around 4pm on Sunday. Fire officials, asking not to be named, said the factory had no permission to operate.Teams of forensic experts were roped in to ascertain the exact cause of fire.“The CM has taken cognisance of the incident and asked us to conduct an immediate inquiry. We have found laxity on part of the local police post in-charge as he was prima facie expected to have knowledge about the operation of the factory. The CM has directed for compensation of Rs 4 lakh each to the families of the victims. I have also directed for a magisterial inquiry. An FIR will also be lodged against the person who was operating the factory and they will be sent to jail,” district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey told reporters at Bakharwa village.Local residents, meanwhile, alleged that the factory was being allegedly operated illegally by one Nitin Chaudhary and his partner Momeen, and there had also been a police raid conducted about a fortnight ago but the operations continued unabated.“There were no safety measures here and the factory had no licence. It was operating illegally. There were 25 to 30 women who were employed here as workers and even children used to work here. There was a raid at the factory several days ago but it continued operations. The local police had information of the operation of the factory,” said Bhupender Kumar, a resident of the village, alleged.Following the incident, Ghaziabad administration and police officials rushed to the spot. Later, the residents blocked the way of ambulances which were roped in to ferry the victims to medical facilities and also raised slogans against officials.“The residents demanded strict action as the factory operations had continued unchecked. My aunt had been working here for the past one year, supporting her family which had four children. She was given a job at Rs 4,500 per month. On Sunday, she went for work at 8am and later we found out that she had died in the fire. About 15 days ago, cops had raided the factory but operations continued. The land belongs to a villager and the factory is operated by someone else,” said Sahil, nephew of one of the victims.“After the fire started, many women got stuck in the factory and an earthmoving machine had to demolish the walls to pull them out. The factory owner was manufacturing party poppers here while some work related to repacking the items was given to villagers at their homes. The owner had also roped in boys aged 15 to 19 years for distribution of goods to nearby areas,” he added.Ghaziabad SSP Kalanidhi Naithani late Sunday night said: “The factory was illegal as we have found no documents or records of its operation or permission. There is laxity on the part of local police post in-charge. The villagers must have gone to him with verbal complaints and he should have informed senior officials but he did not. The circle officer and sub-divisional magistrate went later to conduct a raid, and the police-post in-charge was suspended after the incident,” the SSP said.“In all, we have eight deaths including seven women and a young man aged about 18 years. The factory was manufacturing party poppers but these also had chemical components stored. This led to explosion and fire,” SSP added.Sanjay Kumar, another resident whose wife, Geeta, sustained severe burn injuries, said she had been going to work for the past one month and was paid Rs 200 per day.“Since I do wall painting work, which shutdown during the lockdown, I sent her to work at the factory. Her hands and face suffered burn injuries in the fire. At present, she is the one who has been supporting the entire family, including me and our three children,” he added.Modinagar MLA Dr Manju Siwach also surveyed the spot. “The factory was manufacturing party poppers which are used for birthday celebrations. The work was going on illegally and explosive chemicals which were also stored, caught fire,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-8-charred-to-death-in-fire-at-illegal-factory-cm-seeks-report/story-93A0mLzlGQWmE0JmaeaOKN.html

05-07-2020||City||Child labour cases rise in June||Noida: With the gradual lifting of restrictions, cases of child labour and missing children have seen a steady rise in June compared to the lockdown months.In June, six child labour related cases were reported to the Childline in Gautam Budh Nagar compared to none in April and two in May. There were 18 such cases in March before the first phase of lockdown was announced to contain the Covid-19 spread.“As the situation is coming back to normal, these issues will keep on increasing. With more restrictions being lifted, the number of child labour cases will also be on the rise,” said Satya Prakash, programme manager, FXB India Suraksha, an NGO that manages the helpline in GB Nagar.Childline – 1098 – is a 24x7 helpline number for children in distress.Prakash said that most of these cases were from the unorganised sector establishments like local eateries or grocery shops, though one case was of an underage domestic help.“Most of the migrants who had left for their home towns are now coming back. Even though many of them are avoiding coming back with families, a few will use all members, including children, to earn some money. Besides, the closure of schools due to the pandemic is also adding to the problem,” he said.The cases of missing children have also gone up from five in April and four in May to 12 in June.“On average, we receive about 1,100 intervention calls in a year. However, the figure will definitely be much higher this year as the patterns suggest,” said Prakash.Police officials admitted that there is a rise in the child labour cases in the district. “On Friday itself we had two tip-offs for child labour cases in Greater Noida. As economic activities resume, more such instances might come to light,” said Vrinda Shukla, deputy commissioner of police (women and child safety).PK Singh, district labour commissioner, said, “We have a task force which acts on the information about child labour cases. We coordinate with anti-human trafficking unit, Childline, and police, and conduct raids if the need be. The rescued children are then taken to shelter homes for counselling, and are presented before the Child Welfare Committee before being sent back to their families.”The number of help calls to the Childline had more than doubled in April in the beginning of the lockdown. Most of these revolved around requests for nutrition of children.“Needy people were receiving food from various social organisations or the government. But we were receiving requests for milk and baby food. We are still receiving such requests. It is a new pattern and wasn’t there before the lockdown,” said Prakash.The total number of intervention calls, which also include counselling of children, among others, also went up to 28 in June compared to 20 in April and 24 in May, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/child-labour-cases-rise-in-june/story-7oDzLfO1x6UN0b3mMucNLI.html
05-07-2020||City||Noida: Gaur City residents put up ‘mask bank’ at entry points to lower Covid risk||Noida: In a bid to minimise the risk of infection of the Sars-Cov-2 virus in their society, the residents of Gaur City in Greater Noida West have started ‘mask banks’ within the township. The initiative was taken by a resident volunteer group called ‘sathi haath badhana’, which was created in March after the national lockdown was imposed, to distribute food and ration among migrants though the police. Residents said this is being done to keep their society safe from the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease, given the rising number of cases in the city. As on Sunday, the total number of Covid-19 cases in Gautam Budh Nagar reached 2,646, of which 972 are active cases.Under the mask bank, one box, each with a hundred face masks, would be placed at all seven entry points of Gaur City-1 and anyone entering without masks would be given a mask and asked to wear them.“There are over 5,000 families in Gaur City-1 across seven high-rises. The apartment owners’ association of every society were roped in and a box, each containing 100 masks, placed at each of the entry points, and every day they will be refilled by the volunteers. They are normal facemasks and come at a nominal cost, however, given the current scenario, they carry far more important value” said Amit Sharma, a resident of Gaur City and member of the volunteer group. He added that three new cases of Covid-19 were detected in the township on Saturday, after which the decision was taken.The township is divided into two sectors. Volunteers said that they will soon initiate the ‘mask bank’ at Gaur City-2 as well.“Several positive cases of Covid-19 were found from Gaur City and there are numerous floors sealed due to them being designated containment zones. It’s thus important to take all precautions. While sanitisers are already kept at the entrances, we also gave masks. If someone enters without a face mask, the guard will give them one, and ask to bring their own next time,” said Anita Prajapati, another resident who volunteered to form the mask bank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-gaur-city-residents-put-up-mask-bank-at-entry-points-to-lower-covid-risk/story-DozKyNsHB7ck7ssEtcSbuM.html

The CM had stated recently that if the people of Baroda want a stake in the government, they should vote for the BJP-JJP candidate in the upcoming bypoll. Khattar has failed to undertake development work in Baroda constituency in the last six years after assuming office for the first time in 2014”, Hooda said adding that the state debt increased from ₹60,000 crore to ₹2 lakh crore during the BJP government in Haryana.He said considering the demand of the family members of the two slain policemen, the government should give them an ex gratia compensation of ₹1 crore each and a government job.Two policemen were murdered while patrolling their area in Gohana in Sonepat, on Monday night.BJP-JJP leaders woo votersThe BJP and its coalition partner the Jannayak Janata party leaders have started village-level canvassing to woo voters.

I have been interacting with party workers to know their well being amid coronavirus crisis. The people of Haryana are happy with the functioning of the BJP-JJP coalition government and they will oust Congress from Baroda,” said Ajay Chautala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hooda-dares-khattar-to-contest-baroda-bypoll/story-nB4UQiG4DWpk4JWFADR7JK.html

In a veiled attack, he flayed the Shiromani Akal Dal (SAD) for “dumping” the panthic agenda, during the daily discourse that is aired live on a Punjabi channel.Rode, who is the nephew of slain militant leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, was the Akal Takht jathedar when the militancy was at its peak in Punjab.“This is our bad luck that the Sikhs have abandoned their distinctiveness. Akali word was taken from the historical slogan ‘Akal Purakh ki fauj’. This word has been excluded. Now, they say that we have become Punjabi... the party has become Punjabi,” he said.“Will you be able to launch an agitation today as you did in the past? Today, we are being oppressed. Sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib is being committed,” he said in an indirect reference to the Akali Dal.“On July 4, 1955, police and military entered Darbar Sahib complex with shoes. They used arms and killed many Sikhs. Bhim Sen Sachar was Punjab’s chief minister, while Jawaharlal Nehru was the prime minister,” he said.Notably, his address did not catch the attention of even the intelligence agencies officials who were camping at Golden Temple in the wake of Khalistan ideologue Gurpatwant Singh Pannu-led Sikhs For Justice (SFJ)’s call for starting registration for ‘Referendum 2020’. Now, his address is being linked to the campaign being run by Pannu, who was declared a terrorist by the Union government recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/from-sgpc-stage-jasbir-rode-flays-sad-for-dumping-panthic-agenda/story-h0ZZfHWKe42aVlOcCCQAfP.html

Based on analysis and evaluation, a report will be prepared by IQAC which we expect to submit by next week.”According to the IQAC, the evaluation will be category-wise as done by the NIRF. The university will evaluate score and performance in engineering, pharmacy, management and overall rankings of the university for the last five years.Every parameter will be examined in each category. This year, PU’s score in teaching, learning and resources, which includes its total student strength, faculty-student ratio and financial resources, dropped as well. Its score in research and professional practice, graduation outcome; outreach and inclusivity, and perception also slipped.After evaluating the data, IQAC will also make recommendations. “Our aim is to analyse all positive and negative points.

A cave-in was also witnessed at Saggu Chowk, where the rain left a 20-ft long and 15-ft deep crater in the middle of the road.Food and civil supplies minister and area MLA Bharat Bhushan Ashu, along with Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation (PSIEC) chairman and area councillor Gurpreet Singh Gogi and MC officials reached the spot to find the reasons behind the cave-in.‘DRILLING FOR LAYING FIBRE CABLES CAUSING CAVE-INS’Area councillor Gogi said drilling of roads to lay fibre optic cables by private telecommunication companies is leading to road cave-ins. “It has been observed that while laying these cables, the sanitation pipes get punctured, causing seepage and ultimately resulting road collapse. However, the area has been dug up to find out any other leakages that need plugging,” added Gogi.RESENTMENT AMONG RESIDENTSWhile there was no untoward outcome of the road cave-in, the incident caused a lot of resentment among the area residents. They claimed that it was the third time that the road had collapsed near the chowk, but nothing has been done to stop such incidents from occurring.Sources said no money has been allotted to develop the road under the smart city project. It is an important connecting route for residents living in Hambra, Haibowal, Rishi Nagar and Kitchlu Nagar areas with the rest of the city. The road is widely used to rush patients to Dayanand Medical College and Hospital from Ferozepur Road.“What more is one to expect? The first rainfall of monsoon and the city has already begun to see road cave-ins and waterlogging,” rued Hardeep Singh, while showing the crater.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/overnight-rain-in-ludhiana-leads-to-waterlogging-road-cave-in/story-Ct8Tzz7ZiriyXp698yTerN.html

He, however, said that it was a welcome move as students’ safety is the first priority.Authorities at Punjabi University, meanwhile, are waiting for strictures from the University Grants Commission before deciding their own criteria on the basis of the guidelines issued by director public instructions (DPI) of colleges, Punjab.A professor said the university is yet to declare the results of several undergraduate and postgraduate courses for December-2019 semester.“Even the internal assessment for May semester is incomplete as the second leg of mid-semester tests, which are considered for internal evaluation, are yet to be conducted,” the professor added.As per the directions of DPI (colleges), all the students in terminal or exit classes or semesters will be awarded degrees on the basis of their average grades, marks or CGPA of their previous exams or semesters. Students in intermediate classes will also be promoted to the next classes on the same criteria.Punjabi university registrar Prof Manjit Singh Nijjar said the university has only received a communiqué from the state government so far. “The university has to wait for final guidelines and directions from the UGC before deciding on the criteria for declaring results,” Prof Nijjar said.STUDENTS WELCOME MOVEAjaib Singh, president of democratic students’ organisation, said the government has taken a “pro-student” decision as it won’t be easy for students to come and take final exams amid the pandemic.“Moreover, the government has provided provisions for the students to improve their scores when the situation gets better,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-profs-say-promoting-students-on-basis-of-previous-exams-will-be-cumbersome-task/story-J0VUhQE1MQTqTuH7cAn6ZP.html

There are reasons for it. First, the current border tension between Indian and China and secondly the poor-quality material supplied by Chinese firms. China has used India for dumping its medical equipment. Majority of its N-95 masks and PPE kits were of poor quality and did not meet the standards. The filter on these Chinese masks used to get detached easily and was made of substandard material,” said Manjit.Similarly, PPE and N-95 mask manufacturer Avneesh Aggarwal said Ludhiana industry has both the potential and expertise to manufacture better quality face masks and PPE kits.The need to put a barcode, lot number and place of manufacturing was felt as many people were importing products from China and selling them in the market, said Avneesh Aggarwal. “But following the killing of our soldiers, people started boycotting Chinese-made goods. We were receiving feedback that people were asking about the place of manufacturing. So, we decided highlight our products with ‘Made in India’ tags,” he added.Another manufacturer Ujjwal Miglani said they were receiving direction from buyers to mandatorily attach made-in-India logos on the products made by the firm. “Not only customers, but the labourers working in the factory do not want to use any product made in China. This anti-China sentiment is proving to be blessing in disguise and will give push the MSME industry of the city.” said Miglani.Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO) textile division head Ajit Lakra said, “The anti-China sentiment is dominating every sector of the industry. But we have to keep in mind that over the years we have greatly depended on China in terms of machinery. While software could be replaced overnight, glitches in machinery cannot be fixed without technical support. So the government should encourage subsidised technology exchange with countries like Taiwan, Korea and Japan in order to eliminate dependence on China.”He added that the government has laid down stringent guidelines for manufacturing of PPE kits and face masks. “As per the new guidelines, the manufacturer has to mention the barcode and lot number of the product being made,” said Lakra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-manufacturers-add-made-in-india-labels-to-ppe-kits-masks/story-OttlflENVbGzfFH3PBGvUN.html

While devotees started visiting the shrine on June 9 after online registrations were started, they are still not allowed to offer prasad.Meanwhile, the shops selling the offering, located on the way to the temple, remain decked out, but have no takers.“Our sales are directly dependent on offerings. For us, the unlock period is similar to the lockdown period. There is no relief,” said Pankaj Shukla, who opens his shop at 8am and shuts it at 5pm, earning hardly anything. Shukla, who is also the general secretary of Mata Mansa Devi Market Shopkeepers’ Union, said selling prasad was the only source of livelihood of over 150 people here. “A large quantity of perishable items had to be dumped, causing huge losses,” he said.Union’s president Surinder Manchanda said they had urged the shrine board’s CEO to allow sale of sanitised prasad packets and reopen the small gates next to the booths.Hansaj, who has three shops, said, “Our family has been running shops here since 1975. Earlier my grandfather used to look after the business, which was eventually handed down to me. We never saw days like these when devotees couldn’t offer prasad. If they can offer money, why not prasad?”“Before the pandemic, I would earn around Rs 30,000 on Sundays and Rs 5,000 on weekdays. This has come down to Rs 50-100 per day now,” he said.Somnath Kharbanda, who has been running two shops for over three decades, said it was only during the 1984 curfew that they last had to shut down their shops for a few days.Nestled in the Shivalik foothills, the temple complex is spread over 100 acres. Constructed during the early 19th century by Maharaja Gopal Singh, it is one of the most renowned Shakti temples in North India.However, its doors were closed for devotees since the nationwide lockdown was imposed in March to contain the spread of Covid-19. The temple was reopened on June 9 and entry is now allowed only for those who register themselves on www.mansadevi.org.in.Because of the pandemic, the decision was taken not to accept offerings from outside. Besides, bhandaras, dharamshalas and mundan ghat also remain closed.Every devotee needs to wear a face mask and stand on earmarked spots. Entry is allowed only after proper sanitisation of hands and feet and thermal screening.People aged above 65 years and below 10 years, those with comorbidities and pregnant women are advised not to visit the temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ban-on-prasad-shopkeepers-near-mansa-devi-temple-praying-for-better-days/story-Y2xGTVQIG6BgKuSkCfNr3K.html

Municipal commissioner Bikram Shergill on Sunday said the proposal to use lakes will be beneficial for the city.“As per the plan, water from the defunct power facility lakes will be flown to the waterworks site through a pipe. If needed, water treatment will be installed at these lakes for better supply management,” said the official.Ever since the government announced to put a curtain on the power plant that was established in 1974, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), employees of state power department and various factions of Bhartiya Kisan Unions have been protesting against the decision. They demand the revival of the facility.Finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, who also represents Bathinda (urban) assembly segment, has invited political wrath for backtracking on his pre-poll stand of reviving the plant. For a population estimated 3.5 lakh, Bathinda has 53,510 registered water subscribers. Sources say GNDTP’s lakes have a water holding capacity of 500MGD and it will be beneficial in the long term.Officials say when the canal is closed for maintenance for 20-days each before sowing of kharif and rabi crops, water supply time gets half to two hours in a day.Former SAD legislator from Bathinda Sarup Chand Singla said the city had never witnessed a crisis-like situation and the existing public water system has enough capacity to meet the demand.“Manpreet is trying to deviate public attention from the closure of power plant and plan to dismantle chimneys which are a landmark of development of the neglected part of south Malwa,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bathinda-mc-prepares-blueprint-for-using-assets-of-defunct-thermal-plant/story-Za6xo59vinCrGjo1lg5TDM.html

Of 138 blocks in the state, 110 are overexploiting the groundwater.Agriculture secretary KS Pannu said: “Earlier, it was not successful because of different agronomic practices being followed in paddy and wheat cultivation. With DSR, agronomy is the same and it is the right time to introduce rain gun method. Punjab needs to shift to rain gun method as it is cost effective. It costs about ₹20,000 per acre as against ₹1 lakh for drip irrigation. However, rain gun is not successful for cotton, for that drip irrigation is better,” he said.Pannu has asked the officials in all districts to promote the method. “For maize crop, funds for trials are available with the agriculture department. For sugarcane, which guzzles as much water as paddy, cane commissioner has been asked to liaise with sugar mills and district soil conservation officers for promoting rain gun technology,” Pannu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/agri-dept-for-rain-gun-irrigation-on-paddy-sown-through-direct-seeding/story-F2t3rb0JchGPWhWieytEcN.html

The high court bench of justice HS Madaan dismissed a plea filed by a deputy commandant, Border Security Force (BSF), Western Command, RS Hundal, against his transfer, observing that it is for an employer to see where he requires services of the employee. “… an employee especially member of a paramilitary force is supposed to maintain strict discipline and cannot dictate terms in that regard keeping his personal interest in view rather than showing a willingness to serve, where he is posted, especially at this juncture when the country is facing hostilities by the neighbouring countries at border,” the bench added.Hundal, 58, approached the high court on June 24, challenging his transfer from Chandigarh to Anupgarh (Rajasthan), alleging that transfer order was in violation Covid-19 instructions barring movement of officers as well as BSF rules. He had informed the court that he is due to retire on December 31, 2022 and on attaining the age of superannuation, he cannot be sent to a faraway place in view of the fact that there is no administrative exigency.He was posted as deputy commandant in May 2017 and now transferred with March 24 order. The court was told that he has two children — son studying in Class 12 and daughter doing Master of Arts — and there is nobody to look after them except him. A representation stating that same was submitted on January 16, 2020.The BSF had told court that the petitioner’s representation was submitted to headquarters in Delhi. As of his new posting, he had given a few choices in 2019 for new posting, some could not be entertained due to his age and others due to administrative reasons and therefore, he was given this posting for which he gave oral consent and never represented against it.It was also informed that he stands relieved on June 12. He could have remained here for three years only and if allowed extension of another 2.6 years, his tenure would go beyond five years, which can’t be allowed as per administrative rules. He had also not applied for terminal posting. Further, he had served in Mohali, near Chandigarh, for 165 days (August 2015 and May 2017), before taking up the Chandigarh posting. As of movement of officers during Covid-19 now there is no restriction.Dismissing the plea, the bench observed that the petitioner has been unable to point out mala-fide in his transfer and Covid-19 guidelines also do not help the officer. The family circumstances are not that compelling requiring his immediate presence with the family for most of the time, the bench added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/transfer-an-incidence-of-service-not-act-of-punishment-hc-to-bsf-officer/story-zn0M9sQ9Ii6jMYk3sjYkfL.html

There are different angles and intricacies involved but we are on the case.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jammu-cremation-ground-deaths-zadoo-family-awaits-details-of-probe/story-tPcwJNwDrfVgLSTd9TTw3L.html
05-07-2020||Chandigarh||Transport light point most dangerous intersection in Chandigarh||With seven fatal accidents, the transport light point in Sector 26 remained the most dangerous intersection in the city in 2019, as per the traffic police data. The fatalities included five pedestrians and two motorists.The light point is used mostly by outstation traffic, heading out from Chandigarh towards Haryana and Himachal side. The light point is also in close proximity to the entrance of Bapu Dham Colony (BDC) and the Transport Area in Sector 26.Explaining why it has become one of the most dangerous intersections in the city over the years, general secretary of the Chandigarh Transport Association, BL Sharma, said, “A lot of traffic from Punjab going towards Haryana and Himachal comes from this light point, making it very busy and dangerous. Challaning drives carried out here, especially for speeding, fetch good results.”Local area councillor Dalip Sharma added, “The entrance to Bapu Dham has made the lightpoint a busy intersection. We had made pedestrian paths here but people don’t always walk on those. The area is also dimly lit at night and we have only recently installed lights from here to the entrance of BDC to make the road safer.” Sharma added that he had also written to the UT chief architect to increase the width of the road till Bapu Dham Colony entrance by 5 feet on each side as the route gets congested during peak hours.Deputy inspector general of police (DIG, traffic) Shashank Anand said that the traffic police have recommended to the UT engineering department to install table top speed breakers, similar to the ones used at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, to bring down fatalities here.Punjab traffic advisor Navdeep Asija pointed out how even this year, the Sector 32 roundabout had recorded zero fatalities. “Traffic calming devices are the way forward, and table top breakers here can make this intersection much safer,” he said.DAKSHIN MARG, MADHYA MARG MOST DANGEROUS ROADSDakshin Marg and Madhya Marg were the most dangerous roads in the city in 2019 with 18 and 14 fatalities respectively. Around 30% of the total 104 fatalities in the city took place on these two roads and 45% of the total accidents involving two-wheelers also happened here.Speaking about the problem, member, National Road Safety Council, Government of India, Kamal Soi said, “These are both major roads where speeding takes place. Traffic calming devices, such as rumble strips and speed breakers, can be made here with proper engineering to curb speeding.”DIG Anand added that by slowly switching from manual challaning to e-challaning, the traffic police were improving the implementation of traffic rules to bring down the road fatalities. He added they had made a temporary median on the road connecting Sector 25 and 38 West to bring down collisions. They have also started challaning those who stop on these roads to reduce traffic bottlenecks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/transport-light-point-most-dangerous-intersection-in-chandigarh/story-X4UlMf6kWLoc5YTcdB1WUI.html
05-07-2020||Chandigarh||Amid focused testing, Chandigarh’s positivity rate highest in tricity||Out of every 100 people tested for Covid-19 in Chandigarh since the outbreak, more than five were found positive, a number way higher than its neighbouring districts of Mohali and Panchkula.Till July 3, Panchkula has conducted 10,355 tests, in which 120 people were found infected, translating to a positivity rate of 1.1%. Mohali district has tested close of 15,000 people, finding 284 of them positive, which means a positivity rate of 1.8%. Chandigarh has tested just over 8,000 people and reported 454 cases, leading to a positivity rate of 5.6%. In fact, the number has been on the higher side ever since the outbreak, even reaching 8.3% on May 11.Meanwhile, not just in absolute terms, but even relatively, testing numbers are lowest in Chandigarh, when tests conducted per lakh population are considered (see graphic). However, among several indicators considered by the ministry of health and family welfare to demarcate Covid-19 hotspots in May, Chandigarh is near the critical value of 6% in terms of just positivity rate. In terms of active cases, case fatality rate and tests per lakh population, it is in the desirable range. In fact, when it comes to recovery rate, it is among the top states and union territories, constantly staying over 80%. In Panchkula and Mohali, the rate stands around 75%.The Chandigarh health department as well as medical experts attribute the high positivity rate to a focused testing policy being followed in line with the central government guidelines.Dr KK Talwar, who is a former director of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER, Chandigarh, says the high numbers could be due to testing of high-risk persons and contacts in cluster areas, especially during the outbreak at Bapu Dham Colony.“A number of reasons could be involved, including concentrated testing. As you test more high-risk people, the test positivity rate is bound to increase,” he says.Prof Rajesh Kumar, former head of the department of community medicine and school of public health at the PGIMER, says the states that conduct more tests are bound to report lower positivity rate. “Chandigarh is religiously following the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines. However, its neighbouring districts are also regularly testing frontline workers, who may be more susceptible to contract the infection but have not tested positive in large numbers,” he says.UT health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta says: “Many states have extended testing to certain categories of people, such as domestic air travellers and asymptomatic people, beyond the ICMR guidelines. Ideally, this should not have been done. Their positivity or confirmation rate is expected to be low.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-focused-testing-chandigarh-s-positivity-rate-highest-in-tricity/story-hZ29bTDwn4RguL2w2b00gO.html

Labour is also required to load and unload apple boxes from the vehicle. Due to Covid-19 and other issues with Nepal, labour have not been able to come to the state this year. Till now, the state government has also not taken any concrete step in this direction.”He said the apple season has started in the state and will pick up pace in lower and middle hills within the next two weeks but due to the pandemic, there is a shortage of labourers, packaging materials and other essential resources. Besides, truck owners and other commercial vehicles have also hiked transportation charges by 20% due to hike in prices of petrol and diesel.Also, around 65% fruit crop has been destroyed by untimely rainfall and hailstorms which has resulted in losses, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/take-concrete-steps-to-bring-nepalese-labour-for-apple-season-cpi-m-to-hp-govt/story-D6m5xiMX5MFeQeEKhGOxtN.html

And, he not only recovered from Covid-19, he recovered faster than his son, who is also very old,” a senior doctor.Spanish Flu was a pandemic which hit the world 102 years ago, and affected nearly one-third of the global population at that time.“The 1918 influenza pandemic was the most severe pandemic in recent history. It was caused by an H1N1 virus with genes of avian origin. Although there is not universal consensus regarding where the virus originated, it spread worldwide during 1918-1919,” according to the Centre for Diseases Control (CDC) in the US.In the US, it was first identified in military personnel in spring 1918. It is estimated that about 6,75,000 deaths occurred in America, it said.According to a World Health Organisation (WHO) report, the pandemic of 1918-1919 called the Spanish Flu was particularly virulent, and killed an estimated 40 million people worldwide.In India, the disease is believed to have been brought in by the soldiers returning from World War I conflicts.The first cases of Spanish Flu were reported in areas which are major ports of entry, such as Mumbai (then Bombay), Kolkata (Calcutta), Delhi and Chennai (Madras), where a large number of people returned from abroad.The casualty count in India from the Spanish Flu is believed to be nearly one-fifth of the entire fatalities in the world, though the statistics for mortality in India are too wide-ranging and debatable.Doctors at the RGSSH, a dedicated Covid-19 facility were amazed to see the recovery of this centenarian patient from the novel coronavirus, even though he was highly vulnerable to the infection.“We don’t know whether he was affected by the Spanish Flu or not. We haven’t seen much documentation on the situation back then as far as Delhi is concerned, but very few hospitals were there at that time. It is amazing this 106-year-old showed the will power to survive,” a senior doctor, who monitored his situation, said.But, what is more interesting is that he recovered faster than his son, who is in his 70s. So, he lived through the Spanish Flu and now survived Covid-19, hence, he lived through two pandemics, he said.Besides, his wife and an another family member also had contracted Covid-19, and all four have successfully recovered and were discharged about a month-and-a-half ago, the doctor said.The RGSSH has treated 1,000 Covid-19 patients so fare, and on Monday it is marking the milestone with a symbolic event where Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and Heath Minister Satyendar Jain are slated to participate.Delhi recorded 2,505 fresh coronavirus cases on Friday, taking the tally in the city to over 97,000-mark, while the death toll from the disease mounted to 3,004, authorities said.The national capital, at present is the worst-hit city in the country, from the pandemic.According to the bulletin, 68,256 patients have recovered, been discharged or migrated so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/106-year-old-delhi-man-who-was-child-during-spanish-flu-survives-covid-19/story-pE1cvPf8F92XUipyjoTqKP.html

A minimum of 10 lakh people, other than party leaders and workers, will be linked for live streaming of chief minister Nitish Kumar’s address for upcoming Bihar polls and his vision for the future,” said party general secretary Navin Kumar Arya.Ahead of Nitish’s first virtual poll campaign rally, the party has constituted four teams. The teams are headed by senior JD (U) leaders RCP Singh, Rajiv Ranjan Singh, alias Lallan Singh, state president Vashistha Narayan Singh, state energy minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav. The team will hold virtual meetings in all the 243 assembly segments from July 18 to July 31 that aims to set up the platform for kickstarting party’s campaign.Party general secretary Arya said “the party has set a target for holding virtual sammelan (meeting) in at least six assembly constituencies, with grass roots party leaders and sympathisers, on a daily basis. As such, 24 assembly segments will be covered each day by all the four teams and the task will be over by July 31, leaving ample time for mobilising 10 lakh people for the August 7 event.”Prior to the constituency-level virtual meetings, the JD (U) has decided to organise online interactions with office bearers of various cells, from July 7, where Rajya Sabha member and national general secretary RCP Singh, who looks after organisational matters, will be present as the chief guest.Arya said that the first in line of the meeting of party wings will begin with Chatra JD (U) on July 7, followed by EBC cell, women’s cell, yuva JD (U), kisan prakosth, mahadalit cell and others. “On July 16, party’s national general secretary RCP Singh will hold a virtual meeting with all regional in-charge, district presidents, district organisational in-charge, assembly segment in-charge and heads of various cells,” Arya said.According to a party insider, while it appears that the BJP has taken a lead on JD (U) in using the social platform, chief minister has also been holding meetings with workers and organisational heads at the grass roots level, finding out time in between his daily review meetings for keeping a tab on the return of migrant workers, their stay and monitoring the spread of Covid-19. “So, no one can say for sure whether the JD (U) is a late starter for the upcoming polls. For us, keeping connected with party structure down the line has remained a priority,” he said, requesting not to be quoted.Earlier, Opposition parties had raised question over BJP and JD (U)’s comfort and support on the issue of virtual campaigning at a meeting with the representatives of all political parties, convened by the chief state election officer HR Srinivas on June 26. RJD, along with allies, had objected to the use of digital mode of campaigning and demanded a ban alleging that it would not provide a level playing field for everyone and resource rich and tech-savy parties will have undue advantage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/nitish-to-kick-start-bihar-poll-campaign-in-virtual-mode-on-aug-7-aims-at-least-10-lakh-people/story-pwrY3GewDg3YqGGE4OF9aO.html
05-07-2020||Chandigarh||Fruit procurement and processing hit, Panipat pickle makers in a jam||About 15 to 20 pickle manufacturers find themselves in a jam because of the three-month lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic, exodus of migrant labourers and restrictions on transport, putting at stake thousands of jobs in Panipat, one of India’s biggest pickle manufacturing hubs. As fruit procurement and processing had been hit over April to June, the best months pickle making, manufacturers were unable to gear up for demand that was starting to pick up during the unlocking.They said it would take them a year to emerge from the havoc wreaked by the lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic, with labour shortage and transportation restrictions being the biggest challenges in catering to demand across the country and in the US, UK and other countries.“We depend on migrant labourers as the locals are not willing to work. We had to shut down production for more than two months as most of the labourers had gone home for Holi and were unable to return due to the lockdown,” said Pankaj Dhingra, owner of Pachranga Foods.Even as orders were coming in from the US and other countries, “we face labour and transportation problems as train movement remains restricted,” he added.Among other demands, manufacturers demanded relief from 12% GST on their products as labourers and farmers working for the industry had been affected by the pandemic.“Pickles are like vegetables for the poor and taste boosters for the rich. Around 50% of our products are consumed locally and 50% is exported to different states and abroad,” said Jitender Juneja, owner of Popular Achar, reiterating the need for GST relief.Om Parkash, in the pickle business since 1984, said government restrictions, including 12%GST had also hit manufacturers, which is why many of them were going out of business.“There are problems with raw material procurement as farmers do not sell their products directly to the manufacturers and we have to buy it from traders,” he added.Pickle outlets too were not getting enough footfall. “Like dhabas, pickle outlets also remained closed for three months during the lockdown. Even now, though the eateries are open no one stops to eat because of fears of contracting Covid-19,” said Rahul Dahiya, owner of a pickle shop on National Highway 44 near Gharaunda.Chhattardhari, who ran an outlet on Jattal road in Panipat city and had 14 varieties of pickles in stock, including mixed, mango, lime, green and red chillies, amla, carrot, radish, turnip, onion and even garlic, but buyers were not turning up.“My two sons are completing undergraduate studies and the younger one is in coaching classes in Kota, Rajasthan. Things have come to such a pass because of poor sales that I find it difficult to pay their fees,” said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fruit-procurement-and-processing-hit-panipat-pickle-makers-in-a-jam/story-vM41cv0WQLYW6AzqvfbKeO.html

The chargesheet submitted by Shivaji Pawar, assistant commissioner of police (ACP) and Bund Garden police station incharge, before the Special Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999 (Mcoca), court also stated that the seven accused had demanded a ransom of Rs five crore from the deceased while he was in their custody.Shewani owned a footwear store on Laxmi road and was found dead with three bullet wounds near a canal in Lonad, Satara, on January 5. The seven arrested in the case have been identified as Afridi Rauf Khan (23), Sunil Namdev Gaikwad (49), Ajinkya Hanumant Dhumal (21), Kiran Sunil Kadam (21), Pritam Ramesh Ambe (36), Parvez Hanif Shaikh (42), and Anil Suresh Sapkal (48).Shewani was kidnapped from Pune on the night of January 24 and an extortion note was found in his pocket. However, as no ransom call was made, the police did not suspect extortion as the motive during the initial phase of the investigation.City police commissioner K Venkatesham had granted permission to prosecute the accused under the relevant sections of the Mcoca Act.Pawar stated that the victim refused to give in to their demands after which he was shot dead.Shaikh and Ambe are prime accused in the case and are notorious criminals on record. The crime branch sleuths had recovered seven pistols, 58 live cartridges, five extra magazines and eight cell phones from their possession post their arrest.A case under Sections 302 (murder), 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder), 387 (putting a person in fear of death or of grievous hurt, in order to commit extortion), 397 (robbery, or dacoity, with an attempt to cause death or grievous hurt), 201 (destruction of evidence), 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code along with Section 3(25) of the Arms Act has been lodged at the Bund Garden police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/chargesheet-against-7-in-chandan-shevani-murder-case-accused-demanded-rs5-crore-extortion/story-1zi1s2lDZORtagkJWOpEyI.html

However, this has led to an increase in wait time for ambulances transporting the bodies.In a quest to avoid the delay, the PMC has now reserved a mortuary at Kailash Crematorium near Sangamwadi.Earlier, the civic body reserved six of the 21 crematoriums for the cremation of Covid-19 bodies. However, the PMC faced a staff crunch and decided to keep only two crematoriums.As of Friday, the Pune death toll due to Covid-19 infection reached 685 with 19,849 progressive positive cases.PMC electric department chief Shrinivas Kandul, who is also co-ordinating the cremations, said, “As the Covid-19 deaths are increasing in the city, sometimes there is a queue outside the Kailash and Yerawada crematorium for performing final rites on dead bodies. As the ambulances are stuck at the crematorium, hospitals keep calling the driver to transport the next body. To avoid all this trouble, PMC has now fixed a mortuary at Kailash crematorium. Four dead bodies can be placed in this mortuary at a given time.”According to Kandul, the PMC also planned to keep the mortuary at Yerawada crematorium for the next few days.“PMC allotted six ambulances only for transporting Covid-19 bodies to the crematorium,” he said.According to the PMC, the aim of an extra mortuary is that ambulances would not need to wait to unload the body. They can drop the body at the mortuary and immediately rush for the next call.The PMC officials said the decision to bring down reserved crematoriums from six to two was because civic staff had to use gas crematoriums for final rites and there were some difficulties as gas crematoriums are managed by a private contractor. Also, there was a manpower shortage issue. Due to panic and fear, PMC employees were not ready to perform the final rites, said another civic official.In order to streamline this work effectively, PMC has now only kept two crematoriums for performing final rites. There are three working shifts and in each shift, four employees remain present for duty.

A small crater has developed in the middle of the concrete road, while the layer beneath has flown in the nullah, making it hollow. It is closed for traffic and work of filling the road has started.A nullah wall also collapsed near M H High School in Thane, however no one was injured in the incident. Water-logging was also observed at few places in the city, though there was no loss of life and property.Heavy rains lashed Thane since Sunday morning. The city witnessed around 80.00mm of rainfall since morning while on Saturday the rainfall recorded was 377 mm.Santosh Kadam, chief of Regional Disaster Management Cell (RDMC), said, “The Khartan Road opposite Thane College caved in around 11.30 on Sunday. A small crater has developed on the surface while a patch of 20 feet base course of the road beneath the top layer has flown into the nullah. The road is above a nullah and near to the creek, thus due to the force of the water it caved in. It is a Ultra White Thin Topping (UTWT) road.”The work of repairing the road has begun. “We have got two to three trucks of sand and will fill the base course. A ten feet nullah wall behind M H Highschool in Naupada fell due to heavy rain. A huge tree near the wall was in dangerous condition and fell taking the wall with itself in the nullah.

05-07-2020||Kolkata||Cases of nepotism in Cyclone Amphan relief run into thousands in poll-bound Bengal||Nepotism and malpractice by the Trinamool Congress’ (TMC’s) panchayat leaders involved in the distribution of compensation for people whose homes were damaged by Cyclone Amphan on May 20 have turned into the most raging issue in poll-bound West Bengal.While genuine claims have been ignored, the compensation of Rs 20,000 in most cases went to people who suffered no loss. It is also alleged that multiple members of the same families got Rs 20,000 each. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has asked district administrations to review the payments and take back the money. Bank accounts are also being frozen. “The chief minister is personally looking into this. It is a serious issue and action is being taken. Poor people cannot be deprived,” Javed Ahmed Khan, the state disaster management minister, said while speaking to HT on Saturday. In a reminder of the so-called ‘cut-money’ or illegal commission that TMC leaders charged from beneficiaries of rural housing schemes in the past, the issue of corruption for Amphan relief led to two killings on Saturday.The TMC and Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist), a small Left party, lost one local leader each in the Moipith-Boikunthapur panchayat area of South 24 Parganas district, one of the worst affected by the cyclone. In at least five other districts in south Bengal, agitations and clashes over alleged nepotism has been continuing since June though no death was reported.“Being a coastal area, Moipith was ravaged by the cyclone. But our supporters did not get any compensation. On Thursday, we lodged a complaint at the local police station against the panchayat pradhan. TMC workers attacked our supporters within 48 hours,” said Tarun Naskar, former SUCI legislator from the local Joynagar assembly seat and a professor of engineering at Jadavpur University. While officials in the Cyclone Amphan-affected districts said the number of complaints runs into thousands, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has alleged that around Rs 300 crore has been misappropriated. Relief packageWithin 48 hours of the cyclone hitting the state, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the affected areas and announced an initial grant of Rs 1,000 crore for relief and rehabilitation.Later, the Bengal government told the Centre that 28.6 lakh houses were damaged and the cost of this damage stood at Rs 28,560 crore. The quantum of total damage stood at Rs 1.02 lakh crore, the state said.The chief minister announced an initial relief fund of Rs 6,250 crore. On June 2, she tweeted that the government has transferred funds to nearly five lakh people for repairing homes.In addition, the government has also promised wages for 100 days of work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme for the affected people.Political observers and opposition leaders feel that the huge relief package opened the Pandora’s box as the TMC controls more than 80% panchayat bodies and had won around 34% seats uncontested in the 2018 polls that were rocked by violence. Case studiesThe allegations have surfaced in North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas, East Midnapore, Howrah and some parts of West Midnapore. Surprisingly, complaints have been received even in Nadia, a district located 232km away from East Midnapore and 170km from South 24 Parganas, the worst-hit areas.“We are receiving a huge number of complaints. I cannot give you a figure off-hand as thousands of people applied for compensation. There are cases where vested interests worked. We are not taking any chances. The claims are being reviewed on a daily basis and banks accounts being frozen,” Vibhu Goel, Nadia’s district magistrate, said while speaking to HT. In East Midnapore district, hundreds of people in Mahishadal, Patashpur, Contai and Nandigram assembly constituencies have staged agitation saying TMC leaders deprived them.“We have issued a show-cause notice to some of our men and 25 people have returned the money so far. No party can take such prompt action,” said Tilak Chakraborty, vice-president of the TMC-controlled Mahishadal panchayat samiti.In Howrah district, allegations have been raised in Uluberia, Sankrail, Panchla and Jagatballavpur Assembly segments.“The complaints received include four or five members from same families making claims and even same persons receiving multiple payments,” said Kartik Chandra Roy, community block development officer of Uluberia-1.In North 24 Parganas, where the TMC has faced agitation in assembly constituencies such as Amdanga, Deganga and Sandeshkhali, the party’s district president and state food and supplies minister Jyotipriyo Mallick accused eight BJP-run panchayats of the same nepotism. He even released the list of beneficiaries, mentioning details of the payments made.One such gram panchayat is Keniara 2 in Bagdah assembly segment.“If any irregularity has taken place then it will be rectified,” said Anamika Biswas, the panchayat pradhan who, Mullick alleged, got the compensation three times.“If the government has proof then it should take legal action. This corruption exposes the government’s failure. The accused TMC leaders are writing declarations, saying they made mistakes so that bureaucrats can remain safe,” said BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha.The effectSuvashis Maitra, a political observer and columnist, feels that such a large scale corruption points at a problem with the character of people in rural Bengal.“Otherwise why will poor people in villages lie? This trend started much before the TMC came to power. The ruling party is trying to enforce rectification. The CPI(M) tried it too but failed. This relief scam is like some sort of democratisation of the combination of political power and corruption,” said Maitra.Udayan Bandopadhyay, Kolkata-based political science professor, believes that the issue will directly affect the outcome of the 2021 assembly polls in at least three districts. “The cut money issue helped BJP bag 18 Lok Sabha seats in 2019 and also affected the panchayat polls in 2018,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/cases-of-nepotism-in-cyclone-amphan-relief-run-into-thousands-in-poll-bound-bengal/story-3Bm3P9pgoGClWgE5vrb4vN.html

The crackdown began in Greater Noida on Saturday on the instructions of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to reign in the gangsters, a day after eight policemen were killed in Kanpur by henchmen of history-sheeter Vikas Dubey.  “In line with the chief minister’s instructions, Police Commissioner Alok Singh ordered the attachment of properties worth Rs 7 crore which includes land and cars,” Deputy Commissioner of Police, Greater Noida, Rajesh Kumar Singh said. “Land of water bodies illegally occupied by these gangs got reclaimed today (Saturday), illegal fences razed down. The action would continue unabated and illegal properties would be attached,” he said. The clampdown is being carried out chiefly under Section 14(1) of the Gangsters Act, which allows attachment of illegal properties, in order to effectively curb gangsters, mafias and criminals and their associates, the officials said. DCP, Central Noida, Harish Chander said properties of Anil Dujana gang member Chandrapal have been attached and his vehicles impounded, while properties of Divya Sangwan, wife of another gang member Robin Tyagi, were also attached. The seized cars include models of luxury brands like Audi and BMW, the officer said. This is the first action taken by the Commissioner of Police under the Gangster Act for attachment of property under the commissionerate system of police in the district which started in January this year, a police spokesperson said.   “The action will continue against criminals and mafias involved in criminal activities in future,” the spokesperson added.

05-07-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai records its second-highest single day July rain in 5 years||Incessant downpour over the weekend allowed Mumbai to record its second-highest 24-hour rain in the month of July in over the past five years.The weather bureau had issued a yellow alert for Sunday but only light to moderate rain alert had been issued for Monday.“Models have indicated heavy rain to continue on Sunday but the intensity of rain is likely to be lesser than Friday and Saturday,” KS Hosalikar, deputy director general of IMD’s western region, said.On Sunday, the suburbs woke up to intense heavy rain with 95.4mm over a span of three hours from 8.30am to 11.30am, while south Mumbai recorded intermittent light showers of 9.4mm.The Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded 200.8 mm rain between 8.30am on Saturday and 8.30am on Sunday, falling under the ‘very heavy’ rain category.Last year, the city had recorded 375.2mm on July 2, which is the highest 24-hour rain in the month between 2015 and 2020. In 2018, it was 184.3mm (July 10), 163.4mm in 2017 (July 18), 114.5mm in 2016 (July 30), and 61 mm in 2015 (July 21).Over the past decade, however, more rain was recorded in 2013 (215.6mm on July 24) and 2014 (207.2 mm on July 3). The all-time high 24-hour July rain was recorded during the July 27, 2005, deluge that led to 944.2mm.The Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 129.6 mm rain between 8.30am on Saturday and 8.30am on Sunday.Over the past 48 hours—8.30am on Friday to 8.30am on Sunday—Mumbai suburbs recorded 357.8mm rain while south Mumbai recorded 298.6mm rain.Thane recorded the highest rain across the Konkan region and the state over the past 24-hours at 377mm rain, which falls under the exceptionally heavy rain category.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) further classifies 15.6-64.4mm as moderate rain while 64.5-115.5mm rain as heavy, 115.6-204.4mm as very heavy, and over 204.5mm as extremely heavy rain.“North Konkan including Mumbai witnessed an active phase of the southwest monsoon over the past three days with continuous showers and extremely heavy rain in some areas. The impact of widespread rain activity led to overall excess rainfall for the majority of the weather stations,” Hosalikar said.Mumbai suburbs has currently recorded 15% excess rain for the season while south Mumbai has recorded large excess of 29%. Mumbai has so far recorded 480.4 mm rain (from July 1 to July 5, 11.30 am), which is 57% of the month’s average rainfall (840.7mm). The city had recorded 395 mm rain in June, which was the lowest monthly rain in five years. However, with continuous downpour over 48 hours, the city has so far (from June 1 to July 5 11.30am) received almost 38% of its seasonal average rain (875 mm of 2,317 mm).Independent meteorologists said weather systems responsible for heavy rain over Mumbai were expected to move northwards towards south Gujarat on Sunday leading to the decline in rain intensity for the city.“Massive cloud bands in the Arabian Sea, as a result of the offshore trough, along with strong westerly winds led to these rains. While overnight intermittent heavy rain is expected and there may be some spillover for Sunday, major rain intensity will be felt for the Gujarat coast from Sunday,” Sridhar Balasubramanian, a professor with the department of mechanical engineering and IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, said.The city and suburbs can expect intermittent moderate rain through the day on Sunday with the possibility of heavy showers in isolated areas and light to moderate rain on Monday, IMD’s updated forecast on Sunday read.Rain records during July over the past five years:2020 (July 5) - 200.8mm2019 (July 2) - 375.2mm2018 (July 10) - 184.3mm2017 (July 18) - 163.4mm2016 (July 30) - 114.5mm2015 (July 21) - 61mmOther records2013 (July 24) - 215.6mm (second highest July rain in 10 years)2005 (July 27) - 944.2mm (all-time highest 24-hour rain)Location-wise rainfall for 24-hoursThane - 377mmMumbra:291mmDombivali:265mmNavi Mumbai:263mmMatheran: 209mmKalyan: 192mmMumbai SuburbsKandivali: 235mmBorivali: 211mmVikhroli: 204mmChembur: 203mmKurla: 160mmPowai: 184mmBandra: 152mmSouth MumbaiDharavi: 187mmWadala: 180mmByculla: 159mmWorli: 153mmHaji Ali: 142mmMalabar Hill: 129mmNariman Point: 105mm(Source: India Meteorological Department)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-its-second-highest-single-day-july-rain-in-5-years/story-J2EFoDXg0z6Zy6wiUHJifN.html

More than 1,500 Covid-19 patients are missing in the region, according to Hindustan Times’ sister publication Hindustan.The health authorities are not able to trace these 1,589 patients, the Hindustan reported. This happened because these people gave wrong address and mobile numbers while being tested for Covid-19, it further reported.The highest number of these missing patients - 1,000 - is from Faridabad followed by 266 from Gurugram, 180 from Delhi, 124 from Ghaziabad and 19 from Noida.The health authorities Hindustan spoke to said that a patient’s medical information is uploaded on the mobile application of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) before the sample is taken. The patient is then asked for mobile number and the data is uploaded only after an OTP (One-Time Password) is generated.In these cases, the lapse happened because these people got themselves checked at private labs, when the pandemic was just about rearing its head in India.The health authorities have asked the police to help trace these patients. The authorities say that they have found 65 missing Covid-19 patients in Ghaziabad and they have been admitted to the hospital.In Faridabad, the municipal authorities have also been roped in to trace these missing patients.Tightening the rules further, Faridabad’s civil surgeon Dr Randeep Singh Poonia told Hindustan that they have made Aadhar card, identity card and home address proof mandatory. The authorities have already issued order in this regard, he added.Delhi, meanwhile, crossed the 3,000-mark in the number of Covid-19 fatalities after 55 deaths were recorded on Saturday. The number of deaths due to the viral infection stood at 3,004, according to the health bulletin released by the Delhi government, with 26 “old cases” added to the cumulative number.Delhi had recorded its first death on March 13 - a 68-year-old woman from Janakpuri who got the infection from her son who had travelled to Switzerland, Japan, and Italy. From then, it took exactly two months for Delhi to record the first 100 deaths due to Covid-19.On Saturday, the city recorded 2,505 new cases of Covid-19 taking the cumulative total to 97,200.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases-in-delhi-ncr-authorities-look-for-over-1-500-missing-patients/story-vHBCHFLfKXSc5veCdZKfmO.html

When I visited the area, the accused were bathing there. When I asked why did they stop me from fetching water, they made casteist remarks on me. I narrated the entire episode to the village head and my family members. The sarpanch talked to the parents of the accused, but to no avail. The next day, those men visited my house and pelted stones. When I raised alarm, my brother-in-law and others came for my rescue but the accused thrashed them as well. Then they continued to roam around my residence. My husband, who works with Haryana Police, lodged a complaint on Friday evening,” she added.Julana SHO Surender Singh said the incident took place two days ago and an FIR was registered on Saturday after the victim approached the police in person.“We have arrested four men of the village and booked them under sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 323 (punishment for causing voluntarily hurt) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3 of the SC/ST (atrocity prevention) Act. The matter is being investigated.

The retired personnel is undergoing treatment at a private hospital and has been put on a ventilator. The family has arranged for Rs13.5 lakh, his son said. “We have been helped by our family and friends to a great extent. Now we have requested the home department and Mumbai Police commissioner to help us and we are hoping that they will,” the retired ASI’s son said.The family stays at BIT chawl police colony at Mumbai Central. In her letter, the retired ASI’s wife stated that her son is studying in college and her husband was the only earning member of the family. Thus, it was not possible for her to pay the amount.Naval Bajaj, joint commissioner of police (admin), said, “As per the rules, the Maharashtra Police’s Kutumb Arogya Yojana [under which police personnel and their families can avail free treatment] expires once a staff member retires from the service. However, we are exploring other ways through which we can help him.”According to the letter, the ASI was suffering from cold and fever on March 20. “He did not apply for medical leave as he wanted to serve for the 10 days left in his service,” stated the letter. Later, even after retiring on March 31, he continued to remain unwell for more than a month. The ASI visited a local physician, who suggested him to undergo a Covid-19 test, in which he tested positive. “In May, his test results came positive and we had to shift him to a hospital. We tried to admit him to several hospitals, but there were no beds available. Then I received a call from the private hospital and we admitted him there on May 6. His condition deteriorated and he had to be put on ventilator. His condition has not completely improved yet,” the letter stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/retired-cop-s-wife-seeks-maharashtra-govt-s-help-as-his-covid-19-treatment-is-likely-to-cost-family-25-lakh/story-f2p1QOH21AYR9RlZfsGcbK.html

Kausa’s health officer Hemangi Ghode tracked the family with the help of police and airport authorities, despite the family trying to mislead her, said RT Kendre, officer on special Covid-19 duty.The four are family members of a 54-year-old resident of Kausa in Mumbra who was tested positive for the virus last month. The man died on June 25, after which his 50-year-old wife and three sons – aged 27, 25 and 23 years – were also tested positive for the virus on July 1. “On July 2, I made a phone call to the family, asking them which hospital would they like getting admitted to. They named a facility in Andheri, so I got suspicious and decided to keep a track on them,” Ghode said.The family told Ghode that they are leaving home by 9am for the hospital. “Accordingly, I sent a team to check on them. At 11am, the team found their door locked. When I called the Andheri hospital to inquire if the family had been admitted, the authorities there said they had no information about them. Around 11.45am, when I called one of sons, he did not answer. So I asked the surveillance officer to inquire in the nearby areas and also alerted the police as well as the railway and airport authorities. Following this, the airport authority surveillance team traced the family through the Arogya Setu app when they were boarding the flight and alerted TMC,” Ghode said.Ghode then informed the Mumbra police, following which the family was brought back and admitted to a private Covid hospital in Thane.“If they would have boarded the flight, several more people would have being infected,” she said.Senior inspector M Kad from Mumbra police station, said, “We have not registered a case against the family yet but will take action after their recovery.”When HT contacted the mother and youngest son, they refused to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-covid-patients-from-thane-try-to-flee-to-up-nabbed-from-airport/story-nMmZTxpOHER5zW58wQOfAM.html

The minister said that after the preliminary information he received, he does not find any reason to probe the issue further.Bhujbal, while speaking to the media after the inauguration of a Covid-19 facility in Nashik on Saturday morning, said that he had received complaints about the actor’s trip. He said he was surprised that when the chief minister of the state and ministers travel by road, how the actor received VIP treatment and how he could fly in a helicopter amid the lockdown. He said that he would seek information from officials and check if there was any flouting of rules and how was he provided police escort by the city police when he was travelling to the rural area of the district.Kumar had visited Trimbakeshwar, a temple town on the outskirts of Nashik, four days ago, and had shared photos of his visit on social media. According to local media reports, several senior police officers met him during his stay in Nashik. Kumar’s photographs at the helipad went viral and triggered a controversy in Nashik as people from the district raised questions about the permission given to the actor to travel and stay at a resort during the lockdown amid rising cases of Covid-19. CM Uddhav Thackeray had travelled by road to Pandharpur in Solapur two days ago for a traditional puja at Vitthal temple on occasion of Ashadi Ekadashi. Other ministers and influential people, too, were denied permissions by the administrations, making them travel by road.Later in the evening Bhujbal told HT, “I had said in the morning that I would check into the incident and how he got permission to fly and stay. Later, the district collector informed me that the actor had paid a visit to one Dr Ashraf in Trimbakeshwar. The Nashik police commissioner had called on him there and the escort, about which complaints were received, was for the commissioner. As far as the flying permission is concerned, the flight originated from Mumbai and it needs to be checked into by the authorities there. For us [the Nashik district administration], the chapter is closed now.”When HT contacted the actor, his team said, “Akshay had travelled there for health reasons to meet Dr Ashraf, and he had all the required permissions for the same.”Local officers said the actor had visited Trimbakeshwar as he is planning to set up a Martial Art and Meditation Centre in the vicinity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/controversy-over-akshay-kumar-s-nashik-trip-maharashtra-minister-bhujbal-clarifies-that-no-rules-violated/story-QM4xIg49uo87zYtCBwvBPJ.html
05-07-2020||Mumbai||Doctors caution against Covid-19 spread during monsoon||Medical experts have advised citizens to be vigilant during the monsoon, which brings with it ailments like seasonal influenza whose symptoms are similar to those of Covid-19. Health experts said three parameters govern the how a virus spreads — seasonal change, nature of the virus and patterns of human behaviour. With the onset of the monsoon, doctors in the city are keeping a close watch on how the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, may be impacted by changes in climate and weather. “As the virus is new, we lack knowledge on how it will react to the monsoon. We don’t know if humid temperatures will provide a more suitable environment for the virus to thrive, like in the case of swine flu or seasonal influenza,” said Dr Lancelot Pinto, epidemiologist at Hinduja Hospital.A recent study by professors Amit Agarwal and Rajneesh Bharadwaj of Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B), published in the American Institute of Physics, suggested humid weather may promote the infection. “When an infected person coughs or sneezes, the droplets sit on the surface. In dry weather, these droplets dry faster. But in humid temperature, it takes longer which further increases the chances of the spread of the virus,” said Bharadwaj.However, Dr Randeep Guleria, pulmonologist and director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, said, “Without more research, it will be unscientific to make any such comments.” Experts also warned against self-medication, even in case of seasonal ailments. “If a person has Covid-19, taking fever suppressants will delay treatment. So far, people have been very vigilant and approaching hospitals with the onset of any symptoms. I request people to do the same even in the monsoon,” said Dr Om Shrivastava, part of the state Covid-19 task force. Civic officials said that the virus’ spread may be curbed by the rain, which will force people to stay indoors. “Rain will restrict people’s movement. It will also curb spitting on the roads which often exposes the surrounding public to the virus,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).In July last year, 8,921 people were treated for fever and 123 cases of swine flu (highest in 2019), according to BMC’s data. City doctors are worried that it may be difficult to distinguish the symptoms of these ailments from those of Covid-19. “They all have common symptoms, like fever, cold, cough, rashes. It will be tough to differentiate them,” saidDr Ramesh Bharmal, in-charge of Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital, Sion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/doctors-caution-against-covid-19-spread-during-monsoon/story-pHnpGDGZnoi5TMooXXfByJ.html

Later, we corrected it in an order on June 30 and mentioned it as ‘neighbourhood’.”Nishandar clarified the definition of ‘neighbourhood’ with an example. “Neighbourhood of Malad cannot be Marine Drive or neighbourhood of Dadar cannot be Borivli. Neighbourhood of Dadar can be Naigaon or Parel and we have taken action against people who were roaming around unnecessarily,” said Nishandar.On June 28, the Mumbai Police in its effort to curb the spread of Covid-19 had appealed to Mumbaiites to stay at home, and had imposed a new rule asking people to move only within a radius of 2km for essentials. Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh had tweeted, ‘Driving past 2km of your place of residence for ‘fun’? ‘We know a spot’ for your car.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/you-can-travel-within-neighbourhood-cops/story-aD5l61ZfvHEShGoJuNUhWK.html

The accused charged ₹5,000 for fake police e-pass and ₹1,000 for fake medical certificate for travelling to other districts in Maharashtra as well as the country. According to norms, police e-pass and medical certificates are compulsory to travel to other states or districts during lockdown.The arrested accused are Ravindra Dhige, 39, a Kalyan resident, and Namdev Shankar Dighe, 25, a resident of Bhandup. Officers of crime branch’s unit 7 got a tip-off about a gang duping people who wanted to visit other districts in Maharashtra from the Mumbai metropolitan region (MMR) by providing fake police e-pass.“Following the information, police inspector Manish Dhankar contacted the accused posing as a customer and said he required e-pass and medical certificate to visit his hometown in Solapur. The accused agreed and demanded ₹5,000 for the pass and ₹1,000 for fitness certificate (medical certificate),” said deputy commissioner of police (crime branch) Akbar Pathan. The accused then called Dhankar to meet in Bhandup where the police laid a trap and nabbed Namdev who came in a private car to deliver e-pass. During interrogation, he confessed that his cousin brother Ravindra is the mastermind, said Pathan. A police team then nabbed Dhige. Both the accused were produced in the court and have been remanded in police custody till July 9. Further inquiry is going on to find out if others are involved in the racket, said Pathan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/two-arrested-for-making-fake-e-pass-and-medical-certificates/story-3TfJeqvVdnN0IA3q5gXXMP.html

05-07-2020||Mumbai||Delay in NEET, JEE causing anxiety among students: Parents||The ministry of human resource and development’s (MHRD) decision to postpone the schedule for undergraduate (UG) medical and engineering entrance examinations has left many aspirants and parents anxious and worried. Constant delay in the examination is leaving students with “less enthusiasm and concentration which could, in turn, affect their grades”, said many of them. The parents and UG medical aspirants had written to MHRD and the National Testing Authority (NTA) against delaying the entrance exam any further than July. “More the exam gets delayed, the more students are worried about their preparation. The examination authority needs to find a way to hold exams virtually, so the online admission process too can start immediately,” said Sudha Shenoy, activist and parent of medical student.MHRD on Friday announced the postponement of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for undergraduate medical and dental aspirants as well as Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Mains for engineering aspirants to September from their original dates in July. The decision came after an expert committee stated that holding competitive exams in July amid the pandemic, will not be feasibleWhile NEET-UG was scheduled to take place on July 26, the second phase of JEE-Mains was slated between July 18 and 23. The first phase of JEE-Mains was conducted in January. More than 2.25 lakh students from JEE-Mains will be eligible for JEE-Advance, which is the one-point entry to the premier Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).“Most students have spent the last two years of their lives preparing for the entrance exams in the hope of getting through to one of the best medical or engineering institute. This constant delay is leaving students anxious and in a state of panic,” said Anjana Singh, parent of a NEET aspirant. Over 15 lakh students have registered for NEET 2020, including 2.3 lakh from Maharashtra.Delay in conducting the entrance exam directly leads to a delay in admissions, say parents. Senior NTA officials have stated that with the entrance exam in mid-September, admissions will begin only in October. While the decision on NEET and JEE is already out, the state common entrance test (CET) cell is yet to announce the new dates for MH-CET exam. New dates will be released soon, said CET officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/delay-in-neet-jee-causing-anxiety-among-students-parents/story-tvSTncm5NnKKadTU0D0zOJ.html
05-07-2020||City||Ludhiana police stations turn into fortresses against Covid||That the Covid-19 pandemic has affected various sectors is a given, and the Ludhiana police department is no exception.From the district’s 28 police stations adapting to working amid the pandemic to cops exercising every caution while battling the virus from the frontline, along with health workers, the past four months have brought a sea change in the Ludhiana police commissionerate’s functioning.It was on April 18 when the department lost its first officer, assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Anil Kumar Kohli, to Covid-19, prompting police stations to enforce stringent rules for visitors. While urging residents to visit police stations only in case of emergency, the department has been encouraging them to register their complaints via e-mail. Several police stations have also installed complaint boxes outside their premises.Entry of more than two people at a time is restricted, while those entering are thermal scanned, given sanitisers and asked to wear face masks.While going out for investigation, cops arm themselves with not only weapons, but also face masks and gloves, and sanitise their uniforms before reentering the police stations.Inspector Jarnail Singh, SHO at Division Number 8 police station, said, “We work on the frontline, hence we remain vulnerable. We allow only one or two people to enter the police station at a time and ask them to wear masks.” “Responsibilities of the sentry at the main gate have increased manifold due to the Covid-19 outbreak. He checks the body temperature of visitors using a thermal scanner and maintains hand sanitisers for the public,” the SHO added.The inspector is one out of the 3,000 police personnel, who have undergone Covid-19 testing so far. While he tested positive in the first test, the results were negative in the two subsequent tests.In addition to the other precautions, the Shimlapuri police station has also installed a sanitisation gate to disinfect visitors. Inspector Amandeep Singh Brar, the SHO here, said they had also made adequate seating arrangement to ensure social distancing between visitors.ASI Harbhajan Singh, in-charge at Mundian police post, said the area under their purview was mostly inhabited by labourers, whom they had been educating about the pandemic. “We take all precautions while arresting suspects, as a man arrested in an abetment to suicide case had tested positive for Covid-19,” he said.“Besides ensuring enough gap among visitors, we disinfect the police station building daily,” he added.When it comes to social distancing, police are taking measures for those locked up as well.“Only one suspect is sent in one lock-up room. In case more space is needed, they are sent to other police posts under our jurisdiction,” said inspector Mohammad Jameel, SHO, Focal Point police station, where 17 cops, including the SHO, were quarantined after a snatcher they had arrested and produced in court on April 5 was found positive for Covid-19.Inspector Prem Singh, SHO at Dakha police station, said they had pasted notifications outside the main gate that only two persons are allowed with a complainant. “It is a common habit among people, especially in rural areas, to bring along a crowd for every complaint,” he said.The Dakha police station, which earned the tag of model police station, has also installed a sanitisation gate, besides ensuring availability of sanitiser for villagers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-police-stations-turn-into-fortresses-to-against-covid/story-jJfV6HqFfd9HORnYJXeDcK.html

05-07-2020||City||Thane teachers on Covid survey duty demand better facilities||Teachers carrying out a Covid-19 survey in Thane city have alleged that no social distancing is maintained in most of the congested areas and slums, putting them at risk of infection. They have demanded accommodation in quarantine facilities so as not to risk spreading the infection to their families.Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has roped in around 400 civic school teachers and around 200 from private schools to conduct a health survey to track down people who could have been infected by the coronavirus.“We cover around 70 houses a day and have to work for eight hours daily. It is not only physically tiring, but we also have the mental stress of its impact on our health. Moreover, we do not have any quarantine facility to stay at. We return home every day knowing that our families are also at risk. When we visit densely-populated slum areas, there is no chance to maintain social distance,” said one of the teachers, on condition of anonymity.The civic school teachers were roped in for the survey in May and private school teachers were asked to join in June to ease the load.“We have been working continuously for over two months and hardly got a few days of break. If we are allowed to quarantine at home for 15 days on a rotational basis, it will help us to take care of our health. Moreover, some alternative in slum areas – like an open area where we take information from each family – will also be beneficial,” said another civic school teacher.TMC claimed that even if the slums are congested, teachers are provided safety gear. Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner, said, “We have provided preventive measures like face shields, masks, gloves and sanitisers to all those who are conducting health surveys. Those who are above 55 years of age are also allowed to work in the office.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-teachers-on-covid-survey-duty-demand-better-facilities/story-oUggJAfvy00vdFXk028cIL.html

05-07-2020||Mumbai||12 lakh completed quarantine in Mumbai since March: BMC||With more than 83,000 cases of Covid-19 in the city to date, more than 12 lakh people have completed their quarantine — institutional or at home — according to data by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). On Saturday, Mumbai recorded 1,163 fresh cases and 68 new deaths. The city’s case tally rose to 83,237, while the death toll touched 4,830. The total number of discharged patients in Mumbai was 53,463 with a recovery rate of 64.2%. Further, active cases stood at 24,936. The fatality rate in the city as of Saturday was 5.80%, and the doubling rate was 41 days. One hot spot that has shown signs of drastic improvement — Dharavi — recorded only two cases on Saturday, the lowest since the first week of April. The area has reported a total case count of 2,311, of which 1,704 have been discharged.According to BMC data, more than 12.72 lakh citizens have completed their quarantine period till now, since March 11. As of July 2, around 12,465 citizens were under institutional quarantine, and over 2.47 lakh were under home quarantine.Further, BMC has used contact tracing to identify more than 15.32 lakh citizens who were either high-risk or low-risk contacts of Covid-positive patients. The figure also includes those who have been arriving in Mumbai from domestic and international destinations under the Centre’s Mission Vande Bharat.The civic body claims to have screened more than 1.24 crore people, which includes the floating population, and around 4.97 lakh senior citizens to ascertain their blood-oxygen level. Of the 4.97 lakh senior citizens who were screened, 2,254 had oxygen levels below 95.Daksha Shah, deputy executive health officer, BMC, said, “You can say that we have quarantined over 9% of Mumbai’s population. But we have to keep in mind that this is the cumulative figure of almost four months. All low-risk contacts are home quarantined, and high-risk contacts are quarantined institutionally.”BMC estimates over 9.67% of the Mumbai’s total 1.24 crore population (as of 2011 census) has been directly or indirectly affected by Covid-19. The city’s population is estimated to rise by around 4 lakh by 2021, according to BMC’s projections for the development plan (DP) 2034.Shah added that BMC is attempting to screen maximum citizens through area-wise screenings or sero-surveillance that is currently being conducting in three wards. “We would like to appeal to citizens to come forward to give their blood samples. The test is only to ascertain how many have developed antibodies,” she said. A sero-surveillance test is conducted to diagnose individuals for antibodies of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 and monitor its spread. During sero-surveillance, citizens undergo blood tests that can detect the presence of IgG antibodies, which develop against Sars-CoV-2.“We have the highest number of citizens quarantined in the state as many international and domestic passengers who landed in Mumbai increased our home quarantine count. We trace around 13 high-risk contacts of every Covid-positive patient in slums, and in non-slum areas, two to 10 high-risk contacts are traced,” said a BMC official.Meanwhile, according to BMC data, H-East ward (Bandra East and Santacruz East), has traced a maximum of 19 persons behind every positive patient from slum areas. The second highest is 17 patients in D ward covering areas like Malabar Hill, Grant Road, and Chowpatty.BMC also claims to have around 38% bed vacancy, with 7,273 of the total 19,561 beds available. The highest vacancies have been reported in type-2 Covid care centres (CCC-2), where 3,479 of the total 6,160 beds are empty.There are around 757 active containment zones in the city that consist slums and chawls. The highest containment zones are in L ward covering Kurla and Sakinaka, which has 96 containment zones.

05-07-2020||City||Chandigarh Citi Center: Rift among partners leaves investors in lurch||A rift among the partners of the Chandigarh Citi Center (CCC), a commercial property project in Zirakpur, Mohali, has left over 200 investors in the lurch, who allege that the builders cheated them by not fulfilling the promises made at the time of investment. There were around eight partners when the project started in 2011 but most of them left, alleging fund misappropriation by the main partners. Currently, there are only two partners left in the project.Around 25 investors said that on June 8, they had given a written complaint to the additional chief secretary of the local bodies department, deputy commissioner and additional deputy commissioner of Mohali, but no action has been taken yet.‘TALL CLAIMS FELL FLAT’They further stated that the builder had made tall claims of providing facilities such as open-air gym, amphitheatre, parking for more than 2,000 cars, maintenance agency and assured return of 12 % per annum on the deposited amount and possession of the project within one-and-a-half years. “Initially, the construction work was started at full swing so as to attract maximum investors but soon after that, work slowed down and ultimately stopped,” they alleged.Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said instructions have already been given to the officers concerned, who are looking into the matter. Once the report is submitted, action will be taken accordingly, he added.Alka Kapoor, who is one of the investors and had bought office space here, said, “I have paid the full amount of Rs.25,60,000, excluding taxes and was issued the allotment letter on September 22, 2018. As per the agreement, possession was to be given in December 2018, but till date, they have not given me the possession as work has still not been completed,” she said, adding that she has lodged a complaint with the real estate regulatory authority (RERA).Another investor, Amit Nagpal, said, “They promised me 12 % assured return every month and last year, they promised physical possession of the office space, but so far, neither have they given any possession nor any return.”When contacted, CCC managing director Tejpal Gupta said, “There are some issues and are in my knowledge. We are sorting it out and hopefully, it will be sorted out within a week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-citi-center-rift-among-partners-leaves-investors-in-lurch/story-RRwYYIgzW6oe9DwsrtjWsK.html
05-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh engg dept gears up to build 139 smart bus shelters||Chandigarh: After several failed attempts previously the Chandigarh engineering department is renewing efforts to build 139 new shelters and repair 132 existing ones.Of the 191 existing concrete ‘heritage’ shelters , 139 additional ones will be rebuilt and 52 repaired. The old concrete shelters were built after factoring in the architectural ethos of the city, and the administration has insisted on preserving the design and style.The department has made four attempts so far to build the new shelters and repair the old ones, none of which have worked.“The successful bidder has to construct, repair, and maintain the shelters. The firm can generate revenues through selling advertisement space there. The company has to bear the construction cost and share the advertisement revenue with the administration,” said an official of the department who did not want to be named. MC to get ad revenuesAdvertisement revenues will go to the MC and licence fee to operate the shelters will go to the transport department.An intelligent transport system (ITS) is crucial for a smart city like Chandigarh. “The transport department been pushing the engineering department to expedite the project, which has floated tenders now to build the shelters and to carry out the repair work,” said a senior union territory (UT) official. Information hubsPart of the ITS project, the smart bus queue shelters are to be used as information hubs for passengers using local Chandigarh Transport Union (CTU) buses. Digital information boards, dynamic and static, will be put up there to display live information on bus location, routes, arrival and departure timing, and bus ETA for a particular shelter.Real-time information on buses will also be available on a mobile application. CTU services will be upgraded with IT-enabled solutions as well.A primary control station will keep track of all buses though global positioning system (GPS) and monitor them under a planned system.Bus depots will be linked to the primary control station via LAN connections and bus drivers will be provided with SMS facility to inform about their leaves that will be monitored by the central system of CTU.“Significantly, even though the transport department was laying emphasis on construction/repair of around 80 shelters that are key to starting ITS, the engineering department went ahead with the overall project. It will take another at least nine months for the shelter work to get completed, and that also if any company gets the contract,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-engg-dept-gears-up-to-build-139-smart-bus-shelters/story-HgmO0SJKRpr2mc0KGqpYvN.html

05-07-2020||Lucknow||Major revenue earning depts of UP fail to meet targets again||The Uttar Pradesh government’s major revenue earning departments have failed to meet tax collection targets for third consecutive month, realizing only 37.77 per cent of the targeted tax revenue from April 1 to June 30, the first quarter of 2020-2021, amid fight against Covid-19.The UP government’s total tax revenue collection in first quarter (April 1 to June 30, 2020) was Rs 15,716.48 against the targeted tax revenue of Rs 41,602.68 crore.As the collections were only 37.49% of targets on non-tax revenue front too, the UP government may have to mobilise additional resources soon, if situation fails to improve in coming months.“We hope the situation on tax collection front will improve in coming months. More activities have been allowed now and this will generate more revenue. In June 2020 we have collected about 61 per cent revenue against targets,” said additional chief secretary, finance Sanjiv Mittal.Mittal’s optimism is based on the fact that the tax collections in June 2020 have been considerably higher than the collections in first two months of the first quarter of 2020-2021. UP government earned tax revenue of Rs 8848.69 crore against a target of Rs 14447.47 crore from June 1 to June 30, 2020. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has already asked mining department to start tendering process for mining of minor minerals from October 1, 2020 to earn more revenue. In a statement in June 2020, he had exuded confidence about increase in state government’s earnings saying there was no proposal to levy any new taxes in view of upward trend in the revenue collections in UP.Significantly, GST compensation of Rs 3092.44 crore from the Centre (Rs2259.96 crore received in June 2020 and Rs 832.48 crore received in April 2020) has come as a big help to the state government. The GST compensation has taken the government’s total available tax revenue in first quarter to Rs 18,808.92 crore though tax earnings in the period remained only Rs 15716.48 crore.“The GST compensation for previous financial year received in the first quarter obviously has helped and payment of salaries and other dues well in time,” said senior officer of UP government.A close scrutiny of the revenue earned in the first quarter of 2020-2021 indicates that excise continues to remain the highest revenue earning department after the GST while VAT remains on third place now. The state government was able to get Rs 5589.11 crore as GST in the first quarter while Rs 4978.75 crore was earned from excise. The revenue collected from VAT was Rs 2944.02 crore during the same period. The earnings from stamps and registration remained at Rs1412.89 crore while transport department collected tax of Rs 632.69 crore. Land revenue got Rs 111.00 crore while energy department was able to get Rs 48.02 crore only.Among non-tax revenue earning departments, mining and minerals department got Rs 633.43 crore against target of Rs 900 crore while total non-tax revenue collected in first quarter was Rs 1696.27 crore against target of Rs 4524.55 crore.“An upward trend in state government’s tax earnings is a good sign. The state government’s revenue, including earnings from VAT, transport and stamps and registration gives indication of revival of economy. More revenue collection gives the government leeway to focus on development activities,” said Yashvir Tyagi, former professor, economics department, LU.The state government spends a sum of Rs 12,000 crore to Rs 13,000 crore every month on salaries and pension of its employees. As the total earnings of the first quarter are only about Rs 15716.48 the state government faces a wide gap between earnings and tax collections. It has already initiates measures to cut down its expenditure, besides freezing the dearness allowance and scrapping other allowances. “The state government has to go a long way to increase earnings and strengthen its finances. If there are no more lockdowns due to Covid-19 pandemic, the situation will improve in coming months,” said Tyagi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/major-revenue-earning-depts-of-up-fail-to-meet-targets-again/story-1n2iuvBPagmif6MQDsoW3N.html

05-07-2020||Chandigarh||Vehicular density linked to rise in nitrogen oxide levels in Chandigarh: Study||Nitrogen oxide (NOx) levels are increasing in the city due to higher vehicular density, reveals a study by the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) on air quality in the last 25 years.NOx are a group of toxic gases that contribute to the formation of aerosols and ozone that can worsen respiratory conditions and cause other health problem. The study showed a 68.2 % and 165.2% increase in NOx concentration at commercial and industrial sites, respectively, in 2018 as compared to 2000. This can be linked to increased vehicular emissions.The study titled Air pollution trend in Chandigarh city situated in Indo-Gangetic Plains: Understanding seasonality and impact of mitigation strategies has been authored by Ravinder Khaiwal (department of community medicine and school of public health, PGIMER), Tanbir Singh and Suman Mor (department of environment studies, Panjab University) and Vivek Pandey (Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee).Increasing trend at all locations“As in the year 2011, vehicle number has increased by 270%. Similarly, the concentration of NOx is showing an increasing trend at all the locations in Chandigarh,” the study reads.Chandigarh has the highest vehicular density (878 registered motor vehicles per thousand persons) in India due to which vehicular emissions can be considered as one of the primary sources of background air pollution here. The study has also shown higher particulate matter (PM) 10 concentration (which are inhalable and hazardous to health) in winter as compared to monsoon as air quality deteriorates during December due to crop-residue burning and meteorology. More pollution in winter Winter of 2018 had the highest PM10 levels, and the concentration decreased by 28 to 47% during monsoon.As per United Nations Environmental Protection Agency, “Breathing air with a high concentration of NO2 can irritate airways in the human respiratory system. Such exposures over short periods can aggravate respiratory diseases, particularly asthma, leading to respiratory symptoms (such as coughing, wheezing or difficulty breathing), hospital admissions and visits to emergency rooms.”According to the study, air pollutants show strong seasonal variability having a higher concentration in post-monsoon and winter season, which was found to be linked with activities such as crop residue burning and use of solid biomass fuel for cooking and other purposes.Besides, industrial and commercial sites show a statistically declining trend of PM10. In industrial areas, the reason could be attributed to stricter implementation of air pollution control policies. At commercial sites, moving of interstate bus terminals has restricted movement of diesel buses and cleaner air.The study underlines the need for stringent action to control air pollution due to non-exhaust emissions, municipal solid waste, and crop residue burning to minimise public health and climate risk||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/vehicular-density-linked-to-rise-in-nitrogen-oxide-levels-in-chandigarh-study/story-jPUM59x0G1IuPTJDabQZcO.html

The development comes amid the border stand-off between India and China in Ladakh and the consequent cancellation of bids given to Chinese firms in various projects across sectors.According to an official from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), the bids were invited in December last year and recently, domestic manufacturer Bharat Earth Movers Ltd (BEML), Canadian company Bombardier and Chinese firm CRRC Corporation Ltd, expressed their interest in the project. MMRDA is executing the Mumbai Metro projects.MMRDA officials said that any further decision on the Chinese company’s bid will depend on the central government’s stand on the issue.“The situation is very sensitive right now. The decision to allow a Chinese player will depend on the stand taken by the Government of India as well as the German company which is funding the project,” a senior MMRDA official, who did not wish to be named, said. A German state-hold development bank, KfW, is funding for the rolling stock of Metro 4 and 4A, both under-construction.Last month, CRRC Corporation Ltd and another Chinese company – BYD Co Ltd – had shown interest in manufacturing 10 additional rakes for the monorail. However, MMRDA had then terminated the bids stating that it will look for Indian manufacturers following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call of ‘Aatma Nirbhar Bharat’ or self-reliant India.On Friday, HT had reported that the authority is now in talks with three Indian companies for the monorail rakes. The rolling stock for Metro-2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro-7 (Dahisar E-Andheri E) is also being procured from Bengaluru-based BEML. Recently, Nitin Gadkari, Union minister for road and transport, had said that no Chinese company will be allowed to bid for highway projects and even those entering a joint venture with Indian companies will also be banned. The Centre had also banned 59 Chinese apps earlier this week, citing security and privacy concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/chinese-firm-bids-for-metro-work-mmrda-to-decide-soon/story-1lP7Ev5sDHkKO9tZEw38uO.html

The development comes a day after HT reported that the judicial inquiry report held two serving and three retired MC employees responsible for the lapses that led to the accident. Addressing a press conference, Deepak Kumar, son of Girender Kumar, one of the victims, said it was really unfortunate that the political leaders who were responsible for the accident have been being spared.Navjit Singh, whose son was killed in the accident, said, “Until the magisterial probe indicts the Dussehra committee members and railway employees as well, justice would not be considered as having been done to the victims.”“For the last two years, we have been demanding jobs as promised by the then local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and mayor Karamjit Singh Rintu, but to no avail, “ said Kamal Makhan, the father of another victim.Also, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader and former MLA Virsa Singh Valtoha accused Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi of securing a clean chit for the then local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and his wife Navjot Kaur, who was chief guest at the Dussehra function.“The judicial probe by a retired judge wrongfully framed junior officers of the municipal corporation. The employees could not have refused directions from the local bodies minister who was also the sitting MLA from the Amritsar (East) constituency where the function was held in contravention of all rules and regulations,” said Valtoha during a press conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2018-amritsar-dussehra-train-accident-punish-politicians-responsible-for-tragedy-too-victims-kin/story-AGnqvLqh2RNyVONC9nYx6L.html
05-07-2020||Mumbai||HC raps state for inaction against vendors who sold spurious soybean seeds to farmers||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has rapped the state government for not showing any inclination towards taking action against vendors supplying spurious soybean seeds to thousands of farmers in rural Maharashtra. The court took suo moto cognizance of news reports pertaining to complaints of 2,000 farmers who had purchased soybean seeds for sowing during the ongoing Kharif season, but the seeds did not sprout, and the farmers suffered losses.The court observed that the government did not show any haste in taking action against such vendors even though the farmers in Marathwada and Vidarbha region are poor and such fraud by the soybean seed vendors was detrimental to their survival.A division bench of justice TV Nalawade and justice D Kulkarni on June 26, was hearing the petition initiated after news reports surfaced of farmers from districts like Nanded, Latur, Parbhani, Hingoli and Ahmednagar complaining to the authorities that soybean seeds purchased by them recently, did not germinate. The court said that in light of the reports it had asked the office to register suo moto public interest litigation to see that action is taken against the shop owners and the companies, if any, who had put such bogus seeds in the market. The court-appointed advocate PP More as amicus curiae to assist the court.The minister for agriculture of the state on June 25, had expressed that there are no provisions under the Seeds Act, 1966 for taking action against the concerned. He further said that the state will try to see that farmers are given other seeds. Referring to this statement, the court said, “It can be said that the government, the concerned department has no intention to take criminal action against the vendors and producers of the bogus seeds, even when they have duped the farmers and they have caused huge loss not only to the farmers but to the country.”The court then observed that as farmers incurred huge expenses while sowing the seeds, and such incidents occurred frequently, the matters cannot be closed only by supplying more seeds to the farmers by the state. “This season is more peculiar as due to the Covid-19 pandemic peculiar circumstances are created. These peculiar circumstances are used by the traders and so, the offence committed by them is grave in nature,” the court observed.Holding that as the Seeds Act stipulated the minimum limit of germination and purity and the seed inspector had powers to take action against vendors supplying bogus seeds under section 420 of Indian penal Code. However, the failure of the seed inspector to initiate proceedings was prompting it to pass directions to the state.The court directed the state to provide details of the date and number of complaints received by the police, nature of complaints, action taken by seed inspector at tehsil level, number of routine visits to shops selling seeds and seizure and testing of seeds and number of similar complaints received by agriculture department in last five years.The matter had been posted for hearing on July 3 but was adjourned to Tuesday, July 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-raps-state-for-inaction-against-vendors-who-sold-spurious-soybean-seeds-to-farmers/story-PYoUFcaw2pXKOGYH6AXO3O.html

On enquiry, the child revealed that she had been repeatedly raped by some persons from the neighbourhood.The woman then approached the local police station in Sangli and based on her complaint, a first information (FIR) was registered on June 5. On June 16, following a medical examination of the minor, her mother was informed that the pregnancy could not be terminated without permission of the HC, as it had crossed the 20-week limit set by the Medical Termination of Pregnant Act, 1971.A medical board from the Government Medical College and Hospital at Miraj examined the 12-year-old pursuant to order passed by HC on June 26 and opined that if allowed to progress, the pregnancy would have serious repercussions on the general and mental health of the survivor. It, therefore, recommended that she should be allowed to terminate the pregnancy.The bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Surendra Tavade accepted the recommendation. “In the case at hand, the physical and mental trauma that will be suffered by the minor if the pregnancy is not terminated requires no elaboration,” said the bench.It has now asked the petitioner woman to approach the hospital where the minor’s unwanted pregnancy will be medically terminated on July 6.The court has also directed the hospital to preserve blood and tissue samples of the foetus, which may be required as forensic evidence in the criminal case.The court has further directed the doctors to ensure that all necessary facilities are provided to the foetus for saving its life if it is born alive. HC clarified that if the child born is alive and the petitioner woman and her daughter are not willing to or not in a position to take responsibility for it, the state and its agencies will have to assume full responsibility for the child.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-allows-12-yr-old-rape-survivor-to-terminate-pregnancy/story-Im1ke6pdlUj3jJdxEBgJvL.html

A first information report (FIR) was registered basis on his complaint.The father then moved the high court seeking permission for medical termination of pregnancy (MTP), as his daughter’s unwanted pregnancy had crossed 20 weeks of gestation – the outer limit set by the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971. He prayed for permission on the grounds that his daughter’s mental and physical health was at serious risk because of the pregnancy, and that there was an inherent risk to her life due to her young age.On June 23, HC referred the minor to a medical board at KEM Hospital. Two days later, the board submitted its report opining that “the patient should be advised to continue the pregnancy with medical and psychological support”.However, on June 26, HC sought a further report from the medical board, indicating whether it would be safe for the minor to undergo the MTP procedure. Accordingly, the board submitted another report on June 29, stating that in the case of advanced pregnancies, the chance of haemorrhage is higher.The second report also highlighted the chance of infection and that “it could lead to a catastrophe like infertility, ectopic pregnancy that is potentially fatal”.The report stated that if the termination were to be a failure, the girl would require a Cesarean operation, which would then lead to scarring. “[The scar] is more likely to give way in any subsequent pregnancy as and when it may occur. Depending on the situation, that may need a hysterectomy – removal of uterus,” it mentioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-nod-to-teen-rape-survivor-to-end-pregnancy-in-interest-of-future/story-qJuIOHKKBQ8bmOv7yZbQQI.html

The conduit Bhagwan Singh was arrested on Monday while accepting Rs 1 lakh from the complainant.The investigating agency submitted before the court that Jaswinder made a false DDR entry at the Manimajra police station on June 30, saying that she had returned from the CBI office. “The reality is that she has been on the run since June 30 and her phone is also switched off,” the CBI stated, adding that letters have been sent to senior officers of Chandigarh police, asking them to direct her to join investigation. “It has been informed that she has been suspended on account of the false DDR entry,” CBI told the court. Jaswinder, who was shifted to police lines, has neither joined duty there or visited her home.Bhagwan’s remand extended The CBI court, on Saturday, extended the remand of the accused, Bhagwan, by four days. CBI teams had visited the houses of the other accused-- Randhir Singh, who had complained that Gurdeep Singh had duped him of Rs 28 lakh on the pretext of providing a government job to his wife, one Daljit Singh and Nirpinder Singh alias Nippy, all residents of Sangrur, but they too are missing. As per the complaint, Gurdeep Singh had alleged that Narpinder Singh was present in the police station when Jaswinder Kaur had demanded bribe.Son writes to CBI, says Jaswinder was implicatedJaswinder Kaur’s son Gurpreet Singh has written to the CBI, alleging that his mother is being framed. He said that the alleged bribe amount was actually part of a compromise and Bhagwan Singh was the mediator.

The number of deaths due to the viral infection stood at 3,004, according to the daily health bulletin released by the Delhi government, with 26 “old cases” added to the cumulative number.This puts the city’s care fatality rate to 3.09%.Delhi had recorded its first death on March 13 — a 68-year-old woman from Janakpuri who got the infection from her son who had travelled to Switzerland, Japan, and Italy. From then, it took exactly two months for Delhi to record the first 100 deaths due to Covid-19, days after Delhi’s death audit committee started adding backlog deaths after a discrepancy in the cumulative state data and data from individual hospitals was highlighted.Also read: Maharashtra’s highest spike takes its Covid-19 tally past 2 lakhDelhi crossed the 1,000-death mark on June 11, when the addition of 101 deaths took the city’s cumulative toll to 1085.On Saturday, the city recorded 2,505 new cases of Covid-19 taking the cumulative total to 97,200. On the same day, 2,632 people recovered from the infection taking the number of people who have beaten the infection so far to 68,256.This puts Delhi’s recovery rate at just over 70%.Along with the increase in testing and reduced positivity rate, Delhi’s recovery rate has also increased – a positive indicator keeping the city’s total number of active cases or those living with the infection a constant between 25 and 26 thousand.“This is the first time that the recovery rate of Covid-19 in Delhi has gone beyond 70%. Meaning 70% of the total number of patients have already recovered. Among the 97,200 patients, 68,256 have recovered. Positivity rate (meaning the number of people testing positive among those tested) is 10.58%, which had increased to 36.94%,” tweeted Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia.With increased testing and more cases being detected in the city, the case fatality ratio has decreased over the last two weeks – the average case fatality ration recorded during the week ending on June 21 was 3.79%, and that during the week ending on June 28 was 3.32.Also read: ICMR says following globally accepted norms to fast-track vaccine; wants to ‘cut red tape’In the same time the average number of tests – both rapid antigen and RT-PCR – conducted in the city went up from 11,346 during the week ending on June 21 to 18,343 during the week ending on June 28.During the current week, 20,325 samples were tested each day, with an average positivity rate – the number of people testing positive among those tested – of 11.7%. This had shot up to an average of 31.4% during the second week of June. The highest positivity rate – as referred to by the Deputy CM – was recorded on June 13.“The efforts of 2 crore people of Delhi has showed results. Congratulations to all Delhi’s corona warriors as Delhi’s recovery rate has increased to over 70%. We all need to work harder to defeat corona,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-deaths-in-delhi-pass-3-000-but-recovery-rate-also-highest-so-far/story-Zi4Ix5AyglX4Ur2gKb60zI.html
05-07-2020||Delhi||Coronavirus cases surge in Delhi jails, authorities come up with action plan||The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in Delhi’s three prisons -- Tihar, Mandoli and Rohini -- have gone up from 68 on June 21 to 137 till July 3, officials records show, prompting the jail authorities to come up with a 24-point action plan including rapid antigen testing and contact tracing to contain the spread of the viral disease. Officials in the three prisons attributed the sharp rise in the number of cases to the aggressive testing. A total of 480 tests – 237 RT-PCR and 243 rapid antigen – have been done so far. Director-General (prisons) Sandeep Goel said the 24-point actionable plan includes the creation of a special task force (STF) in each of the three prisons to carry out the contract tracing of the Covid-19 positive prisoners and staffers and regular screening of jail inmates. The STF will comprise of the chief medical officer, superintendent and a couple of other senior officials of the concerned jail.Also read: Delhi govt offers incentives to hire intensive care specialistsGoel said a rapid antigen testing camp has been set up at the government dispensary at Tihar residential complex for around 2,600 prison staffers, including 800 security personnel from Tamil Nadu Special Police, who are deployed on the security duty at the three jails.Till July 3, according to the data shared by Tihar jail administration, 243 jail staff of the total 2,600 have got themselves tested, following the contact tracing of positive Covid-19 inmates and jail staff. Of them, 38 tested Covid-19 positive.“The rapid antigen testing in our jail complexes is primarily for our staff members. The inmates are mostly being tested by RT-PCR methodology. Apart from those identified through the contact tracing procedure, the rapid antigen testing is done on voluntary basis too,” said Goel.Tests that detect presence or absence of an antigen in the body are called antigen detection tests. An antigen is a foreign molecule that induces an immune response within the body, especially the production of antibodies, and detecting its presence determines infection. The test has high specificity (true negative rate) of 99.3% to 100%, which rules out people who are not infected. Tests with a high specificity are most useful when the result is positive. Sensitivity (true positive rate) is lower at 50.6% to 84%, which makes it less accurate in correctly diagnosing a positive case. This is why people with symptoms who test negative have to undergo an RT-PCR test to rule out active infection. Of the total 137 cases, 53 are prisoners and 84 jail staff. Among the 53 prisoners, one, a murder convict, Kanwar Singh,62, died in Mandoli Jail on June 15. In all, 29 Covid-19 positive prisoners have recovered. From the 84 Covid-19 positive jail staff, 23 have recovered, the data shows. Tihar Prisons (which includes Mandoli and Rohini) is the largest prison complex in Asia and nearly 13,600 prisoners were lodged there before the lockdown was announced on March 24. A total of 4,129 prisoners, including 1,168 convicts, were released from the three prisons on interim bail or emergency parole in a drive carried out following the court’s order to decongest the jails to contain the spread of Covid-19.Following the spurt in cases, the prison officers have converted semi-open and open jail buildings into designated isolation hostels for prison staff. As the semi-open and open jails in Tihar jail complex are not operational since the Covid-19 outbreak hit the national capital, the two buildings have been converted as designated isolation hostels for prison staff, senior jail officials said.Also read: At capacity, Chhatarpur centre to dish out 100k meals a day“The objective is to provide isolation facility to staffers who test positive but do not have enough space at their homes for self-isolation,” said a senior jail official, who asked not to be named.Similarly, isolation wards have been created in each jail for isolating prisoners who tested positive for the virus.Goel said a double-layer screening arrangement has been put in place for the checking new prisoners before shifting them to the barracks. The first screening is done at the central public relations officer’s (CPRO) office, which is located near Gate No. 4 of Tihar jail, while the second screening is done at the entry gate of the ward.“Entry of new inmates has been restricted only to two sub jails -- one adolescent jail and one female jail to segregate them from other prisoners for 14 days. Suspension of court production of inmates and discontinuation of visits by family members and outside agencies, including NGOs are other key points in our action plan,” said Goel.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital, said, “Since jails are crowded places and inmates stay in congested spaces, the Covid-19 virus can spread faster in such places. But at the same time, the virus can also be contained faster if the preventive measures and guidelines are strictly implemented, as these are confined places and every activity can be monitored and regulated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cases-surge-in-delhi-jails-authorities-come-up-with-action-plan/story-hmut4UhktaMlT6INiEPeiP.html
05-07-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Dilli Haat reopens, but customers stay away||A bustling tourist hub till it shut as part of the government’s bid to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease, the Dilli Haat in INA reopened after more than three months on Saturday to barely any visitors. In fact, few stores were open either, with several shopkeepers and owners still away.Save for the government-run handicrafts ‘Tribes of India’ shops, no stores or food stalls at Dilli Haat were open on Saturday. Some of the owners, who had come, left within hours. HT spotted one or two visitors, but they too left when they saw all the eateries shut. Chui Shangs, who runs a Manipur handicrafts store, was leaving around 3pm. “I did some cleaning, but there were no customers since morning, so I shut the store for the day,” she said. At the eateries, most owners said their employees had returned to their home states — Mizoram, Nagaland, Bihar among others. “I received an SMS around 5pm on Friday to open the store from Saturday. It will take at least 15-20 days to clean up and procure stock. Besides, most of my staff have not returned to Delhi. it will take them close to a week to arrange for travel and come to work,” said a food stall owner, who asked not to be named.A group of stall owners said they had met the manager of the Dilli Haat on Saturday morning to raise their concerns related to the rent. “We have been told to pay rent from July 4. But there are no customers. How can they charge us rent while we have almost no business? We have requested them to consider charging only 50% rent or allow us to open fully from August, by when we can set up the logistics,” he said.Tenants were exempt rents for April, May and June, they said.The monthly rents of the stalls vary from ₹ 50,000- ₹70,000.The ticket counters were closed, with entry made free to encourage visitors.The government-run shops offered 40% discount on all items. “Earlier the discount was only applicable on select items. Now, it has been given on all items to encourage customers. We have had not a single customer so far,” said an employee at the Tribes of India store in the afternoon. Nidhi Bharadwaj, who works in Hauz Khas, had come to the Haat along with her colleague in the afternoon. “We thought we would eat something nice, as this was one of our usual hangout places near the workplace. But nothing was open,” Bharadwaj said. Some of the artisans, who sit outside the stores at the Haat, came in on Saturday as well. Surendra Kumar Ram, who sells Jharkhand fabrics, said he found out the shop was opening only in the morning through the newspapers. Ratan Singh, chief manager, Dilli Haat, said, “All government-run stores are open. We have informed all artisans all over the country to start coming in. At least those in Delhi and nearby areas can start coming. The footfall will pick up in some days. We had to start somewhere. We did not ask for rents for April, May and June, but now we expect them to open, and that business will pick up. The owners’ demands regarding reducing the rent for some time is under consideration.” The Garden of Five Senses in south Delhi, which was among the five tourist spots that opened on Saturday fared better. “Around 40-50 people have dropped in since morning. Only the garden area is open, while the amphitheatre and the canteen are closed. People are asked to sit at least a metre away from one another and wear masks at all times,” said the security supervisor of the garden. Anas Abdullah, an MBA student from Madangir had come along with his friend. “I saw online that the place has been opened and decided to come out. So far weekends were just about being home. I just wanted to take a break from staying at home,” he said. The Delhi tourism department had on Friday announced that all three centres of Dilli Haat, Nature Bazaar, The Garden of Five Senses, Azad Hind Gram and GTB Memorial would open from July 4 and that no entry fee would be charged for the first 15 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tourist-hubs-in-delhi-reopen/story-v3bTDFkEmJ8rtp6QvLDTyN.html
05-07-2020||Delhi||Positivity rate in Delhi at 7.2%, 181,883 antigen tests so far: Govt data||Of the 11 districts in Delhi, Shahdara in the trans-Yamuna region, has seen the highest positivity rate in the rapid antigen tests being conducted across the Capital over the past two weeks, government data showed on Saturday.The rapid antigen test, a much faster way to confirm positive cases, was started on June 18 as part of the Centre’s and the state government’s efforts to ramp up testing in Delhi. Government reports seen by HT showed that till Friday 181,883 antigen tests were conducted in Delhi, of which 13,100 people were found positive. The positivity rate of the antigen tests in the city as on July 3 was 7.20%. This is 0.26 percentage points lower than the positivity rate of 7.46% that was reported till June 26.An analysis of the district-wise data of the antigen tests showed that Shahdara district has the highest positivity rate of 11.29%. The district has conducted 16,724 antigen tests so far, of which 1,888 tested positive.Also read| ‘Delhi won’t have 5.5 lakh Covid-19 cases by July end, Manish Sisodia’s comments created fear’: Amit ShahThe cluster reports of Shahdara district for July 3 and July 2 showed that the zone has seen as many as 229 cluster cases and 114 single or individual cases in the past two days. The total Covid-19 cases reported from the district in these two days, including those emerging from the containment zones was 389.“The high positivity rate should not come as a surprise in Shahdara district because the area is very densely populated and is highly congested. It also houses a number of health workers since two dedicated Covid-19 hospitals GTB and Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty hospitals are in the neighbouring northeast district,” said a senior official from the district administration.In absolute numbers, the Southwest district has conducted the maximum number of antigen tests and accounts for the highest number of positive cases. This district also had the highest number of containment zones (81 as on Friday). It has so far conducted 26,460 tests, of which 2,595 tested positive. The positivity rate is 9.81%, the third highest of all the 11 districts.“Our district has the highest number of antigen testing centres of all districts. We have a total of 44 centres, so naturally the number of tests conducted is much higher than others. We are conducting tests touching all areas from Dwarka to Najafgarh in outer Delhi,” said a senior district official.Also read: The science behind Delhi’s five-pronged fight against Covid-19At 10.15% the West district has the second highest positivity rate after Shahdara, while northwest district has the lowest positivity rate at 3.22%. The northwest district has so far conducted 14,239 tests of which 458 tested positive till Friday. Saturday’s data from all districts had not been compiled till this report was filed.The media advisor to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal did not comment on the matter. Lalit Kant, a scientist and former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at ICMR said such kind of district-wise data helps the authorities in identifying the transmission rate in different areas. “Also, such data helps in identifying the type of positivity. So, those who are asymptomatic should be isolated at home immediately, while moderate and serious patients anyway have to go to institutional facilities. On the basis of this, high-risk contacts should also be traced and isolated,” said Kant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/positivity-rate-in-delhi-at-7-2-181-883-antigen-tests-so-far-govt-data/story-Z0xsHL3q5XXPMjuyIB6ktM.html
05-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi University extends date of registration to July 18||Delhi University (DU) has extended the date of registration for admission in undergraduate, postgraduate, MPhil and PhD courses till July 18. The registration process, which had begun on June 20, was scheduled to close on Saturday.According to DU’s dean of admissions Shobha Bagai, the decision was taken following the postponement of the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) and National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET). “Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, the university has received a tremendous response in terms of applications. The decision of extension of the registration has been taken keeping in view the notification of declaration of class 12 results by CBSE and postponement of JEE and NEET,” she said.Results of CBSE’s class 12 examinations will be declared by July 15. The Union human resource development (HRD) ministry had announced Friday to postpone both JEE and NEET exams till September. A member of the university’s admission team, asking not to be named, said, “Mostly, NEET and JEE aspirants register and take admission in DU colleges before their results are announced. However, many of them cancel their admission once they are able to secure a seat in an engineering or medical college. So, it’s better the varsity syncs its admission process with other competitive exams.”By Saturday evening as many as 2,15,435 paid applications had come through for undergraduate courses, 1,00,198 for postgraduate courses and a total of 12,800 for MPhil and PhD courses at DU. Last year, the varsity had received as many as 2,58,388 applications for undergraduate courses, 1,31,129 for postgraduate courses and a total of 20,862 applications for MPhil and PhD programmes. Many students, who could not fill the forms by Saturday evening, also welcomed the move. Gyan Kumar, a resident of Mehrauli, said he could not fill the form since his OBC certificate is awaited. “I got really late in getting my certificate issued to apply for admission under the OBC quota. With this decision, I will have some more time to obtain my certificate and register for the varsity,” he said.In view of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, DU has shifted its admission process completely online. The admission process has also been delayed by over two months this year due to the prevailing situation. Last year, the registration process had begun on May 30 and the first cut-off list was announced on June 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-university-extends-date-of-registration-to-july-18/story-7NR2x7Jue3XQjtaeB7FFCI.html
05-07-2020||Delhi||Modify approach to door-to-door Covid-19 survey, suggests govt report||New Delhi: A report jointly prepared by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoH&FW), the Delhi government, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and NITI Aayog has stated that a door-to-door survey to identify those with symptoms of Covid-19 may not be “suitable for Delhi at this juncture”. HT has seen the report.As per the directive issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on June 29, district administrations were directed to complete door-to-door survey in all the 445 containment zones of Delhi by July 6. This was to be followed by a similar survey across the city.But now, the second part of the survey, which meant covering more than 40 lakh households in Delhi, is likely to be tweaked to cover more specific geographic and demographic areas based on the emergence of Covid-19 cases, officials privy to the development said.The report says that while an extensive survey may help in early identification of symptomatic and high-risk individuals, it could also adversely impact contact tracing. Instead, it suggests a modified approach for survey by classifying the localities into containment zones, areas with isolated cased and areas which are yet to report any cases or “free areas”. “Conducting such an extensive survey may help in early identification of people with influenza like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI). It could also identify the high-risk individuals including senior citizens, pregnant women and malnourished children in the city...But the ongoing survey in containment zones already covers most of the population, and that such a survey could adversely impact contact tracing,” the report dated July 1 states.The report also says that a one-time survey may not be “beneficial” because ILI and SARI symptoms may appear any time. It says that a large population living in the containment zones in Delhi are already part of an intense surveillance programme, which has included all cluster cases that account for 43% of all cases. “There are also practical difficulties with the ongoing intense surveillance work. This (such a survey) may also hamper proper contact tracing in the high-risk areas or containment zones across the city or district or state,” the report states. It said that more than 2,000 new cases and on an average 50-100 deaths per day are being reported daily in Delhi. “Although efforts are being undertaken by the state government and other relevant agencies for containment, numbers of new cases are still increasing daily,” it added.Senior government officials on Saturday said a modified approach to surveillance, including the door-to-door survey, is currently under “active consideration” of the Centre’s expert committee led by Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul. While the MHA did not respond to text queries sent by HT , calls and messages sent to the media advisor to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal went unanswered. Enhance surveillance As part of the modified approach, all districts have been advised to enhance surveillance in containment zones with strict perimeter control.“All districts have been asked to strengthen house-to-house surveys by immediate personal, not telephonic, visits. In buffer zones, apart from the ongoing drill of the same survey, SARI and ILI surveys have to be conducted in all private and government health facilities as well, including OPDs,” said a senior official in the health department.In areas with isolated cases, the district surveillance officers (DSOs) have been asked to review localities which have been regularly reporting cases for over 14 days by mapping of cases in terms of time and geographic location. Epidemiological situation analysis and tracking the transmission chains will also have to be done by the districts in this case.Until July 4, Delhi reported 97,200 cases and 3,004 deaths (accounting for 26 deaths added to the cumulative number). There were 448 containment zones spread across all the eleven revenue districts of the city.Rope in residentsIn areas categorised as “free areas”, officers have been asked to focus on reducing morbidity and mortality among high-risk groups. Apart from this, special surveillance groups are to be formed across the city to ensure the rules of social distancing, wearing masks and disinfection are being followed.The focus of these groups will be rickshaw/auto, taxi, goods carriage and lorry drivers, domestic helps, daily workers (plumbers, electricians, carpenters, etc) and daily suppliers of food, general stores and delivery persons, the report says.“In housing colonies, all elderly and others with co-morbid conditions have to be listed by the districts. Entry of persons coming from affected areas should be avoided. And screening upon entry of everyone must be ensured. The RWAs have to ensure these aspects and stay in touch with district authorities,” a senior official in the revenue department said.In villages, the report states that the same protocol is to be followed with the help of the sarpanch and by constituting Nigrani Samitis (surveillance committees), comprising locals.Lalit Kant, a scientist and former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at ICMR, said instead of house-to-house survey in entire Delhi which merely involves asking questions about any flu-like symptoms, high risk members in the family and possible contact with Covid-19 patients, the authorities should scale up serological survey across the city. “The authorities should rather scale up antibody testing which basically is the serological survey. It will help determine who has antibodies and find out who has been infected with the virus. Even if someone never reported a positive test or experienced symptoms will be identified through this. So, the serological survey should be expanded further as it gives a sense of the extent of the virus in Delhi,” said Kant. On Saturday, sample collection under the serological survey in Delhi was completed and the results of the antibody tests are expected in 2-3 days from the NCDC, senior government officials said. The sero-surveillance study was jointly conducted by the NCDC and Delhi government in all the 11 districts of Delhi focusing on as many as 20,000 households on a random basis. Those who were tested also included individuals below 18 years of age.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/modify-approach-to-door-to-door-covid-survey-suggests-govt-report/story-LdRgfh9HnAgRchhNBYPESK.html

Earlier this month, the district had received around 8,000 kits, most of which had been utilised.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageOn Saturday, the district administration deputed officials to assist health teams in areas of large outbreaks where most of the testing is being done. The assistance will include ensuring availability of infrastructure, security and other requirements.The directions come at a time when social distancing norms were being flouted at test sites.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said that better management would lead to better coverage in testing. “On an average 1,000 antigen tests are being conducted daily. On Saturday, over 1500 tests were done.”The health department is testing in Dundahera, Sukhrali, Patel Nagar, Feroze Gandhi Colony, Om Nagar and Gandhi Nagar.Approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), antigen tests look for specific protein associated with the Sars-Cov-2 virus, the pathogen that causes Covid-19. The state health department has already placed an order of 100,000 kits with a South Korean company that has a manufacturing plant in Manesar. The new test highly specific (99.3% to 100%) — meaning a positive result on the test is a “true positive” and does not need any confirmatory test.The sensitivity is between 50.6% to 84% depending on the viral load, meaning those who test negative might still have the infection and are advised to go for a test through the more reliable RT-PCR method if they show symptoms of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-dept-gets-10-000-more-rapid-antigen-testing-kits/story-3f1fVgGZe1fIUsbiJ3uwCK.html

Geo-fencing refers to using a person’s mobile phone data and creating a virtual boundary. Gurugram Police said technology allows them to triangulate the position and alert them if the person steps out of their home, a police officer said. If the person switches off their mobile phone, the police is alerted. “In that case, we visit their locations and and ensure they are indoors,” Nitika Gahlaut, joint commissioner, Gurugram Police said on Saturday.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe process for geo-fencing people begins with the health department providing the contact information of the patient and their contacts to the police. The information is segregated zone-wise.“We track their number. If any mobile phone is taken out doors, we will know about it and ask the person to remain indoors,” said Gahlaut. After the quarantine period, the phone number and details of the patient are removed from the database. As per police data, they have put around 10,000 people under surveillance and detected that 7,639 persons breached the geo-fence. Over 1180 persons had switched off their phones and deleted Aarogya Setu applications, while police convinced 1119 of them to switch on their phones and re-install the application, the rest were still being traced.Gahlaut also said that some people gave them wrong mobile phone numbers and addresses too. “Things have improved after the testing centres were asked to take valid address proof from the people,” she had said on Friday. Meanwhile, police officers privy to the matter said that most geo-fence breachers were reported from the west district, followed by east district, Manesar and the south district. Out of the 2000, police officials deployed in the city 666 are deployed in the east zone, 566 in west zone and 324 in Manesar for containment duties, nakas and related work. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that strict instructions have been given to all the private labs and hospitals to ensure no test is conducted if people have not given correct credentials and that test will be conducted only after an OTP is received on the given mobile number. “This will ensure the data stored is correct and no fake or wrong information is stored,” he said.Apart from that the police officials from cyber cell and crime branch are also reaching out to trace Covid-19 patients and their contacts. Out of the details of 573 persons received by the Gurugram police, 496 have been verified and 77 are being verified by the crime units, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/police-use-geo-fencing-to-ensure-covid-19-patients-their-contacts-follow-quarantine-rules/story-1KN689F5Xk7JACcYgOP1RJ.html

05-07-2020||Chandigarh||7 Dera Sacha Sauda men held for 2015 Guru Granth Sahib bir theft||The Punjab Police’s special investigation team (SIT), led by Jalandhar range deputy inspector general (DIG) Ranbir Singh Khatra, on Saturday arrested seven Dera Sacha Sauda followers in Faridkot district in connection with a sacrilege incident that had sparked off statewide protests in 2015.Khatra said the accused stole a bir (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib from a gurdwara of Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village on June 1, 2015. The case was registered at the Bajakhana police station in the district.The accused were identified as Sukhjinder Singh, alias Sunny, Nishan Singh and Ranjit Singh alias Bhola all resident of Kotkapura, Shakti Singh of Daggu Romana village, Baljit Singh of Sikhanwala village, Randeep Singh, alias Neela and Narinder Sharma, both resident of Faridkot.‘TWO WERE ALREADY RELEASED ON BAIL’Hours after the arrest of seven dera followers, the Khatra-led SIT produced the accused in a Faridkot court on Saturday afternoon and sought their police custody for investigation. Duty magistrate Chetan Sharma, however, termed the arrest of two of the accused, Sukhjinder Singh, alias Sunny of Kotkapura and Shakti Singh of Daggu Romana village, as “illegal”since both were already released on bail.He also ordered their release. The defence argued that the Sukhjinder and Shakti were already granted bail by the CBI court, Mohali, in the case and the SIT has not taken any approval for their arrest from the court concerned. The court has sent the other five accused to two-day police custody.Defence counsel Vinod Monga said the SIT acted irresponsibly without confirming all the facts. He said Sukjihnder and Shakti both were arrested in this case in 2016 and have spent 11 months in jail.“The SIT was not even aware that the two were arrested in this case earlier. But has admitted the mistake and filed an application asking the court to release both the accused,” he said.DIG Khatra said that all the three cases, which the CBI was probing, have been handed over to them and they have started the investigation. “We have got the remand of five persons while two were released due to some technical legal issues,” he said. “They all are also accused in the 2011 Moga riots case. In the investigation of Gurusar and Malke sacrilege cases, the Moga riots and confession of some accused has revealed that late Mohinderpal Singh Bittu was the main conspirator of the episode. These seven accused acted on his directions. As per investigation, Sukjinder and Randeep had stolen the bir from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village. Later Shakti, Baljit and Ranjit took the bir from them, further Nishan while Baljit took it to Sikhanwala village. We are investigating further to know what happened after that,” he added. THE CASEIn 2018, the Khatra-led SIT had arrested more than 20 followers of the Sirsa-based dera, including Mohinder Pal Bittu, who was killed in the Nabha jail in 2019, in connection with the sacrilege incidents and rioting in Punjab in 2015.The Akali-BJP government, led by Parkash Singh Badal, had handed over the probe into the three sacrilege incidents to the CBI. The first case pertained to the theft of the bir (copy of Guru Granth Sahib) from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village near Kotkapura in Faridkot district on June 1, 2015. The second was the putting up of a poster at Bargari village in the district on September 25, 2015; and the third was the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib as torn pages of the bir were found scattered in front of a gurdwara at Bargari on October 12, 2015.The Congress government, led by Captain Amarinder Singh, however, took back the cases from the CBI and handed over the probe to the Punjab Police SIT, led by Khatra.THE TIMELINEJune 1, 2015: A case pertaining to theft of bir (copy of Guru Granth Sahib) from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village near Kotkapura in Faridkot registered.Sept 25, 2015: Second case registered for putting up of a poster at Bargari village.Oct 12, 2015: Third case registered for the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib as torn pages of the bir were found scattered in front of a gurdwara at Bargari.Nov 2, 2015: The then SAD-BJP government handed over probe to the CBI in these three FIRsNov 30, 2015: The SAD-BJP government constitutes another SIT led by then DIG RS Khatra to probe similar incidents of desecration at Gursar and Malke villages.July 4, 2019: CBI files closure report claiming no proof against Dera Sacha Sauda followers.Sept 6, 2019: A notification issued by Punjab government, withdrawing the consent to the CBI to investigate the case.December 2019: Punjab and Haryana High Court upheld the notification of the Punjab Government to withdraw the investigation in the Bargari sacrilege caseFeb 2020: SC dismisses plea of CBI against withdrawal of consent by Punjab to probe sacrilege cases||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/7-dera-sacha-sauda-men-held-for-2015-guru-granth-sahib-bir-theft/story-Xxok9t7TLq7L38VIZIEcgM.html
05-07-2020||Mumbai||Nine leopards trapped in Nashik in past eight months||A surge in human-animal conflict at forest areas in Nashik has resulted in nine leopards being trapped or tranquilised by the forest department over the past eight months.On Thursday night, a five-year-old female leopard, said to have killed four people and injured three, was trapped in a cage by a team of six forest officials around 9pm. The trapped leopard was transported to Sanjay Gandhi National Park’s (SGNP) leopard rescue centre on Saturday.“The leopard arrived after a five-hour journey (12.30pm to 5.30pm) from Nashik to SGNP through a tedious transportation process due to heavy rain. The animal was deemed medically fit by our veterinarian and was released at one of the rescue cages,” said Vijay Barabde, range forest officer (RFO), SGNP. Last month, a 25-day-old leopard cub was brought to SGNP from Nashik as well.While the five-year-old leopard arrived at SGNP, Nashik forest officials are yet to confirm whether the leopard was responsible for multiple human deaths. The leopard’s scat and swab samples have been sent to the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad for DNA analysis for confirmation. “Until results are received, it is best to keep the animal at SGNP to avoid any other possible conflict situations. There are no rescue centres here,” said Vivek Bhadane, range forest officer (RFO), Nashik.Meanwhile, Bhadane explained that a surge in conflict was witnessed across 25 villages along a 12-km stretch bordering Darna river (between Sinnar and Eklahare areas) where number of leopards have risen significantly. “Farmlands are providing shelter along with a large prey base to these big cats. With three to four cases of human injuries per month, over 200 dogs have been killed by these leopards with an average of 25 dogs killed per month,” said Bhadane, adding that wild boars have also been killed. “The safety of villagers and their children has become a serious concern. Leaving children in the fields alone is now a risk.”So far, six adults and three sub-adults have been trapped or tranquillised. “The eight other leopards were released back into the wild at undisclosed locations in the state. However, the latest case has been the most serious with four deaths,” said Bhadane. There are five leopards in the region presently, he said.Independent experts said Nashik needed to replicate models adopted by Mumbai and Junnar that used to be high conflict zones. “In 2015, a standard operating procedure (SOP) to deal with such conflicts involving leopards was prepared. Nashik has had a problem for a long time now; it is high time they implement existing SOPs or else the situation will only escalate,” said Vidya Athreya, a wildlife biologist.Nikit Surve from the Wildlife Conservation Society-India said, “Long term awareness for villagers, forest department and the media (similar to the Mumbai model) is the key to address this issue.”Senior forest officials said rising conflict was a matter of concern. “Trapping leopards is not the final solution. Similar to the Junnar model, ‘living with leopards’ programme is being implemented in Nashik since a year. Our attempt is to educate villagers about coexisting with leopards. Simultaneously, we are increasing monitoring by scaling up the number of camera traps to 30 from the current less than 10, to understand animal behaviour better,” said Sunil Limaye, additional principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife west).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/nine-leopards-trapped-in-nashik-in-past-eight-months/story-ZwfiqjsdXpbqrgqWxDQjLK.html

He was admitted to hospital for treatment. At least four members are yet to receive their test reports and so they are living in their house. Their waste has to be disposed off correctly so that no one is exposed,” said Col UB Singh, a retired army officer and president of the society’s residents’ association.The Gautam Budh Nagar district development residents’ welfare association (DDRWA), an umbrella body of at least 100 RWAs of the city demanded that the authority handle such waste.“We have appealed to all citizens that they should cooperate the authority’s health department in handling the hazardous waste that includes mask, gloves and waste from a patient’s house. The authority has decided to impose a fine of ₹5000 against those who fail to hand over hazardous waste,” said Sanjeev Kumar vice-president of DDRWA.According to the Noida authority, it has laid down rules on collecting such waste.“We have made sure that such waste should be collected as per laid down guidelines. The waste collection vehicle carries a separate yellow colour bag in which it contains the waste from the houses, where a positive case is confirmed,” said SC Mishra senior project engineer of the Noida authority heading the health department.The authority said that there are at least 200 vehicles, which are engaged in the task of waste collection and each carry a yellow colour bag.“We are treating this waste from positive patient’s house as hazardous waste and treat it accordingly.

05-07-2020||Pune||10,000 cases in just 18 days, Pune breaches 20k mark of progressive Covid cases||The number of Covid-19 positive cases crossed the 20,000 mark as the city recorded 819 cases on Saturday, according to the data provided by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).Pune took 100 days to reach the 10,000-mark of progressive Covid-19 positive cases since the first case was reported on March 9 and in a matter of only 18 days city breached 20,000-mark.The overall tally of progressive positive cases is now 20,668. In the past 24 hours 18 deaths were reported, taking the death toll to 703. As many as 12,689 patients have recovered from the infection, said civic officials. Out of the 7,276 active patients in the city, 385 are in critical condition with 56 on ventilator and 329 in ICU. Besides Pune, other cities in Maharashtra to have crossed 20k-mark includes Mumbai and Thane. Despite repeated lockdown and the civic body’s multiple efforts to contain the spread of the virus, number of cases reported on a daily basis has pushed the tally, adding pressure on the health infrastructure and government authorities.Pune reached the 10,000 mark of Covid cases on June 16. With current doubling rate of 19 days, the city crossed 20,000 cases in just 18 days. As the number of cases rise the number of deaths and critical patients is also rising proportionately.The rising cases has forced civic body to focus on better hospital bed management and will start an interactive coordination and facilitation call centre dedicated for the 24x7 hours service for Covid-19 patients.According to PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad, the civic body is now focusing on bed management so that any Covid-19 positive person who requires a bed does not have to wait for a longer time.“We will train around 50 National Cadet Corps (NCC) and National Service Scheme (NSS) students to run our dedicated Covid19 call centre. We will make sure that all the positive patients are counselled and directed to the nearest Covid care centre or a private hospital within two hours of getting the report,” said Gaikwad.“They will note down all the basic information like age, comorbidities and address and direct the person to the nearest facility. We are adding about two to three facilities every week so that there is no shortage of beds for any patient. Once the details are noted down, the students will forward those details to the doctors and then the doctor or the hospital will get in touch with the patient,” said Gaikwad. “There was some resistance from major private hospitals in the beginning when we regulated the prices for 80% of the beds according to the government GR but then now they have agreed to our terms,” said Gaikwad.According to PMC officials, human interaction has increased in the last few days after Unlock 1.0, which has relaxed some of the curbs.“People in slums have come out in the open to interact with each other. It is practically impossible to stay put inside a 10x10 room which you have to share with 5-6 more people. In housing societies, need for services such as domestic helps and drivers is essential than the fear of Covid which is diminishing now, as more and more people are being cured and are being discharged. That is why we are now focusing on the use of masks which is isolation in itself. We are penalising people not found wearing masks. Increased movement will definitely lead to more cases,” said Gaikwad.Dr Sanjay Dabhade, member of Jan Arogya Manch, which works for public health, said, the focus of authorities should henceforth be on preventive steps rather than lockdown. “It is not possible to lockdown such a huge population for more than a month, there is a question of livelihood and also of the need for human interaction,” said Dabhade. “The government must focus on extensive use of masks. Masks must be compulsory in public places. Those violating norms must face action,” said Dabhade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/10-000-cases-in-just-18-days-pune-breaches-20k-mark-of-progressive-covid-cases/story-9tvIFm0KrtHNcvM49WN5IL.html
05-07-2020||City||Increased fare, low footfall: Pandemic hits auto-rickshaw drivers, passengers in Ludhiana alike||Low footfall in markets and fear among the residents regarding the spread of coronavirus are taking a toll on the livelihoods of auto-rickshaw drivers in the city.On the other hand, the consequential increase in fare from Rs 10 to Rs 20 per ride is burning a hole in the pocket of the passengers. In times like these, the drivers rue that they are only left with Rs 50-Rs 100 for their families at the end of the day. Meanwhile, challans are also being issued to three-wheelers for overloading (more than three passengers), travelling without masks and non adherence to social distancing.An auto-rickshaw driver, Rinku, said, “The people are avoiding auto-rickshaws so the footfall is low. I used to earn around ₹500-600 daily before the lockdown, but now I bring home only ₹50-100 after all my daily expenses are met. I have a family of four and it is difficult for us to make the ends meet even though my wife works as a maid.”‘GOVT SHOULD HELP DRIVERS’The vice-president of Auto Rickshaw Union Sangharsh Committee, Ranjit Singh, said, “We had to increase the fare due to low footfall, increased price of diesel and reduced earnings. The traffic police and administration are not allowing the drivers to seat more than three passengers. The state government should help us drivers; we are struggling to earn even bread and butter for our families.”The passengers, however, have demanded that the administration should intervene to reduce the fare or provide an alternative in the form of public transport.A resident of Karimpura, Gurdeep Singh, said, “The income of a middle class family has decreased but the expenses are increasing. The auto-rickshaw drivers have also hiked the fare, and people have no other choice as there is no other public transport available.”“Earlier, I used to travel by the city bus from Jawahar Nagar area to Clock Tower for Rs 5, but now I have to pay Rs 20 per ride. The administration should fix a cap on the fare,” said Charanjit Singh, another resident. Assistant commissioner of police (ACP, traffic) Gurdev Singh said, “Around 200-250 challans are issued to auto drivers on a daily basis. These include challans for overloading, inadequate documentation, no social distancing and travelling without masks. The police are also spreading awareness among the drivers to allow only two-three passengers in their vehicles.”CITY BUS CONTRACTOR LIKELY TO HIKE FARE Suspended on March 20 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ludhiana city bus service will resume on a single route—Sahnewal to Clock Tower—from Monday. However, the contractor is likely to increase the fare from the earlier ₹5, citing low footfall and increased rates of diesel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/increased-fare-low-footfall-covid-19-hits-auto-rickshaw-drivers-passengers-in-ludhiana-alike/story-RtwHHyIVJpH3KT76R34ZxM.html
05-07-2020||Pune||Private hospitals admit patients with mild or no coronavirus symptoms||Even as the city continues to fight the rising Covid-19 positive cases, the civic administration is in a battle with private hospitals who are reserving beds meant for critical patients for those experiencing only mild symptoms or are even asymptomatic in some cases. In some private hospitals, relatives of patients who have tested positive even though asymptomatic or with mild symptoms are occupying the critical care beds. Click here for full Covid-19 coveragePune mayor Murlidhar Mohol has raised the issue with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, on Friday and urged private hospitals to admit patients only as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines.In a series of tweets, Mohol tweeted, “The state government must take a policy stand to ensure smooth coordination with private laboratories and private hospitals with the civic body.”“Whenever a person from a well to do family tests positive for Covid-19, the private hospitals without looking for the intensity of the symptoms, immediately admits the person. So, about four to five beds are occupied in the process which is required for those who cannot afford home isolation or are likely to become critical,” he said.“The hospital should otherwise divert such patients to civic body quarantine centres or isolation centres,” he said.Shekhar Gaikwad, PMC, chief, said, “There have been such incidents wherein the private hospitals are providing beds to patients who could be otherwise isolated at homes or even at PMC’s Covid-19 care centres.”“When a person is admitted, the bed is occupied for at least ten and this can lead to a shortage of beds if this practice continues,” said Gaikwad.Gaikwad said, “After several meetings with private hospitals we found that there is uncertainty about cash flow and so they are admitting such patients. Many hospitals have taken loans from private banks and so we have raised this issue with the district administration too, to ensure that at least part payments could be released every week or every fortnight.” Dr Sunil Rao, group medical director, Sahyadri Speciality Hospital, said, “The patients insist that they do not want to go to the civic-run centres due to multiple reasons and they want to be admitted at private hospitals. We admit patients only when required.”“Sometimes they test negative for the virus, but then again it could be a false negative and there are some patches of pneumonia and looking at their condition we admit the patient. We have three separate sections now Covid19, non-Covid19 and the grey area where it is not known for sure as to if the patient is Covid-19 positive or negative.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/private-hospitals-admit-patients-with-mild-or-no-symptoms/story-VJHeqDOsFmjrrPzZDEgiBI.html

On Saturday morning (July 4), he visited the Hindu refugee colony near Majlis Park Metro Station in Delhi to distribute cricket kits, toilets and bedding amenities. The area houses a number of Hindu refugees from Pakistan, which are taken care of by the Delhi Riding Club Foundation.“I like to contribute to the society and this was a great experience. The Delhi Riding Club Foundation has been doing a lot of work there, so it was good to collaborate with them. I am in a position where I can contribute in that direction and it gives me immense joy and peace,” says the Delhi-born batsman.  Enjoyed my morning with the refugees staying near Majlis Metro Station. Grateful for the kind reception they gave me 🙏🏼Special thanks to @kookaburracricketofficial for help with the kits!A post shared by  Shikhar Dhawan (@shikhardofficial) on Jul 4, 2020 at 4:17am PDTThe inhabitants of the refugee colony had no idea about Dhawan’s visit, which made it all the more special. “They were quite shocked at first. They were very happy that I came and I could feel their happiness. They asked me about my moustache and asked me to do the thigh fives (his signature celebratory gesture). They told me they enjoy watching my game and the (on-field) celebrations,” he adds. Though it is not unusual for cricketers to sport gloves and shields, this time, given the coronavirus pandemic, the batting gloves were replaced by surgical gloves and the helmet with a mask. Protective gear in place, the left-handed opener took selfies with the refugees and helped boost their morale.

Cricket unites the whole community. It promotes a sense of bonding. You learn how to share, and wait your turn.

05-07-2020||Education||As Delhi schools remain shut, students yet to receive mid-day meal allowance since April||The central government’s mid-day meal programme – according to which students up to class 8 are served cooked, nutritious meals during school hours – has taken a hit as schools remain shut since March in view of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Despite the Centre’s order to provide food security allowance to students amid the lockdown, parents of students of both government and municipal schools in Delhi say they have not received the subsidy since April.The mid-day meal scheme, which aims to provide food security to children from economically weaker families and increase enrolment in public schools, is channelised through state governments.Delhi schools have been shut since March 19. The Centre on March 20 directed states to either provide cooked meals or food allowance to students till schools reopen. In March, between Rs 78 and Rs 95 were transferred to accounts of students of Delhi government and municipal schools.Kulsum Khatun, a resident of Jagdamba camp in Sheikh Sarai, said she has not received any money in the accounts of her two daughters (ages 7 and 9 years) since April. “My two daughters study in a government school in Malviya Nagar. We received around Rs 95 in March but nothing after that. Mid-day meals were very important for us since we hardly make enough to feed them twice a day. Under the lockdown, neither my husband, a a rickshaw puller, nor I got any work,” she said.Like Kulsum, many families from disadvantaged sections were dependent on the meals to feed their children at least once a day. Kamlesh Devi fromJahangirpuri, said her two children – 5-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son – study in a municipal school but have not received any food allowance in this academic session (since April). “They would get chana, puri and halwa in the meals. Ever since the lockdown, my kids could not get any of these items. My husband is a mason . We can only afford chapatis once a day. In other meals, we generally have tea and biscuits,” she said.An NGO, Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan, wrote to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office on June 30. “Since the closure of schools on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, the government has sanctioned food security allowance for the month of March. No meals or food security allowance has been provided for April, May or June. We, therefore, urge you to ensure that mid-day meals are immediately restarted or food security allowance is provided to all eligible children without any delay,” the NGO said in the letter.Yogesh Pratap, deputy director at the directorate of education (DoE), said there has been some delay due to the situation but the government has started the process of transferring the allowance. “First, we will cover lower primary classes (nursery to fifth) and transfer Rs 360 as food security allowance in the accounts of these students for April, May and June. Then we will start the process for upper primary classes (sixth to eighth) and send Rs 480 for three months.”Officials at the south and north corporations said they are yet to receive funds from the state government. Ira Sehgal, the north body’s spokesperson, said, “We have not received funds from the Delhi government since April for the food allowance.” An official from the south corporation cited the same reason.Binay Bhushan, DoE, said: “The department has been regularly transferring money to the civic bodies. They have enough money to transfer food allowance to students.”Arun Kumar, spokesperson for the east civic body, said, “We are processing the allowance of April. It will be transferred by next week. We are trying to send the rest by the end of this month.”Ranjana Prasad, member of the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR), said, “The delay in providing nutritious food to children can aggravate problems of malnutrition. We had, last month, written to the government to take this issue on priority and resume the mid-day meal scheme.”An advisor to Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia said, “The government has started the procedure of transfering food security allowance to the accounts of the students. There has been a delay because majority of the officials have been engaged in covid duties since March.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-as-schools-remain-shut-students-yet-to-receive-mid-day-meal-allowance-since-april/story-Zz1V3NVNaOLoiNkNTJYVnN.html
