20-07-2020||News||The differing digital journeys of India, China||Over the last two decades, India and China have become significant players in the digital ecospace with profiles that are different but convergent. India may be the world’s back office, but its presence in products — software and hardware — is relatively small. China, on the other hand, is big in both domains. On the basis of a back-of-the envelope calculation, the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of their digital sectors over the past two decades appear roughly comparable: India’s digital sector has grown, on average, annually by around 35%, while China has recorded 50%+ growth. However, thanks to compounding of the difference in growth rates over 20 years, the final picture today is different. In 2019, China’s digital economy claimed to have crossed $5 trillion or over a third of the country’s total Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In comparison, India’s current digital economy is estimated around $300 billion, or nearly 12% of the GDP. China’s digital surge has not only reinvented the economy, but has also bolstered the nation’s growth rate. In 2019, for instance, its digital sector’s 15.5% growth was the biggest contributor to the national GDP growth of 6.1%. Globally, China’s digital economy is second only to the United States (US). Although the US still dominates with 18 companies in top-30 digital companies by market capitalisation (2019), China has seven companies in the list, including Alibaba ($402 billion), and Tencent ($398 billion). Recently, however, there are signs that this lopsided China-India’s digital paradigm might be correcting. China’s domestic digital economy is getting saturated and its attempt to expand globally is encountering increased resistance. Last month, India banned 59 Chinese apps. The United Kingdom (UK) reversed its decision to allow Huawei to operate 5G telecom system, and, in this, joined a number of western countries uneasy about Chinese digital exports. In contrast, India’s digital economy seems to be getting a tailwind. Over the past three months, Jio, the largest Indian telecom operator, has managed to get Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) of over $20 billion from 13 global investors for its platforms. Google has announced its intention to invest $10 billion in India’s digital economy over the next five to seven years. Foxconn, which assembles Apple phones here, intends to ramp up mobile production by investing $1 billion in India, already the world’s second-largest mobile manufacturer. Despite the enormous global economic challenges, the four Indian technology majors have had healthy growth in their turnover during Q2/2020. While these may be early hopeful signs of gains in India’s digital journey, we need to acknowledge its strategic importance. At this juncture, we need to study the Chinese strategy over the last two decades to become a digital superpower. In the late 1990s, China realised the potential of these emerging technologies and leveraged them. Foreign digital companies recieved permissions to ply their wares in China’s huge market, but these were withdrawn soon in a seemingly systematic manner, and the entire domestic digital ecospace reserved for its home-grown entities. Thus, China is the only major economy where Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google (FAAMG) are either absent or remain marginal players. Their Chinese clones took full advantage of a near-monopoly to grow exponentially. Meanwhile, China invested heavily in digital hardware technologies from chip-making to telecom systems and acquired companies and start-ups abroad. Thousands of Chinese students and researchers went to western technical institutions to specialise in these domains. While many of the pathways China took to become a digital superpower are relevant to us, replicating them has since become more difficult. Having lost China, FAAAM are determined not let go of India. They have also become more possessive about their technologies. On our side, too, the ecosystem has often rendered only tepid support to the home-grown digital companies. Indian IT companies grow despite the government. There is little point in rediscovering the wheel — we should try and leap-frog into the future. To this end, a strategy leveraging our market size and competence to foster alliances between domestic and foreign digital companies will serve us best. The government can and should make this possible by creating a positive and forward-looking framework and adopt best global practices, particularly on Intellectual Property Rights, data security, taxation, land acquisition and employment. A high-powered inter-ministerial entity could be created to supervise the digital sector and accelerate decision-making. Non-resident Indian (NRI) techno-entrepreneurs should be encouraged to lead this synergy, particularly in creating research and development capacity in emerging technologies, clubbed as the Industrial Revolution 4.0. We also need to develop human resources through better academia-industry interface, adopt employment-friendly syllabi and train our workforce. We also need to appreciate that unlike the brick and mortar economy, digital technologies are less beholden to lure of either geo-economics or size. If the country’s digital economy soars, it will have comprehensive spin-offs for the Indian economy and society — from faster growth to higher employment generation to greater self-reliance in an area, both critical at present and strategic in the future. These are reasons enough for us to act — particularly in the current challenging economic times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-differing-digital-journeys-of-india-china/story-nfCaSr6bn9RoJhb9CclNTN.html
20-07-2020||News||Disentangling India’s trade surplus||In June, India recorded its first trade surplus in the last 18 years, the first such month since January 2002. On a year-on-year basis, the Indian merchandise exports fell 12.4%. The imports fell 47.6% over last June. The cumulative effect was a trade surplus of $790 million.Earlier in May 2020, the trade deficit was $3.15 billion, where the exports had fallen by 36.5% and imports by 51%. This resulted in the trade deficit shrinking by over 79%. In April 2020, India registered a trade deficit of $6.8 billion, with exports falling 60.3% and imports falling by 58.7%.Between April and June, as the economy gradually opened up and as buying centres also restarted business activities, the merchandise export contraction narrowed down from 60.3% in April to 12.4% in June. The rate of contraction in imports, however, has been more stubborn, moving from 58.7% in April to 47.6% in June.So, while the June trade surplus reflects a demand weakness in the Indian economy, shackled by the states imposing their local versions of the lockdowns, which at the central level had started to ease in early June, it also reflects a sharp turnaround in the export activity.Exports can be analysed in two broad categories — petroleum and non-petroleum commodities. In June, the petroleum exports shrunk by 31.6% while the non-petroleum exports were down 10.1%. The global demand for petroleum products has been hit in a big way due to the Covid-19 pandemic, as it has in India. These exports have seen contraction in value terms over the years as crude prices have been benign.What is, however, remarkable for June exports was that the non-petroleum category bounced back to only 10.1% contraction over the last year. In April 2020, the non-petroleum exports had fallen by 59.3% over April 2019. So June 2020, in fact, signified a very strong comeback. Despite facing uncertain global demand and supply disruption, Indian exporters did well to resume operations and maintain order fulfilment flow. Indian imports can be analysed in three broad categories — crude oil and petroleum products, gold and silver, and others.In June 2020, India’s import of crude oil and petroleum products fell 55.3%, which was not unusual. With limited retail sales and restricted commercial goods movement, this demand remained tepid. Another factor in comparing imports in value terms is the pricing of the Indian crude oil basket. Between April and June 2019, the Indian basket was priced upwards of $70 a barrel, while between April and June 2020, the Indian basket peaked around $35 a barrel. So the import contraction in value terms would anyway have been far higher than the import contraction in volume terms. By all accounts, this is not a “bad contraction”.In the months to come, this category of imports should catch up in volume terms as economic activity expands, though it should be kept in mind that the Indian crude oil and petroleum imports will also see long term trend adjustment due to factors such as higher electrification and gasification of the economy. These factors will produce an opposite impact on the import demand in terms of the volume composition.The biggest percentage fall in imports was for the gold and silver category, which shrunk by 76%. As households focused on savings and social occasions such as marriages and festivals became austere, the shrinking of this import category was natural. In commonly accepted economic wisdom, gold and silver imports, and the Indian hoarding of these raw materials, have been long derided as foreign exchange guzzlers. In that sense, a fall in import in this category should actually be welcome news, albeit temporary. As social occasions open up in step with the opening of the economy, eventually, this demand will come back, perhaps attracting the opposite criticism then.The third category of non-crude oil and petroleum products and non-gold and silver imports saw a shrinking of 41%. This category, which formed 65% of the total imports in June 2019, shrunk by the narrowest margin in June 2020 among the three categories. These imports have elements such as capital goods, which signify industrial activity and demand as well as consumer goods, which signify consumption demand in India. Falling imports in this category do signify that the Indian domestic demand environment remained weak — but in a lockdown, this was to be expected.In absolute terms, $8.6 billion of import difference — just over 40% of the total fall of $20 billion between June 2020 and June 2019 — came from crude and petroleum products and gold and silver. While these commodities are “raw materials”, their lesser imports here aren’t necessarily an adverse reflection on the economic situation. A further $1.5 billion reduction came from the decline in coal imports. While domestic coal production in both May and June 2020 came in at 41 million tonnes, at reduced levels over corresponding months last year, they were enough to account for the levels of economic activity. So about half of the year-on-year import decline in June was purely situational, and not necessarily a negative reduction. The Aatmanirbhar Bharat plan launched by the Narendra Modi government to propel the economy post the pandemic will also focus on non-crude oil and petroleum products and non-gold and silver imports to be localised, if not in entirety than in significant parts of the value chain. What will matter is how this category of imports evolves in the “open economy” part of the financial year and whether India succeeds in creating their local manufacturing alternatives.

20-07-2020||Ranchi||Jharkhand’s ex-CM Babulal Marandi ‘stamped’, put in home quarantine after Delhi return||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Jharkhand has accused the state government of targeting its legislature party leader Babulal Marandi, who was put in mandatory home quarantine by the administration after he returned from Delhi on Sunday night. A stamp of home quarantine was also put on Marandi’s hand upon his arrival at Ranchi airport from New Delhi. Marandi, a former chief minister, had gone to the national capital last week on a two-day trip for party-related work and had met Union home minister Amit Shah, besides top party functionaries. The state government had issued a notification last week underlining that anyone entering Jharkhand from any other state by any means of transport would have to stay in mandatory 14-day home quarantine. Reacting to Marandi’s quarantine, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey said it was an act of “desperation” on part of the Hemant Soren-led JMM government.State BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said the Soren government was scared of Marandi. “The fear of this government is for all to see. The Hemant Soren government has put a home quarantine stamp on the BJP legislature party leader’s hand. Why was the same stamp not put on the CM’s hands when he himself went into home quarantine for a week,” said Shahdeo.The JMM, meanwhile, said officials were only following protocol. “The government has issued a clear notification for all those coming to the state from outside. The rule applies to all,” JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/jharkhand-s-ex-cm-babulal-marandi-stamped-put-in-home-quarantine-after-delhi-return/story-CGgIMLJthKCUHuDCGohKbJ.html
20-07-2020||Mumbai||Hand over 185ha Mahim mangroves to us: Forest department to collectors||The Maharashtra forest department has requested the transfer of crucial mangrove forests at south-central Mumbai extending from Dharavi to where the Mithi river meets the Arabian Sea along Mahim creek.Citing increasing threats due to encroachments and debris dumping, the state mangrove cell wrote to the Mumbai city and suburban district collectors to hand over 184.87 hectare (ha) area to the forest department for better protection.“This is the first correspondence by us in 29 years based on directions issued by the Bombay high court (HC) in 2018. It took us some time to study the area’s expanse and coordinates before making the transfer request,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell).“It is essential to protect this patch from encroachments, curtail developmental pressures and other allied threats to mangrove trees that act as a natural barrier against flooding at the mouth of the Mithi river,” said Tiwari.Environmentalists had been demanding the move for over three decades as it could allegedly threaten the flood plains of Mithi river.The area was declared as protected forests under section 29 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927 on March 16, 1991, and includes a major section of the 15 ha Maharashtra Nature Park (MNP) in Mahim. HT has reviewed the letter that was issued on Friday.In September 2018, the HC had directed all state agencies along the Konkan coast to hand over mangrove forests under their jurisdiction to enhance protection. Despite repeated reminders, transfer of over 2,000 ha mangrove area remains pending, the cell confirmed.Tiwari added that the latest transfer request was further set in motion following a meeting with the Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA) commissioner earlier this year. “Rising encroachments were identified as a worrying issue. Our letter is marked to MMRDA based on decisions taken during the meeting,” he said.However, MMRDA commissioner RA Rajeev said, “We need to study details of the letter first.”Meanwhile, Mumbai suburban deputy collector Vivek Gaikwad said the entire forest patch was under the city collector’s jurisdiction. However, the 1991 published government resolution included villages spread across Dharavi, Mahim, and Bandra as protected forests.Mahesh Ingle, superintendent (city survey and land records), Mumbai city collectorate said, “We are aware of the communication. Owing to Covid-19 related issues and less staff, we are yet to verify the contents of the letter with our land records. The matter will be taken up soon.”The petitioner before the HC environmentalist Debi Goenka said the land was notified as protected forest in 1991 after the intervention of the then Union environment minister Maneka Gandhi. “At the time the forest department did not have any staff but MMRDA took up the responsibility of securing the area. However, violations increased over the past three decades with minimal cognisance by state authorities and no deterrence. Transferring this forest land is a welcome move but we need to be wary that land remains protected and not further de-notified for future development,” said Goenka.In 2017, MMRDA had proposed to redevelop MNP and beautify it with a pedestrian-cycling bridge among other development plans. The plan was revived in February this year, and the 550-m bridge, connecting BKC to MNP, received MMRDA’s approval earlier this month.“It is high time MMRDA moves out and relinquishes their hold over MNP. All of MNP is a forest though only a part was notified in 1991. The forest minister should immediately instruct the department to take possession of MNP,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti. “If the forest land is transferred, MNP will be protected from encroachments and real estate sharks trying to develop Dharavi showing MNP as a ‘green space’.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hand-over-185ha-mahim-mangroves-to-us-forest-department-to-collectors/story-g1G3u1BKQkyAb2o0GNmEuO.html

Bihar ki vikas mein, main chota sa bhagidaar hoon. Ha, main Nitish Kumar hoon. (Bihar is moving on development path. I am a small stakeholder. Yes, I am Nitish Kumar.”“It is a reflection of the public sentiment, who see Nitish Kumar as a man of development, who is both honest and farsighted... It will strike an instant rapport with sympathizers and electors,” said JD (U) spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Sinha.Except perhaps for the BJP and JD (U), all other parties have put a brake on their poll-related activities. Even Lok Janshakti Patry chief and NDA partner Chirag Paswan on July 10 had echoed Leader of Opposition Teajsahwi Prasad Yadav’s concern over the sudden spike in Covid-19 cases and joined him in demanding postponement of polls in view of the infection threat, which may also lead to low voter turnout.On Friday, heads of Opposition parties, including Congress, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), Rashtriya Lok Samata Party, Loktantrik Janata Dal and Left parties, had also cautioned the CEC against holding the polls on schedule as it may turn into a “super spreader event”.However, the,JD(U) seems undeterred. Party leader and IPRD minister Neeraj Kumar said, “The poster will be put up in all corners of the state. Honest and development oriented person will feel proud in identifying themselves as Nitish Kumar.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-s-ruling-jd-u-gets-in-poll-mode-with-i-am-nitish-kumar-posters/story-sVpOaUj3f8rw1F5vAD9FON.html

There are six posts of assistant town planners (ATPs), of which four are lying vacant. Only four building inspectors are working in the MC against the sanctioned posts of 18.Due to this, three head draftsmen, namely Harvinder Singh, Mohan Singh and Satish Malhotra were deputed as ATPs. But, they were transferred by the local bodies department in an order on July 15. Sabharwal said this will affect the working of the building branch, which has to keep a check on illegal constructions and recover dues from residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-mc-chief-seeks-cancellation-of-transfer-of-three-head-draftsmen/story-4b09OnL9mH8MCRNVNP9tlK.html
20-07-2020||Mumbai||Will see if political social distancing is followed: Sanjay Raut on Ram Mandir ceremony||Barely days after the date for the foundation-laying ceremony for the Ram temple in Ayodhya was finalised, Shiv Sena said that it will see if “political social distancing” is followed in invitations to various people, including Shiv Sena president and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that the Sena chief does not need an invitation to visit Ayodhya.Prime minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit Ayodhya for the bhoomi pujan ceremony of the Ram Mandir on August 5. Following that there were speculations if Thackeray, whose party has been at the forefront of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement since the late 1980s, would be invited.BJP and Shiv Sena stitched the political alliance in the backdrop of the movement and Hindutva ideology in Maharashtra in 1989. The former allies, BJP and Sena, have parted ways late last year after the latter formed a government in Maharashtra with the support of the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party.“I have heard through the media that the date for the ceremony has been decided. The Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas (Trust) has given an invitation to the prime minister. So he would go to Ayodhya on this occasion, we regularly keep going to Ayodhya. They will decide on the invitation, how many people to call, how to maintain social distancing. It is also to be seen if they follow political ‘social distancing’,” Raut said in an apparent jibe at the BJP. He added that the Sena chief has been visiting Ayodhya regularly even before he became the chief minister and will continue to do so.Raut, meanwhile, added that the party has “paved the way” for the construction of the Ram temple and it was instrumental in removing “obstacles” for it. “Shiv Sena has a connection with Ayodhya and it will remain eternally. It is not a political connection. Shiv Sena has never gone to Ayodhya for political gains. The road for Ram Mandir was paved by the Shiv Sena. The obstacles for the Ram Mandir were cleared by the Shiv Sena, not for politics, but because of [our] faith and for Hindutva,” he said speaking to reporters in Mumbai.Meanwhile, party legislator from Thane, Pratap Sarnaik wrote the head trustee of the Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust saying Thackeray be invited for the foundation ceremony as the chief guest considering party’s contribution to the movement. In the letter dated July 20, Sarnaik said that in the backdrop of the coronavirus outbreak guests would be limited but political parties and organisations who have been directly or indirectly associated with the construction of the Ram Mandir should be invited. Sarnaik in the letter said, “On the occasion of the bhoomi pujan you are inviting prime minister Narendra Modi. Similarly, you would invite Uddhav ji Thackeray as a chief guest for the bhoomi pujan ceremony. Scores of followers of Lord Ram wish that there would not be any politics over this event. Everyone is aware of what stand was taken by Shiv Sena party founder’s son and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for the construction of Ram Mandir.”On Sunday, South Mumbai MP and former union minister Arvind Sawant said that the Sena does not bother about an invitation to visit Ayodhya. He added that Thackeray during his last visit donated Rs 1 crore on behalf of the party to the temple trust for the construction of the Ram Mandir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/will-see-if-political-social-distancing-is-followed-sanjay-raut-on-ram-mandir-ceremony/story-SGW9Iv9EPVtDaoqeBvbyxN.html

20-07-2020||City||2015 sacrilege casesShare replies with each other: CBI court to accused, complainant||Mohali The court of special CBI judge, Gurkirpal Singh Sekhon, on Monday, hearing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) appeal to restrain the special investigating team (SIT) that the Punjab government has formed for investigating the Behbal Kalan and Bargari sacrilege cases of 2015, directed the complainant and accused to share the copies of the replies filed by them with each other. The court deferred the hearing for July 29. The judge warned all counsels that ‘the party who will not argue the matter on the next date of hearing will be presumed to be not an interested party and the court will proceed as per the law.’On July 8, the CBI had moved the court urging it to stop DIG Ranbir Singh Khatra-led SIT from carrying out “parallel probe” in sacrilege cases. The move came two days after the SIT named Sirsa dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh as an accused in the 2015 theft of a ‘bir’ (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib. The CBI plea has claimed that the agency is still conducting a probe in these cases and there can’t be two simultaneous investigations by two agencies in same cases.Punjab, in its reply to the court, filed through district attorneys Sanjiv Batra, and RK Salwan alleged that the CBI has, in an illegal and unjustified manner, withheld the handing over of the case files. “It is submitted that the said actions of the CBI clearly amount to contempt of the orders passed by the Supreme Court, the high court and the State of Punjab reserves its rights to take action with regard to the same,” the reply added. Advocate Gagan Pradeep Singh Bal, counsel for the complainant, has replied that the SIT investigation is not criminal contempt and it has the legality of doing investigation. Accused’s counsel RK Handa also filed an application, seeking interim stay to restrain the Punjab SIT to proceed further parallel investigation, till the pendency of the matter in this court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2015-sacrilege-casesshare-replies-with-each-other-cbi-court-to-accused-complainant/story-Etb8pGV4tAQVgQXqe45WBJ.html
20-07-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana:20-ft encroachments found along Buddha Nullah||With the district administrations starting the demarcation process of Buddha Nullah, encroachments of up to 20 feet have been found at different points. The process started on July 8, and so far, only around 5 km of 14.8 km has been inspected. A review meeting was also held at circuit house, wherein mayor Balkar Sandhu, deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma and municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal took stock of the ongoing demarcation process. Officials of revenue and irrigation department were also present. One of the officials, requesting anonymity, said, “Even plots allotted by MC to its employees alongside the nullah are part of encroachments, as per records available with the revenue and drainage department. At Tajpur road dairy complex, the nullah’s width has been reduced by around 20 feet. Similarly, many other factories have also been established by encroaching upon the nullah. We have already marked over 80 encroachments and more will come to light when the process is completed in around 10 days.”Earlier, residents of New Kundanpuri area had rued that the width of the nullah had been reduced by around 20 feet in the last few decades as residents established houses by encroaching upon the nullah portion. Mayor Balar Sandhu said, “The private contractor and officials of different departments involved in the process have been told to expedite the process and submit the report regarding the same. After that, final notices will be served to owners to present documents. The encroachments will be removed to increase the nullah’s width.”The nullah is the main drain of the city and due to encroachments, its width has decreased and overflows almost every monsoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-20-ft-encroachments-found-along-buddha-nullah/story-w1lUJXliRnZtdYMChRTZPL.html

20-07-2020||City||Punjab local bodies dept seeks AG’s opinion if civic body polls can be held in October||Chandigarh Punjab local bodies department has sought legal opinion from the state’s advocate general on whether the civic body polls can be held in October. “As per municipal laws, September first week is the deadline to finish the polling process, so we have to make sure whether or not we can go beyond that,” local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra said. The terms of nine municipal corporations and 117 municipal councils and notified area committees in Punjab came to an end between March 8 and April 26 this year, and as per the provisions of the Municipal Act, 1911, polls should take place within six months. As on date, government-appointed administrators are running these civic bodies. On Saturday, after a video conference with cabinet colleagues, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had said the polls would be conducted in October. The idea of conducting polls in September was dropped because the state government apprehended that the covid-19 pandemic would be at its peak then. At the meeting then, the ministers had said a final call would be taken after the assessing the pandemic situation. Cabinet ministers were divided over the poll schedule, with paddy procurement starting from October 1. “That’s also an issue because of 117 civic bodies, some are semi-rural and the residents would be busy in procurement,” said food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, who comes from Ludhiana. He added, “I think the issue can be handled, as procurement picks up steam in the second week of October, and we want the polls to be over by then.”Mohindra added his department would complete work related to ‘wardbandi’ (delimitation of wards) by the end of the month. “The polls will have 50% reservation for women, in line with the state government’s policy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/local-bodies-dept-seeks-ag-s-opinionif-civic-body-polls-can-be-held-in-oct/story-qS2NtWg3KL5hDGz7rgnSfJ.html

Having given its full backing to the ordinances, which were clearly the first step towards the elimination of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) regime, the CM said that the SAD had lost all locus-standi to even pretend to care about the farmers, whose condition had deteriorated to abysmal levels.“Sukhbir should not forget that as Union minister, his wife Harsimrat Kaur Badal, was part of the Cabinet meeting that stamped its approval on the ordinances that will totally destroy Punjab’s farming community,” CM added.Ridiculing the SAD president’s offer to lead a delegation of farmer organisations to seek clarification from the Centre on the MSP, the CM said that Sukhbir was totally disconnected from the ground situation. He pointed out that the ordinances were completely against India’s federal structure, and were in line with the recommendations of the Shanta Kumar committee, which had also suggested dismantling the MSP structure.Having implemented the recommendation on the ordinances, the inference was logical that the MSP elimination would soon follow, he said, adding that Sukhbir was conveniently choosing to ignore that in order to protect the interests of SAD, in particular his own and his wife’s interests.“Left with no defence for SAD’s anti-farmer and anti-Punjab actions, Sukhbir was now trying, desperately, to save face with his offer,” added the CM.Amarinder claimed that the government, at the Centre, had failed to take a single initiative to protect farmers’ interests in the past six years, and thus neither farmers nor their representative organisations had any trust in their assurances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stop-shedding-crocodile-tears-for-farmers-amarinder-to-sukhbir/story-Sm2FjvHBqgl0bLjWDx7pTL.html

20-07-2020||City||DU reconsiders its decision to skip ECA admissions, set to start registration under the category||New Delhi: Delhi University (DU), which had earlier planned to skip admissions under the extracurricular activities (ECA) quota this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, has reconsidered its decision and is set to start registrations in the category. Just like the sports category, ECA admissions will be done on the basis of merit and participation certificates this year, without any trial. The move comes after some students, teachers and artists objected to the university’s decision to skip admissions under all other ECA disciplines, except for National Cadet Corps (NCC) and National Service Scheme (NSS), for the academic session 2020-21. The university had on June 10 said admissions under other ECA categories were not feasible without trials since there is no recognised body to issue certificates for the activities, unlike in sports.Later on July 18, the admission committee accepted the recommendations and detailed guidelines of the marking scheme issued by the sub-committee constituted for sports, ECA and performance-based admissions, according to minutes of the meeting.The minutes were on Monday approved by the standing committee of the university’s academic council — DU’s highest academic body.Arun Attree, a member of the standing committee, said, “The recommendations of the sub-committee were approved by the standing committee on Monday. The committee has decided to take admissions solely on the basis of certificates. I registered my dissent, saying there is no way of authenticating the credibility of ECA certificates unlike sports,” he said.Dean of admission Shobha Bagai said, “Apprehensions are still there about the authenticity of ECA certificates. Offline and offline trials are not possible. But we had no other option but to approve the sub-committee’s recommendations.”In its suggestions, the sub-committee said, “For undergraduate admissions based on ECA, the committee suggested the trial’s marks should be clubbed with the certificate marks. The applicant is required to upload self-attested pdfs of his/her ECA certificates of merit/participation (maximum five certificates). The certificates uploaded by the applicant shall be scrutinised and evaluated out of a maximum of 100 marks.”“Merit or participation ECA certificate of preceding three years will be considered from 01 May 2017 to 30 April 2020. The marks under ECA category will be awarded based on the sum of the total marks awarded in the three best certificates uploaded by the candidate,” read the sub-committee’s suggestions, a copy of which is with HT. The sub-committee has also suggested forensic verification of the certificates.There are 14 recognised activities under ECA — creative writing, dance, debate, fine arts, music, music instrumental (such as tabla, harmonium, sitar, dholak, drums, guitar and sarod), theatre, NCC, NSS and yoga, among others.Several faculty members objected to the decision to give admissions on the basis of certificates in the ECA quota. A group of teachers and members of the Indian National Teachers Congress on Monday sent a memorandum to DU vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi, saying, “The university must ensure a free-and-fair process to conduct the ECA admissions. It should not become a back-door entry for admissions in top colleges.”Despite several attempts, vice-chancellor Tyagi did not respond to calls and texts for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/du-reconsiders-its-decision-to-skip-eca-admissions-set-to-start-registration-under-the-category/story-Up6MMjcaYR0ufX0Ge6vDIJ.html
20-07-2020||Delhi||Owner of cafe arrested for serving alcohol and hookah illegally, 40 booked||Forty customers -- 25 men and 15 women -- were booked and a cafe owner arrested for alleged violation of lockdown norms after they were found to be revelling with alcohol and hookah at the food joint in West Delhi’s Paschim Vihar on Sunday night, police said.The police arrested the owner of Crossroads Cafe, Tanmay Singhal, and booked him under non-bailable sections of the Excise Act, A Koan, deputy commissioner of police (outer district), said.This is the second such raid at a cafe or restaurant in Paschim Vihar. The police had booked 31 customers at Playgue restaurant last Tuesday, barely a kilometre from the spot of the latest bust.The DCP said Sunday’s raid was carried out after a police patrolling team heard loud noise at Crossroads Cafe and discovered the place.Also read: Hookahs are no safer than cigarettes, here’s all you need to know“When the policemen checked the place, they found it was a restaurant serving alcohol and hookah without authorisation. Serving alcohol in pubs and discos is currently banned, and restaurants are allowed to only seat customers with social distancing in place. Reinforcements were called in and the customers and the owner were caught,” said another senior investigator not authorised to speak to the media.“The owner had let some of his regular customers know that they could get alcohol and hookah and party without any hassle. Those customers called their known ones and soon the place was crowded,” said the investigator.Five bottles of whiskey, 25 beer bottles and 19 hookahs were recovered from the place, the officer said.Calls and text messages to the phone number belonging to the cafe went unanswered.Police said restaurants serving alcohol in Paschim Vihar were taking advantage of the desperation of people looking out for a place to party.“Since these restaurants and cafes are located on the upper floors of buildings in markets, it made it easy for them to operate. They would disable the lifts of their floor so that customers reached the place though a back door without drawing much attention,” said the investigator.The fancy lights would continue to be used but they would be masked in such a way that outsiders wouldn’t see them. The volume of music would be substantially lowered, the officer said.In the latest case, the cafe was located on the second floor of a building. “The patrolling policemen noticed many youngsters visiting a single building and a heavy movement of vehicles around that spot. They checked the building to find alcohol being served illegally there,” the officer said. But there were other business owners who would know of the alleged illegal operation and alert the police. “And that is what happened in the previous raid. One of the local residents had alerted us,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/owner-of-cafe-arrested-for-serving-alcohol-and-hookah-illegally-40-customers-booked/story-8fDs2nu7n5GEDJSIOqyUzM.html
20-07-2020||Delhi||Parents wary of schools reopening till situation is under control||As the number of Covid-19 infections continues to spike across the country, parents of school-going children continue to be unsure about physical classes until a vaccine is developed. This comes after the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) asked states to furnish by Monday the feedback of parents on reopening of schools.In addition to the parents’ preference on the reopening of schools in either August, September or October, the ministry on Friday also asked parents about their expectations from schools whenever they reopen. The final decision in the matter will be taken in consultation with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW).Opposing the move to reopen schools, All India Parents Association (AIPA) said the current Covid-19 situation wasn’t conducive to allow offline classes for children. “Parents have been asking for a declaration of the 2020-21 academic year as zero year and promote every student. This would help alleviate stress among parents and students at a time when death rates are skyrocketing,” said Ashok Aggarwal, AIPA president.Most parents HT spoke to opposed the move to reopen schools in the upcoming months without taking stock of the Covid-19 crisis. Vikas Sharma, a west Delhi businessman whose children study in classes 1 and 5, said, “Most parents I know are not in favour of the schools reopening any time before the health crisis subsides. When grownups are participating in meetings over online conferencing, how can we allow our children to go out and expose themselves to the virus?” Sharma also said that while online classes cannot compensate for classroom learning, parents are compromising to protect the health of their children.Rohini Arora, a south Delhi resident whose daughter studies in Class 5, said, “The government recently came up with revised guidelines about reduced hours for online classes. Parents are mostly satisfied with this and would not want to risk sending their child to school when there have been reports of infection among children in other countries the moment they started going to school,” she said.Recommendations from the parents’ community include staggered classes conducted in the open, halting all extracurricular activities, shorter classes, no sharing of food or water bottles, compulsory masks and sanitisation whenever schools reopen.The Delhi Parents’ Association (DPA) also wrote to MHRD on Sunday and said that schools should not reopen till a vaccine is developed for Covid-19 crisis. “Students till Class 8 should be promoted without exams as per the earlier practice. While students of classes 9 and 11 should be tested through online exams, board exams can also be held online if the situation is not under control by March next year,” said Aparajita Gautam, DPA president.A Delhi government official said that since the order came on Friday, the education department was compiling responses to send to the ministry. “Responses can be varied since there are different types of schools in the capital catering to people from various socio-economic backgrounds. We have had several rounds of conversations with parents on their expectations from schools when they reopen and other suggestions. However, the call over when schools should reopen should be taken by experts,” the official said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/parents-wary-of-schools-reopening-till-situation-is-under-control/story-0R2wY4V7jF3H9kpJTTAZXP.html

20-07-2020||Delhi||Record statements of children rescued from labour via video conferencing: Plea in Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court on Monday sought the response of the Delhi government and city police on a plea that said statements of child witnesses lodged at child welfare centres should be recorded through video conferencing and not physically in court. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan issued notice to the authorities, seeking to know their stand on a plea filed by NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan through its counsel Prabhasahay Kaur. The plea also sought testing of these children at the child care institutions or homes where they are lodged, or at the office of the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), instead of transporting them to government hospitals for the purpose.Citing a recent incident, advocate Kaur told the court that it had recently carried out a raid with the authorities and rescued several children from child labour. Thereafter, the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) directed the police to record the children’s statements before a magistrate in accordance with section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).She said both the CWC and the investigating officer (IO) of the case were “irrationally” insisting that the children be physically taken to the Karkardooma Court to record their statements, despite concerns related to Covid-19 raised by officials of a home run by the NGO, Mukti Ashram.The plea said the children had already been taken to the court complex twice and the IO said he would again take them there to record their statements.Appearing for the Delhi government, its counsel Sameer Vashist, told the court that the children would not be taken to the court. However, since the statements have an evidentiary purpose, the magistrate can go at the CWC and record the statements. He said the physical presence was required to console and counsel the kids.Following brief arguments, the court asked the authorities to file their replies and posted the matter for further hearing on July 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pleas-seeks-recording-of-statements-of-child-witnesses-via-video-conferencing/story-e6KzV7ZQ9uR4F1pdcG5FqN.html

So far, 700 Heads of Schools have undergone training at IIM- A via the programme which started four years ago, they added.The aim of the training programme is to train heads of Delhi government schools to “build leadership competencies, empower them and instil local accountability towards their respective schools.”“In our first term of the Principal Training Programme, we empowered our school principals to take autonomous decisions at the school-level and made them in charge of School Management Committee (SMC) funds which led to local accountability. I am now looking at IIM Ahmedabad to help us to further empower our principals,” Sisodia said. He also said that he wants to see Delhi government schools as “decentralised autonomous institutions.”“Running the school is the responsibility of each school principal who is central to the entire school system. We, as ministers, Education Directors and officers, are just the facilitators,” Sisodia said. While addressing the importance of online learning, he said, “Online learning may not be a solution, but it is a necessity today. So I urge all our school principals to fully commit to it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/online-training-of-school-principals-in-association-with-iim-a-begins/story-QLEkqVrtzmXBOcwYnDsNpO.html

20-07-2020||City||Bail plea dismissed in northeast Delhi riots case||New Delhi: A Delhi court has dismissed a bail application of a man arrested in connection with the murder of a local during the northeast Delhi riots, while observing that the accused might threaten the public witnesses as he lived in his neighbourhood.Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav dismissed the bail plea of Pardeep Rai in the murder case of one Monis in Brijpuri area. In an order on July 18, the court said the case was sensitive in nature and there were serious allegations against Rai.“The case is very sensitive in nature. The possibility of the applicant (Rai) threatening the public witnesses, who are yet to be examined, cannot be ruled out as they are residents of the same locality.“Considering the facts and circumstances of the case in totality, I do not find it to be a fit case for grant of bail. The bail application is accordingly dismissed,” the judge said.Appearing for the accused, his counsel told the court that Rai was picked up from his house by crime branch officials and falsely implicated in this case. He contended that Rai worked as a taxi driver and had clean past antecedents. He said there was no recovery of any material from Rai in the matter.Special Public Prosecutor Manoj Chaudhary, appearing for the police, opposed the bail plea, saying an eyewitness in the case had identified Rai to be part of a mob that had allegedly beaten Monis with sticks and swords and also pelted stones.This eyewitness said Monis had tried to escape, but fell on the ground and later the police deployed at Brijpuri saved him and sent him to the hospital, the public prosecutor said.According to the prosecution, on February 25, Monis was returning from his father’s home. When he reached the Yamuna Vihar bus stand, he found that riots had erupted in the area.He was allegedly caught by a mob, beaten up severely due to which he succumbed to his injuries at the hospital.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bail-plea-dismissed-in-northeast-delhi-riots-case/story-a6LTHisU4kTzpyyBAJlqbM.html
20-07-2020||Chandigarh||Don’t reopen schools till there is Covid vaccine, parents in Ludhiana tell MHRD||Several parents from Ludhiana have asked the ministry of human resource and development (MHRD) to reopen schools only when a vaccine is developed and no positive case is reported for at least a month.On July 17, the MHRD department of school education and literacy, had written to education secretaries of all states and Union Territories, asking parents to send their feedback on the ministry’s email id, coordinationee1@gmail.com or rsamplay.edu.nic.in, on when they will be comfortable with reopening of school and specify their expectations when they reopen. Majority of parents suggested that children are secure at home and asked who will be responsible if schools reopen in the next three months and student gets infected there. They said it is better if schools reopen in the next academic session. A parent, Mandeep Bhullar, a resident of Pakhowal Road, said, “My son is studying at a private school in Class 7. I have sent feedback to MHRD stating that with surging Covid-19 cases in the country, there is no need to reopen schools as children below the age of 10 will be at high risk. Schools should be reopen only after a vaccine is developed.”Ishneet Sharma, another parent, and resident of Punjab Mata Nagar, said, “We should take precautions and focus on online learning for now. In my opinion, schools should reopen in October as the number of cases should dip by then and we can also expect a vaccine, Also, schools should keep ACs switched off, which will be possible in October. We must take precautions, train our children to maintain social distancing and optimise this time with online learning.”Another parent from Chandigarh Road, Baljit Singh, said, “My kids are studying in Sacred Heart Senior Secondary School, Sector 39, Jamalpur, and Vardhman International School. Safety of children is very important at this hour with the rising in number of coronavirus cases, schools should not re-open in the next three months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/don-t-reopen-schools-till-there-is-covid-vaccine-parents-in-ludhiana-tell-mhrd/story-8xyLKCYg9d0YDDnKbsX5ML.html
20-07-2020||City||Delhi HC reserves order on former councillor’s plea in riots case||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Monday reserved its order on a plea filed by former Congress municipal councillor Ishrat Jahan -- charged with the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for her alleged role in the northeast Delhi riots -- challenging a trial court order granting more time to the investigating agency to complete its probe.During a hearing before Justice Suresh Kait, the police opposed the plea and said the high court should not interfere in the matter and that there was no infirmity in the order of the additional sessions judge.Appearing for Jahan, her counsel, Lalit Valecha, said the trial court order was “erroneous”, “bad in law” and “wrong on facts”. He said the prosecutor had not applied his mind while filing the application in the trial court.While Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra said he was authorised to represent the state and Delhi Police, advocate Amit Prasad said he was appointed as Special Public Prosecutor by the L-G to represent the police in riots cases.The high court allowed both the counsels to argue and submit their respective status reports in the matter as it had made clear in an earlier hearing that it was not going to enter into the controversy over which lawyer will represent the police.The high court has already reserved its order on the issue of who is authorised to represent police in another riots matter involving a school principal, Faisal Farooq.Mehra told the court that it need not look into the reasons given by the prosecutor in the application, seeking an extension of time to complete the probe, as it was something for the sessions judge to look into.“All the ingredients for extending the time are made out and there is no irregularity in the sessions judge’s order,” he argued.Prasad contended that the petition does not make out a case and even no question of law is made out here and it be dismissed. He said the reasons warranting an extension of time to complete the investigation in the case has been tested twice, first by the public prosecutor and second by the trial court judge.Central government standing counsel Amit Mahajan said he will place on record an order passed by another judge of the high court in the case of former JNU student Sharjeel Imam, who had also challenged the order extending time to complete the probe in the UAPA case lodged against him in relation to his alleged instigating speeches during anti Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens protests.The high court on June 24 had asked the police to respond to Jahan’s plea challenging the trial court’s June 15 order granting a 60-day extension to the police to complete its investigation against her and activist Khalid Saifi.Jahan, in her plea, claimed “The application by the prosecutor is an abuse of the legal process as the same fails to make out any legal or factual basis that justifies the extension of time. This exercise is only to subvert and defeat the right of the petitioner to seek regular and statutory bail under the CrPC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-hc-reserves-order-on-former-councillor-s-plea-in-riots-case/story-Atf9zG2X76ONNEHyBPn1qN.html

20-07-2020||Chandigarh||Sukhbir invites Capt for assurance on MSP||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Monday asked chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to accompany him along with farmer organisations for a blanket assurance on MSP and assured marketing from the Centre.In a statement here, the SAD chief told the chief minister, “Your repeated lies about the end of MSP regime have already been exposed by the central government. The Centre has announced that MSP and assured marketing will remain in force in the present form.“Since you are choosing not to believe this assurance, you should accompany me along with farmer organisations to get a blanket assurance on this issue from the Union agriculture minister,” said Sukhbir.Stating that it was doubtful that the CM would accept his offer, Sukhbir said it was apparent that the former wanted to continue with the malicious propaganda on the issue to divert people’s attention from the utter failures of his government.“The bogey of the end of MSP regime and assured marketing has also been raised deliberately to mislead the farming community and inflame passions against the SAD in league with the AAP,” added Sukhbir.The SAD president said farmers would not be fooled by this propaganda. He claimed that the CM had passed the provisions of the central agricultural ordinance three years back against which he was protesting now. “I challenge Capt Amarinder to deny this,” he said.Sukhbir said his party had a track record of always standing by the side of farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sukhbir-invites-capt-for-assurance-on-msp/story-Yhat0yfK24JERpE0YC72RM.html

Federalisation of polity and BJP emerging as the dominant party has allowed SAD to shed its anti-Centre politics and share power at the Centre,” he said.Ashutosh Kumar, chairperson of political science department, PU, said, “SAD, as a ‘Panthic party’, was formed by a religious congregation to serve religious and political interests of Sikhs. But, given territorial and demographic changes in Punjab at the time of Partition and after, the party found itself trapped at the crossroads of region and religion. As a result, it transitioned from pursuing the politics of ‘representation’ in colonial Punjab to the pursuit of ‘a territorial homeland’ for the Sikh minority in post-Partition India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/100-years-of-sad-discussed-during-webinar-at-panjab-university/story-OGU5UJp7FkeipnlhFnS5DO.html

Recently, Corona positive cases have been reported from Haryana Public Service Commission, DMER, CRPF and ITBP. I have also written to the heads of offices of Panchkula administration” Ahuja said.The DC said he had written to ITBP and CRPF create Covid care units in their own centres.Dr Jasjeet Kaur, Panchkula civil surgeon, said random sampling at government offices has also been started. “There are at least 50 government institutes in Panchkula. To begin with, we will take five samples from each office.”Most of the offices had working chambers, with three to four staffers in one. The main risk of infection arose from movement of files, as these pass through many hands, she said.Initially, the health department will collect samples of Group-D employees, as they have the highest movement in offices to tackle tasks such as moving of files and arranging for refreshments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panchkula-dc-asks-govt-officials-to-take-care-of-staff-as-covid-cases-spike/story-ScgicZmBf98YcpG6fLCJPK.html
20-07-2020||Chandigarh||GMCH-32 appoints nodal officer for inter-state referrals on PGIMER pattern||The Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, has appointed a nodal officer to deal with referrals of patients from Punjab and Haryana so that the institute can make prior arrangements for their treatment.Prof Harish Dasari, head of forensic department and chairperson of emergency services, GMCH-32, was appointed as a nodal officer for the inter-state referrals.Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, had come out with a referral protocol after an inter-state meeting of officers from both states, UT and PGIMER was held last Saturday. “It was agreed that the nodal officers from the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana and GMCH-32 will unanimously take a call on whether a patient should be treated at a hospital of the respective state or an immediate intervention is required at GMCH-32,” Dr BS Chavan, director-principal, GMCH-32, said.The health authorities in Chandigarh have time and again raised the issue that patients who do not require tertiary care medical facilities are flocking the institute.“Once in place, the referral system will have many advantages. Many procedures which can be done at district and medical colleges of states will be dealt locally, while we will provide tertiary care to the patients irrespective of boundaries. This will save the money the patients have to spend on travel, besides the early treatment,” Dr BS Chavan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gmch-32-appoints-nodal-officer-for-inter-state-referrals-on-pgimer-pattern/story-4Xr2xkaUF91PjbnxnHkYFI.html

20-07-2020||Patna||Need to increase beds: Central team to Bihar govt||The central team, which was here to assess the state’s preparedness against coronavirus (Covid-19), has suggested increasing the number of hospital beds to keep pace with the rise in cases, as it reached 27,455 after 1,076 new infections were reported Monday, with eight deaths pushing the state’s death toll to 187.Of the eight deaths, reported through the state health department’s Twitter handle, East Champaran accounted for two, followed by one each in Begusarai, Bhojpur, Purnia, Sheikhpura, Siwan and Vaishali.Six deaths were reported Monday at AIIMS-Patna and five at the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), the two dedicated Covid-19 hospitals in Patna.The state had also decided to write to the Centre to seek support in providing oxygen, which the central team said the state would need as the number of Covid-19 cases increase, said Bihar chief secretary Deepak Kumar.The team also pointed to the need to motivate doctors at the hospitals in Bihar.In keeping with the central team’s advisory, the state had asked the AIIMS-Patna to take over the 500-bed ESI hospital at Bihta, on the fringes of Patna, for Covid care, said Kumar.“We will also take support of private hospitals in management of Covid-19 cases,” he added.Two private hospitals — the Paras-HMRI and Ruban Hospital — in Patna were given approval on Monday to treat Covid-19 patients amid the rising number of cases in the city.Patna district magistrate Kumar Ravi allowed the two hospitals to set up corona wards with 25 beds each to treat Covid-19 patients. These hospitals would, however, treat low to moderate cases only, said a source of the hospital.Kumar said in addition to private hospitals, the government will also increase the number of beds in its hospitals, including NMCH and Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH).The state government has already asked all its medical college hospitals to have 100 isolation beds for Covid-19 cases. The PMCH was expected to commence the facility in the next couple of days, said sources.The chief secretary, whom the team members met before leaving for Delhi, said the team was in general satisfied with the measures taken by the state, especially during the lockdown, as also curbs imposed in containment zones.The team, however, advised better perimeter control and health screening of people residing within containment zone to contain the spread of the disease.Kumar said the central team was satisfied with the “open-ended measures” the state had taken to ramp up testing through antigen rapid testing kits.“Now, the state will not have any testing target, but conduct testing of all symptomatic patients, who reach our facilities or mobile testing vans,” said Kumar.The Centre had recently sent 10,000 rapid testing kits to the state.Meanwhile, testing facility had started in 11 sub-divisional hospitals of the state on Monday, said Bihar’s health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh during the media briefing.He said the facility will begin in 27 other sub-divisional hospitals on Tuesday.Singh said there were 2,584 containment zones in Bihar, of which 1,931 were in rural areas and 653 in urban areas.He said with the recovery of 938 Covid-19 patients, the total recoveries had gone up to 17,535, with a recovery percentage of 63.87%.A three-member central team, headed by Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the ministry of health and family welfare (MoH&FW) had visited the NMCH to assess its condition on Sunday. Other team members were Dr SK Singh, director National Centre for Disease Control, and associate professor of AIIMS-Delhi Dr Neeraj Nischal.The team also visited Covid-care facility in Gaya before returning to Delhi on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/need-to-increase-beds-central-team-to-bihar-govt/story-wpLmLDW8xWn2xDVv0jVkaM.html
20-07-2020||Lucknow||UP’s cricketing heroes who missed the Team India bus||Bowlers the world over often complain about the nature of the wicket, its pace or turn after unproductive spells. But Uttar Pradesh pacer Ashish Winston Zaidi never found fault with the pitches. Rather, he showed his mettle with 378 wickets in 110 first-class matches in an 18-year career for the state side.If Zaidi had the opportunity to bowl on grassy wickets like those available today, he would have taken close to 500 wickets. His achievements, despite bowling mostly on turning tracks or flat surfaces, should be a lesson for young bowlers in India.Nicknamed ‘Pope’ and ‘Amar, Akbar and Anthony’, Zaidi played his last first-class match against Haryana in 2006 in Rohtak. He tops the list of UP cricketers who couldn’t sport the Team India jersey despite their talent.“I never bothered to see whether the pitches had grass on them. I focused on my deliveries and took wickets,” Zaidi had said soon after quitting the sport in 2006. “If I had the opportunity of bowling on grassy wickets, I would have broken all records for pace bowlers in India,” he had added. Zaidi’s 14-wicket haul in a Ranji Trophy match against the Kapil Dev-led Haryana in the 1991-92 season in Faridabad was one of the most thrilling encounters of his career. The 1983 World Cup winning skipper had spoken to Zaidi after the match. It was a dream come true for the UP bowler.“I was thrilled to bowl because Kapil Paaji was in the opposition team, so much so that I ended up taking 14 wickets in the match. He (Kapil) spoke to me after the game and it was a dream-come-true moment for me,” he recalled.After spending his childhood with Dynamic Cricket Club on muddy tracks of the Yamuna Basic School in Katghar locality of Allahabad (now Prayagraj), Zaidi was picked for the Guru Govind Singh Sports College in Lucknow before moving to MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai, the place Zaidi credited for his transformation into a complete bowler. In-swing came naturally to him, but he learnt to bowl good outswingers at the MRF Pace Foundation.After a 10-wicket haul in an U-15 game for UP, Zaid made his first-class debut at 17. Although his exploits in the domestic circuit put him in reckoning for Team India, he never received a call-up.He was one of the probables for the 1992 World Cup and his name was also doing the rounds for the Singer Cup. He had plenty of five-wicket hauls (19 times) in the domestic matches, but luck didn’t favour him. The wicket-machine of UP cricket had to accept this harsh reality of his career silently.RAJINDER SINGH HANSLeft-arm orthodox bowler Rajinder Singh Hans was in the 14-member Team India squad for the home Test series against Australia in 1979-80 but did not make it to the Playing XI. He was sidelined afterwards.Despite being a native of Mumbai, Hans enjoyed a 10-year career with Uttar Pradesh till 1986-87 as he had a job with Mohan Meakin in Ghaziabad. “I chose to play for UP as I was working for the company in Ghaziabad, but I never felt like an outsider,” said Hans, who took 340 first-class wickets.“I was quite sure of getting a chance to bowl for India in the series against Australia in 1979, but Dilip Doshi bowled exceptionally well and my chance never came,” recalled Hans, who said his 9/152 against Karnataka in the Ranji Trophy final was his best performance. “My 9/152 is the best of my life,” says Hans, who played for Central Zone against touring teams and in the Duleep Trophy from 1976-77 to 1984-85. Besides being a fine spin bowler, Hans was one of the most successful coaches of Uttar Pradesh from 2001-02 to 2006-07. His stint led to UP winning their maiden Ranji Trophy in 2005-06. He also coached Jharkhand Ranji Trophy team in 2007-08 before becoming a member of the Junior National Selection Committee for two years, 2008–09 and 2009-10. He graduated to the senior selection committee from Central Zone in 2012.SHASHIKANT KHANDEKARShashikant Khandekar from Kanpur was an elegant opening batsman whose stroke-play was worth going miles to watch. He was a prolific scorer for UP in the Ranji Trophy and came very close to playing for India when he was named the 12th man in the Guwahati ODI vs West Indies in 1983/84.Once he missed that opportunity, he never got another chance. He played in an era when Sunil Gavaskar was already established and Krishnamachari Srikkanth had emerged as the Little Master’s mercurial partner. But Khandekar had himself to blame. Whenever he got a chance in big matches, he failed to deliver, be it in the Duleep Trophy, Irani Cup or important games against international teams. With a lot of luck and pluck, he could have earned an India cap, but it was not to be. The only consolation for him is that even today he is UP’s top scorer in an innings with an unbeaten 261 against Railways at Moradabad in 1984-85 season. In his 87 first-class matches, Khandekar scored 5,452 runs, including 12 centuries and 24 half-centuries.RIZWAN SHAMSHADAn elegant right-hander from Aligarh, Rizwan Shamshad was a quality batsman of his time who couldn’t play for the country. Shamshad, who belongs to the grand old trinity of AW Zaidi and Gyanendra Pandey, was part of the India under-19 camp with Sourav Ganguly, VVS Laxman and Rahul Dravid.“Yes, we played together in zonal under-19 cricket. I was a better performer than many of the cricketers (many of whom played for India later). With my performance in 1995-96, I averaged almost 100 and I was very sure of getting a call for Team India, but it never happened,” recalls Shamshad who is still known as ‘The Wall’ of UP cricket with 7,018 runs to his credit in 108 first-class matches.Asked who he would blame for his non-inclusion in Team India, he said, “I can say that it was just destiny and nothing else. I have always been a consistent performer, but don’t know the reason for my non-selection.” ANAND SHUKLAAllahabad’s Anand Shukla is the only all-rounder in the list of top five unsung heroes of Uttar Pradesh cricket. A skillful leg-spinner and dependable batsman, Shukla took 300-plus wickets and scored 3,000 runs in domestic cricket. In his third first-class match in his debut season in 1959-60, Shukla took 7/91 against Vidarbha. This was followed by another superlative performance in 1961-62 against Rajasthan, when he took 7/43 and 3/87 and struck an unbeaten 168, helping UP recover from 88/6 to 356 all out.Shukla, who also played for Delhi for one season in 1965-66 and represented North Zone in Duleep Trophy, captained Uttar Pradesh in 1963-64 and 1964-65. In 1964-65, in eight matches, he made 567 runs at an average of 43.61 and bagged 41 wickets at of 22.21, guiding Uttar Pradesh making it to the Ranji Trophy semi-finals for first time before losing to Hyderabad by an innings.Shukla top-scored in each innings with 60 and 83. He returned bowling figures of 3/253 in 63 overs. Earlier, in a victory over Madhya Pradesh, he scored 28 and 96 and took 6/63 and 6/102. He also played for Bihar in 1966-67 and stayed there for nine seasons.Before coming back to Uttar Pradesh for three more seasons from 1975-76 to 1977-78, Shukla scored two centuries in the Ranji Trophy, including 111 not out in a team total of 205 in the second innings when Bihar lost their quarter-final narrowly to Mysore. Against Vidarbha in 1975-76 he scored his last century, after taking five wickets in the first innings. The next season, also against Vidarbha, he made 59 and 35 and took 5/36 and 6/104.Shukla’s stats of 4,312 runs and 386 wickets, including 31 five-wicket hauls and nine 10- wicket hauls are proof of his caliber. Although Shukla was also a national selector from Central Zone, none from Uttar Pradesh could make it to the India team then.“There have been many more like Obaid Kamal, Rahul Sapru, Manoj Mudgal and even Haider Ali, who could have played for Team India from Uttar Pradesh,” said veteran sports writer Santosh Suri.“Have been following Uttar Pradesh cricket since long and drawing a comparison between many great performers is quite a difficult task, but I still believe that if there was a level playing field for UP players, many more from the state could have played for India then,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-s-cricketing-heroes-who-missed-the-team-india-bus/story-scsWgHhshhEvrgbkC4lCPJ.html
20-07-2020||Patna||Bihar woman declared Covid-19 positive without test, probe ordered||With Covid cases witnessing spike in Bihar, the negligence of health department has come to the fore in Rohtas district.A 50-year-old woman was declared positive without being tested. The fact came to the light on Sunday when a health department team reached her house at Sanjhauli to mark a containment zone and take the woman to isolation centre.The woman and her family were shocked after being told that she is corona positive. However, the family informed the health team that she had neither visited any testing centre nor any health employee had collected her sample at home. Sanjhauli primary health centre in-charge medical officer Dr Sudhir Kumar said it was a human error, either by the entry operator or by the concerned clerk which has been rectified.However, a local resident said the health department was collecting samples without verifying the names from voters card or Aadhar Card and there was a chance of a person giving a false name.Civil surgeon Dr Sudhir Kumar said an inquiry has been marked into to the matter. “It may be a human error or a political conspiracy to defame the government,” Dr Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/woman-declared-covid-ve-without-test-probe-ordered-in-bihar/story-ewgNcc9TRXBbV8DYgnRRfI.html
20-07-2020||Patna||Bodies lie in Covid ward of Patna’s NMCH, patients flee||The Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) in Patna, the first government facility in BIhar to be declared a dedicated Covid-19 hospital, has come under intense scrutiny after pictures of a body lying in the isolation ward of went viral on Monday, a day after the Central team visited it.An attendant of a Covid-19 patient, who shot the pictures, claimed the body had been lying there since Sunday. Seven patients were being treated in the room where the body was lying, he said.“My mother has stopped eating since last afternoon. The body is lying on the bed adjacent to hers, and her condition has begun to deteriorate,” said Shatrughan, whose mother is being treated for Covid-19 for the past one week.He said the body had been covered with a thin ‘gumcha’ (cotton towel) and a large part of it was exposed, causing anxiety among other patients undergoing treatment in the room.The attendant claimed he had complained to the hospital staff but nothing was done despite assurances. This was not an isolated instance at the NMCH.Saurabh Gupta, attendant of another patient, alleged that two bodies were lying in another isolation ward since Sunday. A total of five deaths were reported at the NMCH on Monday.Gupta claimed no doctor had come to attend to the patients in the ward since Sunday, compelling him to take a voluntary discharge of his relative from the hospital and shift him to the AIIMS-Patna.Gupta said the immediate relatives of the patient were made to sign a form that they were taking the patient against medical advice, before allowing the patient to leave.“We had no other option. We signed the form because we could not have left our patient to die at the NMCH, where there is no one to either dispose of the bodies or attend to patients,” he claimed.Hindustan Times photographer was witness to a 62-year-old Danapur woman dying inside a private ambulance at the portico of the emergency ward of the NMCH after she was reportedly denied admission. Her two sons brought her to the NMCH around 11.30 am on Monday, but she died in about an hour after no one came to attend to her.The son was heard telling someone on cellphone that the authorities were not admitting her mother, who was on oxygen support following respiratory distress.Asha Garg, 70, who recovered from Covid-19 after undergoing treatment at the NMCH between June 16 and July 3, had also claimed a body remained in the ward with none to dispose it for 24 hours.“We were treated as untouchables. Forget doctors, even nurses would not come despite our request in case of emergency. They would keep our medicines outside the ward and call us out to collect them, avoiding any physical contact with us,” she said.“All through the 17 days of my stay at the NMCH, no physician ever came to attend to me or any of the patients in the ward I was admitted. The doctors enquired about condition of patients on mobile phones and communicated through the nurses,” she added.NMCH principal Dr Hiralal Mahto defended the hospital administration.“There’s a protocol for disposal of bodies of Covid-19 patients. The five deaths had taken place on Monday morning and we had left the bodies there (on beds in wards) for disposal in the evening, as the crematorium at Bans Ghat receives these bodies only after 8 pm,” said Dr Mahto.Asked if the hospital did not have a mortuary, he said: “The hospital does not have a mortuary though there is one at the medical college.”The distance between its medical college and hospital is around 3.5kms.He denied allegations that doctors and nurses were not attending to the patients at the Covid-19 hospital. “We have sufficient protective gear and all our doctors and nurses are promptly attending to all patients,” he said.He also denied that the number of dissatisfied patients leaving the hospital against medical advice was increasing.A three-member Central team, headed by Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the ministry of health and family welfare (MoH&FW) had visited the NMCH to assess its condition on Sunday. Other team members were Dr SK Singh, director, National Centre for Disease Control, and associate professor of AIIMS-Delhi Dr Neeraj Nischal.Patna district magistrate Kumar Ravi, who visited NMCH later in the evening, said: “The bodies should have been kept in the mortuary. There are some administrative issues, which we are trying to resolve and have extended all possible cooperation to the authorities at the NMCH.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bodies-lie-in-covid-ward-of-patna-s-nmch-patients-flee/story-uIjgoGGGQpCMQ5YZTHRiZP.html

They said the impact of the ever increasing rates of diesel and petrol on the income of the farmers should be taken into consideration and the central government should take immediate steps to being down the prices. They said the Punjab government should pass a resolution in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha against the increase in electricity bills, ordinance bills, protection of agriculture sector from corporate houses and implementation of MSP of crops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/members-of-bku-aap-s-kisan-wing-protest-against-agri-ordinance-in-kharar/story-mI3Xpb2km6JthFo4NFOAwO.html
20-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh wants weekend curfew in tricity, Punjab says no||The UT administration’s proposal for imposing weekend curfew in tricity has been turned down by the Punjab government, while Haryana’s response is awaited.UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida had on Monday written to the chief secretaries of Punjab and Haryana, seeking their consent and opinion on imposing weekend curfew in the tricity, a decision taken in the war-room meeting to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The proposal was mooted taking into account the spike in cases in July. In Chandigarh, cases reported in the first 20 days of July are more than double the cases reported in June. So far in July, 297 persons have tested positive, while in June the figure was 146.In the letter, the UT had proposed imposing curfew in the tricity (Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula), from 7pm (Friday) up to 6 am (Monday).Parida said the UT officials considered to take on both Punjab and Haryana on board “since weekend curfew only in Chandigarh will not be effective, unless it is simultaneously imposed in Mohali and Panchkula” .Confirming the development, Parida said, “Punjab has said no. Haryana, initially said no, but later, said they would be putting it up to chief minister. They are also reluctant.”In this regard, Raveen Thukral, media adviser to Punjab CM, tweeted, “Clarifying that Capt Amrinder-led Punjab government has not so far accepted UT administration’s proposal to impose weekend curfew (Friday evening to Monday morning) in tricity.”Significantly, in Mohali, curfew from Saturday evening to early Monday morning is already in force.Meanwhile, the Haryana government as well is not keen to impose weekend curfew in Panchkula. Top officials said chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had considered the issue of imposing a fresh lockdown or curfew in the national capital region (NCR) districts and elsewhere, but decided against it.“The state is instead focusing on ensuring social distancing measures, inculcate the habit of mask wearing among people, observe safe practices at workplace and more sampling, including rapid antigen. This is our approach in the NCR districts and elsewhere,’’ said an official.Khattar had said on Sunday that the government is pursuing an aggressive strategy in the containment zones whereby they screen more people and conduct higher testing since infections were being reported from only certain small pockets in every district.Now, the UT administration will take a final call on Wednesday whether to impose weekend curfew in Chandigarh, said Parida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-wants-weekend-curfew-in-tricity-punjab-says-no/story-umBOWQ8JSOv9NtsojWY24H.html

The doctors enquired about condition of patients on mobile phones and communicated through the nurses,” she added.NMCH principal Dr Hiralal Mahto defended the hospital administration.“There’s a protocol for disposal of bodies of Covid-19 patients. The five deaths had taken place on Monday morning and we had left the bodies there (on beds in wards) for disposal in the evening, as the crematorium at Bans Ghat receives these bodies only after 8pm,” said Dr Mahto.He did not say why the bodies were not immediately put in plastic body bags.Shockingly, the hospital does not even have a mortuary. “The hospital does not have a mortuary though there is one at the medical college.”The distance between its medical college and hospital is around 3.5 km.He denied allegations that doctors and nurses were not attending to the patients at the Covid-19 hospital. “We have sufficient protective gear and all our doctors and nurses are promptly attending to all patients,” he added.He also denied that the number of dissatisfied patients leaving the hospital against medical advice was increasing.Patna district magistrate Kumar Ravi, who visited NMCH later in the evening, said: “The bodies should have been kept in the mortuary. There are some administrative issues, which we are trying to resolve and have extended all possible cooperation to the authorities at the NMCH.” A three-member Central team, headed by Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the ministry of health and family welfare (MoH&FW) had visited the NMCH to assess its condition on Sunday. Other team members were Dr SK Singh, director National Centre for Disease Control, and associate professor of AIIMS-Delhi Dr Neeraj Nischal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bodies-lie-in-covid-19-ward-in-patna-s-nmch-a-hospital-without-mortuary/story-mgr1YAmi6BIauMttjvt5yL.html

20-07-2020||Chandigarh||Online classes leading to stress, eye problems in children, say parents||The long hours children spend on computers and smart phones for online classes as schools remain shut due to the Covid-19 pandemic is beginning to bother parents as complaints of headaches, eye problems and stress surface, it has been learnt. Time spent on screens not just for studies but for other activities as well is increasing, says a city-based psychiatrist, who, worryingly feels it’s turning out to be “worse than cannabis addition.” The ministry of human resource development (MHRD) recommended just 30 hours of screen time for pre-primary students, two classes of 45 minutes each for classes 1 to 8 and four classes of 45 minutes each for classes 9 to 12, but that’s not working, parents allege. Many schools are not following the directions,which anyway are not binding. Classes go on for longer than expected. “My children recently developed fever and headaches after attending online classes and I had to take them to the doctor,” says Nitin Goyal, president of the Chandigarh Parents Association.About his two children in Class 8 at a private school in the tricity, Mahesh Dheer from Panchkula says, “they had only one class initially, which has now increased to four. Sometimes lessons are extended till the evening after which the children have to complete homework. We try to have 10 minute breaks for them to relax and wash their eyes, but there is a visible redness in their eyes now which makes me very concerned as a parent.” Some parents are reporting mental health issues too due to excessive use of gadgets. Baljinder Singh of Sector 21, Chandigarh, suspects his children have increased mood swings now. “They are already cooped up at home and are getting cranky and restless. After their online classes I find they are unable to focus on their work and suffer from headaches,” he says.Opticians report jump in salesOpticians in the city too say more cases of children with complaints of eye strain are coming to them. “At least three or four people come in every day to get their children’s eyes tested because of increased screen time,” says Samrat Arora, the general secretary of the Chandigarh Optical Association, who runs an eye care centre in Sector 22. “We prescribe blue light filtering glasses and anti fatigue lenses to these children, which cost about Rs 1,200 and more.”Eye wear sales have jumped fourfold, adds Arora.‘Worse than cannabis addiction’ Calling screen addiction among children a growing concern, Dr Adarsh Kohli, professor of clinical psychology at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research compares it to cannabis addiction, “Too much exposure to screens of mobiles and laptops leads a feeling of isolation and anxiety in the current scenario. It can lead to depression and an increase in neurotic traits such as nail biting, thumb sucking and hair pulling,” she says.This can have an adverse physical impact on children and lead to eye strain on eyes and ears, obesity and disturbed sleep patterns, she adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/online-classes-leading-to-stress-eye-problems-in-children-say-parents/story-y4a8cnLKqHN8oCqozZ0psN.html
20-07-2020||City||Heroin seizures along Punjab border see three-fold rise this year||There has been a three-fold increase in the recovery of heroin by the Border Security Force (BSF) along the Punjab border this year as compared to the corresponding period last year.According to the BSF’s statistics, around 328kg of heroin, apparently smuggled from Pakistan, has been seized till July 19 this year. Last year, the figure was around 100kg for the same period.Punjab Police officials opine that the coronavirus-induced nationwide lockdown and restrictions imposed on the unnecessary movement of people have cut the supply chain of heroin, increasing the drug’s demand and prompting the Pakistani smugglers to push in more consignments into the Indian territory through various means.In the last four months of lockdown (March 23 to July 19), the BSF has seized 229kg heroin on the state border, which is 9kg more than the total seizures in the last year. In 2019, the BSF had seized total 227kg heroin. On March 23 this year, the Centre had enforced the nationwide lockdown.This year’s seizures include a 64-kg heroin haul from the Ravi river that flows along the India-Pakistan border in Gurdaspur district. The contraband was found in 60 packets concealed in long fabric cloth tubes and tied to a bunch of water hyacinth floating in the river on Sunday.A senior BSF official in Amritsar said, “We have noticed the increased activities of anti-national elements across the border this year. But our force is capable of thwarting their all attempts. Our personnel are keeping 24x7 vigil along the border.”A senior special task force (STF) official said, “The supply chain of heroin has been disrupted by the strict lockdown in Punjab and due to this out-patient opioid assisted treatment (OOAT) centres across Punjab have also witnessed a drastic increase in the admission of drug dependents for treatment.”The BSF’s recovery is apart from the drug haul by Punjab Police along the international border. On May 28 this year, the Tarn Taran police had seized around 8.50kg of heroin from across the barbed fence at Rattoke village on the India-Pakistan border.Tarn Taran senior superintendent of police Dhruv Dahiya had said the heroin was buried in an agriculture field across the barbed fence. After the recovery, the police had also arrested one Gurlal Singh of Rattoke village. Police had said Gurlal had been in contact with Pakistani smugglers for the supply of heroin.Similarly, on May 2, STF had recovered 9kg heroin with the arrest of three persons in two separate operations carried out near the India-Pakistan border. The STF had said the heroin, which was smuggled from across the border, was being cleared by the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/heroin-seizures-along-punjab-border-see-three-fold-rise-this-year/story-MjyxX9bTW2WTrgLpvpiZRL.html
20-07-2020||Lucknow||Humble egg: UPites new-found love during the lockdown||The Covid-19 pandemic seems to have egged on the people in Uttar Pradesh into consuming more eggs.As per estimate, UPites were buying over 2.5 crore eggs per day as against an estimated 1.5 crore eggs per day last year during the same period. The ban on meat-chicken-fish sale, unhindered supply and sale of eggs and nutritional value of eggs worked together in the high sale of eggs despite the summers.“Between April and now, all summer months, the Uttar Pradesh consumed the number of eggs it consumes in winters. This is the Saawan month (of Hindu calendar)--when sales of all non-vegetarian products and eggs goes down drastically but despite the summers and the sawaan, this time eggs are selling high,” said Ali Akbar, president, UP Poultry Farmers’ Association.Akbar said the state’s average summer consumption was between 1.25 crore to 1.75 crore eggs per day.“Chicken, meat was banned in UP since when Covid started in UP. When the government imposed the lockdown, eggs sale were allowed under essential supplies. We have witnessed higher demand and sale of eggs since April. And it continues. I have been selling 25-30 per cent more eggs than what I sold just before the lockdowns. Never before we saw such demand of eggs in summers,” said Ashwani Kumar, owner of Mama Milk Point in Udaiganj.He also said that this was the first time he observed eggs-hoarding tendencies among people.“Normally, people buy six or a dozen eggs. But this time, they pick up egg trays. One tray has 30 eggs people picking up more than one tray at a time is quite common now,” said Ashwani.According to the Livestock Production Data of the UP Animal Husbandry Department, the state had produced 260 crore eggs in 2018-19--that was roughly 70 lakh eggs per day.“But the capacity of UP egg farmers had touched 1.5 crore egg per day before Covid,” said Akbar.UP Egg Farmers Association data said that UP has 644 egg farms (with the capacity to produce 10,000 to 30,000 eggs per day each) in the organised sector and an additional backyard (unorganised) farms that produce 40 lakh eggs per day.The surplus eggs are coming from Telangana, Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan.The egg producers of those states are reaping the benefits of this jacked up demand.But then how did the UP egg farmers couldn’t reap the benefits of higher demand?“Because we were not in a position to meet the demand with enough supplies. Our egg production fell. The price of bird feed went up during lockdowns while already the UP egg farmers were reeling under high electricity bills as the poultry farmers’ power connections are commercial while they should be concessional ones as they too should be considered farmers. So many farmers could not sustain the business.Egg farmers buy chicks are Rs 5 each, but when the fresh non-vegetarian sale got banned in the state; many farmers sold the full-grown live birds at a premium--around Rs 125 each bird--to people (to be reared at home and then used for eating whenever desired). So, UP egg farmers production went down and other states’ benefited.”The egg farmers in UP got the opportunity to sell their birds at the premium because the state’s chicken industry had suffered badly due to pre-lockdown rumours that birds spread Covid. Before the lockdown, the chicken was either sold at throwaway prices, distributed free or culled.“Now, the farmers are rearing new chicks and they would be ready to lay eggs in about three months. So, the UP farmers would be in a position to supply 1.5 crore eggs per day by September,” said Akbar.“Eggs became a staple in our family since April,” said Tarun Gupta, a Canal Road resident.Eggs are well known good source of protein and good fats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/humble-egg-upites-new-found-love-during-the-lockdown/story-2GOTER4d1ldePyGeNSNpII.html
20-07-2020||City||Rise in fuel prices: Himachal govt hikes bus fare by 25%||Travelling in buses would be costlier as the government on Monday increased fare by around 25% to compensate for the recent increase in fuel prices, officials said.The minimum fare has been increased to ₹7 from existing ₹5. The decision to hike the fare of both private and Himachal Roadways buses was taken at the cabinet meeting on Monday presided by chief minister Jai Ram Thakur.“The decision has been taken keeping in view the increased fuel prices amid coronavirus pandemic. Transport corporation is suffering huge losses after the Covid-19 outbreak,” said transport minister Govind Thakur.Public transport in Himachal Pradesh was stalled in March-end after the Covid-19 outbreak. The government allowed intra-state transport to resume on June 1 with 60% occupancy. However, most private buses remained off-road due to non-viability and operators demanding up to 50% hike in the fare.The government initially refused to increase the fare but allowed 100% occupancy in the buses during Unlock 2 that started this month.However, the private bus operators remained adamant and wanted the government to hike the fare due to increased fuel prices.The Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) had also recommended an increase in the bus fare.SECOND HIKE IN TWO YEARSAt present, the fare of ordinary buses in Himachal is ₹1.12 per km in the plains and ₹1.75 in the hills.Similarly, the fare of deluxe buses is ₹1.37 per km in the plains and ₹2.17 per km in the hills.For Volvo and air-conditioned buses, the fare is ₹2.74 per km in the plains and ₹3.62 in the hills.The minimum bus fare is ₹5.This is the second bus fare hike during the tenure of the Jai Ram Thakur-led BJP government.Last time, bus fares were hiked by up to 24.44% on September 24, 2018.Buses are the only means of transportation in rural Himachal as the state lacks air and train connectivity in these areas.The HRTC has 3,300 buses in its fleet while there are 3,100 private buses in the state. At present only 33% of buses are plying. OTHER DECISIONSThe cabinet approved the replacement of 38 ambulances under the National Ambulance Service-108 in the state in lieu of ambulances which have outlived their economic life.The Industries Department made a presentation on ‘Ease of Doing Business’ before the cabinet. It stressed on the development of an online system for 46 services to facilitate the entrepreneurs and improve the ease of doing business in the state. The cabinet directed the department to move on all points of reforms in a time-bound manner.Information and Technology Department presented the hardware for e-Cabinet and the cabinet authorised the department to go-ahead for the purchase of 16 workstations. It was decided that the third-party security audit should be done for maintaining confidentiality.It also gave its nod to provide government land measuring 8 marala at a rate of 20% of the present circle rate i.e. ₹34,008 as a lump sum and ₹1 per month lease for 99 years at Bamsan in Hamirpur district in favour of HPSEB Limited. for construction of office of junior engineer and complaint room of tikri section.The cabinet gave its nod to withdraw the facility of free travel to Members of Parliament and MLAs in HRTC buses within and outside the state. However, this facility would continue for all former MLAs and MPs.It decided to convert the 771 vacant posts in the cadre of assistant librarians in the education department into junior office assistant (library) for the smooth functioning of libraries of educational institutions in the state.CONGRESS, CPI(M) CONDEMN HIKE State Congress and Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Monday condemned the state government’s decision to hike bus fare by 25% and have demanded to take back this decision.CPI(M) leader Sanjay Chauhan said that this decision has exposed state government and its ministers as after receiving backlash for considering to hike bus fares after the last cabinet meeting, CM, transport minister Govind Singh Thakur and other ministers were constantly making statements that bus fare in the state will not be hiked. The government has betrayed the people of the state.State Congress president Kuldeep Rathore said that this decision is totally anti-people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rise-in-fuel-prices-himachal-govt-hikes-bus-fare-by-25/story-aEffiTMv2v0dDx04ME1XaO.html

20-07-2020||Chandigarh||2017 graft case: Complainant, witness allege threats, high court seeks DGP’s response||The Punjab and Haryana high court has sought a personal affidavit from the Chandigarh director general of police (DGP) in an alleged false drug case instituted by the Chandigarh Police against a witness in graft case involving suspended SHO Jaswinder Kaur and other cops.The high court bench of justice Sudhir Mittal acted on the plea of Prem Singh Bisht and Samdarsh Kumar, who had approached the court seeking that the probe be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The FIR was registered under various sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act against Kumar at the Sector 39 police station on June 19.As per them, while Bisht is the complainant in the graft case, Kumar claims to have witnessed sub-inspector (SI) Mohan Singh of Sector 31 police station demanding Rs 9 lakh from Bisht to withdraw names of his employees from an attempt to murder FIR.Bisht had alleged that the SI had told him that the Rs 8 lakh were for the then SHO, Jaswinder Kaur, and Rs 1 lakh for him. After Bisht had approached CBI, the agency had laid a trap and arrested the SI while accepting Rs 2 lakh bribe in October 2017. Kaur has not been named in this FIR. However, in 2019, Bisht had filed a plea in a trial court to summon her as an accused.They have alleged that both of them were receiving threats from Rajdeep Singh, an inspector and SHO-rank officer, and Kaur to turn hostile in the 2017 case. They claimed that the June 2020 FIR against Kumar was a result of them not toeing the cops’ line. “Petitioners are being harassed unnecessarily and false case has been planted. Present is a case where the life and liberty of the petitioners has been put to peril. The senior officials of Chandigarh Police are also aiding the accused and are involved in illegally pressurising the petitioners,” they stated, demanding transfer of case to CBI.Kaur, recently suspended as Manimajra SHO, is again in the news in another graft case. She, along with a conduit, Bhagwan Singh, was booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act on June 29 on charges of seeking Rs 5 lakh bribe from a Manimajra resident, Gurdeep Singh for not lodging an FIR in a cheating case.The court, while seeking response from CBI and Chandigarh Police by August 10, said the response should be accompanied by an affidavit of the director general of police.ALSO READ: Sanction to prosecute SHO Jaswinder Kaur under consideration: DIG to CBI court||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2017-graft-case-complainant-witness-allege-threats-high-court-seeks-dgp-s-response/story-slymn245tDStqQdxbSZzKJ.html
20-07-2020||Chandigarh||Selja slams BJP govt for ‘anti-farmer’ ordinances||Accusing the BJP government of leaving no stone unturned to ruin the farmers, Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja on Monday said the three recent ordinances promulgated by the Central government will only help government’s favourite capitalists to have a free hand to loot the farmers.The Congress leader was referring to the Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance and the Essential Commodities (amendment) Ordinance.Addressing a press conference, Selja said that as per the new laws, the trader will be allowed to buy crops from outside the mandi. “This will eliminate competition in the market and minimum support price for the crops. These laws will also affect functioning of mandis in Haryana. At the same time, the crops of the farmers will be sold in the market at one-third price, due to which the farmers will suffer a huge loss,” she alleged.“The ordinances will protect the interests of a particular class only and are against the interests of farmers. These should be withdrawn immediately,” the Congress leader demanded. The state Congress chief maintained that amendment in the Essential Commodities Act will also lead to black marketing of many items.Chief minister ML Khattar, however, had on Sunday allayed fears regarding the new laws saying they will help in doubling the farmers’ income. Khattar had said the new measures will create an environment where farmers and traders have a free choice of sale and purchase of farm produce. The chief minister had said that it’s a false propaganda that minimum support price (MSP) will be done away with after the implementation of these measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/selja-slams-bjp-govt-for-anti-farmer-ordinances/story-gHDjCH47iZQoiQCNIPrOOM.html

Plasma, the liquid portion of the blood, from people who have recovered from the disease is called convalescent plasma.Earlier the college administration was sending blood samples of recovered patients to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, for plasma.Dr Harjinder Singh, principal, GMC Patiala said, “Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had given its permission to conduct trial of plasma therapy at college and we have successfully achieved the target. Now we will have state’s first plasma bank. We have enough people... who will donate plasma after the inauguration of the bank.”Dr RPS Sibiu, professor and head, department of medicine, in charge of trial process of plasma therapy, said, “The ICMR had given a target of 10 patients for plasma therapy in the state and we had contributed in five therapies. We already have facility of plasma storage and the equipment and machines”.Patients can donate their plasma 28 days after recovery and up to four months.“Around 15 donors are ready to donate their plasma and we are also encouraging other recovered patients to come forward for this purpose,” said Dr Harish Malhotra, civil surgeon Patiala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gmc-patiala-gets-punjab-s-first-plasma-bank/story-g1pakNAbupcjVuQrPbO1WJ.html
20-07-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab govt school students resort to widespread cheating, make mockery of online exams||Patiala: Students from primary to higher secondary classes of Punjab government schools are resorting to widespread cheating during the ongoing online examination, raising questions about the efficacy of such assessments during the Covid-19 pandemic.The students across government schools in Punjab were provided online study material followed by bi-monthly exams that began from July 13. It has been found that most children are using unfair means to attempt the examination.Teachers say most students have answered word for word as mentioned in help books. “The students did not adhere to repeated instructions and appeals by teachers to attempt exams with fair means. In most cases, the teachers received fully attempted answer sheets within 15 minutes of releasing the question papers,” said a government teacher, requesting anonymity.The students were provided question papers of 20 marks each on official WhatsApp groups. They had to upload the answer sheets in the same group.‘FAULTY PROCESS OF TESTING’Vikram Dev, a government school teacher, who is also a member of the Democratic Teachers’ Front (DTF), said, “This is a faulty process that makes students bank on unfair means to clear an examination. These can’t be called exams, rather they should be termed assignments. What is the point of holding such exams when students have a free hand to copy from guides and textbooks?” he said.“The online education method can only be used as a teaching aid. It is not possible for teachers to ensure decorum among students virtually,” he said.Another teacher said his colleagues were receiving answers-sheets with the cheating material also visible in the photos uploaded by students.“Parents are equally at fault as they have failed to keep check on their wards. Teachers will have no option than to make marking of answer-sheets stricter,” another teacher said.BE PREPARED FOR STRICT MARKINGEducation secretary Krishan Kumar said the purpose of providing online study material and conducting exams was to keep students involved with studies.“Teachers are well aware of their students’ performance so they can easily identify those who attempted the exams with unfair means. The teachers have been directed to follow strictness while giving scores,” he said.He said that these exams are meant to assess the actual performance of the students so that the teachers can work on their weak areas.“The teachers had also sent messages to parents to ensure that the children attempted the exams through fair means,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-govt-school-students-resort-to-widespread-cheating-make-mockery-of-online-exams/story-EVdHo2TK7ZH4PI3TKwWnFN.html

20-07-2020||Chandigarh||Himachal CM’s participation in yagya in Covid-19 times sparks off political row||Shimla: Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jai Ram Thakur’s participation in the yagya organised by the BJP’s women’s wing last week has sparked off a political row with the opposition Congress and Left parties training their guns on the ruling party, saying it flouted social distancing norms in Covid-19 times.The BJP’s women’s wing organised the Vedic ritual prayer in the parking lot on main Circular Road on July 16 for world peace and for warding off coronavirus. The chief minister, who participated in the ‘puranahuti’ (culmination of the ceremony) after 55 lakh Gayatri Mantra jaap (repetitions), praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “farsighted leadership” to help slow down the pandemic’s spread. Among those present on the occasion were the head of the Gayatri Parivar, VK Bhatnagar and state BJP Mahila Morcha chief Rashmi Dhar Sood besides education minister Suresh Bhardwaj, urban development minister Sarveen Chaudhary, organising secretary Pawan Rana, state BJP general secretary and the CM’s political adviser Trilok Jamwal, women’s wing office-bearers Vandna Guleria and Sheetal Vyas Sharma.“The Communist Party of India condemns the participation of the chief minister and his ministerial colleagues at a function where social distancing norms were thrown to the wind. Instead of age-old Vedic traditions, the government should draw up a scientific strategy to check the spread of coronavirus. There has been a spurt in the number of Covid-19 cases after the government lifted travel restrictions,” Sanjay Chauhan, a former Shimla mayor, said. He said that Shimla was itself one of the worst-hit cities in the state.The Communist Party of India Marxist also demanded action against the organisers. “It’s ridiculous that on one hand the government has limited the numbers for wedding and funeral ceremonies, while on the other hand it’s not adhering to norms in the fight against Covid-19,” Congress organising secretary Harkirishan Himral said.Meanwhile, the BJP Mahila Morcha refuted the opposition’s allegations. “It’s mere propaganda by the opposition as it has failed in all aspects during the pandemic. The opposition should explain what it did for society during the pandemic. We have proof where Congress leaders themselves threw social distancing norms to the wind,” said Sheetal Vyas Sharma, the state BJP general secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-cm-s-participation-in-yagya-in-covid-19-times-sparks-off-political-row/story-SEZFVE3QGRtzGTgu6kXwCJ.html

20-07-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab Police book singer Sidhu Moosewala in new case for glorifying gun culture in latest song Sanju||Chandigarh: Punjab Police are set to move the Punjab and Haryana high court for the cancellation of the anticipatory bail granted in an Arms Act case to controversial singer Sidhu Moosewala, against whom the crime branch registered another case for promoting violence and gun culture with his latest song Sanju, released on social media a couple of days ago.Punjab additional director general of police (ADGP) and director, Punjab Bureau of Investigations, Arpit Shukla said the singer had been booked in Mohali on the basis of information received that his song Sanju, which is trending on social media, blatantly glorifies the use of weapons and boasts about the FIRs, including the one under the Arms Act, registered against him. The ADGP said the police would be soon filing a petition for the cancellation of the anticipatory bail granted to Moosewala by the high court.Shukla said it had been verified that the latest video-song, Sanju, was uploaded from Moosewala’s official YouTube channel. In the song, Moosewala refers to the case against him under the Arms Act, and the video starts with a news-clip of him being booked for unauthorised use of an AK-47 rifle.GLORIFIES SANJAY DUTT’S OFFENCESIn the video, Moosewala’s news clip is later merged with news reports of Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt having been convicted and sentenced for similar offences. Shukla said the lyrics of the song, and the video, promotes and glorifies the possession and use of illegal firearms, and boasts about the registration of an FIR as a sign of a ‘real man’.Shukla said the lyrics of the song, “Gabru de naal santali (47) jud gayi, ghato ghat saja paanj saal vat de, gabru utte case jehra Sanjay Dutt te, jatt utte case jehra Sanjay Dutt te….; awa tawa bolde vakil sohniye, sari duniya da oh judge sunida, jithe saadi chaldi appeal sohniye”, not only promote the use of illegal firearms but also undermine the judiciary, police and advocates.Shukla said Moosewala had been earlier booked for a similar offence on February 1 this year by the Mansa Police. On May 4, he was booked by the Barnala police for offences under the Disaster Management and Arms Act after his photos of firing an AK-47 rifle at a firing range during the curfew went viral on social media.MOCKING POLICE AND JUDICIARYHis latest act is clearly intended to not only ridicule, mock and undermine the police and the judiciary – but also shows that the singer is incorrigible and has repeatedly committed such offences, said Shukla.The ADGP said that the high court had already directed the director generals of police of Punjab, Haryana and the Union Territory of Chandigarh to ensure that no songs glorifying liquor, drugs and violence are played even at live shows. Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has also expressed concern over the propagation of violence and gun culture in Punjabi songs and has directed the state police not to show any relaxation or concession towards such singers, who lure youngsters into following the path of violence and hooliganism.Shukla said it seems that with his latest song, which he seems to wear as some sort of a badge of honour, Moosewala deliberately wants to incite and mislead youngsters of this border state, which has borne the brunt of terrorism in the ’80s and ’90s, by glorifying the use of AK-47 rifles and other weapons.He said Moosewala has been booked under Sections 188, 294, 504 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code in Mohali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-police-book-singer-sidhu-moosewala-in-new-case-for-glorifying-gun-culture-in-latest-song-sanju/story-ov3Uv5fL1Xd0LsEvxCwagJ.html

20-07-2020||Delhi||4 die in first heavy rainfall of monsoon in Delhi; CM says not time for blame-game||The first heavy monsoon rainfall in Delhi claimed four lives on Sunday, including that of a mini-truck driver who got trapped in a waterlogged underpass, as Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tried to defend his government by blaming the lack of preparation on the coronavirus pandemic.As the Delhi BJP charged that the very first spell of heavy rain this season “exposed” the AAP government’s preparations, Kejriwal said a “blame-game” should be avoided.Nearly 100 places across the city were waterlogged, the traffic came to a standstill on important roads, and at least 10 houses collapsed in a slum area in Anna Nagar, which is behind the WHO Headquarters near ITO, displacing the residents.A small NDRF team was sent to Anna Nagar to take stock of the situation.Many residents shared on social media videos and pictures of rainwater gushing into their houses and vehicles wading through waterlogged roads.The maximum cases of waterlogging were reported from North Delhi Municipal Corporation (36) followed by New Delhi Municipal Council (32) and South Delhi Municipal Corporation (30), officials said.The municipal corporation officials said more than 66 incidents of felling of trees or their branches were reported, in addition to around a dozen wall collapse incidents.A 56-year-old man from Uttarakhand drowned after his mini-truck was stuck under the waterlogged Minto Bridge in central Delhi. Police said Kundan Kumar was trying to navigate his vehicle through the waterlogged underpass but the vehicle got stuck in the neck-deep water. His body was found floating on the street.An eight-year-old boy died after he fell in a roadside ditch in Saurabh Vihar in southeast Delhi, police said. A 28-year-old man who worked at a scrap shop in Sriniwaspuri in Gandhi Camp died in a similar accident outside the shop.Police said their inquiry found that the area was filled with up to three-ft-deep water following the rainfall and the man fell into a pothole. His co-workers lifted him but he was unconscious and declared brought dead at AIIMS.The fourth accident happened in northwest Delhi’s Jahangirpuri.A 56-year-old man lost balance on a slippery road and hit a cemented electric pole. He was taken to BJRM Hospital but was declared brought dead, police said.Water-logging was reported from several areas including at Minto Road, Azadpur underpass, South Avenue Road, Pul Prahladpur underpass, Azad Market, Moolchand underpass and near Batra Hospital, according to Delhi Traffic Police.Water-logging was also reported at Youth Congress office on Raising Road.At Zakhira, six people stuck inside a bus submerged in water had to be rescued. According to Delhi Fire Service Director Atul Garg, the firemen could not use a ladder to climb atop the bus and they had to carry people on their backs to safer grounds.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said Kejriwal had promised to make Delhi like London and Paris but in reality people are unable to step out due to waterlogging.East Delhi BJP MP Gautam Gambhir shared pictures of waterlogging and tweeted, “Heard that Delhi government is running rainwater harvesting scheme on London-Paris like roads. When will the advertisements be seen Kejriwal ji.” Kejriwal, however, said that this was not the time for any “blame-game over waterlogging” as all agencies have been busy combating the coronavirus.“This year, all agencies, be it Delhi government or MCD, were busy in prevention of COVID-19. They faced many difficulties due to corona. This is not the time to blame each other. All have to fulfil their responsibilities together. Wherever there is waterlogging, we will try to pump out water immediately,” he said on Twitter in Hindi.But former Delhi BJP president and and his main challenger in February polls, Manoj Tiwari, tweeted: “Arvind Kejriwal ji your preparations are exposed by the first rains of monsoon. A solid plan should be prepared to deal with the rains so that Delhi could be prevented from submerging and people saved from difficulties.” Deputy Chief Minister Sisodia said the Delhi government is closely monitoring the situation and appropriate steps will be taken to address the issue.He requested BJP to work together and not indulge in a blame-game.The India Meteorological Department, which had predicted heavy-to-very heavy rainfall over parts of northwest India, said 74.8 mm rainfall was recorded in Delhi till 8:30 am on Sunday. Rainfall recorded below 15mm is considered light, between 15 and 64.5 mm is moderate, and above 64.5mm is heavy.However, AAP leader Sanjay Singh said “no one had expected” that there would be such heavy rainfall.In a statement, AAP spokesperson and DJB Vice-Chairperson Raghav Chadha said the water-logging problem has been a huge issue but in the last 2-3 years, after the AAP government came to power, the situation drastically changed.At a time when all agencies are busy combatting the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unfortunate that the BJP is blaming us for water-logging.Delhi Congress president Anil Chaudhary said the rainfall “unmasked” the faulty working of both the ruling AAP and the BJP-ruled municipal corporations. “The swelling water of drain at Anna Nagar near ITO swept many houses,” he said after visiting the affected families.The monsoon reached Delhi on June 25, two days earlier than its usual date. But it remained subdued since. The IMD has predicted normal rainfall in the national capital during the monsoon season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/4-die-in-first-heavy-rainfall-of-monsoon-in-delhi-cm-says-not-time-for-blame-game/story-uiL82eYF1leTWhjh0Y7WVK.html

20-07-2020||Delhi||Ghewar sales unaffected: Foodies in Delhi-NCR can’t stay away from this festive sweet||Mention Teej, which is approaching on July 23, and the next word that comes to the mind is ghewar! The popular disc-shaped sweet dish from Rajasthan has its own fan following among North Indian dwellers such as those from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and of course, Delhi. Malai ghewar, mawa or plain ghewar — all variants are so tempting that their demand hasn’t reduced even amid the corona scare. Popular sweet shops in Delhi-NCR have reportedly been experiencing a decent demand for ghewar, which has left even the halwais surprised. A salesperson at Gopala, a popular dairy and sweet shop in Delhi-NCR, says they have been selling 15-20 ghewar/per day. “Jisko lena hain, woh le lete hain. Ab tyohar hai to log ghewar to khayenge hi... Teej ya Rakhi ghewar mithai ke bina kahan manti hai,” he says while manning the Gurugram outlet. ALSO READ: Teej 2020: History, significance, puja timing of this monsoon festivalEchoing similar sentiments, Sanjay Aggarwal, from Shyam Sweets, Chandni Chowk, says, “Jabse lockdown khula hai, waise orders kam ho gaye hain par ghewar log phir bhi khareed rahe hai. Farak itna hai ki ab log bada order directly nahi de rahe. They are buying in smaller quantities. For instance, people who bought 1kg earlier, are now buying half a kilo. Aisa shayad is liye ki logon ki jeb main paise utne nahin hain abhi... Pehle 15 din pehle tayari shuru ho jati thi, is saal ek hafte pehle hi hui hai.”Talking about how goodwill matters, Ramesh, from Nathu Sweets, New Friends Colony, says, “We are selling about 40 to 50 pieces of ghewar on a daily basis. Jinko wishwas hain ki hum achchi cheez hi banate hain, woh lene aa rahe hain, ya ghar se order kar dete hain toh we deliver.” It’s true that one can’t ignore sweets in the festive season. “I did buy ghewar from Harish Bakery in Sector 7, Gurugram,” says Nupur Agarwal Kalra, a food and lifestyle blogger, adding, “That is the first time I bought food from outside in the last four months. Initially I had reservations, but it was a prompt decision as I was passing by the sweet shop and this being the start of the festive season, the sweets were just irresistible to give a miss.” But precautionary measures do cross the mind of many before making a purchase. Gurugram-based home chef Shahla Ahmed says, “I have plans to buy malai ghewar from two of my favourite sweet shops. I trust them to be taking care of hygiene and safety.” Whereas Sakshi Jain, a Gurugrammer who travelled all the way to Old Delhi to get her favourite ghewar, confesses, “We bought ghewar from the famous Chaina Ram in Old Delhi. We were a little apprehensive for sure, so we sanitised the outer box and then threw away the entire packing once we reached home. Once it landed in our mouth, the taste surpassed all our worries.”Kunal Balani, one of the partners at Chaina Ram Sindhi Confectioners, informs that their sales have been “decent”. He adds: “Everything has been affected because of the coronavirus. We have taken a hit of 50 to 60%. But, I’m glad that people are still appreciating ghewar this year. As soon as July began, people started calling us to ask ‘When will you open?’ It meant people haven’t forgotten us. It feels good to be loved, and see people appreciate your sweets. People might have reduced the quantity of their purchase, but they are buying.” Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ghewar-sales-unaffected-foodies-in-delhi-ncr-can-t-stay-away-from-this-festive-sweet/story-9Tql1OuMfWGnunHoLcU7aK.html
20-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Golf Club now a ‘puppy free’ zone||‘Hole in one’ is a friendly mutt who can be found at the 18 fairway. ‘Caddy girl’ roams freely around the caddy area, but has a cautious temperament. And ‘white line’ can be found lurking near hole no. 2 and is the least interested in interacting with golfers.These four-legged creatures are among the 50-odd dogs who have made the Chandigarh Golf Course their home. Only recently, these furry friends were christened and the club is now maintaining their data: what they look like, area of movement on the course, a brief on their temperament and the status of their sterilisation and vaccination. The Chandigarh Golf Club had tied up with two NGOs six months ago to conduct a sterilisation and vaccination drive. Now, the club is a ‘puppy free’ campus, with all 52 dogs, including puppies, sterilised and vaccinated. Two of the dogs have even been flown to the US for adoption with help from Reet, who runs Sewa Stray—an international NGO with roots in Chandigarh—and whose father is a member of the club.“In December last year, the club management approached us (Peedu’s People and Sewa Stray) for systematically dealing with the problem of dog-overpopulation. The drive was stretched a little due to the Covid situation. The drive will ensure the population of stray dogs stabilises. Though the chances of a new dog entering the course are less, because dogs here are territorial, if a new dog finds its way here, they will be promptly vaccinated and sterilised,” says Inder Sandhu, the brain behind Peedu’s People, which works for the welfare of stray animals and educating school children across the tricity on how to take care of animals.“We protect dogs against rabies so that humans are protected, too,” adds Sandhu, who has worked in animal rescue and rabies control authority in the US for six years before migrating back to India in 2016.“All the dogs were humanely caught with the help of the club staff and after vaccination and sterilisation, they were released back in their earlier marked areas,” says Rubika Singh, member of Peedu’s People.Dog trapping, transport, sterilisation and post-operative care were done by both the NGOs. The club pitched in for funds. “We now have complete data on the canines on the course and this will help us to monitor their population. Although no cases of human-dog conflict have been reported here, the drive was a precautionary measure,” says Colonel Arun Johal (retd), general manager of the Chandigarh Golf Club.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-golf-club-now-a-puppy-free-zone/story-oUB0VJF52z7BAaKyb7GpqN.html

20-07-2020||Chandigarh||Dhankar’s appointment as Haryana BJP chief: Central leadership keeps caste balance intact||The appointment of OP Dhankar as Haryana BJP chief is being seen as an attempt by the central leadership to balance the caste equations in the state, where politics revolves around Jats and non-Jats.By giving the baton to Dhankar, the BJP bosses have sent a conciliatory message to the politically boisterous Jat community that has been nursing a plethora of grouses against the BJP after 2016 violent Jat quota agitation. The Jat community constitutes about 25 % of the state’s population, making them a singular dominant vote-bank.The BJP has maintained a status quo on the delicate issue of caste by replacing Barala (a Jat) with Dhankar. But, the move primarily points towards BJP attempting to woo the Jat community ahead of the bypoll in the Jat-dominated Baroda assembly segment.According to Prof Ashutosh Kumar, department of political science, Panjab University, the Jats of Haryana will back “outspoken” Dhankar more than “non-performer and controversial Barala.Dhankar’s elevation should also be seen in the light of growing perception that the central BJP leadership ignores the dominant caste, he says. “The BJP has been cutting down to size the leaders of the dominant caste. That’s the perception... It’s a kind of status quo, but Dhankar is a dynamic leader, certainly a better choice than Barala.”There are no immediate electoral challenges before Dhankar, barring Baroda bypoll.Political analysts say electoral calculation is not what alone appears to have catapulted the former minister to the top post. “Khattar was backing some other leaders,” a Haryana watcher said.The key task before Dhankar will be to expand the base of the party and bridge the gap between the government and the people at the grassroots level even as he will have to maintain a delicate balance between the party and the state government.Unlike his predecessor, who was “unpopular “ even in his own constituency of Tohana, Dhankar is tactful — a trait that could come in handy to make inroads into the hearts of the Jats in the hinterland.Dhankar, a crowd-pullerInside the Vidhan Sabha, Dhankar, a former agriculture minister, often came across as an aggressive speaker who would hit back at the opposition with biting remarks.Outside the assembly, Dhankar is known for regaling the crowd by singing Haryanvi ragni (a traditional folk song) from public platforms.Before jumping into the active politics, people close to him say, Dhankar had served as a geography teacher in Bhiwani for over a decade. Born in Dhakla village of Jhajjar district in 1961, Dhankhar did his postgraduation and MEd from the Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak.BARALA’S EXIT WAS ON THE CARDSThe ouster of Subhash Barala as the Haryana BJP chief was on the cards. Somehow, he managed to not only complete his term, but also stay at the helm of affairs despite the BJP’s inability to cross the halfway mark in the October 2019 assembly elections, forcing the party to form a coalition government.Barala’s political troubles began with the alleged stalking case involving his son, who was then a law student at Kurukshetra University. The BJP backed him despite the raging controversy.A close aide of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, Barala, 52, a Jat leader, went up the ladder quite quickly.He won his first-ever election in 2014 after losing twice. Barala remained the state BJP chief from December 2014, when he replaced Ram Bilas Sharma, who became a cabinet minister in the previous Khattar government.As Jats, the largest and very volatile vote bank of Haryana, were angry with the BJP, the task before Barala was to woo them in the October 2019 assembly polls.But the BJP, which was aiming at a lofty ‘Abki Baar 75 Paar’ (this time, it will be over 75 seats), fell short of a simple majority (46 seats) in the 90-member state assembly, securing just 40 seats. The BJP had swept the Lok Sabha polls in May.Barala himself lost the assembly polls from the Tohana segment by 52,302 votes. Since then, the knives were out demanding his ouster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dhankar-an-aggressive-leader-known-for-biting-comments/story-PxpIFihCkPO2Ywm1J0qzwK.html
20-07-2020||Chandigarh||RWAs in Chandigarh oppose imposition of TDS on park maintenance by MC||The resident welfare associations (RWAs) of the city have opposed the municipal corporation’s (MC) renewed action of imposing TDS (tax deducted at source) on them for maintaining neighbourhood parks.MC has been asking the local RWAs maintaining neighbourhood parks and public toilets either to get themselves registered with the income tax department or else seek exemption from payment of income tax, otherwise MC would start deducting TDS from their bills of payment.There are around 1,800 neighbourhood parks in Chandigarh and of these, nearly 700 are being maintained by the RWAs. They are paid ₹2.48 per square metre, and the rates haven’t been revised since 2013.In June 2020, the MC sent memos to all RWAs, imposing 2% TDS liability on them, and making it mandatory for them to get PAN (Permanent Account Number) to pay the TDS. It is reported that if RWAs do not get PAN, they will be considered as individuals and will be liable to pay 20% tax as per the provisions under the Income Tax Act.“TDS deduction on receipts of reimbursement of expenditure incurred by welfare societies on maintenance of neighborhood parks is totally illogical and unjustified. There was no such condition in the MOU signed by us with the MC,” said JP Yadav, president of Sector 37 RWA.Vinod Vashisht, convener of City Forum of Residents Welfare Organisations (CFORWO), said “We have gone through the MOU issued by the MC to the concerned RWAs and relevant provisions of the I-T Act. Payments to RWAs by MC for maintenance of parks do not come under the purview of TDS.”“All our members are extending voluntary honorary services in maintaining the green cover in the city. Neither are we vendors of the MC, nor are they our customers. How can such an activity be considered under the purview of income tax?” said Som Nath Saini, president of Sector 27 RWA.“Imposing TDS at 20% on a society like ours having no PAN or Aadhaar is totally uncalled for. Our society has no profit function and we don’t want to remain unconstructively occupied in I-T works,” voiced Kuljinder Sra, general secretary of Sector 33 RWA.“The central government has reduced the rates of TDS on various non-salaried transactions by 25% with effect from May 14, 2020, hence, sending TDS notices for activities not covered under the purview of IT Act, are totally uncalled for,” said Vashisht.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rwas-in-chandigarh-oppose-imposition-of-tds-on-park-maintenance-by-mc/story-erLWLRjM1A8KGo1ogR5lmI.html

The accused has already been sent in five-day police remand.Baldev has accused him and one Surinder Singh of cheating him on the pretext of sending his son to the US. DSP Munish Sehgal said, “Another case was registered against him at the Ambala City police station. He has been arrested twice in cases registered against him at Barara and Shahazadpur police stations, but was released on interim bail.”Kaithal: Travel agent arrested A travel agent has been arrested for allegedly taking ₹56 lakh from a person for sending him to the US illegally. As per the police, action was taken following the complaint from the family of the victim, who is lodged a jail in the US.Mandeep Singh of Pundri alleged that accused Mahabir of Dherru village took ₹56 lakh from him to send his son to the US in February 2019. He claimed that his son had to face hardships as he undertook a rigorous journey via bus, boat and on foot through Mexican jungles. “He was later forced to cross the US border in July 2019 illegally and was subsequently arrested by police and sent to Jail,” he added. Earlier this month, he was deported and filed a police complaint. Kaithal superintendent of police Shashank Kumar Sawan said the accused was taken in police remand for two days for interrogation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-bjp-leader-held-for-immigration-fraud/story-RylkcioTiRzLY9TM67GEPJ.html
20-07-2020||Mumbai||‘Only 57% Maharashtra students have internet connectivity’||Lack of digital skills among parents, no access to smartphones, poor internet connectivity, and inability to recharge phones are some of the reasons why nearly half the students in the state have poor or no access to online education. The findings are a part of a survey conducted by the Maharashtra State Council of Educational Research and Training (MSCERT) in association with the United Nations International Children’s Fund (UNICEF) before the new academic year began on June 15.A total of 737 schools and 6,855 students were interviewed for the study. The government had selected two blocks from each district – those with the highest and the lowest literacy rates – for the survey. While almost 59.8% of students had access to a smartphone, only about 57% had internet connectivity. Less than 1% of the total students surveyed had access to desktops and laptops.Dinkar Patil, director, MSCERT, said, “The survey was conducted to identify the hurdles that needed to be addressed before schools could reopen online. Efforts are now being taken to reach out to students through multiple mediums. After schools reopened online, we started conducting another leg of the survey to understand how students are managing to learn over the last one month.”The most common barrier for students who could not access online learning was the lack of digital skills among parents. Nearly 72% of the 3,391 students who had such issues, claimed this was a problem for them. Lack of access to smartphones (66.4%); no internet (52.3%); issues with connectivity (35.2%), and lack of family support (22.6%) were other major hurdles when it came to online learning. Nearly 8.5% of students were engaged in supporting their families through some type of unpaid work.Issues concerning access were seen more in marginalised and socially-backward groups. As opposed to 59% of students from the general category who could access learning resources of the education department, only 40.5% of students from the scheduled tribes and 46.2% from the nomadic tribes could use them. Vanita Mate, who has two children, both studying at a Mumbai-based school in Class 4 and Class 6, respectively, moved to her hometown Mangaon in Raigad district, when the lockdown began. She doesn’t have enough money to recharge her phone to call people, let alone get a data pack. “I want my children to learn but I cannot afford to pay for internet. Also, we have very poor network in our village,” she said.Even in a metropolitan city like Mumbai, several parents said they were struggling to take care of the expenses that come with online learning. Pushpa Sharma, who works as a domestic help, said, “My son has online classes for two hours daily, and the internet pack we got is not sufficient even for a week. This is becoming a big hassle and we do not know how to afford it.” Anagha Madhukar, the principal of Ahilyadevi Holkar Secondary School, which is run by the Pune Municipal Corporation and iTeach Schools, said that a student requires 1-1.5GB data daily for a four-hour online class. “This means a monthly investment of ₹200 to ₹250. Over the last few months, we are happy to see that a lot of parents have been able to keep aside some money for the purpose. Even children were saving for their recharges,” she said.Balu Bhoyar, principal, Karamveer Vidyalaya in Chandrapur, said that with most students not having access to technology, the only way to continue their education is through physical classes. “We have started sending teachers to localities, where small groups of students can be taught daily. This is safe and also helps in continuous learning for such students,” he said.Kannan Moudgalya, Erach and Meheroo Mehta Advanced Education Technology chair professor, IIT-Bombay, said that when it comes to access, one needs to understand that it is of two kinds. “It includes access to fast internet, which is required to see live videos, and slow internet, with which one can download videos and watch later. The first type of internet has limited reach, and several IIT students, too, do not have access to it, let alone school students from low-income families. For government schools, the second kind of access can be put to good use,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/only-57-maha-students-have-internet-connectivity/story-rIhrSeDyVuR5XMjE72tzDJ.html
20-07-2020||Mumbai||‘Need to bring fatality rate in city to below 1%’||Although the city’s Covid-19 cases have plateaued, the fatality rate, hovering at 5.63%, continues to be a cause for concern, and experts are now stressing the need to bring it to below 1%. HT spoke to Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the Covid-19 task force formed by the state, on the way ahead. Excerpts:What has been the learning curve while tackling the outbreak nearly four months after we went into a lockdown?As the pandemic evolved, we learnt about its transmission and impact. There are three major learnings: when the first few cases were detected, wearing masks was not mandatory, as we believed that Covid-19 spread through droplets, sneezing etc, for which we advised social distancing. However, now we know that the virus is also airborne and hence wearing masks are mandatory. We also learnt that social distancing is not possible in a closed cluster, spaces with poor ventilation and at offices as central air-conditioning can aggrevate the risk of spreading the virus.Initially, we thought this pandemic is a life-threatening disease. But as the pandemic evolved, we found that 85% of the infected patients are asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic or are mildly symptomatic. Of the 15% critical patients also, only 3 to 5% would require intensive care. Earlier we though many patients will require ventilators, but now we know that most of them just require oxygen support.Why are Mumbai’s daily cases hovering in the 1,000-1,500 range (barring a few spikes or decline) for around two months now?In Mumbai, Covid-19 cases started getting detected from March-end and the city’s peak was probably from May 15 to May 31. The cases have now plateaued in the city, though the case burden is still existent. With testing being liberalised, there has not been much change in the daily number of cases. The recovery and doubling rates however, have improved, but Mumbai has still not managed to bring down its fatality rate. Now, a lot depends on how we handle the monsoon-related infections as well as the Covid-19 outbreak in the coming days.Why is the city’s fatality rate high and how can it be tackled?Many deaths which had taken place earlier, which were added up quite later. Due to this, the fatality rate is not accurate. The other reason being that patients are reaching hospitals late and many of the patients who died also had comorbidities. However, we need to save lives and Mumbai should bring the mortality rate to below 1%.We have rapidly built our health infrastructure, including providing life-saving drugs, which has not happened in Mumbai before. However, we ought to continue making more and better arrangements and must be on our vigil until the vaccine arrives.Which are the areas where the city should have done better?Like I said, we have a liberalised testing policy now, so anyone can go and get tested without prescription. But I feel we should have taken this step much earlier, though the testing protocols are driven by ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research]. I also think that we should have done better at ensuring that patients reach hospitals early. In March and April, there should have been better emergency healthcare facilities such as ambulances. We could have also conducted better at tracing and quarantining people. But let me also add that the entire responsibility does not lie just with the administration, and that citizens are also responsible. In several parts of the city, citizens did not follow the lockdown in true sense.What is the role of Covid-19 task force and what has been the contribution of the task force until now?The task force had two mandates: one was to draw out the treatment protocols and the other to strategise on reducing the fatality rate. We tried to have better treatment protocols, brought about a strategy to reduce the fatality rate and implemented protocols for critical patients’ care. We also gave inputs on Covid-19 hospitals to the authorities. Another thing we did was to draw up strategies for the ‘chase the virus and save lives’ initiative.We continue to be in a state of lock down. When do you think the city can open up local trains, restaurants, malls, gyms etc?Our unlocking needs to be very mindful. Malls, trains and theatres are crowded, have poor ventilation and can therefore become transmission hubs. If at all they are to be opened, we will have to look at restricted timings, restricted access and social distancing norms. All these services can be opened up only gradually to avoid a second spike. We don’t want to do a repeat of what happened in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/need-to-bring-fatality-rate-in-city-to-below-1/story-XmxxGsQ0e14E2RNBNC3qZJ.html

20-07-2020||Chandigarh||Khattar rules out lockdown in NCR districts||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday ruled out the imposition of an immediate lockdown in the national capital region (NCR) districts in view of the large number of Covid-19 cases being reported.Five NCR districts — Faridabad, Gurugram, Sonepat, Rohtak and Rewari — account for 63% of the total active coronavirus infections in the state. Speaking to mediapersons at a press briefing, the chief minister said the government did not want to create panic by imposing lockdown in the NCR.“Things have started coming back on track gradually. At this juncture, imposition of lockdown would be meaningless. Our focus remains on ensuring social distancing, wearing of masks, making people aware about taking precautions, and more testing,” Khattar said.The chief minister said infections were being reported from only certain small pockets in every district. “So, there is no need for a lockdown in the entire district. Instead, we are pursuing an aggressive strategy in the containment zones whereby we screen more people and conduct more sampling, including rapid antigen tests,” the chief minister said.Khattar said the state now has a recovery rate of over 75% which once fell down to about 32%. The mortality rate is also coming down, while our testing rate (14,000 per million) has gone up, he added. Don’t pay heed to false propaganda: CM to farmersThe chief minister said two ordinances promulgated by the Centre — Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance and Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance — were beneficial for the farmers and they should not pay heed to any false propaganda. “These measures will help in doubling the income of the farmers. It will create an environment where farmers and traders have a free choice of sale and purchase of farm produce. It will also eliminate barriers to inter and intrastate trade and commerce outside physical market premises.Khattar said it’s a false propaganda that the minimum support price (MSP) will be done away with after the implementation of these measures.‘Can’t bring ordinance against SC’s decision’In response to a query regarding the demand made by opposition parties to accommodate 1,983 physical training instructors (PTIs), whose selections have been set aside by the Supreme Court, by bringing in an ordinance, the chief minister said the government cannot bring an ordinance against the apex court’s decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/khattar-rules-out-lockdown-in-ncr-districts/story-LLvmMZZbL1tLtvdI3pOmEN.html
20-07-2020||City||Thane teachers go the extra mile to help their students||Seventeen-year-old Gaurangi Patil, a resident of Bhiwandi, is unable to attend online classes as her family cannot afford internet connectivity. However, she has been able to keep up with her peers thanks to her teachers going the distance to provide her with study material.Like Patil, many students from poor financial backgrounds would be unable to get an education during the lockdown if it wasn’t for extra efforts taken by their teachers.“Initially attended a few classes, however, I noticed that my family was struggling to make ends meet and I did not want to burden them further for internet access. My parents are daily-wage workers; we have not had any steady income since the lockdown has been implemented. The first week after classes began, I had to miss out on lectures one by one as my data pack got over too soon,” said Patil.After she shared her trouble with her teacher, she was provided with recorded videos of the online sessions and her teachers also offered to be available on call to solve any of her doubts.Nitin Barve, professor, BK Birla College, Kalyan, said, “It has been hardly a week since online classes commenced for college students, but we have noticed that many of them are facing connectivity issues. Moreover, there are a handful of students who are not able to attend lectures due to their financial situation; we have helped by paying for their internet charges.”Meanwhile, a Shahapur-based couple who teaches in a zilla parishad school is taking extra efforts to ensure students from Varyachapada village within Thane district, are getting an education. The internet connectivity is weak in this village as it is in a tribal area and most families do not have smartphones. With the commencement of online classes, Pramod Patole and his wife Sharmila prepared notes based on the syllabus and started visiting the homes of their students to provide the study material.“We gathered different explanation methods and easy-to-understand concepts for students of Class 1 to Class 5. We started taking printouts of these materials along with test papers as well. Twice a week, we visit the houses of the students to provide the materials and collect the previous test papers. These tests help us understand if the student can grasp the study material well,” said Patole.“The material has a lot of illustrations and pictures that make the information easier to understand. Moreover, teachers help solve doubts when they visit us. During every visit, the teacher brings a question paper based on the previous day’s teachings,” said Rishabh Pawar, a Class 3 student from Varyachapada Zilla Parishad School.Thane Municipal Corporation conducts online admission for civic schoolsThane Municipal Corporation’s (TMC) education department has shifted admissions online for the first time and is providing application forms on the civic body’s website. This has been introduced so that people need not step out of their homes for admissions.“We had already started our admission process before the lockdown began; we have now given this additional facility to those who may have missed out. Keeping in mind the current situation, we have gone online,” said Rajesh Kankal, education officer, TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-teachers-go-the-extra-mile-to-help-their-students/story-lD22uM6j3pfP905bGYFglL.html
20-07-2020||City||Woman tries to buy phone online, loses ₹1.66 lakh||The NRI Coastal police have booked six persons for duping a woman of ₹1.66 lakh in an online fraud.The woman was trying to purchase a mobile phone worth ₹40,000 online. She then got a call from six persons who posed as executives and duped her. According to police, the complainant Vaishali Patankar, 45, is a Navi Mumbai resident and works at Sion Hospital as a counsellor. On July 7, she chose a phone online and agreed to pay ₹40,000 for it along with the accessories. She spoke to a woman, who identified herself as Ashwini. On the same day, Patankar paid ₹10,000 and transferred ₹21,450 as customs charges the next day. On July 9, the accused convinced her to transfer the GST of ₹30,000.When Patankar told them that she has paid more than the amount for the phone, the accused promised to refund the extra money during the delivery. She further paid ₹23,700 for ‘state and local tax’ over the next two days. On July 10, she paid ₹15,700 for shipping charges and on July 13, another ₹11,990 for customs charges. Next day, they asked for ₹17,854 for GST again.“Patankar still paid the new GST charges and another ₹23,980 towards delivery charges. As the week passed and Patankar continued to pay the amount asked by the accused. She was later asked to ₹37,000 as a five-year insurance cover. This time, she told them she does not require insurance,” said an officer from NRI Coastal police station.The accused, however, told her they will close her file if she does not pay for insurance, which was mandatory. She then asked to cancel her order, but they further demanded ₹27,990 as refund charges, in their last attempt to dupe her. The woman did not pay the insurance and refund charges, realising this is a never ending con.She approached the police on Friday after collectively losing ₹1.66 lakh to the week-long fraud. The NRI Coastal police have registered a case of cheating against the six persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/woman-tries-to-buy-phone-online-loses-1-66-lakh/story-BQkUBGa2m2XIo8PPA3jAnL.html
20-07-2020||City||Farmers harried as Haryana govt withdraws subsidy on cotton crop insurance premium||Haryana cotton growers are a worried lot as their share of premium under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) has been increased from Rs 620 per acre to Rs 1,650 this time. This is the result of withdrawal of the subsidy Haryana provided on the premium. Under PMFBY guidelines, a farmer is required to pay 2% of the sum insured in case of kharif crop and 1.5% in case of rabi crop (5% for horticulture crop) as the premium and the balance is shared 50:50 by the state and the Centre. This year, farmers’ premium share under the government insurance scheme was hiked up to Rs 50 per acre for paddy, Rs 10 per acre for maize, Rs 40 per acre for bajra, Rs 1,030 per acre for cotton, Rs 8 per acre for barley and wheat, Rs 15 per acre each for gram and sunflower and Rs 130 per acre for mustard. Rajbir Sihag, a farmer from Bhiwani’s Miran, said he had paid Rs 2,480 as the premium for four acre of cotton crop last year, but this time, he had to cough up Rs 4,120 for the same area.“On one hand, the government is encouraging farmers to adopt non-water guzzling crops and on the other, it has increased the insurance premium for the cotton crop. We want the government to reduce the hiked amount. We have to invest a lot in cotton production and now, the Haryana government has put more financial burden on us by increasing the premium amount to Rs 1,030 per acre,” he added. Farm leader Ramandeep Singh Mann said the overall premium for the cotton crop has increased Rs 3,250 per hectare this time as compared to the last year. “It is quite unfortunate that the state government reduced its share in the premium for the cotton crop this time, due to which farmers will have to bear the brunt,” he added.Haryana agriculture joint director Jagraj Dandi agreed that the farmers’ share of premium for cotton crop under PMFBY has increased to Rs 1,030 per acre as the state government withdrew its 3% subsidy on the premium amount. “Cotton is a commercial crop and farmers are required to pay 5% of the sum insured as the premium. Earlier, the farmers were paying only 2% and the remaining 3% was being deposited by the Haryana government. This time, we have withdrawn 3% subsidy and the cotton farmers will have to pay 5% of the sum insured as the premium,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-harried-as-haryana-govt-withdraws-subsidy-on-cotton-crop-insurance-premium/story-NKio2KFHZSe07rvOFOjaCK.html
20-07-2020||City||For some Covid patients, cops fill in for their family||Amol Surve, a 39-year-old Ghodbunder resident who stays in Bangalore, was worried when his parents tested positive for Covid-19 back home. However, both his parents were admitted in hospital and taken care of by officers of Kasarvadavli police station, who also gave him timely updates about their health. Like Surve, many residents have lauded the efforts of the Thane Police to ensure the well-being of their loved ones, especially senior citizens and young children.Police officers in the commissionerate have helped the patients and their family members in various ways such as help them get admitted, keep a tab on their well-being, provide medicines, food and essentials. Residents said police officers have been going beyond the call of duty.Surve, whose parents stay in Patlipada area of Ghodubunder, said, “My parents, aged 66 and 72 years, tested positive 20 days ago. We don’t know the source of infection but I was worried about how they would manage alone. My mother was admitted in Vedant Hospital. Ever since they got admitted, Kasarvadvali police kept a check on their health. My father used to get calls every morning and evening from officers asking about his health and whether he needed anything, till the date he tested negative. We were really touched.”In another case, a 20-year-old woman, whose mother tested positive for Covid-19 and was admitted to a hospital, was staying alone at home in Diva. The woman, who did not wished to be named, said, “I was alone at home when my mother got admitted. Every day I used to get calls from Mumbra police officers. Once a woman officer also delivered medicine and food for me when I said there was nothing to cook at home. My mother was worried about me, but when I told her police were in touch with me, she was relaxed. “Police across the commissionerate in Thane, Kalyan and Bhiwandi are doing the needful and most residents have taken to twitter to thank then. Few senior citizens groups have sent thank you letters to Thane police for guiding them and helping those who were alone.In one such tweet, one user wrote, “@ThaneCityPolice such a wonderful gesture. Sandeep More from Bhiwandi Town (Kumbharwada) police station called and inquired about my family and my health, we talked in length and he also shared how Rajkumar Shinde DCP Zone 2 and Kokate (Sr PI) inquiring about our health.”Thane police commissioner Vivek Phansalkar said, “Our 35 police station officers are continuously taking care of people, solving their problems and simultaneously performing their duty. It is very important to help people on humanitarian ground.”Phansalkar added, “I am extremely proud of our officers who are going beyond their capacity and duty, from helping people to taking care of other Covid-19 warriors. There are 833 cops who have tested positive in Thane, but the others are working rigorously for the people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/for-some-covid-patients-cops-fill-in-for-their-family/story-znp31kDlh97ioRDlOoyXxN.html
20-07-2020||Mumbai||No easy route to recovery for patients: Fatigue even a month after discharge||Even as the city breached the one lakh Covid-19 cases mark on Saturday, its recovery rate is 70%, with over 67,000 patients recovering at home or recovered and back to their regular routine. For most, however, the side effects, ranging from physical to financial, continue.Several patients HT spoke to complained of continued weakness, body fatigue and heavy breathing. Others reported drastic or moderate weight loss. Lata Varghese, 69, a Vile Parle resident, who was discharged from the hospital on July 4, a week after getting admitted, said she continued to feel weak for 10 days after discharge. Varghese, a diabetic, was diagnosed with Covid-19 on June 28. “I was given medication while I stayed in the hospital and was also given vitamin tablets later, but I experienced weakness during the treatment and post discharge. However, with time, I am feeling better. We also had our follow-up with the doctor, who said my condition is improving. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has also called thrice to check on my health,” she said.She said besides fatigue, she suffers from shortness of breath. “I breathe heavily at times if I speak continuously. Along with me, my husband, who is 68, also tested positive and was home quarantined as he was asymptomatic. However, we don’t step out at all, not even to buy essentials. We get everything delivered at home,” she added.RajiKumar Nadar, 39, a Goregaon resident, who was involved in food distribution work for the needy, tested positive on June 12. “My symptoms were mild, so I opted for home quarantine. But I lost around 7kg of weight in over 45 days. My body felt weak. With time, my health is improving,” he said.Nadar, a martial arts trainer, said he has resumed normal life, but avoids going out. Sunil Sawant, 56, a Borivli resident, who works in a milk production company, tested positive mid-May. “I only had fever that went in the days after my treatment started. I got admitted and was also discharged by the end of May, after which I was home quarantined. Thankfully, I have not experienced any problem. I have also resumed work. My family members continue to go out for essential work, as we feel we have to live with the virus,” he said.Ankush Chiplunkar, 31, a fitness trainer, who tested positive mid-May, has recovered physically, but the pandemic had left him financially dry. “I didn’t face any symptoms after my discharge. But it has been four months that I have no earnings. After my treatment, I was badly in need of money. So I went back to my native place in Solapur. The government should allow opening of gyms and fitness clubs with precautions.”In Mumbai, the number of recovered patients has been going up. As of July 18, 70,492 patients had recovered, of the total 100,350 cases in the city. This means, the city’s recovery rate has gone up to 70%. From 25,152 on June 12, the number of recovered patients went up to 34,576 on June 23, and crossed the 67,000 mark mid-July, and 70,000 on Saturday.Dr Samrat Shah, consultant internist at city’s Bhatia Hospital, said, “While the vast majority who contract Covid-19 will make a full recovery, we are likely to see more people with pulmonary fibrosis or persistent lung damage, following acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by Covid-19.’’He said, “Many will be severely affected for some time following severe infection, and some will need oxygen at home. Meeting such people’s longer-term health and care needs will pose a significant challenge. Covid-19 may also cause other illnesses such as non-specific symptoms to impairment of kidneys, heart, gastrointestinal tract, nervous system and clotting system. Some effects could be partly caused by clots in the small blood vessels supplying these organs. There is also likely to be an impact on mental health.”Dr Shah said that post discharge advice for such patients is to continue chest physiotherapy, increase effort tolerance slowly, take medications as per the advice of doctor, which could be long-term oral steroids, inhalers, home oxygen, etc.“Although the lungs can recover from severe Covid-19, they can also sustain long-term damage of varying severity. It is important to watch out for the condition in people who suffer from severe Covid-19. An early study of people recovering from Covid-19 found that such damage also improves in the first few weeks after discharge from hospital,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-easy-route-to-recovery-for-patients-fatigue-even-a-month-after-discharge/story-MQGA9qFluhToHCyU704qjI.html
20-07-2020||City||Banker loses job, starts selling veggies||Having lost his job amid the Covid-19-induced lockdown, a 41-year-old banker from Kalyan is now forced to sell vegetables.Sachin Dhiware, a resident of Yogidham, Kalyan (West), lost his job on May 20 after working in a bank for over a decade. Dhiware, the only earning member in the family, then started selling mangoes for a living, during the summer months.“Despite being one of the best performers, I lost my job. I have to run the household and pay loans too. So, I started selling mangoes in the area. Post-summer, I planned on setting up the business of selling clean and fresh vegetables,” said Dhiware, who is a father of two children, aged eight and two, respectively.Dhiware met farmers, inquired about rates and also visited several markets. He also involved his three friends to join in.“I couldn’t manage the business alone, hence I asked my friends to join me. As soon as I opened a shop in my locality, immediately the civic body imposed a strict lockdown from July 2,” added Dhiware.However, due to the lockdown, there was a shortage in the vegetable supply in the locality. Dhiware then started the home delivery of vegetables. “Our team managed to deliver vegetables to around 30 people in the area, in last two days,” he said.Sneha Mahadik, a resident of Yogidham, Kalyan (West), said, “For almost 10 days there was no supply of vegetables as the vendors were not allowed to enter the premises. The only way out for residents was to order online. Dhiware’s service came to our rescue.”The team took the help of social media to spread the word about the business and managed to get customers for home deliveries. “Due to limitations on transportation we are selling the vegetables in one locality only. Though there is an uncertainty in this business, my target is to earn at least ₹3,000 a day so that I can keep up with the lifestyle which we had,” said Dhiware.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/banker-loses-job-starts-selling-veggies/story-FaSb6oVm7YnQP8FM3ZAKeN.html

20-07-2020||Mumbai||Some think coronavirus will go away by building temple: Pawar||The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Sunday taunted the Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi over news reports that the latter is going for ground breaking ceremony of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya in first week of August. Pawar said that some people may be of the opinion that the coronavirus will go away by building temple, hence such an event might have been scheduled. He said that for them (NCP) tackling coronavirus is more important as it is impacting the economy of the country as well small businesses. The NCP chief also said that they want the state and Central government to focus more on the existing health crisis.“For us, working to bring out people from the coronavirus crisis is more important. Some people may be of the view that the virus will go away by building the temple, and with that sentiment such programme might have been scheduled. I don’t know the exact reason behind this,” Pawar said in a press conference in Solapur. The NCP chief, however, did not named anyone in particular. “For us fighting the coronavirus crisis is more important as it is leading to lockdown that is impacting the economy, small businesses and others. We want the state and Central government to focus more on the existing health crisis,” the veteran leader said.The BJP slammed this jibe saying there was no need for cheap politics as Ram Mandir was about faith of millions of Hindus.“Everyone knows that Covid-19 is not going to go away by building of the Ram Mandir. They should focus on their state. Is coronavirus going to go away by buying expensive cars for their ministers, by not giving farmers loan waiver or black marketing of ₹20 masks for ₹200. There is no need for this cheap politics, Mandir is about the faith of millions of Hindus,” said BJP leader and former minister Sudhir Mungantiwar. The Shiv Sena, however, has welcomed the finalisation of the foundation laying ceremony date and said that it is not bothered whether party leaders are invited or not.Sena’s south Mumbai member of parliament (MP) and former Union minister Arvind Sawant said that the issue over invitation should not be politicised. “I do not know if there is any invitation or not. If it comes, Uddhavji will decide whether to go or not. For us, the Ram Mandir is a matter of happiness, therefore if we are invited or not invited is not a matter of respect or disrespect. We are directly connected to Lord Ram and Ayodhya,” he said, while speaking to a regional news channel.Sawant added that Shiv Sena is associated with the Ram Mandir movement since the beginning and its contribution is equally important. “How would we know if they (the organisers) would invite us or not? It depends on them (organisers). Lord Ram is a matter of faith, there is no need to give it a political colour. Bear in mind that we are the ones involved in laying the foundation for the Ram Mandir. The sadhus of Akhadas were fighting a legal battle, and [our contribution] is equally important,” he said.The parliamentarian added that Shiv Sena president and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray visited Ayodhya and also donated Rs 5 crore to the temple trust for the construction of Ram Temple. The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust on Saturday forwarded tentative dates — August 3 and 5 — for Ayodhya temple’s bhoomi pujan to the Prime Minister’s office. The decision was taken in a meeting called by the trust.Some reports also suggests that the Prime Minister is going to attend the ceremony on August 5.The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust was formed in February on the direction of the Supreme Court.In November last year, the Supreme Court had ruled that the then disputed land in Ayodhya would be given to a government-run trust for building a Ram Mandir and Muslims be given a five-acre suitable plot elsewhere in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/some-think-coronavirus-will-go-away-by-building-temple-pawar/story-EeljleW1v6pOibqjycoA5O.html
20-07-2020||Mumbai||2 booked for sending rape threats to actor||The Mumbai Police registered a first information report (FIR) against two unknown Instagram account holders for sending obscene messages and threats to actor Rhea Chakraborty.On July 16, Chakraborty shared a screenshot of message that she received on Instagram where the users threatened to get her raped and killed. This comes as she is being blamed for actor Sushant Singh Rajpur’s death and many social media users accused her for using Rajput.She posted, “I was called a gold-digger…I kept quiet. I was called a murderer...I kept quiet. I was slut shamed....I kept quiet. But how does my silence give you the right to tell me that you will get me RAPED and MURDERED if I don’t commit suicide @mannu_raaut?”“Do you realise the seriousness of what you have said? These are crimes, and by law, no one, I repeat NO ONE, should be subjected to this kind of toxicity and harassment. I request @cyber_crime_helpline @cybercrimeindia to please take necessary action. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH,” she commented through her a post on Instagram.Following this, Rhea visited Santacruz police station and lodged a complaint against the accused on Saturday evening.Abhishek Trimukhe, deputy commissioner of police, zone-9, said, “On complaint of Rhea Chakravarty, an offence is registered at Santacruz police station against two Instagram account holders for sending obscene messages and threatening her.”Police registered a case under sections 507 (criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication), 509 (word, sound or gesture intending to insult the modesty of woman) of the Indian Penal Code and section 67 (publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of the Information Technology Act.Sources from Santacruz police station revealed, “We have written a letter to Instagram and sought details of the Instagram user who sent her the obscene messages and threat.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-booked-for-sending-rape-threats-to-actor/story-n59punYYtAcGHVKAfpdRGL.html
20-07-2020||Mumbai||City sees 89% spike in deaths in May||Contrary to the trends in March and April, the city saw a total of 12,963 deaths (both Covid and non-Covid) in May, 89% more than the 6,832 deaths recorded in May 2019, leading to questions from the Opposition as well as experts if all Covid-19 patients are being identified and whether a lot of the unidentified patients have died at home. Municipal commissioner IS Chahal, however, attributed the surge to the higher influx of patients to the city, reconciliation of figures and the Covid-19 cremation protocol.According to the state figures, Mumbai recorded 989 Covid-19 deaths in May. On June 16, the government added 862 backlogged deaths to the Covid-19 toll, of which some had occurred in May. Similarly, until July 3, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) added 751 backlogged deaths, some of which were from May, to the toll. However, even if one were to deduct the backlogged figures, the number of total deaths reported in Mumbai in May would remain significantly higher than the May 2019 figure.In March, the city saw 5,669 deaths, against the 7,155 deaths reported in the same month last year. Similarly, 5,536 deaths were registered in Mumbai in April, a decline from the 6,752 deaths recorded in April 2019.The data raises questions over the possible reasons for the increase in fatalities in the city, with some even alleging the city is witnessing a higher number of Covid-19 deaths than what are being registered. “When Covid-19 patients from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region or other parts of Maharashtra such as Ahmednagar, Jalgaon or Nashik were shifted to Mumbai for treatment during April, May and June, they were registered as Covid-19 cases in their respective hometowns. But if the patient died, he/she had to be cremated in Mumbai owing to the strict protocol for Covid-19 deaths and the patient’s death was counted in Mumbai. This was not the case before the Covid-19 outbreak, but now we have to abide by the safety norms,” said Chahal.The civic commissioner said 12,000-plus death toll in May comes from the crematorium records. “Our death records are not as per the Indian Council of Medical Research website, but from the crematorium records. I can give an example of a former Member of Parliament who the BMC airlifted from his hometown after he tested positive [for Covid-19]. He died during treatment in Mumbai and was cremated at the Chandanwadi crematorium. If you search for his name in ICMRs’s records, he will be registered as a Covid patient in his hometown, but his death is registered here,” said Chahal.Chahal, while pointing at the example of Sion hospital, said 54% of deaths at the hospital in May and June are of patients from other cities.“It seems logical that these death figures show there are undiscovered Covid-19 patients, whose deaths were attributed to other causes as they were not known to be positive. But even if that’s the case, why are the numbers high in May, and not in April and March, when our testing capacity was lower. It is still unclear,” said a senior doctor working with the Maharashtra government.Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the task force of nine doctors appointed by the state in April to control the fatality rate in Maharashtra, said, “My feeling is March deaths and April deaths got pulled into May, which is why we see an artificial rise in May. Partly, the Covid-19 factor is also responsible. I do not agree that unidentified Covid-19 patients who died at their homes were counted as non-Covid deaths. Because of the lockdown, a lot of non-Covid patients, suffering from hypertension, diabetes, heart and other ailments did not access medical care in March and April and probably died in May.”Dr Joshi said such a trend was also witnessed in New York. “A lot of heart patients, who were not Covid-19 patients, died at home because they could not access healthcare as they were scared to visit hospitals. It is time the government focused equally on non-Covid healthcare, too,” he said.Public health expert Dr Sanjay Pattiwar said many elective surgeries in March and April were deferred and some patients, who were scheduled for surgery, subsequently died in May.Earlier this month, leader of the Opposition in Assembly, Devendra Fadnavis, alleged the government has not accounted for around 600 Covid-19 deaths of patients who died outside hospitals.Earlier this week, Chahal told HT that BMC has initiated an investigation to find out the number of patients who died at home. “In March and April, test results were delayed by many days. A patient who gave his swab on April 14 got his result on April 22. He died before the test result came. Such deaths will also be examined and counted as Covid-19 deaths now,” the municipal commissioner said.On Sunday, Mumbai recorded 1,037 new cases and 64 deaths. The total number of Covid-19 cases in the city now stands at 101,388, even as the toll reached 5,714. Currently, the city has 23,697 active Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/city-sees-89-spike-in-deaths-in-may/story-B94w4EHv2BxtWhQsOL4RNJ.html

The non-hot spot zones will be controlled by ward officers and police department in order to ensure there is no crowding or violation of social distancing,” said Vijay Suryavanshi, commissioner, KDMC.​In order to keep track of home-isolated asymptomatic patients, KDMC has set up a call centre through which patients are called for feedback. If urgent attention is required, the call centre connects to the health department. Around 70,000 calls have been made throughout the week.Lockdown didn’t show any major impact in Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation where the cases continued to rise. A total of 4,100 cases have been reported in Navi Mumbai during the 16-day lockdown period announced by NMMC first from July 3 to July 13 midnight and then the extension to July 19 midnight.

20-07-2020||Mumbai||HC refuses relief to institute seeking ₹42-L penalty waiver||In a setback to a Pune-based polytechnic institute, the Bombay high court (HC) has directed its management to pay ₹42.62 lakh as penalty, imposed by the Directorate of Technical Education (DTE), for admitting 150 students without the approval of the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), in 2007.The institute, which was established in 1993, initially recovered ₹21,000 as fees from students and admitted them. As per the rules, the college had to pay 200% of the tuition fee recovered from students as penalty to DTE for admitting the 150 students, which the institute did. However, as the final fee recovered by the college was ₹35,875, for each student, DTE demanded that the institute pay an additional ₹42 lakh as penalty. Aggrieved by the increased penalty, the institute approached the HC. However, the court observed that DTE exercised its right to recover the penalty on the entire amount collected as fees by the institute and hence rejected the institute’s claim to quash the demand of ₹42 lakh.A division bench of justice SS Shinde and VG Bisht, while hearing a petition filed by Sinhgad Technical Institution Society, was informed by senior advocate VP Sawant that the society ran a polytechnic institute by the name Venutai Chavan Polytechnic at Pune. In 2007, based on a government resolution to allow polytechnic institutes to run second shifts, the college had applied to the state authorities concerned for approval. The state had recommended the commencement of the second shift, and as the institute fulfilled the minimum eligibility criteria laid down by AICTE, the institute’s application for permission was forwarded to the apex body too.Even as the approval from AICTE was awaited, the admission process had started, and under the assumption that the AICTE would grant its approval, the institute admitted 150 students and recovered ₹21,000 as the fee amount prescribed by the Shikshan Shulk Samiti (SSS) for new institutes from the students and informed that they would have to pay additional fees when the final approval was received by SSS. The final amount recovered as fees was Rs 35,875.As the institute had admitted students before receiving all approvals, DTE recovered a penalty of ₹62 lakh from the institute to regularise the students based on the ₹21,000 collected towards tuition fees. However, after the final fee was fixed at ₹35,875, DTE demanded an additional penalty of ₹42 lakhs as per rules. Aggrieved by the additional penalty demand, the institute approached the HC seeking a declaration that the institute was not to pay in excess of ₹62 lakh as penalty.Additional government pleader Manish Pabale, however, argued that as the institute had recovered ₹35,785 as fees for academic year 2007-08, as per the rules, the institute had to pay 200% penalty for admitting students without getting approvals, and hence DTE was right in making the additional demand. He further added that the ₹21,000 fee was meant for new institutes and as the Sinhgad institute was established in 1993 they could not claim benefit of the same.After hearing the submissions, the court observed that there was nothing perverse in DTE’s demand and that it was justified. Hence, the court rejected the petition of the institute and allowed DTE to recover the penalty from the institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-refuses-relief-to-institute-seeking-42-l-penalty-waiver/story-oEJsxpcBU4B6DxCMuLWpAN.html

20-07-2020||Mumbai||Record 9,518 fresh cases take Maharashtra Covid-19 tally to 310,455||A day after crossing the grim 300,000 Covid-19 cases mark, Maharashtra on Sunday recorded its sharpest single-day jump of 9,518 infections, first in excess of 9,000, taking the tally to 310,455. It also recorded 258 more fatalities, taking the death toll to 11,854. Amid continued complaints of inflated private hospital bills, state health minister Rajesh Tope said that independent auditors have been appointed to verify bills of Covid-19 patients treated in private hospitals. The state breached the 9,000 mark in daily cases for the first time after clocking over 8,000 cases on each of the past three days. The number of active cases in the state now stands at 169,569 with 3,906 patients discharged on Sunday.Mumbai recorded 1,038 new cases to push the city’s tally to 101,388. The city also added 64 fatalities that took the death toll to 5714. The cities in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), excluding Mumbai, contributed to 39% of the cases recorded on Sunday. The eight municipal corporations, excluding Mumbai, and three districts that fall in MMR added 2,751 new cases with Kalyan-Dombivli recording 495 cases. Kalyan-Dombivli is the worst affected in MMR with 18,115 cases, followed by Thane city and Thane district at 332 and 348 new cases, which pushed their respective tallies to 17,226 and 10,503. Vasai-Virar recorded 276 new cases, while Navi Mumbai recorded 298 new Covid-19 cases. Ulhasnagar added 198 new cases, while Mira-Bhayander added 135 fresh infections.On the “inflated” hospital bills, Tope, in a tweet on Sunday, said, “The bill of the patients admitted for Covid-19 will only be given to them after it is inspected by an auditor. For that, independent auditors have been appointed for all private hospitals.” He had gone to Solapur [city with the highest Covid-19 case fatality rate (CFR)] to take stock of the Covid-19 situation on Sunday, along with NCP chief Sharad Pawar. At a press conference in Solapur, he was asked about the continued complaints by patients of being overcharged by private hospitals. “For the bills management, we requisitioned 80% beds in private hospitals for Covid-19 patients. We have also capped charges at Rs4,500 for non-ICU bed and Rs7,500 for ICU ones. These are package rates, including for tests, etc; no hidden charges. Besides, 1,000 hospitals under Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana provide free treatment,” he said.The minister or the government have so far not outlined what action it would take against the private hospital if found guilty of overcharging. In June, the NCP chief had first raised concern over overcharging by private hospitals for Covid-19 treatment. Pawar raising the issue gained significance as the health department was with the NCP. Subsequently, earlier this month Tope said that the state government would appoint auditors to look into the complaints of inflated bills.Besides MMR, Pune recorded 1,812 new cases and 25 fatalities on Sunday, while its neighbouring Pimpri-Chinchwad reported 851 new cases to cross the 10,000-mark to 10,507 confirmed cases. Pimpri-Chinchwad also reported 15 fatalities. Pune crossed 1,000 fatalities on Sunday as its death toll rose to 1,019. Nashik city breached the 6,000-mark with 471 new cases, taking the tally 6,015; it also recorded 10 deaths.Solapur city, another hotspot in the state, has the government and the administration worried with its high CFR. With 334 fatalities, Solapur city has a CFR of 8.63%, which is the highest in the state. The city recorded 71 new cases, that took its tally to 3,867.Tope visited Solapur to review the situation and said that he has directed the local civic body to expand the institutional quarantine facility to segregate asymptomatic Covid-19 positive patients from densely populated areas. Speaking to reporters in Solapur, the minister also said that he has directed authorities to increase the number of beds with oxygen supply.“There would not be any shortage of hospital beds. I have instructed authorities to ramp up the infrastructure. I have also stressed on the need for institutional quarantine facilities to remove patients from densely populated areas. Additional beds with oxygen supply will be added in the next 15 days,” he said adding that these measures will help bring down the high CFR. The minister added that the state government has increased testing across the state, including in Solapur. He said that around 10,000 antigen tests will be carried out in Solapur in the coming weeks. Senior health department officials said that the antigen test, which provides faster results in comparison to the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test, will helpo curb the spread of the virus in the city.Tope reiterated the state government’s plan to start plasma therapy across all districts in the state. He said, “Plasma therapy has yielded positive results and there are many success stories and we want to start it in other parts of the state. The therapy would start in 18 medical college hospitals in the state soon.”So far, Maharashtra has carried out 15,64,129 tests and has an overall positivity rate (19.85%) for Covid-19. Currently, 754,370 people have been put under home quarantine and 45,846 people are in institutional quarantine, the state health department data said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/record-9-518-fresh-cases-take-maha-covid-19-tally-to-310-455/story-roR7cvXdcWJVLhcTgF2o2H.html

20-07-2020||Mumbai||Chandrapur airport project clearance stalled over tiger corridor concerns||The construction of the Chandrapur greenfield airport has hit a hurdle after the nodal officer of the Maharashtra forest department stalled clearances for the project recently over concerns for the tiger population in the area.The Maharashtra Airport Development Corporation (MADC), appointed by the state government in 2018 as the nodal agency to develop Vidarbha’s first greenfield airport catering to Q-400, A-320, and smaller aircraft, said that combined with Covid-19 related issues, stalling the project would mean an overall delay of 10 months for basic execution.Located at Murti village, 32km from Chaprala Wildlife Sanctuary, 38km from the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) buffer, and 26km away from to the proposed 265 sqkm Kanhargaon wildlife sanctuary (KWS) in Gondpipri tehsil, the proposed airport across 340 hectares (ha) would lead to the destruction of 3,817 trees and diversion of 75 hectares (ha) of forest land. The area is part of a tiger corridor identified by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun.The decision to defer the clearances was based on a report by WII, which stated that the project may affect the connectivity of a tiger corridor and lead to an increase in human-animal conflict. “The proposed site is within the critical habitat and connectivity corridors of tigers. The present site may or shall not be considered for the construction of the proposed airport,” the report had said.Sanjeev Gaur, additional principal chief conservator of forest, and nodal officer, Maharashtra, said, “There is no question of issuing clearance at the moment. We have asked MADC to submit responses regarding any alternative site for the airport, and whether the mitigation measures suggested by WII, including the financial and administrative implications, are acceptable to MADC, and to what extent. Based on their response, we will appraise the Maharashtra government and the Centre correctly about the project and its impacts. As of now, it remains deferred.”HT had reported on June 29 that the Chandrapur forest department had recommended clearance for the project, while MADC claimed that they had already received stage-1 clearance (state’s nod) under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. However, the forest department clarified this. “I only received the proposal in the first week of July. Stage-1 clearance can only be granted once approval is issued by the state government,” said Gaur.MADC said a review of the entire project was underway. “There are no other alternative options for the airport as other areas are either already protected as sanctuaries, or have mines located close to them. This site, among four others, was chosen after considering all options,” said Gaurav Upshyam, senior manager (regional connectivity scheme), MADC. “A decision regarding acceptance of proposed mitigation measures will be taken by the state and MADC board. Details regarding feasibility, funds for each measure, and source of funding are being worked out. Once we have clarity, the revised proposal will be submitted to the forest department. An overall delay of five months has happened, another five months is expected.”Chandrapur district is home to around 170 of the state’s 312 tigers. WII’s report identified the presence of 12 tigers in a 20-30km radius around the proposed airport site, between Rajura reserved forest and KWS. There are 15 tigers and at least 23 leopards in KWS, which received the state wildlife board’s nod in December 2018 to be declared a sanctuary. The final notification is awaited.Among other mitigation measures, MADC has been asked to undertake the restoration of 17 forest patches with mixed plantations to ensure corridor connectivity. Overall cost of mitigation measures are yet to be determined by WII. The total project cost for the airport is ₹300 crore.“The best mitigation measure is to avoid the project in this area. Remaining mitigation measures are suggested in our report,” said Bilal Habib, WII scientist and author of the report.WHAT WII FOUNDThe Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, which studied the wildlife impact of the project, said the airport would hamper the corridor connectivity and enhance human-wildlife conflict. “The proposed airport site is well known for the wildlife value, especially for tiger conservation and its importance as a connecting corridor. Hence, the present site may or shall not be considered for the construction of the airport,” the report said.In case there is no alternative site for the proposed airport, the project may be constructed after undertaking the following mitigation measures:· Realigning the airport boundary· Restoration and strengthening of existing wildlife habitat along the corridor· Minimising likely impact of peripheral lights and noise levels· Minimising occurrence of food resource for wild animals in the boundary of the airport· Building underpasses and overpasses across roads passing through the existing corridor· Minimising extent of increased disturbance with this development within the landscape· Forest patches include private forests that need to be acquired· Undertake restoration of 17 forest patches to ensure connectivity of the corridor· Wildlife corridor usage to be monitored during the construction phase and for the next five years· MADC to accept any mid-term mitigation measure during construction and after airport by WII· A committee to monitor the compliance of suggested mitigation measures.· Overall cost of mitigation measures are yet to be determined by WII.(Source: Wildlife Study for Chandrapur Greenfield Airport by Wildlife Institute of India)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/chandrapur-airport-project-clearance-stalled-over-tiger-corridor-concerns/story-BVUo8oQlLo6JfhW2GoUs7K.html
20-07-2020||City||Magisterial probe ordered into body swap of two Covid victims at Amritsar hospital||A day after bodies of two COVID-19 patients got swapped at Amritsar’s Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), the authorities have launched a magisterial probe into the matter. The GMCH officials have also written a letter to state medical education and research department for suspending four staff members of the hospital for negligence in handling the bodies.Amritsar sub-divisional magistrate Shivraj Singh Bal will conduct the inquiry. On Saturday, a 37-year-old woman of Damganj area of Amritsar had died of Covid-19 at the GMCH. Soon after her death, her body was sent to mortuary and authorities were told to pack her body in the personal protection equipment (PPE) kit before handling the body to her family members.The same day, a 92-year-old man of Hoshiarpur district, who was also undergoing treatment at the GMCH, died and his body was sent to mortuary. The hospital authorities, after packing the bodies in PPE kits, put wrong labels on the caskets.On July 16, a 92-year-old man of Hoshiarpur district, who was also undergoing treatment at the GMCH, died and his body was sent to mortuary. The hospital authorities, after packing the bodies in PPE kit, put wrong labels on the caskets. The body of the Amritsar woman was packed and sent to Hoshiarpur in an ambulance and the body of Hoshiarpur man was sent to family members of the woman. Since bodies were packed in PPE kit and were kept in a box, no one checked it, unless the bodies were taken for cremation.Unknowingly, the family members of the woman had cremated the Hoshiarpur man on Saturday. This happened as hospital authorities put wrong name labels on the caskets.After the hospital authorities decided to suspend two staff nurses of the hospital and two class-4 employees, the staff members of the hospital raised objections.Narinder Kumar, president of class-4 employees’ union, said: “The doctors have the responsibility of handling the bodies to their families and this is not the assigned duty of staff nurses and class-4 employees. The doctors are responsible for this negligence and the matter should be probed by the higher officials. If the staff members will be suspended without any reason, the nursing and class-4 employees will boycott their duties in GMC Amritsar and Patiala.” A GMC doctor, requesting anonymity, said, “Body of the woman was brought back to GMCH and her family members were called for identification of the body. The family identified her and complained that her body had been damaged. Also, a gold ring and earring of the woman was missing from her body. The cremation of a woman held on Sunday by her family.” NO BODY MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE AT GMCAs per the guidelines of Punjab government, a body management committee was to be formed in state GMCs to handle bodies of Covid-19 victims, but no such committee was formed at the Amritsar GMCH.“The committee should have been formed to pack the bodies in PPE kits and to put tags on it. The government had asked to make a committee with doctors of the medicine department of GMC, staff nurses and class-4 employees, but to no avail,” said a GMC doctor, requesting anonymity.GMC principal Dr Rajiv Devgan was unavailable for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/magisterial-probe-ordered-into-body-swap-of-two-covid-victims-at-amritsar-hospital/story-Sb4bncFz3TVO6uWmfL0cCM.html
20-07-2020||City||Punjab govt launches probe into recruitment irregularities at PTU||The Punjab government has launched a probe into the alleged irregularities in recruitments at Inder Kumar Gujral Punjab Technical University (IKG-PTU), Jalandhar. As per information, the technical education department had received a complaint from the technical teachers’ welfare organisation, stating that IKG-PTU vice-chancellor (V-C) Prof Ajay Kumar Sharma had illegally appointed his close aides to various posts at the university. It was further alleged that even the selection committee consisted of his close friends. The deputy director of the state technical education department issued a letter (documents with Hindustan Times) on July 16, stating that the board of governors’ chairman SK Salwan and vice-chairman Anurag Verma, who is also the technical education principal secretary, have decided to constitute a fact-finding committee to look into this matter. The committee comprises Guru Nanak Dev University V-C Jaspal Singh Sandhu and former GNDU V-C Jairoop Singh. ‘APPOINTMENTS DONE THROUGH PVT AGENCY’It was further stated that the V-C had appointed 150 persons, mostly from Himachal Pradesh, on contract basis by relaxing the norms. The recruitments were done through a private manpower agency after terminating the contract of an agency manned by the state government. The complainants stated that nearly 110 persons have been appointed as guest faculty with a fixed salary of Rs. 60,000 and paid leave even as guest faculty members are usually paid on an hourly or lecture basis with a remuneration of not more than Rs. 30,000 a month. “The V-C conducted the interview for the post of dean-cum-Professor at NIT Jalandhar in March this year. Some of the candidates were declared ineligible after which they staged a protest. But a few days before the interview, they were made eligible for the post which shows the corruption in the system. No representative of the government was part of the interview panel, which leaves no doubt that the interview was a parody,” the complaint read.‘IRREGULARITIES EVEN IN HIRING OF SECURITY MEN’Another complaint was filed by Hoshiarpur resident Arsh Kamal Singh Saini to the Prime Minister of India. The letter, later received by the Punjab technical education department, stated that PTU had been recruiting security personnel through a private company, SIS, even as the rules state that the recruitments have to be done through the government agency ‘PESCO’ (Punjab Ex-Servicemen Corporation). “The V-C wanted to please a private company for his personal gains and use this company as a platform to make appointments of his close ones,” Kamal had stated in the complaint. ‘V-C GOT HIMSELF A LAVISH OFFICE’It was further stated that even though the V-C already had an attractive office, he shifted to a new one, which cost the university more than a crore. Besides, the administrative officers of the varsity are provided free conveyance, which puts a financial strain on the university.ATTEMPT TO MALIGN OUR IMAGE: VARISTY OFFICIALWhen contacted, IKG-PTU spokesperson Rajneesh Sharma said, “This is an unprecedented attempt by anti-university and anti-government elements to malign the image of the university. The university already inquired about the identity of the complainant but no person of this name has been found on the mentioned address.” He further added, “The matter has already been clarified to the Punjab government through the department of technical education and industrial training. The university will provide support to every official or committee in terms of clarification on this,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-govt-launches-probe-into-recruitment-irregularities-at-ptu/story-3vG0d8hSro65SIkxI4Tb8L.html
20-07-2020||Mumbai||Male tiger captured after killing 3 people in Chandrapur||A three-year-old male tiger (NT-1) was tranquilised and captured by the forest department at Talodi range, Brahmapuri forest division in Chandrapur on Sunday evening. Forest officials said the tiger was responsible for the death of three people over the past month. The latest death was reported on Saturday evening, near Visapur village. The state chief wildlife warden (PCCF) issued orders to capture the tiger on Sunday morning, and the animal was darted at 5.45pm. After a medical examination, the tiger will be transported to the Gorewada Rescue Centre in Nagpur and kept in captivity for the time being.“There was a threat to the safety of human life if the tiger was not captured immediately,” said Nitin Kakodkar, PCCF (Wildlife). Kulraj Singh, deputy conservator of forest, Brahmapuri said the first two kills were reported on June 18 and July 4 in Nagbhid range. “Attacks were at farmlands adjoining forests. A decision on releasing the tiger will be taken later.”The incident comes five days after another sub-adult tigress was tranquilised at a rice mill in Sindevahi town in Chandrapur on July 14 but released soon after at an undisclosed location.So far, four tigers, involved in the conflict, have been captured by the forest department this year. The first case was in May when a tiger from Brahmapuri was captured in Gondia, said to have killed four people across two forest divisions. The next two cases were in June where a sub-adult male tiger that killed five people between February and June, was captured from the buffer area of Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve, and an adult tigress that had entered a house in Nagbhid range of Brahmapuri was captured on June 22. Both tigers captured in June died at the rescue centre, one due to old age and the other due to septicaemia. HT had reported on June 12 that the state chief wildlife warden had warned of increasing human-animal conflict cases in Chandrapur, which is home to over 170 of 312 tigers in Maharashtra. There have been 27 human deaths reported due to tiger attacks between January and July this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/male-tiger-captured-after-killing-3-people-in-chandrapur/story-2Jets5bR78ic9shDY0qN6N.html
20-07-2020||Delhi||Covid19: Delhi govt to add 600 more ICU beds by month end||The Delhi government is set to add at least another 600 intensive care unit (ICU) beds in three Covid-dedicated hospitals by the end of this month as part of its healthcare augmentation plan, a senior government official said on Sunday.“A detailed plan has been drafted for adding more than 600 ICU beds in Covid hospitals under the Delhi government by July 31,” said the senior government official.As of Sunday, Delhi had 2,166 ICU beds in Covid dedicated hospitals — both private (115 hospitals) and government (11). Of the total ICU beds, at least 555 were in three Delhi government hospitals --- Lok Nayak Hospital, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital. “The capacity of ICU beds will be increased in these hospitals. Once the new beds are added, the total ICU beds in these three Delhi government hospitals will be more than 1,155,” the official said.On June 8, Delhi hospitals – both private and government -- collectively offered a total of 582 ICU beds. The numbers have more than tripled since then, as the government roped in more private hospitals for Covid management and increased ICU beds in existing hospitals.Gagan D Bharti, manager of Charity Beds, a non-profit organisation that has been helping people in Delhi avail beds during the pandemic, said: “Delhi needs more ICU beds because only severe Covid cases are landing in the hospitals and a large number of them would potentially need ICU.”Dr Puneet Misra, professor in the community medicines department of AIIMS-Delhi, said: “At this juncture, the government should focus on reducing the Covid-19 mortality rate. For that, supportive treatment is necessary. ICU counts as supportive treatment. But it is essential to ensure that there is adequate number of trained doctors and healthcare workers who work in the ICUs. Handling patients in ICUs need special training. In Delhi, there was always a shortage of ICUs. The augmentation should be permanent in nature not just to handle Covid. It should be extended for regular medical emergencies also.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-add-600-more-icu-beds-by-month-end/story-MCbU6R22eWQfx2y7RzGo9H.html
20-07-2020||Delhi||Hutments washed away in overflowing drain near ITO; dramatic video goes viral||Over half-a-dozen hutments were swept away, portion of an under-construction building of the World Health Organisation (WHO) was submerged and drain water spilled on to the Ring Road, IP Marg and the stretch near Vikas Bhawan after heavy morning rain on Sunday caused a stormwater drain to overflow near ITO in Central Delhi, the police said. The force of the overflowing water was such that it took less than a minute for the jhuggis located along the banks of the drain to be swept away. On social media, videos of the incident were shared widely.Police said no lives were lost in flooding but several pet animals were swept away and a 36-year-old man narrowly escaped getting washed away with the water. “The children of our slum raised an alarm in the nick of time, because of which we were able to escape from our houses,” said Vishal, one of those whose houses were destroyed.The traffic police had to divert vehicles on the affected nearby roads to other routes such as Vikas Marg, Bhairon Road and towards Akshardham. The drain, known as Sen Nursing Home Drain, comes under the jurisdiction of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation. On one side of the drain is a slum, Anna Nagar, while an under-construction building of the WHO is located on the other side. Anna Nagar has a mixed population of South and North Indians and most of them do odd jobs. The two sides of the drain, whose banks are cemented, are connected by an iron bridge. Vishal, who goes by a single name, said the drain overflows every monsoon in the last four decades, but it never did any damage. “We were relaxed on Sunday morning as well despite it raining heavily,” said Vishal. But around 8.15 am, the residents heard cries of local children and rushed out to see the water breaching the cemented banks, right along which many jhuggis had been erected. “We had barely managed to make it out when our houses were swept away. My motorcycle got washed away and others also lost their two-wheelers. One of my goats died while another was rescued by the fire officers,” said Vishal, a flower seller. While people managed to rush out in the nick of time, a man named Santosh Bhura happened to be carried away with the water current. “He had decided to stay in bed longer since it was a Sunday. When be tried to get out of the house, the wooden doors and windows collapsed on him. But our neighbours managed to rescue him,” said Anita, Bhura’s wife. The local residents blamed the construction of the WHO building on the other side of the drain for the mishap. “The basement parking lot they are constructing led to the incident. It weakened the soil below,” alleged Padam Kumar, one of the affected slum dwellers. Officials of the Delhi Jal Board (DJB), who inspected the site, also said that the construction had some role to play in the mishap. “A team of DJB officials inspected the site where NBCC was executing digging work. It appeared that the NBCC had dug up the site too deep, which weakened the foundation of the shanties that got washed away in the heavy flow of water. The matter does not involve the Jal Board,” said a spokesperson for the DJB.But NBCC officials said they had been following all norms and constructing as per approval of the SDMC. “This is a low lying area and we have often told the authorities about water overflow in the drain. The DJB had been cooperative all along and they would use motors to flush out the water, but the drain would never be cleaned or desilted. That caused the problem on Sunday,” said an official who didn’t want to be identified. Sanjay Bhatia, deputy commissioner of police (central district), said that there was no evidence so far of any negligence in the construction of the WHO building. No police case has been registered either. As the drain water began overflowing on Sunday morning, about two dozen workers constructing the three-level basement parking of the WHO building -- on a 7,000 square meter plot -- left the place. “The force of the water was so tremendous that it destroyed all barricades we had set up and submerged the entire parking lot that is about 12 metres deep. There is about 25 lakh cubic feet water in our premises now,” said the NBCC official. A SDMC spokesperson, meanwhile, said that the agency has deployed three super sucker machines with eighteen tankers, one suction-cum-jetting machines and two pumps on the spot to drain out the water. A team of the NDRF too waited on stand-by in case there was anyone trapped in the water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hutments-washed-away-in-overflowing-drain-near-ito-dramatic-video-goes-viral/story-GL10hFijaQ9FlgjncYV89N.html
20-07-2020||Delhi||Waterlogged since 1950s: Why Minto Bridge is Delhi’s flooding constant||In a news report published in July 1958 in Hindustan Times, then municipal commissioner of Delhi PR Nayak said they have installed pump sets to prevent waterlogging under the Minto Bridge. The measure was undertaken as part of anti-flooding measures suggested by the Reddi Committee.Sixty-two years later, the civic agencies are yet to find a solution to the annual monsoon flooding of the railway underbridge, which according to late historian and chronicler of Delhi RV Smith, was built in 1933. A short but heavy spell of rain on Sunday inundated the underpass yet again, drowning vehicles and killing the 56-year-old driver of a mini truck.Also read: 56-year-old tempo driver drowns in waterlogged Minto Road underpassMuktesh Chander, senior IPS officer and a former Delhi traffic police chief, tweeted that he has seen the underpass flooding since his childhood. “Since my childhood I have seen almost every year, photographs of DTC bus submerged in water under Minto bridge during monsoon. Why can’t engineers, town planners & civic agency officials fix it? Let only one agency, whose name should be prominently displayed there, own & fix it,” Chander tweeted.The underbridge lies at the key traffic junction of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya (DDU) Marg and Swami Vivekananda Marg (formerly Minto Road) and leads to Connaught Place on one side and New Delhi station, Old Delhi and Darya Ganj on the other. Subhash Arya, who was a municipal councillor in the city from 1983 till 2017, said he has seen the underpass flooding since 1947, when he was just a five -year-old. “It has a deep slope and water from all the approach roads, including Swami Vivekananda Marg as well as from CP, flows into it. It has no outlet.”Arya said the underpass was a common flood point then too. “During the monsoons, it would get flooded and buses would get trapped. In 1967, the slope was widened to manage the water flow, but it didn’t help much. In 1980s, the stormwater drains were laid on both sides of the DDU Marg,” he added.So, more than 60 years later, why has no agency been able to fix the problem? It is because the bridge is a heritage structure, explained Jagdish Mamgain, who was the works committee chairperson of the erstwhile MCD. “All one can do is experiment with engineering solutions. The first pump was installed there in 1958, when flooding under the bridge became a huge issue in the municipal House,” he said.He added that during the 2010 Commonwealth Games, there was a scheme to add two more tracks to the bridge and level the road from beneath to raise its height, but it did not take off.In July 2018, when two DTC buses were submerged in the flooded underpass and 10 people had to be rescued, the Delhi High Court had directed all agencies concerned to coordinate efforts and prepare a plan to prevent such instances. A concrete solution to the problem, however, is yet to be found. Officials in the Public Works Department (PWD), which manages the road, said four suction pumps are installed at the underpass that are ready to be deployed throughout the day. Two of these pumps are in operation while the other two are on standby. “Sunday’s waterlogging seems to have been due a blockage in the main sewer line on DDU Marg. It seems that water came out of the main hose and flooded the road, a low-lying area. A detailed enquiry report will be prepared soon,” said a senior PWD official, who asked not to be named.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who holds interim charge of the PWD portfolio, said, “At all such points where waterlogging occurs frequently, steps are being taken to fix the issue and prevent waterlogging. All agencies have to work together in this task.” The DJB, which manages the sewer line on DDU Marg, said there was no blockage. “Had there been a blockage, the water would not have drained at all. We have inspected the sewer line, no blockage was found. It could only be because of the PWD pumps either not being functional or not being turned on at the right time,” a senior DJB official said.Experts said the agencies should prepare in advance since the problem takes place only during monsoon. “Often drivers fail to gauge the depth of water and try to cross over and get trapped. Till the time, a concrete engineering solution is found, all agencies including the traffic police should coordinate efforts and ensure better drainage of the stormwater and divert traffic as soon as the road starts flooding,” said Sewa Ram, professor and head of transport planning, School of Planning and Architecture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/waterlogged-since-1950s-why-minto-bridge-is-delhi-s-flooding-constant/story-EMM9oz0CvshDaiZ8qIQ9TJ.html
20-07-2020||Delhi||Civic bodies, PWD say pumps and machines being deployed at flooding-prone points||With a short spell of heavy rain on Sunday inundating several arterial roads, uprooting 20 trees, causing portions of two buildings to collapse and washing away of over a dozen hutments by an overflowing drain, exposing the Capital’s poor monsoon preparedness, the three municipal corporations and the Public Works Department (PWD) said they have identified waterlogging spots and are deploying machines and pumps to drain water. While the three civic bodies said they had completed desilting of drains last month, the PWD said a few drains are left to be covered and that the coronavirus disease has delayed the cleaning of drains since resources had to be diverted to fight the pandemic.The PWD manages 1,260 km of major roads (which are 60-foot wide) along with drains on these stretches. All others roads are cleaned and managed by the three municipal corporations, the Delhi Cantonment Board, NHAI, and flood and irrigation department. North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s mayor Jai Prakash said, “We have around 24 railway under-bridges (RUBs) in our jurisdiction, which are prone to waterlogging. We are getting the permanent and portable pumps installed there checked and made a junior engineer responsible for each point so that even if water stagnates, it is drained out at the earliest,” said Prakash.The north corporation manages around 200km of drains along its roads.Civic officials said desilting of drains usually starts in March and ends by May end. But this year due to coronavirus pandemic the process of allotment of tenders was delayed and hence desilting began late in April and May.South Corporation mayor Anamika Mithilesh said they have identified 36 major waterlogging-prone points. The South civic body manages around 180km of drains. “We have around 249 small and big drains. We have been monitoring the points prone to waterlogging and have got enough super sucker and jet machines to drain out the water,” she said. Officials in the East DMC said they have 21 permanent pumping stations and 150 portable pumps. “We had to use the portable pumps for the first time on Sunday on the PWD roads, as they did not have enough functional pumps to drain out rainwater,” said a senior official, who did not wish to be named.PWD officials said they have deployed over 200 pumps across the major waterlogging-prone points. The officials said that around 1,200-1,500 labourers are engaged every year for desilting. This year, adequate workforce was not available since most of them went to their native places because of Covid-19 pandemic.“The lack of availability of labourers had delayed the desilting process. The desilting of drains was started in the last week of April. It picked up slightly in May and most of the drains have been covered except for a few, which need more cleaning,” said a senior PWD official, requesting anonymity. Residents of south Delhi neighbourhoods such as South Extension and Defence Colony said the desilting of Kushak drain -- a big stormwater outlet for several south Delhi localities -- is yet to be completed even though the monsoon has already kicked in.“There is an unbearable stench from the drain since it rained on Sunday. The government agencies must clean it before it causes waterlogging and accidents,” said Asha Gupta, a resident of Defence Colony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/civic-bodies-pwd-say-pumps-and-machines-being-deployed-at-flooding-prone-points/story-KbYwmKfeCh1AwprsCtBF8N.html
20-07-2020||Delhi||Heavy rain triggers traffic jams in Delhi||The season’s heaviest rainfall so far caused traffic snarls in many parts of the city on Sunday along several stretches such as IP Estate Marg, Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, and Dhaula Kuan due to waterlogging and uprooted trees.The city traffic police released an advisory in the morning, asking commuters to avoid waterlogged roads and those in which trees has fallen. “Waterlogging reported at following places: IP Marg, Mayapuri Chowk, Panchkuian Road Gol Chakkar, Zakhira towards Inderlok under railway line, Apollo towards Ashram near U-Turn, Modi Mill towards Lala Lajpat Rai Market,” the traffic police tweeted in the morning.At least 20 trees were uprooted across the city, throwing traffic into disarray across several key stretches, including Ring Road near the World Health Organization (WHO) office, near which at least six shanties in a slum cluster collapsed due to the inundation.As of Sunday evening, traffic has been opened up in all the stretches, except for Ring Road near the IP flyover. “Motorists are requested to check the traffic updates while planning their trip especially when it rains,” Delhi Traffic Police said in a statement on Sunday evening.The fire department said it received reports of trees being uprooted in areas such as Max Mueller Marg, Malcha Market, Deepali Chowk, Shivaji Stadium, Jwalaheri Market, Aurobindo Marg, Shanti Van, Aurobindo Chowk, Hansraj Gupta Marg, Hindu Rao roundabout towards Baraf Khana roundabout, and Mathura Road near Supreme Court gate number eight.Traffic police officers said, it was fortunate the rains were reported on a Sunday, when there is usually lesser traffic on the road.”I was travelling towards Connaught Place via Vikas Marg. There was heavy traffic in Laxmi Nagar since some pipeline work is going on right on the main carriageway, leaving little space for vehicles. Also, there was a traffic jam from the Vikas Marg red light till the main ITO intersection. I had to turn right on the Ring Road and reached CP through Ranjeet Singh flyover,” said Anand Kumar, a graphic designer, who lives in Surajmal Vihar.Rain affected traffic movement in areas such as Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, Ring Road towards Bhairon Road, both carriageways of Ring Road under Dhaula Kuan flyover, both carriageways Gurugram Road - Pared Road Road, near Mundka Metro Station, Minto Road, Vinay Marg, Moolchand underpass, and Barakhamba Road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/heavy-rain-triggers-traffic-jams-in-delhi/story-oYpzFeF5Z4HxqoKJGGnH8K.html
20-07-2020||Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal calls for concerted efforts to tackle flooding in Delhi||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday all agencies must work together to clear waterlogged parts of the city, after a spell of heavy rain flooded several areas in the national capital.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress blamed the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government, accusing them of shoddy work that led to waterlogging, especially at Minto Bridge, where a person drowned in the inundation. Kejriwal tweeted, “This year all agencies, which include the Delhi government and the municipal corporations, were completely invested in managing corona. They have faced a lot of difficulties due to Corona. This is no time to get into any blame game. All agencies must join hands in fulfilling their responsibilities. We will make all efforts to clear areas where waterlogging is reported at the earliest.”In another tweet, he said, “I’ve been with agencies since this morning and was monitoring the process of removing water from there. There are several such areas in Delhi which are being monitored. We shall send pumps immediately to areas in which waterlogging is reported.”The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in turn lashed out at the Delhi government. Attaching photographs of a bus submerged at Minto Bridge and of other waterlogged areas in Delhi, Badarpur MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, leader of the opposition in the Delhi Assembly, tagged Kejriwal on Twitter and asked him about his promise to make Delhi a world-class city. “@ArvindKejriwal ji, what happened to your claim of making Delhi at par with Paris and London? In a short spell of rain, Delhi roads are flooded with water. Who is responsible for the death of the person (at Minto bridge)?” Bidhuri tweeted.The BJP said the situation at Minto Bridge could have been averted had government agencies like the Public Works Department (PWD) and the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) taken timely action.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said, “It is very unfortunate that a person lost his life due to waterlogging. We don’t want to indulge in any blame game, but it is clear that the Delhi government didn’t do its job properly.”He added, “The entire Minto Bridge area is under the Delhi government’s PWD. They didn’t start the pump on time, due to which it led to waterlogging at the bridge. The excess water is pumped into a DJB drain, which was clogged. We have been raising the issue of cleaning drains for a long time. If PWD and DJB had done their job on time, this tragedy could have been averted.”Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia asked BJP leaders to not pin blame and instead “coordinate and cooperate” with the government to tackle the issue.Sisodia said, “I want to tell BJP leaders that this is not the time to engage in politics and they should issue directions to agencies under them to focus on coordination and cooperation that is needed to tackle this issue. Delhi has witnessed focused efforts of agencies in Covid management. Together, the government and municipal agencies can handle this problem (waterlogging) too. I urge senior BJP leaders to introspect.”Aam Aadmi Party’s national spokesperson Raghav Chadha, said de-silting of drains in the city got delayed this year because of Covid-19 crisis, but added it was “unfortunate” that the BJP sought to make it a political issue.Chadha, who is also the vice-chairperson of the Delhi Jal Board, said, “It is unfortunate that several BJP leaders have engaged in a blame-game and they are making the issue political. We chose not to engage in politics over the issue…. Drains that come under the jurisdiction of the Delhi government and the municipal corporations are cleared before the arrival of monsoons, especially in April. This year, all agencies were invested in Covid management, so work concerning drains either got postponed or delayed. Agencies could properly get into clearing and de-silting drains only by June. The current issue is being monitored personally by the CM.”The Congress said the BJP-led civic agencies and the AAP government are to be blamed for the mess. “They are just blaming each other and trying to shrug the responsibility. Both parties are to be blamed for the present crisis, as they are in power in the municipal corporations and at the Delhi government,” said Anil Chaudhary, Delhi Congress chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-calls-for-concerted-efforts-to-tackle-flooding/story-AcT0GShD06eYuJij4t2aAI.html
20-07-2020||Delhi||56-year-old tempo driver drowns in waterlogged Minto Road underpass||A 56-year-old man drowned in the waterlogged Minto Road underpass near Connaught Place on Sunday morning and 10 others stranded on submerged roads and underpasses were rescued by different agencies across the Capital as the city received its first heavy spell of monsoon showers this year. Firefighters rescued three people from the Minto Road underpass where, they said, water was at least 8 feet deep. Besides the tempo which the victim, Kundan Singh Mehra, was driving, a DTC bus and two auto-rickshaws had also submerged. But fire officials said they never got to know that a man had drowned there.Mehra sat on his submerged mini truck for several minutes before his death, showed a small video clip which was authenticated by his family. However, it doesn’t show him falling into the water. Also read: Delhi runs for cover as record July rain hits city“There were motorists on both sides of the underpass and some of them even recorded Mehra sitting on top of the vehicle. But no one tried to rescue him or even alert the authorities,” said Mehra’s cousin, Pritam Singh. Mehra belonged to Pithoragarh district in Uttarakhand, where his wife and two children live. He lived in the parking lot of Shankar Market in Connaught Place. Mehra took up odd transportation jobs, mostly from New Delhi railway station to other parts of the city. “For the past few weeks, he had been hired temporarily by a contractor who provides food to CRPF personnel deployed in the city,” said Singh who lives in Ghaziabad. Singh owns the tempo that Mehra drove. Rajender Dubey, assistant commissioner of police (Barakhamba Road), said the initial probe revealed that Mehra had started from New Delhi railway station towards Connaught Place when he got stranded in the water collected under the Minto Road rail bridge. “He tried to manoeuvre his vehicle through the water, but couldn’t make it,” he said. Mehra’s cousin said he received a call from an employee of a public toilet near the underpass around 8am, informing him that his brother was trapped in the water and was sitting atop the tempo. “The man who called me had worked for me in the past, so he knew Mehra,” said Singh. By the time Singh could send some drivers from the nearby taxi stand to help Mehra, the stranded man couldn’t be spotted anymore. The fire department, meanwhile, had received a call for help around the same time. “We were informed that some people were trapped after a bus and two auto-rickshaws were stranded in the underpass. We rescued the bus driver and conductor and an auto driver, but no one told us that a fourth man was also stuck in the water,” said Atul Garg, director of Delhi Fire Services.It took the firefighters about 90 minutes to carry out the rescue operation as they had to use ladders to save the stranded men. Mehra’s body was finally spotted by a lineman working at the yard of the New Delhi railway station nearby. “He swam in the water and retrieved Mehra body. Mehra’s tempo was found near the stranded DTC bus,” said ACP Dubey. Mehra’s cousin, Singh, said that he has been seeing the underpass get flooded every monsoon for the last 32 years he has been in the city. “We have reached the moon, but aren’t able to solve the problem of an underpass. I hope my cousin’s death will not be wasted and the government can find a permanent solution to this problem,” said Singh. Police said there were no external injuries on Mehra’s body and while they await the autopsy report, they have initiated inquest proceedings into his death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/56-year-old-tempo-driver-drowns-in-waterlogged-minto-road-underpass/story-sKnwqkAHiUVGnfPh9OM1cO.html
20-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi runs for cover as record July rain hits city||The national capital, which was nearly parched since monsoon arrived in the city on June 24, received spells of “heavy” monsoon showers for around three hours on Sunday early morning, which threw traffic into disarray, led to the collapse of several shanties, and claimed at least two lives. The Safdarjung, Delhi Ridge and Lodhi Road observatories recorded 74.8mm; 86mm and 81.2mm of rainfall respectively.In fact, Safdarjung recorded the highest rain in a day for July in five years. On July 11, 2015, Safdarjung station had recorded 93.8mm rain. The all-time rain record for July in Delhi is 266.2 mm recorded on July 21, 1958, according to data with the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, Delhi.“Moderate category rain is expected again on July 20 night or July 21 early morning,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.At least two deaths were reported due to Sunday’s rains. A man died after falling into water in south-east Delhi, and another man drowned in the flooded Minto Road underpass. The first death took place in Gandhi Camp in nearby Srinivaspuri. Jalil, 28, was standing outside the same shop when he suddenly fell into a pool of water.  “The rain had led to the accumulation of three feet deep water outside the shop,” said RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (south-east). Jalil too was brought dead at a hospital. “The reason behind his death is not clear. We’ll know more after we receive his autopsy result,” said the DCP, adding that inquest proceedings have been initiated.An eight-year-old boy was reported to have drowned in the Yamuna, but the police could not immediately confirm if the death was due to the rains.Reports emerged from across the city of at least 20 trees being uprooted, shanties collapsing, and vehicles being submerged, slowing down traffic to a crawl on major stretches. Six people were evacuated from Zakhira underpass in southwest Delhi, after a cluster bus and a tempo submerged there. Two buildings collapsed in east Delhi’s Laxmi Nagar and Shanti Mohalla in Gandhi Nagar. Shanties, trees, shops along the banks of a storm water drain in ITO near the World Health Organization building were washed away in the flow of water.The Delhi Traffic Police reported heavy waterlogging at Minto Road, Azadpur underpass, South Avenue Road, Pul Prahladpur underpass, Azad market, Moolchand underpass and near Batra Hospital among others.Many residents shared on social media videos and pictures of rainwater gushing into their houses and vehicles wading through waterlogged roads. Police officers said one of the three domes of the 197-year-old Mubarak Begum mosque in Hauz Qazi collapsed around 7am on Sunday. “It got damaged due to the rain. No one was around it when it happened, and there have been no injuries due to the damage,” said an officer who asked not to be named.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said the Delhi government is closely monitoring the situation following waterlogging in parts of the city and appropriate steps will be taken to cover the losses due to heavy rains. “The situation is being constantly monitored and we are in touch with our engineers and taking the report,” he told reporters.Experts said that while the rain on Sunday in Delhi was “heavy” but the damage it caused was disproportionate to the amount and intensity of rain.“The topography of Delhi is such that we should never see flooding here. It is west of Yamuna river and the topography is undulating, making it favourable for drainage. The reason we see such flooding even after a couple of hours of rain is because we are not allowing the water to find its own path. We have not taken care of the natural drainage — there are people living right on the drain. So when the drain overflows it will damage the houses in its way. It’s also a sad commentary on the state of housing for urban poor. What happened to Delhi’s drainage master plan? Crores have been spent on it. Why is it not being implemented?” asked Manoj Mishra, convenor of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan.After the rains, Safdarjung observatory has got 122.7 mm rainfall in July so far, 8% more than the normal of 114.1mm, according to IMD data. The Lodhi Road station has recorded 137.1 mm rainfall in July so far, 20% more than the normal.IMD has issued an orange category warning for all of northwest India on July 20 and 21. An orange warning implies that disaster management and local authorities should prepare for heavy rain or flooding related emergencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-runs-for-cover-as-record-july-rain-hits-city/story-B2BXk8OmNyo1LIKtZ9W1vN.html
20-07-2020||Noida||Noida: RWAs, social groups asked to help admin set up Covid-19 testing camps||The Gautam Budh Nagar administration has asked social groups —such as apartment owners associations and residents’ welfare associations — to contact them for setting up of camps in their respective housing societies for Covid-19 testing. The move, officials said, will help them identify infected patients early and treat them properly with the final goal of reducing the death rate in the district. “Apartment owners associations, residents’ welfare associations, village heads or other such groups can approach the incident commanders to organize the camps to conduct test of suspected residents in their societies. We want to ensure that a patient gets treatment as early as possible under this scheme as it will help us in containing this disease,” said Narendra Bhooshan, CEO of Greater Noida authority, who is nodal officer for Gautam Budh Nagar district.The administration has been focusing on early detection of cases in Gautam Budh Nagar to stem the spread of infection, which crossed the 4,000 cases mark on Saturday“We will organise camps for antigen tests not only in containment zones but also in other areas as well. We have appealed to apartment owners associations and residents’ welfare associations and village heads to come forward and ensure all suspected or vulnerable people get tested. If need be then RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) tests will also be done for re-confirmation, so that treatment can start promptly,” said Bhooshan. On Saturday a total of 3,365 people were administered the antigen tests, out of which 57 tested positive. All those who tested positive were given a second RT-PCR test. “We are daily conducting at least 3,000 antigen tests at camps, hospitals and other places. Our focus is to reduce the death rate to less than 1% in our district. And we can do that only if the residents support us and volunteer for testing,” said Bhooshan.The Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that they are roping in the social groups via incident commanders and health officials. “Apartment owners associations, residents’ welfare associations and other social groups can express their views and give suggestions on our portal,” said Suhas LY district magistrate GB Nagar.“We got an antigen camp conducted at our society where 75 people got their tests done. All of them tested negative. Everyone who got tested did so voluntarily. We feel some people fear getting tested. We appeal to such residents to not be scared and willingly step forward to get tested for their own safety,” said Rajiva Singh, president of Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Associations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-rwas-social-groups-asked-to-help-admin-set-up-covid-19-testing-camps/story-JUUGojIDLMJnkHctbv82pL.html

20-07-2020||Delhi||Woman and her two kids found murdered at home, missing husband is a suspect||A 28-year-old woman and her two minor children were killed at their rented home in outer Delhi’s Nihal Vihar on Sunday morning. The police are searching for her husband, who is currently missing. Police did not comment who could have murdered the three but the woman’s father said that his son-in-law had killed the three of them.A Koan, deputy commissioner of police (outer district), said that a “blunt object” was used in the murders, but refused to identify the weapon. “We have seized the weapon and are searching for the suspect,” said the DCP. The murdered woman, Preeti Gupta, lived with her husband Gagan Kumar, a nine-year-old daughter and a five-year-old son in a rented house in Shiv Ram Park of Nihal Vihar. Kumar was a marble contractor while Gupta was a homemaker. “Theirs was a love marriage 10 years ago, but Kumar would abuse my sister. He was a drunkard who earned little and spent most of the money on alcohol,” said Gupta’s brother, Paras, who lives in the same neighbourhood. Preeti’s father Ram Chandra said, “On Sunday morning, when my wife tried to reach our daughter over the phone, there was no response. After sometime, I decided to visit her house and check on her,” said Chandra, adding that when he visited his daughter’s house around 11.15 am, he found the door ajar and the air-cooler switched on. “I walked into my daughter’s bedroom and found her lying on the bed. My two grandchildren were also lying on the same bed,” said Chandra. “It was dark in the room, but I soon realised that they were bleeding,” said Chandra. He raised an alarm and soon neighbours rushed into the house even as someone alerted the police. The trio was taken to a hospital, but they were declared brought dead. “I couldn’t see the murder weapon around and the police won’t tell me what was used to kill my daughter and grandchildren,” said Chandra. Chandra accused his son-in-law of killing them. “During the lockdown, Kumar has sent away all three of them to live with me. If he couldn’t keep them, he could have sent them to live with me forever. He didn’t have to kill them,” said Chandra. The police, meanwhile, have registered a murder case and have begun searching for Kumar who hasn’t been seen around ever since the triple murders came to light. “We’ll be able to share more details once we have nabbed the suspect,” said DCP Koan, refusing to share the possible motives behind the killings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/woman-and-her-two-children-found-murdered-at-home-his-missing-husband-is-suspect/story-GN4rQvK8idn3ZVjxilrijJ.html

20-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC to make final bid to auction Sector 41 fish and meat market shops on August 28||The municipal corporation (MC) is making a final attempt to auction shops at the Fish and Meat Market in Sector 41, failing which it is likely to be used for general trade.The civic body, which has over 10 years failed to sell or auction 32 booths and a chill room in the market, has invited bidders to participate in an open auction for the sites.Converting the market for general trade was recommended by the MCs gaushala committee in June this year.It (committee) “discussed the issue as in the previous several attempts the MC did not get any takers for the shops,” said Shakti Parkash Devshali, councillor and member of the committee.The committee’s proposal was presented at the general house meeting in June, which decided that a final attempt be made to auction the shops or recommend change of usage to the UT administration. “The market was built with Central government funds, which specified its purpose so the Centre’s approval will be required. That’s why a final bid is being made for the auction,” said Devshali.FAILED: CUTTING PRICE, OFFERING ON RENT, REDUCING RENTDeveloped as a fish market in 2006 at a cost of Rs 5 crore by the UT administration, the market was handed over to the MC in 2009. Later, however, to attract more retailers, meat and poultry products were added.Initially, the MC offered the shops for Rs 60 lakh each, but as no buyers turned up authorities decided to rent them at Rs 30,000 to Rs 35,000 a month. Poor response forced the MC to cut the rent price to Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000, but even then no tenants turned up. “The condition of the market is deteriorating because of disuse. There are complaints of theft of different civic and electrical installations at the shops. Also, garbage has been dumped at many places by local residents,” said a senior MC official requesting anonymity.NO E-AUCTION THIS TIMEE-auctions in the past too haven’t succeeded for MC so this time it will be hoping its open auction works.It will be held on August 28 at 11 am at the market. The booths will be given initially for five years and extension given for a maximum of 10 years.For booth number 1 to 24 measuring 21.21 measuring square metres each, the minimum reserved monthly licence fee is Rs 12,000 each. From number 25 to 30, measuring 19.02 sq m, it’s Rs 10,000 and for booth number 32-33 measuring 39.51 sq m, it’s Rs 15,000. The chill room measuring 35.31 sq m area has a minimum fee of Rs 10,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mc-to-make-final-bid-to-auction-sec-41-fish-and-meat-market-shops-on-aug-28/story-AaCantwWY8K6c8UizK2KGN.html
20-07-2020||Pune||No dhol-tasha in 2020, silence on Pune streets in run-up to Ganesh fest||The Ganesh festival each year is preceded with the sound of drums (dhol) and cymbals (tasha) clanging, as troupes (pathaks) begin practicing a month before the Ganpati idol is welcomed into homes on the first day (August 22) of the 10-day festival. Every day after the installation of the idol, the dhol-tasha pathaks perform, with the final day, the visarjan (immersion) a climatic eruption of dhol-tasha displays, choreographed, and, for most, an eight-hour performance marathon.This year there is silence.Not a single road or area in Pune has the practice sessions going on. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, there will be no public celebration of the Ganpati festival.The Maharashtra Dhol Tasha Mahasangh, the umbrella body governing dhol-tasha pathaks in Pune, has instructed all pathaks to not hold practice sessions or perform during the festival this year for safety reasons. Pathaks, instead, have been engaged in social activities during the lockdown to help society.“This year there are no dhol-tasha pathaks practising anywhere in Pune. The priority for all is safety and so we have decided not to be involved in any kind of public celebration or immersion procession during the Ganpati festival. In fact, most of our prominent pathaks are doing social work - distributing food packets or providing ration kits to the needy. These members contributed funds from their savings. Also, 700 members have donated blood so far in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. We have also provided ration kits to 250 families of members of music band groups in Pune, as they are completely dependent, financially, on their work,” said Parag Thakur, president of the mahasangh.Members from all walks of life are in these pathaks, from college students, and IT professionals, to doctors, business owners and even senior citizens.There are 170 pathaks with 25,000 members in Pune district and in the state, at least 500 pathaks.“There is a bit of edginess among members as they are not able to come together to practice and play for their beloved Bappa this year,” added Thakur.Ashutosh Deshpande, president of Shiv Mudra Dhol Tasha Pathak, one of the prominent pathaks in Pune, said, “It is unfortunate that the Covid-19 pandemic has changed things across the globe. Our members are bit sad as they are not able to perform this year for Ganpati Bappa, but they are aware of social safety. From the contribution of members we have donated to needy organisations during the lockdown. We have plans to work with Ganpati mandals this year, as our members want to volunteer to raise awareness, if needed. There are 600 members in our pathak and we began in 2005.”Karan Salunkhe, a student who plays in one of the pathaks, said, “We want to do something for society. Wherever it is needed, we will go as volunteers during the 10 days of Ganpati and help mandals to create awareness about Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-dhol-tasha-in-2020-silence-on-pune-streets-in-run-up-to-ganesh-fest/story-w0dBiWP2I6bIVSdwFrqXEN.html

They have raised the issue with the university, but to no avail. Jayanti Dutta, deputy director of the centre, who has not received her salary since April, said, “Since University Grants Commission (UGC) has not reimbursed the funds to the centre since March, we have not received our salaries since April. It’s not a large amount for the varsity and they can disburse our salaries till the funds are received.”“There are no guidelines or rules which allow stopping of salary to the staff in case of non-receipt of UGC grant,” she said.The HRDC was established in 1987 at PU by UGC to provide in-service training to college and university lecturers. The centre receives funds from UGC for all its activities, including salaries of staff.The staffers have even written to vice-chancellor Raj Kumar, but no step has been taken so far. The letter said that receiving UGC grant should not be linked to payment of salary, since HRDC is a part of the university and grants are received only on reimbursement basis.Panjab University Teachers’ Association (PUTA) also wrote to the V-C with regard to this. “The faculty and staff at HRDC have not been paid salary for the last three months, causing enormous problems in an already difficult situation. It is therefore requested that necessary steps may be taken to release the salaries,” PUTA’s letter said.SK Tomar, director of PU’s HRDC, said, “The salaries have been delayed as funds have not been disbursed by UGC. We had already sent them this year’s proposal and tentative utilisation certificate, and hope to receive the grant by August.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/staffers-of-panjab-university-s-hrdc-yet-to-receive-salaries-for-last-three-months/story-bkdWbVB1BGStxrXGRsaMfO.html

We are also giving home isolation to people who have mild symptoms which will keep beds empty in the hospital,” added Bodade.Meanwhile, PCMC municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar has appealed to not fear the numbers.“Although the number has crossed 10,000, one must take note that out of these around 8,100 to 8,200 people were those who had not shown any Covid symptoms but they were only carriers of Covid-19 and now they are totally cured. People should not fear Covid-19 and one must trust that it is curable,” said Hardikar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/11-106-positive-covid-cases-in-pcmc-focus-on-increasing-number-of-beds/story-wk3KSmAhP0ma44a5uYU7aK.html
20-07-2020||Chandigarh||A Sikh rock ‘n’ roller from 60s who earned sobriquet ‘Indian Elvis’||The voice on the telephone line from Mumbai is incredibly youthful and one wonders if one is speaking to a man all of 86 who sang and danced his way into the hearts of people through the fabulous ‘50s and the swinging sixties. “Well I may be a few years away from 90, and had a hip surgery following an accident, but you can guess by my voice that I am young in heart and soul,” says Iqbal Singh Sethi with a chuckle.He certainly strikes the right note and one is reminded of the tall and handsome turbaned Sikh singing and dancing with gusto in the 1960 Bollywood blockbuster ‘Ek Phool Chaar Kaante’, a romantic comedy that starred Waheeda Rehman and Sunil Dutt, hard pressed into wooing his beloved’s four fussy uncles. His performance in the nightclub number ‘Beautiful baby of Broadway’ penned specially for him by Hasrat Jaipuri won accolades. “Actually, the original lyrics by Jaipuri were ‘Bombshell baby of Bombay’ but the censors objected and so the title line was replaced Beautiful baby of Broadway,” he recalls.How did this happen? It is an incredible story indeed for he moved as an 11-year-old boy with his parents from Rawalpindi to Pune where his father Gopal Singh Sethi served in the Punjab Regiment and was a decorated soldier. “I completed my schooling from Pune and joined the British Indian Navy in 1949 as an ensign that gave me a chance to travel the world and there I discovered the singer and dancer in me,” he says. In fact, during a romance with a lass from Southampton, who was a very good dancer, he got initiated into rock and roll, the Elvis way. He was a junior sailor, an engine-room class II mechanic, in a coastal minesweeper, one of four commissioned in August, 1956. The vessels sailed to the Royal Navy minesweepers base at Hythe, where he became a favourite at the port town dances and would go on to win the top spot at the South of England rock ‘n’ roll championship.Of course, the stardom lasted a short while as the naval authorities gave him the choice of leaving films for good or face a court martial for acting without permission. Sethi turned down the film offers that flooded him. “I have no regrets because the navy gave me so much. I attended Queen Elizabeth’s coronation in 1953, trained as an engineer and was decorated with service medals.”After retiring from the navy, he did managerial jobs with reputed firms, including long years as works manager with Tata for Maruti Suzuki. Besides, he remained a caring husband to his late wife Parduman Kaur and anchor to his three daughters and a son as well as doting grandchildren. However, old timers still recall the young turbaned navy ensign doing his ‘frantic Presley thing!’A small post in a WhatsApp group leads onto a Facebook page maintained by his second daughter, Arvinder Sethi Sandhu, titled ‘Iqbal Singh Sethi my daddy’. He says he is happy to be chatting with a Chandigarh reporter for this city is home to his late wife’s brothers and their families.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/a-sikh-rock-n-roller-from-60s-who-earned-sobriquet-indian-elvis/story-ByBe9NFOyZONECqBlc0OQL.html
20-07-2020||Pune||Why PMC’s contact tracing system: stretched and willing, but not able||The Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) contact tracing ability is being severely tested thanks to a variety of factors all coinciding at the same time.An increase in the number of Covid care centres has stretched the civic staff. Rapid antigen tests have increased the number of positive cases being reported, with the city now recording at least 1,500 fresh positive cases daily.There is also a delay in the civic system’s positive Covid data reaching each ward.While the state’s average contact tracing is 21 per positive person, the Pune civic bod was operating on a number of nine persons traced per positive person, which has now gone up to 13.It is still not enough and at least three cases that HT contacted showed no contact tracing done. A man in his mid-30s, living in Yerwada, tested positive for Covid-19 through the rapid antigen detection testing kits on July 13.The patient said, “Soon after I got the result I left the Covid care centre, but there was no stamp or any guidance about what I should do next. I home isolated myself on my own. The PMC has no record of me and has not reached out to my family or anyone for contact tracing.”Another person living on Sinhgad road who tested negative but his roommate tested positive, said, “The PMC did not contact any of us for further contacts. Even though only the two of us were sharing the room it is quite possible that my roommate may have infected others when he went outside. The civic body only fogged the premises around our room. The PMC did not contact my roommate and ask him who all he met in the past two days.”A 62-year-old male tested positive from Hadapsar on July 16 at a private hospital, but the family of the patient, which also includes a high-risk patient, were never contacted. One of the relatives said, “Till July 18, the civic body did not contact us until we contacted them. The next day when we voluntarily went to the Covid care centre at the PMC school in Hadapsar, there were close to 500 people there. The centre was supposed to start at 10 am, but till 12 noon, not a single person was tested.”Dr Sanjay Dabhade of Jan Aarogya Abhiyan said, “The PMC must trace every person who might have come in contact with a positive person two days prior to the symptoms appearing; now that the results are coming in within two-three days, contact tracing needs to be backdated even more Without much contact tracing, it is impossible to break the chain and with Pune reporting an alarming number of cases daily. Only more testing, tracing and isolation will help control the cases.” What the PMC says:Dr Vaishali Jadhav from the PMC’s health department said, “Earlier I had a staff of 1,200 people, but now, due to multiple centres working, the staff is divided and I only have 500 people left working for me. However, we still try to do aggressive contact tracing. With regards to the Hadapsar ward, the civic doctor is currently not feeling well and I am not able to find another doctor to replace her. With regards to the rapid antigen testing, this is a new phenomenon and we are still getting used to it. However, we have asked our staff to collect the contact details of the patient as soon as the result comes in. It is time now that people must reach out to the civic body if they get to know that they have come in contact with any positive patient. Once a person is positive, the reports are compiled by the Smart City unit and is then sent to us. It takes three days for us to get the list, which is then sent to the respective wards.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/why-pmc-s-contact-tracing-system-stretched-and-willing-but-not-able/story-nnE3BbQ09sV0RBMqS83ofP.html

People get food from the markets and drive towards the residential area where they drink alcohol too. We feel unsafe,” says Capt GS Ghuman (retd), vice president, Chandigarh Senior Citizens’ Association, who lives near the market.Though there is a beat box near the market, police personnel do not appear to be too keen to penalise people for not wearing masks and flouting other safety norms, says RS Gill, president, Sector 8 Resident Welfare Association (RWA). “Many youngsters from other sectors come here and cause law and order problems in Sector 8. With so many people crowding the place in the evening it’s hard to imagine that any sort of lockdown has been imposed in the city.”On managing the crowds, a traffic police official says, a “Only one-way traffic is allowed on the roads outside the market at around 5:30 pm. To manage traffic congestion we see to it that cars are parked at the designated space and not by the road.Naveen Singhal, general secretary of the market, insists that shopkeepers are following rules. “It’s not just youngsters, even many families sit in their cars and enjoy a meal and snacks to ensure social distancing rules are maintained. Teams from the police and administration arrive here at 5 pm so most people stick to the rules,” he adds. Local area councillor Maheshinder Sidhu adds that people need some respite after the lockdown and are flocking to the market more often now than in the past. “Since children are stuck at home, many parents bring them here for an outing. They mostly sit in their vehicles so social distancing is maintained here in a way.” Sidhu says he will ask the police to remain more vigilant and book those who are not wearing masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rush-for-alcohol-food-no-one-gives-a-toss-for-social-distancing-in-sec-8-market/story-Ac5xRx1Ahh8mIutGVg0iHN.html

A team of six officials will be on the job, it has been learnt.A drive planned earlier by the MC in March was cancelled due to the intervention of director, local bodies, Punjab, following which a lockdown was imposed because of the Covid-19 outbreak.“I have already instructed the civic body to remove all illegal hoardings in the ambit of the MC area and now they are holding a drive on July 20, for which we will be providing them police support,” Jain said.The MC is losing lakhs of rupees in advertising revenues because of the hoardings installed illegally, with housing societies the main offenders. These include Gold Homes and Golden homes, both on the Kharar-Landran road and Yakshi Wedding Collection on the Kharar-Mohali Road. Pratap Infra alone has set up around 10 hoardings.The sites are being sold to advertisers for an estimated Rs 60,000 per month, causing huge losses to the government exchequer.According to Sangeet Kumar the rights to remove the illegal installations were with the agency contracted for the task. “ We have provided them the team and police force for holding a drive on July 20,” he said. MC allots tenders for 40 sites in Kharar, but this year it contracted the work for Rs 3.25 crore for nine years.

20-07-2020||Gurugram||Women in slum areas stitch masks to support their families||Lending a helping hand to the families living in the slum areas of Delhi, a not profit organisation has come forward to help those who have lost their jobs, through a project. Little India Foundation, a trust that are supporting 26 slums in the Capital, has brought together around 20 women to make affordable cotton masks. “Earlier, we were distributing food and ration to the families living in slums and then we got to know about them losing jobs due to Covid-19. Then founder Saleem Khan decided to take upon the food project a little further, and extend it to for the cause of employment generation. We thought this would not just make them self-reliant, but confident too! We are teaching them the basics of stitching with help from our managing director, Suman Arya. We have also provided them sewing machines and fabric and in turn for their skills and hard work, we paying are them as well,” informs Harsimar Chawla, additional deputy director of the trust. During these testing times, women have come forward to shoulder the responsibility of supporting their families, financially. Sahnaaz, one of the women who has been stitching masks as part of this project, says, “My husband used to work as a bus driver with a school, but due the pandemic he has lost his job. Although we are getting ration but there’s nothing like a job security because we have to look after our kids’ future as well... I have learnt to stitch masks and the money I receive in return gives me confidence and a sense of empowerment to be able to do something for my family.” Hindustan Times reader, Sujata Aurora, who posted about this initiative on social media, has been bringing smiles on the faces of these women, by buying and distributing their masks. Aurora says, “We need to take collective responsibility to support them. I would also like to request others to support them.”The masks made by these women can be ordered in bulk. “The cost of each mask is ₹15 and the delivery charges are ₹250. One can call at +91-9560688867 to order these masks, and there should be a minimum order of 100 masks. As we aim to put the lives of these women back on track, any support at this time will help them to live with dignity,” says Saleem Khan.

20-07-2020||Chandigarh||Non-bailable warrants issued against suspended SHO Jaswinder Kaur||A special CBI court on Thursday issued non-bailable arrest warrants against suspended SHO Jaswinder Kaur, accused in a Rs 5-lakh graft case.The inspector, along with an alleged conduit, Bhagwan Singh, was booked under Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 7 and 7A of the Prevention of Corruption Act on June 29 on charges of seeking Rs 5 lakh bribe from a Manimajra resident, Gurdeep Singh. Gurdeep had told CBI that he had already paid Rs 2 lakh to Kaur for not lodging a cheating case against him and was to pay Rs 3 lakh more.On Thursday, CBI’s public prosecutor KP Singh moved an application seeking non-bailable arrest warrants against Kaur, former SHO of the Manimajra police station.Allowing the application, special judge, CBI, Sushil Kumar Garg ordered: “In view of circumstances mentioned in the application, non-bailable warrant of arrest be issued against the accused Jaswinder Kaur returnable on July 20.”“Returnable on July 20” entails initiation of proclaimed offender proceedings if she is not arrested by then.In its application, CBI had stated that Kaur “deliberately and intentionally absconded” despite being asked twice to join the investigation.The agency stated that she created false evidence in a DDR at Manimajra station that she had returned from CBI office, Sector 30.“The SHO took the complainant’s signatures under pressure on a blank paper and a compromise statement was written on it later. One of the constables, Sarabjit Singh, even revealed this in his statement before the judicial magistrate and the CCTV footage of Manimajra police station from June 21 corroborated Sarabjit’s statement,” CBI had said.Stating all these findings, the agency prayed for non-bailable arrest warrants, which was allowed by the court.On July 10, the court had denied anticipatory bail to Kaur, who had claimed false implication and that the amount recovered was actually compromise money and not bribe.The case so farJune 29 FIR registered against Manimajra SHO Jaswinder Kaur and others by CBIJune 30 Suspended on account of false DDR entry made by her at the Manimajra stationJuly 9 Files anticipatory bail applicationJuly 10 CBI court dismisses her pleaJuly 16 CBI court issues non-bailable arrest warrants||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/non-bailable-warrants-issued-against-suspended-sho-jaswinder-kaur/story-fmZ0zRNgA4aKpX8O8Z4NHI.html

Delhi’s favourite go-to monsoon eateries have been getting phone calls from pakoda lovers, asking when are the shops planning to resume operations. Prateek Dhingra, owner of Sarojini Nagar’s Khandani Pakodewala, says, “As soon as it starts drizzling, our phones start ringing with customers calling to demand pakodas. We are getting calls from morning to evening! Par abhi medically halat itni achchi nahi ki hum kaam dobara shuru karein. I have to think about my staff’s health who have been with us for 30 years.”Dhingra says they did open in unlock 1.0, but decided to halt business because people coming in to collect orders weren’t following government guidelines. “The problem is that when we tried to open post lockdown, customers couldn’t maintain social distancing, which we feel is very important for everyone’s health at this point. Therefore, we decided to re-strategise, and hopefully we will soon reopen again.” Khandani PakodewalaWhere: Ring Road, Sarojini NagarWhen: Plans to reopen in AugustSpeciality: Onion Pakoda, Paneer Pakoda, Gobhi Pakoda and their in-house Chutney Price: ₹12/pc, ₹15/pc, ₹12/pc, respectivelyAnother staple joint for pakoda maniacs is Sitaram Pakodewala in Lajpat Nagar. “Monsoon is the peak season for our business. Last year we had 30 delivery riders waiting to collect orders at any given point while we attended walk-in customers at the store. Every other day I receive so many enquiries on when will we restart functioning,” says Vikas Pawar, owner of the joint, adding, “We had planned to wait till mid-July before resuming operations.

20-07-2020||World||More frost in UK-China ties as extradition pact is suspended||The Boris Johnson government on Monday escalated its ennui with China following Beijing’s recent enactment of a security law for Hong Kong by suspending the extradition treaty with it “immediately and indefinitely” and banned the export of items related to suppressing riots.London’s latest action follows last week’s ban on Chinese company Huawei, high-profile expression of concern over the reportedly repressive treatment of Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang province of China, and previous offer of a path to UK citizenship to Hong Kong citizens holding the British National (Overseas) passports.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab announced the suspension in the House of Commons: “I have consulted with the Home Secretary, the Justice Secretary and the Attorney General, and the government has decided to suspend the extradition treaty immediately and indefinitely”.“And I should also tell the House that we would not consider re-activating those arrangements, unless, and until clear and robust safeguards which are able to prevent extradition from the UK being misused under the national security legislation”, he added. UK is also extending to Hong Kong the arms embargo that is in force on mainland China since 1989. This includes no exports from the UK to Hong Kong of potentially lethal weapons, their components or ammunition, besides a ban on the export of any equipment not already banned, which might be used for internal repression, such as shackles, intercept equipment, firearms and smoke grenades.Calling upon China to live up to its international obligations, Raab said: “We want to work with China. There is enormous scope for positive, constructive, engagement…But, as we strive for that positive relationship, we are also clear-sighted about the challenges that lie ahead”.“We will always protect our vital interests, Including sensitive infrastructure, and we won’t accept any investment that compromises our domestic or national security. Mr Speaker, we will be clear where we disagree, and I have been clear about our grave concerns regarding the gross human rights abuses being perpetrated against the Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang”.The opposition Labour supported the measures announced, calling it a step in the right direction. Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the measures should lead to a “new era” in the two countries’ relationship.She said: “This must mark the start of a more strategic approach to China based on an ethical approach to foreign policy and an end to the naivety of the ‘golden-era years’.”“Like him, our quarrel is not with the people of China, but the erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong, the actions of the Chinese government in the South China Sea and the appalling treatment of the Uighur people is reason now to act. We will not be able to say in future years that we did not know.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-frost-in-uk-china-ties-as-extradition-pact-is-suspended/story-iMavlBPa1hivoYOZk6w21H.html
20-07-2020||World||2020 Watch: Does Donald Trump have a strategy to win in November?||Presidential politics move fast. What we’re watching heading into a new week on the 2020 campaign:Days to general election: 106Days to first state offering early voting (Pennsylvania): 56___THE NARRATIVEPresident Donald Trump insists he’s not losing, but by virtually every objective measure he’s struggling through one of the worst moments of his presidency. Trump demoted his campaign manager last week, acknowledging through his actions, if not his words, that things are not moving in the right direction.Republican allies have begun to share concern publicly about Trump’s political strategy and his inconsistent leadership, most notably his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Daily infections are exploding, the death rate is ticking up and the economic recovery is in jeopardy.Trump on Sunday charged, without evidence, that Democratic state and local officials were planning to close schools and roll back reopening plans just to hurt him. Multiple polls suggest that a majority of voters, including many Republicans, simply don’t believe what Trump says about the pandemic.Meanwhile, Trump also refused to say whether he would accept the results of the general election. Early voting begins across multiple swing states in just eight weeks.___THE BIG QUESTIONSDoes Trump have a strategy to win?Scott Walker, the former Wisconsin governor and a Trump ally, tells us that he sees no clear strategy coming from the Trump campaign. Some might think that’s why Trump downgraded campaign manager Brad Parscale last week, except that his replacement, Bill Stepien, had largely been running the political operation already.There is little evidence that Trump is working to expand his coalition. He seems to be betting everything that he can win by energizing his base while depressing turnout among would-be Biden supporters by redefining the lifelong politician with a flood of negative advertising. Trump’s campaign has reserved $146 million in television ads this fall, the vast majority of which is going to must-win states like Florida and Ohio he carried four years ago.Trump’s team continues to embrace a kitchen sink messaging campaign against Biden that features questions about his mental competence, his allegiance to the far left, his inconsistent record and conspiracy theories about the integrity of the election itself. The scattershot approach is frustrating allies like Walker, although it’s not likely to change anytime soon.Are school closures already America’s next major crisis?Several weeks before many elementary and secondary schools are scheduled to open, there are clear signs that surging coronavirus infections will force education officials in several states to keep their doors closed. That leaves millions of children and their parents in limbo and threatens the economic recovery.Trump told Fox News Channel on Sunday that Democrats were planning to close schools just to hurt him but cited no evidence for his claim. He also threatened to strip federal funding from public schools if they refuse to open. Such rhetoric won’t help ensure that it’s safe for children and their teachers to get back to the classroom.Is Biden’s veep search actually expanding?The biggest decision of Biden’s campaign looms as he continues his search for a running mate. As few as six serious contenders advanced in the search earlier this summer. But amid pressure for Biden to make a selection that would satisfy a wide range of priorities and constituencies, additional candidates have joined the vetting process in recent weeks, according to multiple Democrats with knowledge of the dynamics. That’s yielding an unusually large field of contenders, including some of the nation’s best-known politicians and others who have a lower profile.Those known to be under consideration earlier include Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Florida Rep. Val Demings, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance-Bottoms and Susan Rice, who served as President Barack Obama’s national security adviser. Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth and California Rep. Karen Bass have come under greater consideration more recently.Are we headed toward a constitutional crisis?Trump on Sunday refused to say whether he would accept the results of the election if he lost. “I have to see,” he told “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace. “No, I’m not going to just say ‘yes.’ I’m not going to say ‘no.’”Trump made a similar statement that frightened constitutional scholars four years ago, although it was quickly forgotten after Trump’s victory. With his numbers looking worse heading into 2020, some are taking the threat more seriously this time. Of course, the president has also spent several weeks working to undermine the integrity of the election by raising unfounded questions about mail voting. Combine that rhetoric with an array of ballot issues expected as the coronavirus forces changes into the election system this fall, and it’s not hard to imagine a legitimate constitutional crisis in November.___THE FINAL THOUGHTWe’ve seen over and over that it doesn’t matter much who Trump taps to serve as his campaign manager or chief of staff. One man and one man only is making the big decisions that will decide the president’s political future and the immediate future of the United States.Trump told us he was his own best strategist four years ago, yet many still believed he would put experienced and effective leaders around him to guide his decisions. Four years later, it’s become clear that history will remember the 45th president as a man whose fate was decided almost exclusively by his own instincts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2020-watch-does-donald-trump-have-a-strategy-to-win-in-november/story-6OXk50mJPOG4qlaOaSpU9O.html

Britain also accused Russia of attempting to interfere in the country’s general election last year by disseminating documents relating to trade talks with the US Russia rejected the charges.The 2018 US midterm elections demonstrated the country’s enhanced “agility” across government agencies, Nakasone said, adding that the NSA’s capabilities were now “battle-tested.”The cyber chief also addressed the ongoing debate over 5G technology as countries across the world assess the role of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co.“Part of the 5G conversation has been, do nations want to entrust the security of what will likely be the most important platform for their communications to nations that do not share their values?” he asked. “We’re in an era of great power competition. We see it every day in cyberspace.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-nsa-chief-vows-to-hit-back-at-nations-interfering-in-2020-elections/story-IBxsCb0T6sZDYEWSFMVgwO.html
20-07-2020||World||Coronavirus pandemic advances the march of ‘cobots’||While a resurgence in coronavirus cases in Texas has brought many businesses to a screeching halt, eight robots have kept All Axis Machining’s metal fabrication facility in Dallas humming.The small, nimble robots perform multiple jobs, such as machine-tending, sanding, deburring, part inspection and laser marking, leaving owner Gary Kuzmin far less dependent on manual labour. When all the workers on one shift went into self-quarantine last month, it had no impact on the facility’s productivity.All Kuzmin had to do was to move a couple of workers from other shifts to supervise the robots. “I have not lost any spindle time because of the pandemic,” he said.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Companies of all sizes are leaning on automation to keep factories running without compromising the health and safety of their workers. Half of the chief financial officers surveyed last month by PricewaterhouseCoopers said they were planning to accelerate automation.With the US economy grappling with a double-digit unemployment rate, however, industry’s rush to robots will fuel worries about semi-skilled or unskilled workers as low-paid, routine tasks become more likely to be automated.“It is the most productive thing for us to have the robots,” said Kuzmin. “I don’t even look at a machine these days without thinking how I would automate it.”Since August 2018, when All Axis Machining began using robots, its productivity has doubled with the same headcount. If not for the robots, the company would have needed to expand its staff of 30 by 50% to keep up with increase in demand.“We are less dependent upon a semi-skilled employee,” said Kuzmin. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The pandemic has changed companies’ calculations about investments in automation, said Jeremie Capron, research chief at research and investment-advisory firm ROBO Global. “The cost of operating without a robot today in a factory is higher than it was pre-COVID,” he said.Mark Muro, senior fellow and policy director at Washington-based the Brookings Institution, says the automation drive will result in a net reduction in the workforce as companies invest in technology not just for social distancing, but also to boost productivity and protect profits from the pandemic-induced recession. “Technology has improved and gotten cheaper, and the financial pressure on companies is higher,” he said.He noted, however, that since middle class and lower-paid workers tend to spend a larger share of their income than the higher-paid, it is important that productivity gains eventually result in more jobs.“If there is... too little sharing of the gains of automation-supported growth, we will wind up with little economic activity,” Muro said. Lower cost, faster payback The affordable cost of the so-called collaborative robots, or “cobots,” promises payback in months, making the changeover easier, even for small and medium-sized enterprises. All Axis Machining, for example, spent $85,000 per robot and was able to recover the cost in five months. There are cheaper collaborative robots on the market, as well.One of the most popular cobots sold by Denmark-based Universal Robots - a unit of Massachusetts-based Teradyne Inc. and a market leader in collaborative robotics technology - costs about $35,000, with a payback period of three to four months.The robots are very easy to use, safe to be around and can easily be adapted to new tasks. It takes just hours to train employees to work with them, saving companies huge training expense.Although they are not suited for heavy-duty jobs, they are designed to work alongside humans, making them the robots of choice in the age of social distancing.California-based DCL Logistics, a third-party logistics company, decided to employ cobots to manage a 30% increase in orders in the immediate aftermath of the outbreak.Normally, the company would have hired temporary workers to deal with the surge in orders. But bringing in new workers was fraught with safety risks, said Chief Revenue Officer Brian Tu. The robots have led to a 300% increase in productivity and a 60% jump in labor cost savings, Tu said.DCL plans to deploy more cobots this year at its facilities in California and Kentucky.At All Axis Machining, the cobots have allowed owner Kuzmin to stagger the shifts. The facility now runs three shifts seven days a week, with robots working the late night shift alone, without any roving inspector.This has allowed workers in the facility to stay 30 feet apart from each other. Having seen the benefits, the company is automating its remaining machines as well.Kuzmin, who also runs a robotics services company, says several Dallas-based manufacturers have approached him recently to install similar robots in their factories.Economic uncertainty Universal Robots is fielding inquiries from companies seeking social distancing solutions, as well as tools to re-shore production and make their operations more flexible.“Some companies... are talking about dozens and dozens of robots,” said Joe Campbell, senior manager of applications development at Universal Robots.Still, the virus-induced recession is keeping many companies on the sidelines, wary of making new investments.Tacoma, Washington-based Tool Gauge, which makes metal and plastic parts and assemblies for aerospace companies, including Boeing Co., planned to add two mobile industrial robots to its fleet of two cobots and 10 industrial robots before the novel coronavirus hammered the aviation industry.But Tool Gauge put the robots on hold after a production shutdown at Boeing’s Washington state factories and an overall drop in orders, General Manager Jim Lee said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-pandemic-advances-the-march-of-cobots/story-gBnE98joSA7a2bSj6I4iXK.html
20-07-2020||World||UK’s Oxford University Covid-19 vaccine prompts immune response in early trial||Scientists at Oxford University say their experimental coronavirus vaccine has been shown in an early trial to prompt a protective immune response in hundreds of people who got the shot.British researchers first began testing the vaccine in April in about 1,000 people, half of whom got the experimental vaccine. Such early trials are usually designed only to evaluate safety, but in this case experts were also looking to see what kind of immune response was provoked.In research published Monday in the journal Lancet, scientists said that they found their experimental Covid-19 vaccine produced a dual immune response in people aged 18 to 55 that lasted at least two months after they were immunized.“We are seeing good immune response in almost everybody,” said Dr. Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford University. “What this vaccine does particularly well is trigger both arms of the immune system,” he said.Hill said that neutralizing antibodies are produced — molecules which are key to blocking infection. In addition, the vaccine also causes a reaction in the body’s T-cells which help to fight off the coronavirus.The experimental Covid-19 vaccine caused minor side effects like fever, chills and muscle pain more often than in those who got a control meningitis vaccine.Hill said that larger trials evaluating the vaccine’s effectiveness, involving about 10,000 people in the U.K. as well as participants in South Africa and Brazil are still underway. Another big trial is slated to start in the U.S. soon, aiming to enroll about 30,000 people.How quickly scientists are able to determine the vaccine’s effectiveness will depend largely on how much more transmission there is, but Hill estimated they might have sufficient data by the end of the year to decide if the vaccine should be adopted for mass vaccination campaigns.He said the vaccine seemed to produce a comparable level of antibodies to those produced by people who recovered from a Covid-19 infection and hoped that the T-cell response would provide extra protection.“There’s increasing evidence that having a T-cell response as well as antibodies could be very important in controlling Covid-19,” Hill said. He suggested the immune response might be boosted after a second dose; their trial tested two doses administered about four weeks apart.Hill said Oxford’s vaccine is designed to reduce disease and transmission. It uses a harmless virus — a chimpanzee cold virus, engineered so it can’t spread — to carry the coronavirus’ spike protein into the body, which should trigger an immune system response.Hill said Oxford has partnered with drugmaker AstraZeneca to produce their vaccine globally, and that the company has already committed to making 2 billion doses.“Even 2 billion doses may not be enough,” he said, underlining the importance of having multiple shots to combat the coronavirus.“There was a hope that if we had a vaccine quickly enough, we could put out the pandemic,” Hill said, noting the continuing surge of infections globally. “I think its going to be very difficult to control this pandemic without a vaccine.”Numerous countries including Germany, France, the Netherlands, Italy, U.S. and the U.K. have all signed deals to receive hundreds of millions of doses of the vaccine — which has not yet been licensed — with the first deliveries scheduled for the fall. British politicians have promised that if the shot proves effective, Britons will be the first to get it.In an accompanying editorial, Naor Bar-Zeev and William Moss of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health called the Oxford results “encouraging” but said further judgment should wait until the vaccine is tested on much bigger populations.Last week, American researchers announced that the first Covid-19 vaccine tested there boosted people’s immune systems just as scientists had hoped and the shots will now enter the final phase of testing. That vaccine, developed by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna, produced the molecules key to blocking infection in volunteers who got it, at levels comparable to people who survived a Covid-19 infection.About a dozen different experimental vaccines are in early stages of human testing or poised to start, mostly in China, the U.S. and Europe, with dozens more in earlier stages of development.British officials said Monday they had also signed a deal to buy 90 million doses of experimental Covid-19 vaccines being developed by the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and others.In a statement, the British government said it had secured access to a vaccine candidate being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, in addition to another experimental vaccine researched by Valneva.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-oxford-university-covid-19-vaccine-prompts-immune-response-in-early-trial/story-mSlgah339RyQYfAt3oYD0N.html

20-07-2020||World||Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate is safe, early results show||The vaccine candidate developed at the University of Oxford is safe and induces immune reaction, preliminary results published in medical journal The Lancet on Monday said, raising hopes for a cure for Covid-19 that has killed tens of thousands and disrupted human activity across the globe.The widely-followed trial is currently at an advanced stage, with trials in the UK, Brazil and South Africa. A collaboration has already been reached between Oxford, UK government and biopharma major AstraZeneca to produce the vaccine on a mass scale if the final results are also positive. The Serum Institute of India is one of the global partners for its production.The journal also reported that phase 2 of a vaccine trial in China has also been found to be safe and induces an immune response. The randomised controlled trial of a recombinant adenovirus type-5-vectored Covid-19 vaccine (Ad5-vectored Covid-19 vaccine) was conducted in China in April and involved more than 500 people.Mene Pangalos of AstraZeneca said: “We are encouraged by the Phase I/II interim data showing AZD1222 was capable of generating a rapid antibody and T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2. While there is more work to be done, today’s data increases our confidence that the vaccine will work and allows us to continue our plans to manufacture the vaccine at scale for broad and equitable access around the world.”ALSO WATCH | Covid update: Bill Gates on Indian pharma; Oxford vaccine hope; curbs tightenedExplaining how the Oxford vaccine works, study lead author Andrew Pollard said: “The new vaccine is a chimpanzee adenovirus viral vector (ChAdOx1) vaccine that expresses the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein”.“It uses a common cold virus (adenovirus) that infects chimpanzees, which has been weakened so that it can’t cause any disease in humans, and is genetically modified to code for the spike protein of the human SARS-CoV-2 virus”.“This means that when the adenovirus enters vaccinated people’s cells it also delivers the spike protein genetic code. This causes these people’s cells to produce the spike protein, and helps teach the immune system to recognise the SARS-CoV-2 virus.”He added: “The immune system has two ways of finding and attacking pathogens – antibody and T cell responses. This vaccine is intended to induce both, so it can attack the virus when it’s circulating in the body, as well as attacking infected cells”.“We hope this means the immune system will remember the virus, so that our vaccine will protect people for an extended period. However, we need more research before we can confirm the vaccine effectively protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for how long any protection lasts.”The early stage trial finds that the vaccine is safe, causes few side effects, and induces strong immune responses in both parts of the immune system – provoking a T cell response within 14 days of vaccination (ie, a cellular immune response, it could find and attack cells infected with the virus), and an antibody response with 28 days (ie, humoral immune response, it could find and attack the virus when it was circulating in the blood or lymphatic system).Reacting to the news, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “This is very positive news. A huge well done to our brilliant, world-leading scientists & researchers at the University of Oxford. There are no guarantees, we’re not there yet & further trials will be necessary – but this is an important step in the right direction”.Business secretary Alok Sharma said: “Today’s results are extremely encouraging, taking us one step closer to finding a successful vaccine to protect millions in the UK and across the world. Backed by £84 million Government investment for the vaccine’s development and manufacture, the agility and speed with which the University of Oxford have been working is outstanding. I am very proud of what they have achieved so far.”An ideal vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 should be effective after one or two vaccinations, work in target populations including older adults and those with other health conditions, confer protection for a minimum of six months, and reduce onward transmission of the virus to contacts.The Lancet said the current trial is too preliminary to confirm whether the new vaccine meets these requirements, but phase 2 (in the UK only) and phase 3 trials to confirm whether it effectively protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection are happening in the UK, Brazil and South Africa.The new trial included 1,077 healthy adults aged 18-55 years with no history of Covid-19, and took place in five UK hospitals between April 23 and May 21, 2020. The data included in the paper covered the first 56 days of the trial and is ongoing.The participants either received the new Covid-19 vaccine (543 people) or the meningococcal conjugate vaccine (534 people). 113 participants (56 given the Covid vaccine, and 57 in the control group) were also asked to take paracetamol before and for 24 hours after their vaccination to help reduce vaccine-associated reactions (as the Covid-19 vaccine was given in a high dose to help induce a strong immune response).All participants gave additional blood samples and underwent clinical assessments to determine if the vaccine was safe and whether it provoked an immune response. Participants were also asked to record any adverse events throughout the trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-s-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-s-initial-results-show-it-is-safe/story-SO1USJvXyCi3hVWp0h4g4L.html

AstraZeneca will work to produce 100 million doses for the UK in total.As part of a wider £131 million investment by the government, support has also been given to Imperial College London to develop their vaccine candidate, which started human studies in June.Officials said the UK government has committed £250 million to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations – the biggest investment of any country - to support equitable and affordable access to new coronavirus vaccines and treatments around the world.The government on Monday also launched the NHS Covid-19 vaccine research registry to enlist volunteers for future vaccine studies. To enable large-scale vaccine studies to take place across the UK, the aim is to get 500,000 people signed up by October.Health secretary Matt Hancock said: “A safe and effective vaccine is our best hope of defeating coronavirus and returning to life as normal”.“We have some of our best scientists and researchers working on this, but members of the public have a vital role to play too. So I urge everyone who can to back the national effort and sign up to the NHS Covid-19 vaccine research registry to help find a vaccine as soon as possible”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/awaiting-trials-success-uk-seals-early-access-to-3-vaccine-candidates/story-gPXLhSjBu3aZut9Wdh08jM.html

It also showed that patients who received SNG001 were at least twice as likely to recover to the point where their everyday activities were not compromised through having been infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19),” he said.In addition, SNG001 significantly reduced breathlessness, one of the main symptoms of severe Covid-19, the company said, which is now focused on working with the regulators and other key groups to progress the potential Covid-19 treatment as rapidly as possible.Also read: Mylan launches Remdesivir’s generic version ‘Desrem’ in India for Covid-19 patientsThe trials showed that the average time coronavirus patients spent in hospital was reduced by a third, for those receiving the new drug – down from an average of nine days to six days.The double-blind trial involved 101 volunteers who had been admitted for treatment at nine UK hospitals for Covid-19 infections. Half of the participants were given the drug, the other half got placebo – an inactive substance.The results, published by the company under its stock market obligations, have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal as yet.“The results confirm our belief that interferon beta, a widely known drug that, by injection, has been approved for use in a number of other indications, has huge potential as an inhaled drug to be able to restore the lungs’ immune response, enhancing protection, accelerating recovery and countering the impact of SARS-CoV-2 virus,” said Professor Tom Wilkinson, Professor of Respiratory Medicine at the University of Southampton and Trial Chief Investigator.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Professor Stephen Holgate, Medical Research Council Clinical Professor of Immunopharmacology at the University of Southampton and Co-Founder of Synairgen, added, “recognising that SARS-CoV-2 is known to have evolved to evade the initial antiviral response of the lung, our inhaled treatment of giving high local concentrations of interferon beta, a naturally occurring antiviral protein, restores the lung’s ability to neutralise the virus, or any mutation of the virus or co-infection with another respiratory virus such as influenza or RSV, as could be encountered in the winter if there is a resurgence of COVID-19.” Synairgen’s drug trial was the template for the Accord programme, a fast-track clinical trial scheme set up by the UK government in April to accelerate the development of new drugs for patients with Covid-19.The team believes the drug could be even more effective at the early stages of infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-firm-declares-positive-results-from-covid-19-protein-treatment/story-4vVfeM4D4j14aqv4UEN8kK.html

The companies have received fast track designation from the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for two investigational vaccine candidates being developed to help protect against SarS-CoV-2. Vaccines typically provide the immune system with harmless copies of an antigen: A portion of the surface of a bacterium or virus that the immune system recognises as foreign. A vaccine may also provide a non-active version of a toxin - a poison produced by a bacterium - so that the body can devise a defence against it.They must follow higher safety standards than other drugs because they are given to millions of healthy people.Vaccine testing is a four-stage process - pre-clinical testing on animals, phase I clinical testing on a small group of people to determine its safety and to learn more about the immune response it provokes, phase II trials are expanded safety trials, and phase III testing is done by administering it to thousands of people to confirm its efficacy.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-results-to-be-out-today-lancet-editor-s-tweet-creates-buzz/story-YxA09d0svj82Urz9Iz3zKM.html

20-07-2020||World||Marathon EU summit breaks up after all-night talks, to resume later||A marathon European Union summit has broken up temporarily after four-days of acrimonious haggling over an unprecedented 1.85 trillion-euro ($2.1 trillion) EU budget and coronavirus recovery fund to tackle the crisis. The weary leaders were scheduled to resume the meeting in the afternoon.The summit of the 27 EU leaders began Friday and was scheduled to end on Saturday. Instead deep ideological differences between leaders forced the talks into Sunday and then through the night to Monday morning.The bitter negotiations pitted a group of five wealthy northern countries - the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Finland - against southern nations hardest hit by the pandemic, supported by European heavyweights Germany and France.Leaders did not comment as they left the summit venue early Monday.Seeking to tug at the hearts of all European Union leaders, EU Council president Charles Michel implored them late Sunday to overcome their fundamental divisions and agree on an unprecedented 1.85 trillion-euro ($2.1 trillion) EU budget and coronavirus recovery fund to tackle the crisis.After three days of fruitless talks, Michel conjured up during an official dinner the vision of the 600,000 dead that COVID-19 has claimed around the world and the unprecedented recession it has wrought on the bloc.“Are the 27 EU leaders capable of building European unity and trust or, because of a deep rift, will we present ourselves as a weak Europe, undermined by distrust,” he asked the leaders at the end of another day of divisive negotiations. The text of the behind-closed-doors speech was obtained by The Associated Press.“I wish that we succeed in getting a deal and that the European media can headline tomorrow that the EU succeeded in a Mission Impossible,” Michel said.Early on the fourth day of talks - the summit was meant to last only two - the leaders still had not reached a compromise. As dawn broke Monday in Brussels, they were still in the marathon summit after haggling through the night over the size and terms of the recovery fund.Even with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron negotiating as the closest of partners, the traditionally powerful Franco-German alliance could not get the bloc’s 27 quarrelling nations in line.Often negotiating outdoors on a sundeck in the Europa summit centre in Brussels, the blue skies and fresh breeze had no impact on the mood. Undiplomatic terms like “hate” and “grumpy” have been thrown around between leaders during marathon negotiations that should have drawn everyone closer together to fight a historic recession in the bloc.“Whether there will be a solution, I still can’t say,” Merkel said.The pandemic has sent the EU into a tailspin, killing around 135,000 of its citizens and sending its economy into an estimated contraction of 8.3% this year.The bloc’s executive has proposed a 750 billion-euro coronavirus fund, partly based on common borrowing, to be sent as loans and grants to the countries hit hardest by the pandemic. That comes on top of the seven-year 1 trillion-euro EU budget that leaders have been haggling over for months even before the pandemic hit.All nations agree they need to band together but five richer countries in the north, led by the Netherlands, want strict controls on spending, while struggling southern nations like Spain and Italy say those conditions should be kept to a minimum.At their dinner table Sunday night, the leaders could mull a proposal from the five wealthy northern nations that suggested a coronavirus recovery fund with 350 million euros of grants and the same amount again in loans. The five EU nations nicknamed “the frugals” - the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Denmark - had long opposed any grants at all.Merkel and Macron walked out of heated talks before dawn Sunday with the frugals, bemoaning their lack of commitment to a common cause. “They ran off in a bad mood,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said.Rutte has long been known as a European bridge builder, but this weekend his tough negotiating stance is being blamed for holding up a deal. He and his allies are pushing for labor market and pension reforms to be linked to EU handouts and a “brake” enabling EU nations to monitor and, if necessary, halt projects that are being paid for by the recovery fund.“He can’t ask us to do specific reforms,” Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said. “Once (the aid) is approved, each country will present its proposals.” Another member of the frugals, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, said he still believed a deal was possible, but there is a “long way to go,” the Austria Press Agency cited Kurz as saying.Rutte also wants a link to be made between the handout of EU funds and the rule of law - a connection aimed at Poland and Hungary, countries with right-wing populist governments that many in the EU think are sliding away from democratic rule.That drew a harsh response from hardline Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.“I don’t know what is the personal reason for the Dutch prime minister to hate me or Hungary, but he’s attacking so harshly and making very clear that because Hungary, in his opinion, does not respect the rule of law, (it) must be punished financially,” Orban said.Macron said leaders need to compromise but still respect the underlying principles and goals of the EU.“It is still possible, but these compromises, I say very clearly, will not be made at the cost of European ambition,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/marathon-eu-summit-breaks-up-after-all-night-talks-to-resume-later/story-6iQ2oej8affa1RSfrXZO6O.html
20-07-2020||World||UK orders 90 million vaccine doses from Pfizer, Valneva||The UK has signed agreements to buy 90 million doses of vaccines in development by drugmakers including Pfizer Inc., BioNTech SE and Valneva SE.The government said it has secured access to three different vaccine candidates, and it’s setting up a program seeking 500,000 volunteers to participate in clinical trials.Click here for full Covid-19 coveragePfizer and BioNTech plan to supply 30 million doses of their vaccine candidate this year and next, the companies said in a separate statement. The companies plan to seek approval as early as October and could produce as many as 100 million doses by the end of this year.The UK described the order as that alliance’s first binding agreement with any government. The US has been supporting Pfizer and BioNTech’s efforts through its $10 billion Operation Warp Speed research program. The vaccine uses a novel technology called mRNA.Valneva agreed to supply 60 million doses of a shot it’s developing. The UK previously struck a supply agreement for a vaccine being tested by AstraZeneca Plc with the University of Oxford.The UK also said Monday it ordered treatments containing antibodies that neutralize Covid-19 from AstraZeneca.Valneva, a French drugmaker, will supply a further 40 million doses if its vaccine is found to be safe, effective and suitable, the U.K. said. The company is producing the vaccine at a factory in Livingston, Scotland. Valneva said it expects the government to help fund clinical studies and it’s negotiating funding to expand the Livingston facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-orders-90-million-vaccine-doses-from-pfizer-valneva/story-C2HLRAOtMqWeYTkkdHU79K.html
20-07-2020||World||Donald Trump refusing to commit to accept results of upcoming election||President Donald Trump is refusing to publicly commit to accepting the results of the upcoming White House election, recalling a similar threat he made weeks before the 2016 vote, as he scoffs at polls showing him lagging behind Democrat Joe Biden. Trump says it’s too early to make such an ironclad guarantee.“I have to see. Look ... I have to see,” Trump told moderator Chris Wallace during a wide-ranging interview on ”Fox News Sunday.” “No, I’m not going to just say yes. I’m not going to say no, and I didn’t last time either.”The Biden campaign responded: “The American people will decide this election. And the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.”Trump also hammered the Pentagon brass for favoring renaming bases that honor Confederate military leaders — a drive for change spurred by the national debate about race after George Floyd’s death. “I don’t care what the military says,” the commander in chief said.The president described the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, as a “a little bit of an alarmist” about the coronavirus pandemic, and Trump stuck to what he had said back in February — that the virus is “going to disappear.” On Fox, he said, “I’ll be right eventually.” The United States tops the global death toll list with over 140,000 and confirmed infections, with 3.7 million.It is remarkable that a sitting president would express less than complete confidence in the American democracy’s electoral process. But for Trump, it comes from his insurgent playbook of four years ago, when in the closing stages of his race against Hillary Clinton, he said he would not commit to honoring the election results if the Democrat won.Pressed during an October 2016 debate about whether he would abide by the voters’ will, Trump responded that he would “keep you in suspense.” The president’s remarks to Fox are certain to fuel conversation on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers had already been airing concerns in private about a scenario in which Trump disputes the election results.Trump has seen his presidential popularity erode over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and in the aftermath of nationwide protests centered on racial injustice that erupted after Floyd’s death in Minneapolis nearly two months.Trump contends that a series of polls that show his popularity eroding and Biden holding an advantage are faulty. He believes Republican voters are underrepresented in such surveys.“First of all, I’m not losing, because those are fake polls,” Trump said in the taped interview, which aired Sunday. “They were fake in 2016 and now they’re even more fake. The polls were much worse in 2016.”Trump was frequently combative with Wallace in defending his administration’s response to the pandemic, weighing in on the Black Lives Matter movement and trying to portray Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, as lacking the mental prowess to serve as president.Among the issues discussed was the push for wholesale changes in policing that has swept across the nation. Trump said he could understand why Black Americans are upset about how police use force disproportionately against them.“Of course I do. Of course I do,” the president said, adding his usual refrain that “whites are also killed, too.”He said he was “not offended either by Black Lives Matter,” but at the same time defended the Confederate flag, a symbol of the racism of the past, and said those who “proudly have their Confederate flags, they’re not talking about racism.”“They love their flag, it represents the South, they like the South. That’s freedom of speech. And you know, the whole thing with ‘cancel culture,’ we can’t cancel our whole history. We can’t forget that the North and the South fought. We have to remember that, otherwise we’ll end up fighting again. You can’t just cancel all,” Trump said.Wallace challenged Trump on some of his claims and called out the president at time, such as when Trump falsely asserted that “Biden wants to defund the police.” The former vice president has not joined with activists rallying behind that banner. He has proposed more money for police, conditioned to improvements in their practices.Trump continues to insist that Biden “signed a charter” with one of his primary rivals on the left, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. At one point in the interview, Trump calls on aides to bring him documentation to support his assertion. Trump, however, is unable to point to language from a Biden-Sanders task force policy document released this month by the Biden campaign.Trump stood behind his pledge to veto a $740 billion defense bill over a requirement that the Defense Department change the names of bases named for Confederate military leaders. That list includes Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Hood in Texas and Fort Benning in Georgia.The president argued there were no viable alternatives if the government ever tried. “We’re going to name it after the Reverend Al Sharpton?” Trump asked, referring to a prominent civil rights leader. “What are you going to name it?”Trump, 74, stuck to a campaign charge that Biden, 77, is unable to handle the rigors of the White House because of his age. As for polls showing the incumbent is trailing, Trump noted he was thought to be behind for much of the 2016 contest. “I won’t lose,” he predicted.The president and top advisers have long accused Biden of using the pandemic as an excuse to stay in “his basement” in his Delaware home. Biden has indeed shifted much of his campaign online, but frequently travels in Delaware and Pennsylvania, organizing speeches and small gatherings with voters and community leaders that are within driving distance of his home. Biden’s campaign says it will begin resuming normal travel and campaign activities, but only when health officials and state and local authorities say it is safe.Questioned about the coronavirus, Trump chided Fauci, the National Institutes of Health expert, and repeated false claims that anybody could get a test and that increased testing was the only reason that the U.S. was seeing more cases. When Wallace cited criticism about the lack of a national plan to confront the virus, Trump said, “I take responsibility always for everything because it’s ultimately my job, too,” and claimed, “I supplied everybody.”Case are rising because people are infecting each other more than they were when most everyone was hunkered down. The percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus has been on the rise across nearly the entire country.___Associated Press writers Hope Yen and Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-refusing-to-commit-to-accept-results-of-upcoming-election/story-UdZR92qOfDE7XR1Zo8AVfK.html
20-07-2020||World||Astrophysicists unveil biggest-ever 3D map of Universe||Astrophysicists on Monday published the largest-ever 3D map of the Universe, the result of an analysis of more than four million galaxies and ultra-bright, energy-packed quasars.The efforts of hundreds of scientists from around 30 institutions worldwide have yielded a “complete story of the expansion of the universe”, said Will Percival of the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada.In the project launched more than two decades ago, the researchers made “the most accurate expansion history measurements over the widest-ever range of cosmic time”, he said in a statement.The map relies on the latest observations of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), titled the “extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey” (eBOSS), with data collected from an optical telescope in New Mexico over six years.The infant Universe following the Big Bang is relatively well known through extensive theoretical models and observation of cosmic microwave background -- the electromagnetic radiation of the nascent cosmos.Studies of galaxies and distance measurements also contributed to a better understanding of the Universe’s expansion over billions of years.‘Troublesome gap’But Kyle Dawson of the University of Utah, who unveiled the map on Monday, said the researchers tackled a “troublesome gap in the middle 11 billion years”.Through “five years of continuous observations, we have worked to fill in that gap, and we are using that information to provide some of the most substantial advances in cosmology in the last decade,” he said.Astrophysicist Jean-Paul Kneib of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) in Lausanne, who initiated eBOSS in 2012, said the goal was to produce “the most complete 3D map of the Universe throughout the lifetime of the Universe”.For the first time, the researchers drew on “celestial objects that indicate the distribution of matter in the distant Universe, galaxies that actively form stars and quasars”.The map shows filaments of matter and voids that more precisely define the structure of the Universe since its beginnings, when it was only 380,000 years old. For the part of the map relating to the Universe six billion years ago, researchers observed the oldest and reddest galaxies.For more distant eras, they concentrated on the youngest galaxies -- the blue ones. To go back even further, they used quasars, galaxies whose supermassive black hole is extremely luminous.The map reveals that the expansion of the Universe began to accelerate at some point and has since continued to do so.The researchers said this seems to be due to the presence of dark energy, an invisible element that fits into Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity but whose origin is not yet understood.Astrophysicists have known for years that the Universe is expanding, but have been unable to measure the rate of expansion with precision.Comparisons of the eBOSS observations with previous studies of the early universe have revealed discrepancies in estimates of the rate of expansion.The currently accepted rate, called the “Hubble constant”, is 10 percent slower than the value calculated from the distances between the galaxies closest to us.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrophysicists-unveil-biggest-ever-3d-map-of-universe/story-iuOHBUIi98MRLgKNJ0gtqL.html
20-07-2020||World||84-year-old Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz hospitalised||Saudi Arabia’s 84-year-old ruler, King Salman bin Abdulaziz, has been admitted to hospital in the capital Riyadh, suffering from inflammation of the gall bladder, state news agency SPA said on Monday.The king, who has ruled the world’s largest oil exporter and close U.S. ally since 2015, was undergoing medical checks, the agency added, without giving details.King Salman, the custodian of Islam’s holiest sites, spent more than 2-1/2 years as the Saudi crown prince and deputy premier from June 2012 before becoming king. He also served as governor of the Riyadh region for more than 50 years.The defacto ruler and next in line to the throne is the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, widely known by his initials MBS, who has launched reforms to transform the kingdom’s economy and end its “addiction” to oil.The 34-year-old prince, who is popular among young Saudis, has won praise at home for easing social restrictions in the conservative Muslim kingdom, giving more rights to women and pledging to diversify the economy. To the king’s supporters, this boldness at home and abroad was a welcome change after decades of caution, stagnation and dithering. But state control of the media and a crackdown on dissent in the kingdom make it difficult to gauge the extent of domestic enthusiasm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-king-salman-84-admitted-to-hospital/story-Qb9Bdo6ek6rdOYZ7vQQP3N.html
20-07-2020||World||Canada promises review of $6.8 million worth security equipment purchased from Chinese govt-owned firm||Canada’s Foreign Minister Francois-Phillipe Champagne has promised to review $6.8 million worth of security equipment purchased from a Beijing-based high-tech company that has been found to have connections with the highest levels of the Chinese Communist Party.As per Global News reports, Canada, this week, posted details that Beijing-based Nuctech, a company owned by the Chinese government and founded by the son of former General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Hu Jintao, has been awarded a deal by Global Affairs Canada (GAC) to install X-ray scanning equipment and software systems to provide security for 170 Canadian embassies, consulates and high commissions worldwide.Responding to questions from the media, the Foreign Minister on Friday promised in a statement to review “any possible issue relative to security or safety ... all appropriate actions (will be) taken to ensure the safety of our missions around the world.”“We are currently looking into the offer with Nuctech company to provide some security screening equipment in our missions abroad,” Champagne said in a statement. “Global Affairs has not purchased any equipment from Nuctech at this time.”“In addition, I have today directed GAC officials to review our purchasing practices when it comes to security equipment and to continue reviewing the security of our missions around the world,” the statement read further.The deal has been signed despite mounting concerns among some national security experts about Nuctech’s growing access to sensitive facilities worldwide.Nuctech has been accused in the past of engaging in controversial business practices in Asia, Africa and Europe, including offering soft loans and illegal dumping.The New York Times has repeatedly reported on an alleged corruption case in Namibia involving Nuctech. According to Namibian prosecutors, in May 2008, three suspects allegedly received $12.8 million in kickbacks to help Nuctech secure a $55-million X-ray scanner contract, the Times reported.Critics of state-owned enterprises alleged that the Chinese government subsidises its companies to allow them to bid at lower prices than Western competitors.Meanwhile, in Europe, some analysts are complaining that Nuctech is making rapid inroads providing services to border security facilities due to China’s state-backing, unfair practices, and potentially Beijing’s influence over some European politicians.Carleton University professor Stephanie Carvin, a former Canadian Security Intelligence Service official, said the Nuctech contract for Canadian embassies presents security concerns, but she believes China’s “geo-economic” strategy is the bigger concern.“This is not Huawei. I am not as concerned as I would be with telecommunications,” Carvin said.“The issue is the fact companies like Nuctech are inherently anti-competitive, they may in some cases be beneficiaries of stolen technologies, and they want to fundamentally take over and undermine western technologies,” Carvin added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-promises-review-of-6-8-million-worth-security-equipment-purchased-from-chinese-govt-owned-firm/story-myeCmLZAPtWFD4xhsCkxZL.html
20-07-2020||World||Indian-Americans hold protest in front of Chinese embassy in Washington||A group of Indian-Americans from in and around the national capital has held a peaceful demonstration in front of the Chinese embassy here, protesting against China’s aggression along the Line of Actual Control. Displaying anti-China banners and shouting slogans like “China Communist: Down Down”, the protesters on Sunday said that “the Chinese virus has killed lakhs of people across the world and has brought the global economy to a standstill”. Community activist Manoj Sreenilayam said: “We condemn the unprovoked Chinese aggression, landgrab and killing of Indians on Indian territory in Ladakh, while the world is distracted with the Covid-19 pandemic”. For the past several decades, China has been bullying India and other smaller nations, said another activist Mahindra Sapa. “In the South China Sea, China has been illegally capturing land and islands of smaller nations. It has killed 20 Indian soldiers. We are here to raise awareness and urge the world to do horizontal escalation and economically decouple from China,” Sapa said. The peaceful protest represented a cross-section of the Indian-American cultural and social organisations from Maryland, Virginia and Washington DC. Prominent among them being Kerala association of Greater Washington, Durga Temple friends, Tamil cultural groups and Indian cultural Associations of Howard County, National Council of Asian Indian Associations and Vishwa Hindu Parishad of America. Recently formed New York-based Oppose Chinese Imperialism (OCI) Group 23 also sent its representatives to participate in the protest. “We are here to protest against the Chinese aggression on the Indian land and territories of the neighbouring countries,” said Sanjay Patel. In recent weeks, Indian-Americans in major US cities have held peaceful protests against China. The first of those was held in Chicago by eminent Indian-American Dr Bharat Barai at New York’s Times Square where members of the Tibetan community also demonstrated against China. Another group led by Prem Bhandari in New York recently formed OCI Group 23 to mobilise people in the 23 countries with whom China has territorial disputes. The group last week held a webinar on the Chinese imperialism addressed by India’s former ambassador to China Gautam Bambawale and former Securities and Exchange Board of India chairman D R Mehta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-americans-hold-protest-in-front-of-chinese-embassy-in-washington/story-CI7ZtTE2MpB30MhHs8TGBK.html

Despite record levels of new cases nationwide, the Trump administration is pushing for school to reopen in a few weeks and resisting a federal mandate to wear masks in public. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageTrump defended his handling of the coronavirus pandemic in an interview broadcast on Sunday, including his statement that there were only embers of the virus popping up around the country. The United States, with 3.7 million total cases, has almost as many infections as the next three hardest-hit countries combined - Brazil, India and Russia.“We have embers and we do have flames. Florida became more flame-like, but it’s - it’s going to be under control.” Trump on “Fox News Sunday” repeated his assertion that the virus will eventually disappear. “I’ll be right eventually,” he said. “It’s going to disappear and I’ll be right.” Experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have warned cases and deaths could rise this autumn and winter. Nearly all 20 forecasting models used by the CDC project rising deaths in the coming weeks.Throughout the United States, every metric to measure the outbreak is going in the wrong direction - rising cases, deaths, hospitalizations and positivity rates of test results. At least 14 states have reported record coronavirus hospitalizations so far in July, including Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, Nevada and Texas.Trump said he did not agree with CDC Director Robert Redfield that this fall and winter will be one of the most difficult times in American public health, as hospitals deal with the seasonal flu on top of Covid cases. “I don’t know and I don’t think he knows,” Trump said.Trump also called Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious diseases expert, “a little bit of an alarmist.” Fauci has warned that cases could soon top 100,000 a day if Americans do not come together to take steps necessary to halt the spread of the virus. The country is averaging 60,000 new cases a day and reported a record one-day increase of 77,299 on Thursday.Testing shortages and delayed results in some states are hampering efforts to curb the outbreak, similar to situations that frustrated state officials and health experts at the start of the pandemic in March and April. Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that people were waiting up to a week to learn if they tested positive.“The average test delay is too long,” said Collins. “That really undercuts the value of the testing.”Instead of expanding testing, the Trump administration wants to block $25 billion for states to conduct testing and contact tracing, according to reports in The Washington Post and the New York Times. The White House declined on Sunday to comment to Reuters on those reports.The number of Covid tests performed each day has doubled since late May but remains lower than recommended by some health experts. The United States set a record on Friday with over 850,000 tests performed, according to data from the Covid-Tracking Project https://Covidtracking.com/data/charts/us-daily-tests.

Once there, it will loop the planet for a whole Martian year, or 687 days.While the objective of the Mars mission is to provide a comprehensive image of the weather dynamics in the Red Planet’s atmosphere, the probe is a foundation for a much bigger goal -- building a human settlement on Mars within the next 100 years.The UAE also wants the project to serve as a source of inspiration for Arab youth, in a region too often wracked by sectarian conflicts and economic crises.Several dozen probes -- most of them American -- have set off for the Red Planet since the 1960s. Many never made it that far, or failed to land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-arab-emirates-launches-space-mission-to-mars-from-japan-calls-it-hope/story-khjJtnsX0EaMR6MMYPsqRP.html
20-07-2020||World||FDA approves Quest Covid-19 test for ‘pooled’ sample use||The Food and Drug Administration has given emergency approval to a new approach to coronavirus testing that combines test samples in batches instead of running them one by one, speeding up the process.The FDA said Saturday that it reissued an emergency use authorization to Quest Diagnostics to use its Covid-19 test with pooled samples. It is the first test to be authorized to be used in this way.With pooling, instead of running each person’s test individually, laboratories would combine parts of samples from several people and test them together. A negative result would clear everyone in the batch. A positive result would require each sample to be individually retested. Pooling works best with lab-run tests, which take hours — not the much quicker individual tests used in clinics or doctor’s offices.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The potential benefits of sample pooling include stretching laboratory supplies further, reducing costs and expanding testing to millions more Americans who may unknowingly be spreading the virus. Health officials think infected people who aren’t showing symptoms are largely responsible for the rising number of cases in more than half the country. The approach might enable mass testing at schools or businesses, though it’s unclear when that could happen.“It’s a really good tool. It can be used in any of a number of circumstances, including at the community level or even in schools,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, told a Senate hearing last month.Pooling is not always be the best option. It won’t save time or resources when used in a Covid-19 hot spot such as a nursing home outbreak. That’s because the logistical and financial benefits of pooling only add up when a small number of pools test positive.Experts generally recommend the technique when fewer than 10% of people are expected to test positive. For example, pooling would not be cost-effective in Arizona, where a surge has pushed positive test results to well over 10%. But the approach could make sense in areas with a lower rate of positive results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fda-approves-quest-covid-19-test-for-pooled-sample-use/story-386oQskj0anPlx2gxzAHQL.html

A later statement said Crown Prince Sheikh Nawaf Al Ahmad Al Sabah had assumed some of Sheikh Sabah’s powers temporarily, without explaining why that was necessary.However, the visit comes as the tiny nation fights the coronavirus pandemic, which has seen over 58,000 cases and 400 deaths in the country of 4.1 million. Its Health Ministry says over 49,000 people have recovered from the virus and the Covid-19 illness it causes.In August 2019, Kuwait acknowledged the emir suffered an unspecified medical “setback” that required him to be hospitalized. That came after visiting Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif wrote on Twitter that he was “praying for Emir’s speedy recovery,” without elaborating.Sheikh Sabah has ruled Kuwait since January 2006. He’s pushed for diplomacy to solve regional issues, such as the ongoing boycott of Qatar by four Arab nations, and hosted major donor conferences for war-torn nations like Iraq and Syria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kuwait-s-ruler-hospitalised-crown-prince-steps-in/story-1SuReIogAAeowHWR5ulBYJ.html
20-07-2020||India||After former head priest of Tirumala dies of Covid-19, TTD under pressure to shut temple||The death of a former chief priest of Lord Venkateshwara Swamy temple in Tirumala due to Covid-19 on Monday lent credence to the demand of the priests and employees of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams for a temporary closure of the temple for darshans to check the spread of the coronavirus.Srinivasa Murthy Deekshitulu (75), one of the 18 priests of Tirumala temple who had tested positive for Covid-19 last week, passed away at Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences (SVIMS).SVIMS Director B Vengamma said Deekshitulu, who was admitted to the hospital on Saturday, was suffering from co-morbidities including diabetes and kidney-related ailments.Deekshitulu, who belonged to the Archakam Peddinti family, one of the four families of hereditary priests associated with the Tirumala temple for centuries, had served as the chief priest for over two decades.He was forced to retire along with three other priests in 2018 by the previous Telugu Desam Party government. After the YSR Congress party government came to power, he had been participating in the temple rituals though his position was not restored.As per the temple custom, the last rites of any hereditary priest have to be held as per a specific procedure associated with the temple. However, in the wake of the present Covid-19 situation, the TTD decided against following the customs.Soon after the death of Deekshitulu, TTD trust board chairman Y V Subba Reddy flew to Vijayawada to have a meeting with chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy to discuss the demand from various sections of the TTD for closure of the temple for darshans by pilgrims.Subba Reddy told the reporters last week that 15 out of 50 priests at Tirumala temple had tested positive, apart from 140 TTD employees since the famous temple was re-opened for darshan on June 8.Honorary head priest of the temple A V Ramana Deekshitulu found fault with the TTD authorities for continuing to allow darshans in the temple despite a surge in Covid-19 cases in Tirumala.He alleged that the TTD officials were obediently following anti-hereditary archaka and anti-Brahmin policy of TDP led by N Chandrababu Naidu. “Disaster if this continues. Please take action,” he requested the CM.The TTD Staff and Workers United Front, affiliated to the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, submitted a representation to TTD Executive Officer Anil Kumar Singhal requesting that darshan at the temple be temporarily suspended in the wake of growing number of positive cases on the Tirumala hills.The TTD staff pointed out that more than 1,000 positive cases of Covid-19 were reported in Tirupati town and around 100 employees of the TTD had tested positive. “These employees can end up infecting devotees when they go up the hill to Tirumala to perform duties. In this context, employees are all very worried,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-former-head-priest-of-tirumala-dies-of-covid-19-ttd-under-pressure-to-shut-temple/story-ItmCA3n3rSWZzoYi7zbYRI.html
20-07-2020||India||Lucknow was a pleasant surprise: Shoojit Sircar||Filmmaker Shoojit Sircar fell in love with Lucknow when he came to shoot for his directorial ‘Gulabo Sitabo’ starring Amitabh Bachchan and Ayushmann Khurrana.“Lucknow came as a surprise to me. All I knew about it was Bada Imambara, Rumi Gate, Chota Imambara and La Martiniere. When I came for location-hunting, I discovered Chowk and was charmed. I spent a lot of time walking deep inside the different galis (lanes) in between Akbari Gate and Gol Darwaza and loved eating there. I also discovered the Qaiserbagh area. The people of the city bowled me over with their language and charmed restraint,” said the national award winning director, during a webinar, on Sunday.He shot for almost four months and it was a golden opportunity to walk around different parts of the city. He discovered architectural marvels but is sorry that much of the heritage sites are in such bad shape and neglect. The filmmaker said that he would like to see the architectural beauties in Kolkata and in Lucknow restored to their former glory and taken care of, but he is not sure how to make that possible. “The heritage kothis and havelis must be preserved,” he said.Sircar stayed at hotel Clarks Avadh because Satyajit Ray had stayed there when he came to shoot ‘Shatranj Ke Khiladi’ in the early 1970s. Shoojit said that he worships the work of Satyajit Ray.When asked repeatedly if he would return to Lucknow to film another local story, or make a film on the city’s history, especially the 1857 event, he said he would love to do that if he is inspired by an idea and the opportunity to film in the city come up. He termed his experience of filming ‘Gulabo Sitabo’ as memorable. “I was amazed to see the art of puppetry and feel sorry to see it fading away,” he said.Giving an insight on Big B he said, “Whenever Mr Bachchan shoots in a city, he usually goes to Mumbai and comes back in between but during the entire shoot he did not go even once and probably that was because he likes the city a lot.”He also revealed that shooting the scene when Big B as Mirza falls near a makkhan malai shop at the Chowk Crossing was very tough. “I cannot tell you how we shot that one scene when Mr Bachchan is having kulfi and he collapses. We were fortunate that a lot of people did not recognise him.” He also revealed that initially they were planning to shoot the film in the Jama Masjid area, Delhi.Sircar was all praise for ‘Begum’ Farruk Jaffar and other local actors who excelled in the film. Organised by Citizens of Lucknow, the webinar was hosted by Mehru Jaffar and other senior members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow-was-a-pleasant-surprise-shoojit-sircar/story-YNwBkzupYYeywX9ATAsuzJ.html

20-07-2020||India||Mamata Banerjee preps for first virtual martyrs’ day, BJP calls it a farce||With Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee preparing to observe martyrs’ day, her party’s biggest annual road show held in memory of the 13 youth Congress workers killed in police firing in Kolkata on July 21, 1993, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Bengal unit on Monday upped the ante by releasing a list of 93 party workers killed in political clashes since 2013 and said it will observe the day as ‘the day of farce’.Banerjee was a Youth Congress leader in 1993 and led an agitation on July 21against the then Left Front government in Bengal. Over the years, the rally emerged as a symbol of the TMC’s struggle since its birth in 1998 and serves as a platform from where Banerjee sends out messages and declares future plans. Held at Esplanade in the heart of Kolkata, TMC’s martyrs’ day rally is known to be the biggest crowd puller in the state but this year it will be held virtually because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Banerjee will address people on social media from her office. Giant screens and monitors are being installed in public places and TMC offices across the state. TMC workers have been asked to raise the party flag forming small groups. Last year, the rally was held after the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats. The day is important for the TMC this year because Banerjee is likely to make important announcements aimed at the crucial assembly polls in 2021 as the BJP has set an agenda to win 200 of the 294 assembly seats.“When Banerjee was not in power she used to talk of struggling for people now her party and her government bulldozes the poor. We will observe the day as the day of farce,” said BJP state president Dilip Ghosh who also released a booklet containing details of some incidents in which BJP workers were killed.“Such statements can be made only by the leader of a party that never struggled. Our martyrs’ were all common people for whom Mamata Banerjee has worked all her life,” said state power minister Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay. Having lost 18 seats to the BJP mainly because of a huge shift in Left votes in the Lok Sabha polls, Banerjee last year called the saffron force “CPI(M) in new bottle” in her martyrs’ day speech. TMC leaders said the situation has changed since then and she is likely to focus on the BJP alone on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-preps-for-first-virtual-martyrs-day-bjp-calls-it-a-farce/story-Q5WOLPlkqOHkkB5jGosIfN.html

These hospitals would, however, treat low to moderate cases only, said a source of the hospital.Kumar said in addition to private hospitals, the government would also increase the number of beds in its hospitals, including the NMCH and the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH).The state government has already asked all its medical college hospitals to have 100 isolation beds for Covid-19 cases. The PMCH was expected to commence the facility in the next couple of days, said sources.The chief secretary, whom the team members met before leaving for Delhi, said the team was generally satisfied with the measures the state had taken, especially during the lockdown, and also curbs imposed in containment zones.The team, however, advised better perimeter control and health screening of people residing within containment zones to contain the spread of the disease.Kumar said the Central team was satisfied with the “open-ended measures” the state had taken to ramp up testing through antigen rapid testing kits.“The state would now not have any testing target, but would conduct testing of all symptomatic patients, who reach our facilities or mobile testing vans,” said Kumar.The Centre had recently sent 10,000 rapid testing kits to the state.Meanwhile, testing facility had begun in 11 sub-divisional hospitals of the state on Monday, said Bihar’s health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh during the media briefing.He said the facility would begin in 27 other sub-divisional hospitals on Tuesday.Singh said there were 2,584 containment zones in Bihar of which 1,931 were in rural areas and 653 in urban areas.He said with the recovery of 938 Covid-19 patients, the total recoveries had gone up to 17,535, with a recovery percentage of 63.87%.A three-member Central team, headed by Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary in the ministry of health and family welfare (MoH&FW) had visited the NMCH to assess its condition on Sunday. Other team members were Dr SK Singh, director National Centre for Disease Control, and associate professor of AIIMS-Delhi Dr Neeraj Nischal.The team also visited the Covid-care facility in Gaya before returning to Delhi on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-cases-in-bihar-surge-to-27-455-central-team-suggests-hiking-bed-capacity/story-oRKrcOb0TOcERRvHDFRKnO.html

Enough is enough. Mr @bhupeshbaghel will be hearing from my lawyers,’’ Omar, a former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister tweeted.I am fed up of the downright malicious and false allegation that what Sachin Pilot is doing is somehow linked to my or my father’s release from detention earlier this year. Enough is enough. Mr @bhupeshbaghel will be hearing from my lawyers. Cc @RahulGandhi @INCIndia @rssurjewala https://t.co/Gojb7vN1V3Baghel in an interview to The Hindu had said, “And as far as Sachin Pilot is concerned, not that I have been tracking the Rajasthan events so closely, but it does make one curious why Omar Abdullah was released? He and Mehbooba Muftiji were booked under the same Sections of the law, while she is still languishing, he is out. Is it because Mr. Abdullah is brother-in-law of Sachin Pilot?”Following Omar’s threat, Baghel took to Twitter to say, “Please do not try to turn this tragic demise of democracy into an opportune moment Omar Abdullah ji. The ‘allegation’ was only a question asked, and we will keep asking it, as will the country.”The tragic demise of democracy began with the imprisonment of the leaders who believe in democracy like Mr. Abdullah, Ms. Mufti and other leaders of Kashmir. The release of @OmarAbdullah is duly welcomed but we shall continue to demand the release of all others. (1/2)The NC leader dismissed Baghel’s comeback saying the Congress doesn’t know its friends from its opponents.“You can send your answer to my lawyers. This is what is wrong with the Congress today, you don’t know your friends from your opponents. This is why you people are in the mess you are in. Your ‘question’ was malicious and will not go uncontested,” he said in another tweet.The National Conference also condemned Baghel comments.“The party has taken note of and expresses strong objection to an interview given by CM of Chhattisgarh Bhupesh Baghel wherein he had maliciously suggested that the release of our Vice President Omar Abdullah from preventive detention was somehow related to Sachin Pilot or the present political situation unraveling in Rajasthan,” the NC said in a statement.‘’The party unequivocally rejects such malicious, false and politically motivated statements that are used for convenient political posturing,’’ the statement said. This statement further said apart from being false and scurrilous the allegation is also defamatory to the reputation of Omar Abdullah. ‘’It is within the province of public knowledge that the release of Omar Abdullah happened after judicial intervention was sought from the Supreme Court and the illegal order of detention of Abdullah was challenged. Given the indefensible nature of the illegal detention order the same was revoked by the Government during the course of the proceedings before the Supreme Court,’’ the statement said.Omar’s sister, Sarah Abdullah is married to Sachin Pilot. She had approached the Supreme Court in February and challenged her brother’s detention under the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act (PSA) under which he was imprisoned.Later, the government withdrew the Public Safety Act of Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah and they both were freed. Currently only one former chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti who is also the PDP president is detained under Public Safety Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omar-abdullah-fumes-after-chhattisgarh-cm-links-his-release-to-sachin-pilot/story-uq57OclVzxTn3ap8ATOGwL.html

The additional director general of the state’s Criminal Investigation Department would monitor the probe.The Mamata Banerjee administration had earlier handed over the case to the CID which is now probing the case. The post mortem report had hinted that Roy may have committed suicide even though the chemical analysis report is still pending. Police investigation had suggested that Roy committed suicide after he was duped by his business partners.

The man’s father Yenkappa Talwar filed a complaint claiming that his son was assaulted for touching the bike of an upper-caste man named Mahantesh Devendrappa Basti on Saturday morning. The case was registered after a video of an assault on Kashinath went viral.In the complaint, Yenkappa claimed that his son was abused because of his caste. He also claimed that when he, his wife, and daughter tried to rescue Kashinath they were also assaulted and abused using caste slurs.However, two women from the village have filed a counter-complaint that Kashinath was beaten up by angry villagers for continuously eve-teasing women and making sexually suggestive remarks. In the complaint, they also said Kashinath was a repeat offender. They have alleged that Kashinath would undress and misbehave when they went to wash clothes in the village pond. District SP Anupama Agarwal said that both cases have been registered and four people have been detained for questioning.

In Hyderabad, as many as 30 volunteers have registered with the NIMS for the clinical trials.“Of them, seven more subjects are available and they would be administered the vaccine in the next few days,” NIMS director Dr K Manohar said.Also read: Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate is safe, early results showAccording to an official familiar with the development, the volunteers are being drawn from different parts of the state. These subjects would be administered two doses of the vaccine. There will be three types of vaccines — three micrograms, six micrograms and placebo. Each subject would be given the second dose of the same vaccine after 14 days.For two days after administering the vaccine, the subjects would be monitored by a team of doctors in the Intensive Critical Care Unit (ICCU) before being discharged.“Their health condition will be monitored from time to time. The doctors would also look into the interaction with the vaccine digitally as well as through frequent physical check-ups,” the official said.Meanwhile, King George Hospital (KGH) in Andhra Pradesh’s D, which was also selected by the ICMR for clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccine, is yet to commence the exercise.“We have got the approval from the ICMR, but are yet to get the clearance from the state government. We have written to the Director of Medical Education to give the nod for clinical trials and once we get it, we shall start,” Dr K Indira Devi, in-charge superintendent of the KGH, told Hindustan Times.She said the selection of subjects would be done only after getting an approval from the state government. “As of now, we have not identified any subjects,” she said.The first phase of clinical trials would go on for 28 days, after which ICMR and Drug Controller General of India (DGCI) would accord permission for the second phase which will include more subjects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clinical-trials-for-covid-19-vaccine-begin-in-hyderabad-s-nims/story-cphbLJ9sEq5mZwNCV72iRP.html

Efforts will focus on operationalisation of the aircraft at the earliest,” said Wing Commander Indranil Nandi. A formal induction ceremony will take place next month, he said.The air force is inducting the fighters at a time of heightened military tensions with China. Hindustan Times on Sunday reported that the IAF could deploy its new Rafale fighters in the Ladakh sector as part of India’s overarching plan to strengthen its military posture in the region, where Indian and Chinese forces are locked in a tense border confrontation and disengagement has turned out to be a challenging process.India-specific enhancements on the jets include cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases.Acting on a special request by the IAF, France has accelerated the deliveries of Rafale fighters to India --- five jets are coming instead of four that were originally planned to be delivered in the first batch.Preparations are currently on to fly the jets to India with a stopover at Al Dhafra air base near Abu Dhabi in the United Arab EmiratesThe French air force will refuel the Indian fighters using its Airbus A330 multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) aircraft on their way to Al Dhafra from where aerial refueling support is expected to be provided by the IAF’s Russian Ilyushin-78 refuellers.India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016 as an emergency purchase to arrest the worrying slide in the IAF’s combat capabilities.The possible deployment of Rafale fighters in Ladakh could be discussed at the IAF commanders’ conference in New Delhi from July 22 to 24 where the air force brass is expected to focus on the ongoing border row with China, the IAF’s preparedness and new purchases that have to be made fast.“During the three-day conference, the discussions would take stock of the current operational scenario and deployments. The plan of action for operational capability enhancement of the IAF in the next decade will also be discussed,” Nandi said. IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria will chair the conference. IAF in the Next Decade is the theme of the conference.According to the original delivery schedule, the first 18 jets (including the four in the first batch) were to be delivered to the IAF by February 2021, with the rest expected in April-May 2022. Future deliveries will also be expedited.France handed over to India its first Rafale fighter during a ceremony attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh and his French counterpart, Florence Parly, in Merignac on October 8 last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-to-induct-5-rafale-jets-at-ambala-air-base-on-july-29/story-ioxKxAkNLJeO5ucLE4xiaK.html
20-07-2020||India||‘Worrisome law and order situation’: Bengal Guv reports to Amit Shah||West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Monday told Union home minister Amit Shah about the “worrisome” law and order situation in the eastern state, adding it was on the “edge of a cliff” and cited the healthcare management, nepotism in cyclone relief distribution and the general governance as examples to drive home his point. The governor has been raising these issues on the social media platforms and in his interactions with state ministers and bureaucrats for a long time but this is the first time he met Shah to officially report his assessment. “Worrisome and dangerously deteriorating law and order situation, targeting political opponents and the highly partisan role of police was also discussed. The role of police leaves much to be desired and focused that it was high time exemplary action was taken against senior police officials who act in disregard of the conduct rules,” the governor’s house said in the statement.“Rampant corruption and nepotism in Amphan relief distribution also figured in the discussion. Governor Dhankhar indicated that the relief, rather than benefiting the needy and entitled persons, was unashamedly siphoned off by the members of the ruling party… State has taken no steps in law to deal with this monumental corruption. Cover up of this has been a mere eyewash in the media,” the Raj Bhawan said. It added that nepotism led to widespread unrest and violence.“Governor Dhankhar shared his concern with the Union Home Minister at the alarming Covid-19 situation with figures of Covid 19 deaths and positive cases rising to a higher level day by day and abysmal lack of health facilities for the suffering people, both Covid and non covid. People are in a state of deep worry at this grim scenario,” said the statement.Appointed governor on July 20 last year, the governor’s relationship with the TMC government and chief minister Mamata Banerjee has been marked by acrimony through a chain of events since September 2019.Significantly, Dhankhar’s meeting with Shah took place a day before the TMC chief was preparing to observe July 21 as martyrs’ day in memory of the youths who died in police firing in 1993 in Kolkata during a law violation programme by the state Youth Congress which she led at that time.The day is special for the TMC and Banerjee, especially this year, because she is likely to announce her next political programme aimed at the crucial assembly polls in 2021. The Bharatiya Janata Party, which won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019, has set an agenda to win 200 of the 294 assembly seats and capture the eastern state.“This is most unfortunate and I would say the unbecoming of a governor. In my long political career I have not seen a governor like him,” said Tapas Roy, senior TMC leader and minister of state for parliamentary affairs.Prof Amal Kumar Mukhopadhyay, an expert on the Indian Constitution and former principal of Presidency College, said Dhankhar did his duty and the ruling party should have no reason to criticise him.“As the governor is appointed by the Centre it is his duty to report whatever is happening in West Bengal. He has to send a monthly report to the Union government, practically to the home minister, for which he does not have to take the advice of the state cabinet. He has not done anything wrong by choosing to talk to the home minster,” Mukhopadhyay told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/worrisome-law-and-order-situation-bengal-guv-reports-to-amit-shah/story-gttwrUakDoSXYDKL59g0nJ.html

The IBM CEO briefed the prime minister about his company’s huge investment plans in India and expressed confidence in the vision of an ‘Aatma nirbhar Bharat’ (a self-reliant India), the statement said. “The prime minister highlighted that this is a great time to invest in India. He said the country is welcoming and supporting investments taking place in the tech sector. He noted that while the world is witnessing slowdown, FDI inflow in India is increasing,” the statement said.In the course of interaction, Modi explored the possibilities of creating India-specific artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools in the healthcare sector and development of better models for disease prediction and analysis.He underlined that the country is moving towards developing an integrated, tech and data-driven healthcare system which is affordable and hassle-free for the people.Modi noted that IBM can play an important role in taking forward the healthcare vision.Krishna appreciated the prime minister’s vision for Ayushman Bharat (the all-India healthcare scheme) and talked about using technology for early identification of diseases. Modi appreciated the role played by IBM, in association with CBSE, towards launching of AI curriculum in 200 schools in India. He said the government is working towards introducing students to concepts such as AI and machine learning at an early stage, to further the tech temperament in the country. Krishna said teaching about technology and data should be in the category of basic skills like algebra, which needs to be taught with passion, and should be introduced early. Other areas of discussion included the issues of data security, cyber attacks, concerns around privacy and health benefits of yoga. Modi also congratulated Krishna on becoming the global head of IBM earlier this year. He mentioned the strong connection of IBM with India and its huge presence in the country, with over one lakh people working across 20 cities in the company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/great-time-to-invest-in-india-pm-modi-tells-ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna/story-eSPwIxdYqhSLodD6LLKBmL.html

A huge well done to our brilliant, scientists and researchers at the University of Oxford. There are no guarantees, we’re not there yet and further trials will be necessary – but this is an important step in the right direction.”Scientists involved in the trials have said the vaccine caused minor side effects more frequently than a control group, but some of these effects could be reduced by taking common paracetamol, with no serious harmful effects from the vaccine.Here’s all you need to know about Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate:1. The vaccine has been called AZD1222 and was under development by pharma giant AstraZeneca in collaboration with scientists at Britain’s Oxford University.2. The first human trial of the Covid-19 vaccine has indicated it is safe for use on healthy volunteers.3. The new vaccine is a chimpanzee adenovirus viral vector (ChAdOx1) vaccine that expresses the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. It uses a common cold virus (adenovirus) that infects chimpanzees, which has been weakened so that it can’t cause any infection in humans, and then has been genetically modified to code for the spike protein of the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, according to scientists working with the pharma major.4. The human immune system has two ways of finding and attacking viral pathogens – antibody and T-cell responses. This experimental vaccine is intended to induce both, so it can attack the coronavirus when it’s circulating in the body, as well as attack infected cells.5. The widely-followed clinical trial is currently at an advanced stage, with ongoing trials in the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa.6. Oxford University has tied up with pharma major AstraZeneca and the British government to produce the vaccine on a mass scale if the final results turn out to be positive. 7. The Serum Institute of India is one of the global partners for the production of the Covid-19 vaccine on a large scale, once it gains regulatory approval.8. A lot more research is needed before it can be confirmed that the experimental vaccine effectively protects against the Covid-19 infection and for how long that protection is likely to last in an infected patient..9. AstraZeneca’s is among the leading vaccine candidates against the Covid-19 pandemic that has claimed more than 6,00,000 lives worldwide.10. Some of the other vaccines candidates being developed and in the forefront of the frantic search for an effective one are China’s Sinovac Biotech, another from state-owned Chinese firm Sinopharm, and one from the U.S. biotech firm Moderna. 11. The British pharma giant has signed agreements with governments around the world to supply the vaccine should it prove effective and gain regulatory approval. The company has said it will not seek to profit from the vaccine during the Covid-19 pandemic. 12. There is currently no working vaccine against Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and experts say one will be needed to control the pandemic that has infected millions of people around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/initial-human-trial-of-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-brings-hope-found-safe-all-you-need-to-know/story-MDaZB7z2i89ZrINDA4y3kM.html

A bulletin issued by Bikram Singh, director, Regional Meteorological Centre, stated, “Heavy to very heavy rainfall with intense to very intense spells is very likely (60% probability) to occur over Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, Chamoli, Bageshwar and Pithoragarh districts of Uttarakhand between Tuesday and Thursday.”These districts are likely to experience landslides, boulder fall, overflowing of gushing streams and blockade or a washout of link roads.The IMD authorities advised the district administrations to be on their guard and maintain a strict vigil at settlements such as people living nears banks of rivulets, streams and landslide-prone areas.There is a forecast for heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places in Dehradun, Haridwar, Tehri, Pauri, Nainital, and Almora districts in the Himalayan state between Tuesday and Thursday.Praveen Alok, an official from the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), on Monday, said that in the past 24 hours, over 500 people were evacuated to safer places by alternate route after a road was blocked at Pipalkoti in Chamoli district on Sunday. Eight rescue operations were conducted by SDRF personnel and some are still underway across the hill state.Officials from State Emergency Operations Centre said that National Highway-(NH) 58, which leads to the Badrinath shrine, was blocked near Lambagad, a landslide-prone area till Monday afternoon. The Thal-Munisyari highway was also blocked at three places. Work is in progress to clear the debris.State officials, however, exuded confidence of meeting the annual nature’s fury during monsoon.Ravinath Raman, commissioner, Garhwal Mandal, said regular review meetings with district magistrates (DMs) are being conducted to monitor the situation.“We have instructed all DMs to take precautionary measures and ensure the safety of people in the hilly regions during monsoon. Satellite phones for improved communication; protection equipment such as torches and ropes for rescue have already been provided to all district authorities. Funds are also available with the district authorities to give compensation to anyone affected due to heavy rainfall,” said Raman.Leaves of all field staff engaged in disaster management have been cancelled until September, he added.Officials have also identified cloudburst-prone areas in Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, and Chamoli districts in Garhwal, and Bageshwar and Pithoragarh districts in Kumaon, where DMs have been asked to keep an additional vigil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imd-issues-red-alert-in-uttarakhand-s-five-districts-for-next-3-days/story-ySdjoWL3InpaoYyJX7h7iN.html
20-07-2020||India||Districts in MP, Bihar, Telangana most vulnerable to Covid-19 pandemic: Lancet study||Districts in Madhya Pradesh may be the most vulnerable to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, followed by those in Bihar and Telangana, according to a study in The Lancet journal which assessed several key indicators like housing, hygiene, and the health system in these states. According to scientists, including Rajib Acharya from the Population Council, New Delhi, vulnerability in the research means the risk of consequences of infection, including spread, morbidity, mortality, and social and economic effects of the pandemic. The study noted that nine of 30 large states -- Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Telangana, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Odisha, and Gujarat -- have high vulnerability to be impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. It rated the vulnerabilities of the states to the pandemic on a scale from zero to one, measured using 15 indicators across five domains -- socioeconomic, demographic, housing and hygiene, epidemiological, and health system. “Our index aims to help planners and policy makers effectively prioritise regions for resource allocation and adopt risk mitigation strategies for better preparedness and responses to the Covid-19 epidemic,” the scientists, including Rajib Acharya from Population Council, New Delhi, noted in the study. They identified a number of vulnerable districts in India, which currently do not have large numbers of Covid-19 cases but could be strongly impacted by the pandemic.They said a number of districts in the nine large states -- Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Odisha, and Gujarat -- located in every region of the country except the northeast, had high overall vulnerability. According to the researchers, these states also had high vulnerability with respect to most of the five domains. Madhya Pradesh had an overall vulnerability score of one, with Sikkim on the other end with a score of zero, making it the least vulnerable. Arunachal Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh were two other states on the lower overall vulnerability end of the scale. “Although our intention was not to predict the risk of infection for a district or a state, we observed similarities between vulnerability and the current concentration of Covid-19 cases at the state level,” they wrote in the study. However, the researchers said this relationship was not clear for districts, adding that better data collection at this regional level can help make more refined evaluations of vulnerability in their respective states. They also added that data used in the study are two to five years old and might not have captured vulnerability well in districts in which rapid changes have occurred up to the present day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/districts-in-mp-bihar-telangana-most-vulnerable-to-covid-19-pandemic-lancet-study/story-CGMqwwMzdetzmeen7URfmM.html

20-07-2020||India||HC asks state, NIA if Varavara Rao’s family can see him in the hospital||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday asked the Maharashtra government and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to respond to a plea on whether the family members of Telugu poet and social activist, P Varavara Rao (81), who is an accused in the Elgar Parishad/Bhima Koregaon case, be allowed to see him from a distance at Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital following his worsening health condition.Rao, who had tested coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive on July 16 and suffers from old-age related health issues such as neurological ailments, was transferred on Sunday morning to Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital from the state-run St George’s Hospital, whose healthcare facilities are few and far between.The court issued the directions after Rao’s counsel Sudeep Pasbola informed the bench that the undertrial could be “on the verge of death” and his bail application be expedited.The court paid heed to Pasbola’s prayer and directed the state government and NIA to respond by Wednesday and his bail plea will be heard the following day.Pasbola informed a two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices SS Shinde and PV Tavade, that Rao’s health condition was rapidly worsening since he was lodged in Navi Mumbai’s Taloja Jail.It had further aggravated after he was shifted to Sir JJ Hospital last week, he added.His counsel said his multiple health issues have flared up since he tested Covid-19 positive. Rao also suffered a head injury following a fall from his bed at Sir JJ Hospital.“Mr. Rao is in an extremely critical condition and it can be said that he is on the verge of death. His wife, through an affidavit filed on July 15, has requested permission to see him at the hospital,” submitted Pasbola.The counsel cited his critical health condition and his wife’s request to pray before the bench that his bail plea must be heard expeditiously. The gravity of Rao’s health condition overtook the issues raised in an earlier plea, filed last week through advocate R Satyanarayan, seeking an inquiry against the superintendent of Taloja Jail, and the matter could not be heard on Monday.The petition has alleged that the jail authorities did not comply with the prescription issued by the doctors at Sir JJ Hospital, when Rao was admitted there on May 28, leading to the worsening of his health condition. He had become delirious and incoherent, which was also corroborated by his wife and daughters, when they spoke to him over the phone on July 11.Additional solicitor-general Anil Singh, who appeared for NIA, submitted that Rao has been accorded the best possible treatment at Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital after he suffered the head injury. He is being taken care of as per the guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), he added.Singh also cited ICMR guidelines to make the point that the next of kin of Covid-19 patients are barred from any visitation right at a hospital.Public prosecutor Deepak Thakare, who appeared for Maharashtra government, submitted before the court that Rao’s family members could interact with him via a video link. Later, both Singh and Thakare informed the court that they would take instructions from their respective authorities and the bail plea will be heard on Thursday.On May 28, Rao was taken to Sir JJ Hospital after he had lost consciousness. Later, he was discharged on June 1. At that time, the family members had alleged that he was hurriedly discharged in a bid to obstruct his bail plea before the special NIA court, a fear that came true on June 26.The NIA, which had taken over the Elgar Parishad case from Pune Police in February, had opposed the bail plea, as Rao was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act (UAAPA), 2019, where there is no provision to grant him temporary bail.Earlier, on January 1, 2018, violence erupted between Dalits and Marathas near the village of Bhima Koregaon in Pune district, where thousands of Dalits had gathered to mark the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Koregaon.In the battle, the British Army’s Dalit Mahar soldiers had defeated the Brahmin Peshwa rulers of the Maratha empire.The commemoration took place a day after an event in Pune called the Elgar Parishad was held.The Pune Police conducted a preliminary probe and claimed that the violence in Bhima Koregaon was the result of speeches made at the Elgar Parishad event.They alleged that banned Maoist groups organised the event, and a first information report (FIR) was also filed.In June 2018, the Pune Police arrested five activists and lawyers from Pune, Nagpur, and Delhi – Surendra Gadling, Mahesh Raut, Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, and Shoma Sen – for their alleged links to the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist), and also for organising the Elgar Parishad event.In August 2018, the police arrested four more activists – Sudha Bharadwaj, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, and Rao.While Gautam Navlakha and Dr. Anand Teltumbde were arrested on April 14 this year, taking the total number of the accused in the case to 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-asks-state-nia-if-varavara-rao-s-family-can-see-him-in-the-hospital/story-0fvNKwVOqBFf0oZpG5xpTP.html

20-07-2020||India||Row over invitation to PM Modi for Ram Temple bhoomi pujan unwarranted: VHP||The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has defended the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust’s invitation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the bhoomi pujan on August 5 to mark the beginning of the temple construction in Uttar Pradesh’s Ayodhya amid criticism by the Congress and the NCP for different reasons. It has also asserted that the groundbreaking ceremony will be performed in line with all the laid down protocols for ensuring distancing and safekeeping during the Covid-19 pandemic.On Monday, Alok Kumar, the international working president of the VHP, an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh said the controversy over the invitation to the PM who is yet to confirm his presence, is unwarranted.“There is no confirmation on who will be present for the ceremony. The invitations have been sent out by the trust after deciding the names unanimously,” he said. Reacting to Congressman Hussain Dalwai’s comment that former PM Jawaharlal Nehru had refused to attend a similar ceremony for the Somnath Temple which was reconstructed, Kumar said Indian secularism celebrates all religions and does not negate them. “The secularism to us means that the state does not prefer of patronize any religion and treats all of them equally,” he said.He went on to add, “It is a matter of record that PM Nehru had declined to attend the inauguration of Somnath Temple. However this is only half-truth. It must be recalled that Somnath Temple was inaugurated by the then President Dr. Rajendra Prasad. Nehru had sent a letter to Prasad advising that the President of a secular country should not attend the temple function. Dr. Rajendra Prasad had retorted that he was prepared to resign from the Presidency if that was Nehru’s view of the matter. Nehru did not pursue the matter.”Former chief minister and Congress MP Digvijay Singh also questioned the invitation to the PM. Talking to news agency ANI he said If PM Modi lays the foundation stone of the temple on August 5, all Shankaracharyas and Swami Ramnareshacharya ji of Ramanandi sect should be invited to the function and made members of the Nyas. He also objected to the Centre’s decision of not including Shankaracharyas in the Nyas, but filling it up with VHP and BJP leaders.Reacting to Singh’s statement Kumar said, it was the Supreme Court’s decision to allow the central government to appoint the trust.On the allegations that the ceremony is being held in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, Kumar said, “We believe that the central government, the government of UP and other governments are engaged in a determined war against Corona and on all fronts. They have successfully contained the endemic. India is progressing in finding a vaccine.”NCP supremo Sharad Pawar had also criticized the timing of the bhumi pujan and said while the Maharashtra government’s priority is to handle the Covid crisis, some feel that the coronavirus pandemic will vanish by erecting the Ram Temple.The VHP hit back saying that the country and its life cannot be put on hold for an indefinite period. “Efforts are being made to resume normal life while taking precautions. The efforts to revive the economy, industry and services are urgently necessary and are being attempted. Similarly all social, religious and spiritual activities must go on,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-over-invitation-to-pm-modi-for-ram-temple-bhoomi-pujan-unwarranted-vhp/story-cn0vyeTLyOzBYZJr18lPdJ.html
20-07-2020||India||‘More concocted allegations coming’: Sachin Pilot after MLA’s bribe charge||Rebel Congress leader Sachin Pilot said on Monday that he was “saddened but not surprised” and called the allegations against him of offering money to a party MLA to switch to BJP as “baseless”. The former deputy chief minister of Rajasthan said this was a clear attempt to undermine his reputation and take the focus away from the substantive issue he has raised against the party leadership of the state.“I am saddened but not surprised to be at the receiving end of such baseless and vexatious allegations being levelled against me. This is done solely to malign me and to stifle the legitimate concerns that I had raised against the party leadership of the state, as a member and MLA of INC. This attempt further aims at defaming me and attack my credibility,” said Sachin Pilot in a statement. Without disclosing the amount offered, Rajasthan Congress MLA Giriraj Singh Malinga said at the talks held at Pilot’s house he was offered money to switch allegiance to the BJP. The MLA said he subsequently told chief minister Ashok Gehlot about the plan. ALSO WATCH | Rajasthan audio tapes row: Congress demands Gajendra Shekhawat’s resignation “I had a talk with Sachinji. He offered me money to join the BJP, but I refused, saying I will not join the saffron party,” Malinga was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Pilot, sacked as deputy CM and president of the Rajasthan Congress unit last week, said more such lies are in the offing to tar his image.“I will be taking appropriate and strictest possible legal action against the MLA who was made to make these accusations. I am sure more such concocted allegations will be thrown at me to cause aspersions on my public image. But I shall be unfettered and remain firm in my beliefs and convictions,” said Pilot.The former Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA from Badi, along with five other legislators of the Mayawati-led party, was inducted into the Congress in September last year. The lawmakers had handed over affidavits to state Assembly Speaker CP Joshi to merge the legislative party with the Congress.Earlier today, CM Gehlot again repeated his charge against his former deputy of being hand in glove with the BJP to destabilise his government. Taking a swipe at the young leader, the CM said who would have believed that a person with an “innocent face” will try and do such a thing. Pilot, who is categorical in his denial of the BJP, has repeatedly called all such accusations of him trying to dislodge the government a false charge. The simmering tension between the two leaders reached its apogee when Pilot was served summons to record his statement by the Rajasthan police’s special team probing an alleged conspiracy to topple the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/saddened-but-not-surprised-sachin-pilot-denies-offering-money-to-mla/story-Y9kFbhAihRHhPFBRGhrVMM.html
20-07-2020||India||‘Local community transmission of Covid-19 cases likely happening in hotspots: AIIMS Director||Certain areas of the national capital have hit their peak in Covid-19 cases while certain other areas in the city are yet to reach the peak, said AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria on Monday. He further said that there is not much evidence of community transmission happening at the national level.“Certain areas have hit their peak in Covid-19 cases. Delhi seems to have done so because the cases have declined significantly. Certain areas have yet to reach the peak. Cases are increasing in certain states. They will reach the peak a little later,” Dr Guleria said here while addressing a press conference here.The national capital had witnessed a surge in the cases of novel coronavirus cases over the past one month. However, the number of active cases has seen a dip over the past few weeks.“But there are hotspots, even in cities where there is spike of cases and it very likely that local community transmission in those areas is happening,” he said.The Union Health Ministry said there are a total of 12,2793 Covid-19 cases in Delhi including 16,031 active cases and 3,628 deaths. Over one lakh people have been cured/discharged/migrated in the national capital.On Monday, India’s Covid-19 case tally crossed the 11 lakh mark with the highest single-day spike of 40,425 new cases and 681 deaths reported in the last 24 hours.Further, the AIIMS director said that the mortality rate in South East Asia, including India, is much lower than in European countries like Italy and Spain and even in the United States.“If you look at the data from Southeast Asia, not just India, the mortality rate is much lower than what happened in Italy and Spain or what is happening in the United States,” he said.Two days after announcing that All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) will conduct the human clinical trial of the indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine candidate Covaxin, Dr Guleria said that the trial will be conducted in three phases.“Phase 1 vaccine trial will be conducted on healthy people aged 18-55 years who have no co-morbidity. A total of 1125 samples have been collected of which 375 people will be studied in the first phase and 750 people between 12-65 years will be studied in the second phase,” said Guleria.“To test the efficacy and effectiveness of the vaccine a trial will be conducted under phase-3. The trail will be conducted in AIIMS,” he added.AIIMS Ethics Committee on Saturday gave its approval for conducting the human clinical trial of the indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine candidate Covaxin.The country’s top drug regulator had recently given a green signal for human clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccine candidate Covaxin, which has been developed by the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the ICMR and the National Institute of Virology (NIV).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/likely-local-community-transmission-of-covid-19-cases-happening-in-hotspots-aiims-director/story-MzYY7JZi89bpeOLv9orvEL.html
20-07-2020||India||Ex-Andhra top poll officer takes reinstatement plea to Guv; Jagan moves SC||The tussle between retired IAS officer Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar and Andhra Pradesh government over his reinstatement as the state election commissioner (SEC) took another turn on Monday.While Ramesh Kumar approached governor Biswabhushan Harichandan requesting that he be restored as the SEC as per the directions of the state high court, the Jagan Mohan Reddy government on Monday moved the Supreme Court again to stall any such move.The high court, which is presently hearing a contempt petition by Ramesh Kumar against the state government, gave an interim order last week, asking him to make a fresh representation to the governor.Nimmagadda, who met the Governor at the Raj Bhavan in Vijayawada, contended that the high court had confirmed his reinstatement as SEC, as the Supreme Court had dismissed the petition of the state government thrice and refused to grant the stay.In a statement after the meeting, Ramesh Kumar said the governor had given him a sympathetic hearing and assured to look into his representation. “I am hopeful to get justice at the earliest,” he said.However, the YSRCP government moved the Supreme Court again seeking a stay on the high court taking up the contempt petition filed by Ramesh Kumar. It argued that the high court could not take up such a contempt petition at a time when the matter was pending before the apex court.It may be recalled that the Jagan government had, on April 10, removed Ramesh Kumar from the post of SEC through an ordinance reducing the tenure of the SEC from five to three years and appointed a retired judge in his place.Ramesh Kumar challenged the ordinance in the high court, which struck down the same on May 29. The state government moved the SC challenging the high court order and sought a stay, but the top court refused to grant the same.When the government refused to reinstate him as the SEC, the retired IAS officer filed a contempt petition last week. The high court asked him to approach the governor and posted the case to Friday for next hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ex-andhra-top-poll-officer-takes-reinstatement-plea-to-guv-jagan-moves-sc/story-uQPelyGkNFyFCbtfs3JXHO.html
20-07-2020||India||‘Phone tapping assault on freedom, bringing down elected govt with money treachery’: Sena on Rajasthan crisis||The Shiv Sena has called the phone-tapping order by the ruling Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan, which is caught in a bitter internal power struggle with the sacked deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot’s faction of 19 rebel lawmakers, an assault on personal freedom and termed the attempt to bring down a democratically elected dispensation “unconstitutional”.Saamana, the Sena mouthpiece, carried an editorial on Monday that stated the jury is still out on which is a bigger crime – a state government order for phone tapping or a bid to topple a democratically elected government.The Gehlot government has claimed that there has been a concerted bid to dislodge the ruling dispensation following the surfacing of three audiotapes last Thursday evening that quickly went viral on social media.The Congress has accused Jodhpur Member of Parliament (MP) and Union Minister for Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat as the villain of the piece in cahoots with two dissident party lawmakers in an alleged plot to oust the Gehlot government. The tapes did make a reference to one Gajendra Singh, which bolstered the Congress, to accuse him of indulging in horse-trading.The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has sought a report from Rajasthan chief secretary over the alleged “illegal tapping of phones”. “Phone tapping is an offence and assault on personal freedom. It is treachery to bring down a democratically elected government by the lure of lucre. However, it needs to be decided which one is a bigger crime,” the editorial said.“There is nothing wrong if the MHA wants to probe the phone-tapping incident. But the key question is: if the Gehlot government has indeed eavesdropped the purported phone conversations, what state of emergency had erupted in the state or the country?” it asked.The Marathi daily made a play for the former Congress president Rahul Gandhi.It said several skeletons would tumble out of the cupboard, if the conversations among power-hungry Congress leaders became public and they reached Gandhi. It cited that the disputes within the Congress’s ranks are unending and a certain section within Gandhi’s party didn’t want him to succeed. “The Rajasthan phone-tapping episode has exposed many. But, a lot of revelation will come to the fore if someone hears the secret conversations among Congress leaders and they reach Gandhi. Some people have been hell-bent on not letting Gandhi work properly. This is hurting the entire opposition,” it said. The editorial said that Gehlot has foiled the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) plans amid the generational war between the Rajasthan CM and his challenger Pilot. “The deal, which was on between the BJP and Pilot, was about an exchange of cash for power. It was decided that the elected Rajasthan government would be brought down by horse-trading through cash inducements,” the editorial alleged.“CM Gehlot exposed Pilot’s rebellion, which was less against injustice, and brought to light by the phone conversations between the sacked deputy CM and BJP leaders. It is both shocking and sensational,” it further alleged.The editorial questioned the BJP’s radio silence over Shekhawat’s alleged role.“Why those who are seeking the President’s rule in Rajasthan have not made Shekhawat resign? First, make Shekhawat resign, atone for poaching of the lawmakers and then point a finger towards the Gehlot government,” the editorial said while adding that phone tapping is not restricted to Rajasthan alone.The Sena also took a potshot at ally-turned-rival BJP.“In the Rajasthan episode, the condition of the BJP is such that they set out to do something, but something contrary happened … games are being played these days to weaken opponents politically, socially and mentally by dislodging them from their governments (across states),” it signed off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bringing-down-elected-govt-with-money-is-treachery-says-shiv-sena-on-rajasthan-political-crisis/story-gjefpQ1GvW0cuLSkhx8AzL.html

20-07-2020||India||Customs grill gunman of UAE consular’s attaché in Kerala gold smuggling case||Customs sleuths probing the Kerala gold smuggling case on Monday questioned the gunman of United Arab Emirates (UAE) consular’s attaché who is recuperating in a hospital after an alleged suicide attempt on July 17, a top official said.He reportedly told them that though he escorted some consignments as directed by consulate officials he never had any idea about the content and he came to know about the concealed gold from media reports.But investigators feel he is an important link in the smuggling racket and the suicide attempt was a drama he enacted to divert attention. They said he will be questioned again after his discharge from the hospital.“Our investigation is proceeding well. Different agencies are involved. Those who are arrested by the customs will be booked under Customs Act sections 112 A, 112 B, 132 and 133. We will go after those who helped them in the offence. We will get to the bottom of the syndicate this time,” said Customs Commissioner in-charge of Kerala and Laksshdweep Sumit Kumar.The Customs had seized 30 kg gold from a consignment that came in the name of an official of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on July 5. Later the case was handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) but many other central agencies are also involved in the probe. The NIA has arrested four persons and Customs 13 in the case so far.The smuggling racket has forced the Left-front government to sack two high-ranking officials - Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s powerful principal secretary M Sivasankar and his IT fellow Arun Balachandran, for their alleged links with some of the accused.The CPI (M) has called a meeting of staff members of all ministers on July 23 where it is expected to chalk out a strict code of conduct for them. Some parties in the ruling coalition feel that a free hand to some of the bureaucrats led to such a pass that dented the image of the government when assembly polls are just nine months away.Meanwhile state opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala has written a letter to CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury drawing his attention to latest developments in the state.“We want to know whether the party condescends to the consultancy raj being promoted by CM Pinarayi Vijayan. Now the NIA is set to widen its scope of investigation including the CM’s office,” he said in the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/customs-grill-gunman-of-uae-consular-s-attache-in-kerala-gold-smuggling-case/story-4duQhGfACfJziwzXqFOM5M.html

20-07-2020||India||Amid power tussle with Sachin Pilot, CM Ashok Gehlot’s message to young leaders||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday said that young political leaders should have a little patience and the Congress party would no doubt give them many opportunities to take their political careers forward, in an oblique reference to rebel Congress leader Sachin Pilot. The chief minister and Pilot are involved in a bitter power tussle for more than a week now.“I want to tell our young leaders that we, too, got chances when we were young but we never thought of disrespecting our seniors and the party leadership. We never promoted groupism or factionalism. I was already a three-time president of the state unit when I became the Chief Minister for the first time. Young leaders should have a little patience. The party will give them many opportunities to take their political careers forward,” Gehlot said when asked why young leaders in his party were feeling restive and were keen to switch to rival political parties.Claiming that people and rivals who talk of a ‘Congress-free Bharat’ should stop daydreaming, Gehlot in an interview to Hindustan Times said every Congress member who has faith in the party’s leadership and its fundamental ideology and policies -- and who can work diligently giving priority to the party rather than selfish interests – is likely to have a bright future in the Congress party. ALSO READ | Some young leaders think they are superior to high command, says Ashok GehlotAmid the ongoing political crisis in Rajasthan, several young Congress leaders have expressed their support for Sachin Pilot. So what is it that makes the younger generation abandon the Congress and move to other political rivals? “Those who rise from frontal organisations such as the NSUI (National Students’ Union of India), Youth Congress, Seva Dal, Mahila Congress and have worked at the grassroot level cannot feel restive. They know if they’re working hard, with honesty and diligence, the party will look after them; that ample opportunities will come their way,” the Rajasthan chief minister stressed.Gehlot elaborated that he was himself an example of rising through the party ranks. He worked in NSUI, was elected as an MP at the age of 28 and then became a minister when he was 29. “I was PCC (Pradesh Congress Committee) president three times, a central minister three times, and also a party general secretary three times. Now I’m chief minister for the third time with the support and blessings of the people,” he said.

20-07-2020||India||Youth accused of rape and murder of north Bengal student found dead, BJP alleges cover up||A day after the unnatural death of a 16-year-old school girl triggered clashes between police and local people in the Chopra area of North Dinajpur district in Bengal, the body of the suspect named in the police complaint by the girl’s family was found in a ditch on Monday morning.He lived in the same village. The girl’s death had prompted the Bharatiya Janata Party to target the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC), The girl’s death also sparked clashes between the locals and the police on Sunday.The girl, who recently passed the class 10 state board exams, was raped and murdered as her family supports the BJP, the opposition party alleged on Sunday.The girl’s father made the same allegation in his police complaint on Sunday night after the West Bengal Police said that preliminary report of the post mortem examination pointed at death caused by poisoning and there was no sign of sexual assault.“The body of the youth named in the complaint has been found. An investigation is going on,” Binod Gazmer, inspector-in-charge of Chopra police station told HT on Monday afternoon.Tension was palpable in the area since the girl and the youth belonged to different religious communities. Anticipating trouble, the police stopped a team of senior BJP state leaders and members of the Lok Sabha from visiting the village.“The youth’s body was spotted submerged in water with his face jutting out of the water. It was seen not far from where the girl was found. Most of the youth’s face had turned red. Only post mortem examination can confirm the cause of death,” a police officer said on condition of anonymity. TMC district president Kanaia Lal Agarwal claimed the girl and the youth died by suicide.“The girl and the youth knew each other and went to the same private tutor. They probably committed suicide as they felt that their families might not accept their relationship,” Agarwal said.The girl’s father dismissed Agarwal’s statement and stuck to what he said in his police complaint. He alleged that his daughter was regularly harassed by the youth and he raped and murdered her. The BJP has alleged there was an attempt to cover up the girl’s death.Surajit Sen, vice president of the BJP’s North Dinajpur unit, said, “The TMC and the police are trying to project the deaths as a tragic end to an affair.”Members of the youth’s family did not speak to the media till Monday afternoon.BJP state president Dilip Ghosh alleged that the police engineered Sunday’s arson and set fire to their own vehicles to divert attention. BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha alleged that the incident proved that law and order in the state has collapsed.The West Bengal Police said on Twitter on Monday afternoon that the body of the youth had been sent for post mortem examination and the process would be videographed.

20-07-2020||India||HC asks Maharashtra, NIA to respond to plea by Gonsalves and Teltumbde to be tested for Covid-19||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday asked the Maharashtra government and National Investigation Agency (NIA) to respond to a petition filed by activists Vernon Gonsalves and Dr. Anand Teltumbde, who are lodged in Navi Mumbai’s Taloja Jail in connection with 2018 Elgar Parishad/Bhima Koregaon case, seeking directions to authorities to make the undertrials undergo coronavirus disease (Covid-19) tests.The activists are booked under the stringent The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act (UAPAA), 2019, for their alleged links with the outlawed Communist Party of India (CPI) (Maoist) and for organsing the Elgar Parishad event.They sought to undergo the Covid-19 tests, as they were in close touch with Telugu poet and social activist and a fellow accused in the case, P Varavara Rao (81), who was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, at Sir JJ Hospital on July 16. They stated in their plea that they want to undergo Covid-19 tests for their own safety and that of other inmates.Gonsalves was in close touch with Rao, as he was assigned to take care of him because of his failing health condition. The plea was moved after Rao tested Covid-19 positive.The plea also made a case for Dr. Teltumbde to undergo the Covid-19 test because he, too, was admitted to Sir JJ Hospital.Gonsalves is suffering from multiple health issues, including hypertension. While Dr. Teltumbde has a host of chronic health conditions such as bronchitis asthma, cervical spondylitis, supraspinatus tendinosis and he is susceptible to Covid-19.A two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices SS Shinde and SP Tavade, while hearing the application of Gonsalves and Dr. Teltumbde was informed by senior advocate Mihir Desai that the accused were not seeking interim bail but only asking for permission to get themselves tested for Covid-19, as they were in touch with an infected Rao.The petition, filed through advocate Devyanii Kulkarni, said both the accused are suffering from multiple health issues and they are apprehensive that they might have contracted SARS-CoV-2 from Rao.Additional Solicitor general Anil Singh, who appeared for NIA, submitted that the investigating agency did not have any objection, if the request was granted, but it had to be done as per the norms laid down by various court orders passed previously.He, however, sought time to take instructions in this regard. Public prosecutor Deepak Thakare, who represented the Maharashtra government, also sought time for similar instructions.Initially, the bench remarked that the request of the petitioners could be easily complied with, but later it sought to know whether they would be willing to be confined in isolation centres, if they test Covid-19 positive.The court said it would not pass any order and issued notices to the state government and NIA to respond to the plea by Thursday, when the case will be heard next.NIA had taken over the Elgar Parishad case from Pune Police in February.Earlier, on January 1, 2018, violence erupted between Dalits and Marathas near the village of Bhima Koregaon in Pune district, where thousands of Dalits had gathered to mark the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Koregaon.In the battle, the British Army’s Dalit Mahar soldiers had defeated the Brahmin Peshwa rulers of the Maratha empire.The commemoration took place a day after an event in Pune called the Elgar Parishad was held.The Pune Police conducted a preliminary probe and claimed that the violence in Bhima Koregaon was the result of speeches made at the Elgar Parishad event.They alleged that banned Maoist groups organised the event, and a first information report (FIR) was also filed.In June 2018, the Pune Police arrested five activists and lawyers from Pune, Nagpur, and Delhi – Surendra Gadling, Mahesh Raut, Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, and Shoma Sen – for their alleged links to the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist), and also for organising the Elgar Parishad event.In August 2018, the police arrested four more activists –Sudha Bharadwaj, Arun Ferreira, Gonsalves, and Rao.While Gautam Navlakha and Dr. Teltumbde were arrested on April 14 this year, taking the total number of the accused in the case to 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-asks-maharashtra-nia-to-respond-to-plea-by-gonsalves-and-teltumbde-to-be-tested-for-covid/story-26gZtjuO5EZh5bFM0xtS6N.html
20-07-2020||India||Some young leaders think they are superior to high command, says Ashok Gehlot||Rajasthan’s embattled chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday accused a few young leaders of putting their personal interests above the party’s leading to problems.In an interview to Hindustan Times, Gehlot, an old guard in the Congress party, said the party should strictly follow “whatever the high command decides for the betterment of the country and the party”.The veteran leader who has been locked in a power struggle with his former deputy Sachin Pilot, has accused the latter of conniving with the BJP to bring down his government. Without naming Pilot, he said some of the young leaders think “they are superior to the high command”.“I’ve always followed the directions of the high command, not just on this issue but on each and every issue. Regarding this matter, all directions will be followed. The ideology and thinking of leaders of my generation has always been to make our party strong. (But a) few young people think their personal interests are bigger than those of the party; that they are superior to the high command. That’s why problems of such kind occur. I believe the party should strictly follow whatever the high command decides for the betterment of the country and the party,” Gehlot said.He also denied that his government furnished any tape and the audio clips in question about purported conversation between Congress MLAs and BJP leaders had already gone viral on social media. “But I know that they (BJP) had been planning to topple the government for at least the last six months,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/some-young-leaders-think-they-are-superior-to-high-command-says-ashok-gehlot/story-cBVXrtqCOjWUPSgiNaKUvI.html
20-07-2020||India||Will see if political social distancing is done: Sena on Ram Mandir bhoomi pujan||Barely days after the date for the foundation stone-laying ceremony for the Ram Temple in Ayodhya was finalised, the Shiv Sena said that it will see if “political social distancing” is followed in invitations to various people, including Shiv Sena president and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that the Sena chief does not need an invitation to visit Ayodhya.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit Ayodhya for the bhoomi pujan ceremony of the Ram Mandir on August 5. Following that there were speculations if Thackeray, whose party has been at the forefront of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement since the late 1980s, would be invited.BJP and Shiv Sena stitched the political alliance in the backdrop of the movement and Hindutva ideology in Maharashtra in 1989. The former allies, BJP and Sena, parted ways late last year after the latter formed a government in Maharashtra with the support of the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party.“I have heard through the media that the date for the ceremony has been decided. The Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas (Trust) has given an invitation to the prime minister. So he will go to Ayodhya on this occasion, we regularly keep going to Ayodhya. They will decide on the invitation, how many people to call, how to maintain social distancing. It is also to be seen if they follow political ‘social distancing’,” Raut said in an apparent jibe at the BJP. He added that the Sena chief has been visiting Ayodhya regularly even before he became the chief minister and will continue to do so.The senior Sena leader added that the party has “paved the way” for the construction of the Ram Temple and it was instrumental in removing “obstacles” for it. “Shiv Sena has a connection with Ayodhya and it will remain eternally. It is not a political connection. Shiv Sena has never gone to Ayodhya for political gains. The road for Ram Mandir was paved by the Shiv Sena. The obstacles to building the Ram Mandir were cleared by the Shiv Sena not for politics, but because of [our] faith and for Hindutva,” he said speaking to reporters in Mumbai.On Sunday, South Mumbai MP and former union minister Arvind Sawant said that the Sena does not bother about an invitation to visit Ayodhya. He added that Thackeray during his last visit donated Rs 5 crore on behalf of the party to the temple trust for the construction of the Ram Mandir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-see-if-political-social-distancing-is-done-sanjay-raut-on-ram-mandir-bhoomi-pujan/story-kBfNk72kDqvSg2cQ7NW4HN.html
20-07-2020||India||Pilot camp is so much hand in glove with the BJP that I doubt they’d come back: Ashok Gehlot||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday told reporters that his former deputy Sachin Pilot was acting on behalf of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and was given money, “backed by corporate houses from Mumbai”, to bring down the Rajasthan government. He said he was an elected CM, “not a vegetable-seller”, indicating that he was aware of the alleged controversy for months. Hours before making these comments, he spoke to Vinod Sharma about the thinking in the party, the tapes alleging a BJP hand in the alleged move to topple the government, and the position in the state assembly. Edited excerpts:Are you on the same page as the party high command on Sachin Pilot -- you have accused him of a conspiracy to dislodge your government, but the central leadership seems willing to call a truce if he retraces his steps?I’ve always followed the directions of the high command, not just on this issue but on each and every issue. Regarding this matter, all directions will be followed. The ideology and thinking of leaders of my generation has always been to make our party strong. (But a) few young people think their personal interests are bigger than those of the party; that they are superior to the high command. That’s why problems of such kind occur. I believe the party should strictly follow whatever the high command decides for the betterment of the country and the party.Also read| ‘Who knew person with such innocent face will…’: CM Gehlot roasts Sachin PilotYou have furnished recorded tapes to prove his supporters’ attempts to topple your government. When did you come to know about it? What is the high command’s view on that?I want to clarify that we have not furnished any tape. These audio clips had already gone viral on social media. We also got it on social media. The person who looks after our media sent it to the media to expose the lies of the BJP and its allies. But I know that they had been planning to topple the government for at least the last six months. That’s why at the time of Rajya Sabha elections we had to move [MLAs] to a hotel for 10 days. Had we not done so at that time, what’s happening today would have then happened. Few of them (rebels) had a plan to leave at 2am on June 10 - the day before the death anniversary of late Rajesh Pilot. The rest of them were planning to leave after paying tributes to him at Dausa. I got this information at midnight. I talked to district collectors, spoke to my MLAs and asked them to come to Jaipur. I did not feel good putting up our legislators at a hotel. It was done to save democracy and our government. Their plan ended in failure.ALSO WATCH | ‘With an innocent face...’: CM Ashok Gehlot’s fresh attack on Sachin Pilot Several young Congress leaders have expressed support for Pilot. Why is Gen-X feeling restive? Is it that they don’t see any future in the Congress?People who talk of a ‘Congress-mukt Bharat’ should stop dreaming. Every Congress person who has faith in the party’s leadership and its ideology and policies -- and who can work giving priority to the party rather than self-interests – has a bright future in the Congress. Those who rise from frontal organisations such as the NSUI {National Students’ Union of India) , Youth Congress, Seva Dal, Mahila Congress and have worked at grassroots level cannot feel restive. They know if they’re working hard, with honesty and diligence, the party will look after them; that ample opportunities will come their way. I’m an example of it. I worked in NSUI, was elected as an MP at the age of 28 and became a minister when I was 29. I was PCC {Pradesh Congress Committee} president three times, a central minister three times, and also a party general secretary three times. Now I’m chief minister for the third time with the support and blessings of the people. I want to tell our young leaders that we, too, got chances when we were young but we never thought of disrespecting our seniors and the party leadership. We never promoted groupism or factionalism. I was already three-time president of the state unit when I became CM the first time. Young leaders should have a little patience. The party will give them many opportunities to take their political careers forward.Also read: Check authenticity first: Shekhawat after police notice over audio clipsHave Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi or Priyanka Gandhi Vadra spoken to you on the prevailing crisis? They appear keen on retaining Pilot in the party -- if that happens, will you restore his position in your government?I’m in touch with the leadership. Any decision taken by the high command in this or any other issue will be followed. But I’d like to add that they (Pilot camp) are so much hand in glove with the BJP that I doubt that they’d come back. In the forthcoming days, you will get to see that. They’re sitting in a BJP-ruled state and enjoying their hospitality. The BJP government [in Haryana] is providing them police protection; its leaders are giving statements in their favour. What more evidence does one need to see that they’re in alliance with the BJP.The Pilot camp alleges that your desire to promote your son Vaibhav (who lost from Jodhpur to the BJP’s Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections) prompted you to marginalise your deputy CM and his supporters.That’s totally absurd. I never placed my own or my son’s interests above the party. Shekhawat is a big face in the Rajasthan BJP. They wanted to make him the state BJP president, but it didn’t happen because of their internal conflict. He’s very close to Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and the RSS {Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh}. Vaibhav’s name came up because there was widespread sentiment that only he could give Shekhawat a good fight in Jodhpur. Had he not fought, it would’ve sent out the wrong message that the Congress wasn’t giving the BJP a tough fight in the CM’s home district. I have never promoted Vaibhav in politics. During the Youth Congress elections, he ran a membership drive and wanted to fight elections. I discouraged him because I was the CM then. In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the AICC committee for ticket distribution recommended Vaibhav’s name for the Tonk-Sawai Madhopur seat. I was again the CM and I suggested that Namo Narain Meena, who was a central minister at the time, had the first right to fight from there. He later contested and won the seat. In 2019, Vaibhav was considered for two-three safer seats where the result could have been different. But the party fielded him from Jodhpur to send a message.Also read: In Gehlot vs Pilot, Congress backs regional leadershipIs it true that Rahul Gandhi brokered a pact in 2018 that Pilot would succeed you as CM before the assembly’s term ends in 2023?In my whole political career, I’ve never heard the leadership promising a post to any leader in future. It was the Pilot lobby’s campaign for the last five years that the high command has promised them the CM’s office. That’s how they promoted groupism and put self-interest above the party’s interest. They’re totally exposed now. He (Pilot) is saying so to gain sympathy and to tarnish the leadership’s image.Can you give the exact number of legislators whose support you have in the assembly?You’ll get to know the exact number when we win the floor test by a thumping majority. This time, every MLA will hear the voice of his conscience and vote. Rajasthan is facing a major crisis of lives and livelihood. In such adverse times, our government has done commendable work. I’ve done 21 hours of video conferencing with all MLAs and MPs representing the state. We got positive feedback across party lines. It’s unfortunate that amid the coronavirus pandemic, BJP is doing horse-trading and trying to topple our government as they did in Madhya Pradesh. People are not supporting them in MP and the people will not support them in Rajasthan.How optimistic are you of sustaining in power for the remaining tenure of the assembly?We will definitely complete our tenure. We have already started preparing for the 2023 polls which I am sure we will win.What is your reaction to the BJP ally, Hanuman Beniwal’s claim that you were helped by Vasundhara Raje in preventing desertions of some Jat legislators?I have never compromised with my party’s ideology. To say that I’m getting support from someone (in BJP) is totally false. Everyone knows about Beniwal’s habit of saying anything about anyone. He has been speaking against Vasundhara Raje for the last 15 years; he’s doing so now to get the blessings of the Modi-Shah duo.How strong is your evidence against Shekhawat in the alleged plot to topple your regime? He has denied playing any role and has questioned the genuineness of the tapes.Anyone who commits a crime does not accept it and tends to deny. As for evidence against Shekhawat or others, including Bhanwar Lal Sharma, who earlier attempted to topple five governments – it’ll be better to ask the SOG {special operations group of Rajasthan Police} or other investigating agencies. The matter is under probe. It’s not appropriate for me to comment at this stage. I believe that truth will prevail.(With inputs from Aurangzeb Naqshbandi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilot-camp-is-so-much-hand-in-glove-with-the-bjp-that-i-doubt-they-d-come-back-ashok-gehlot/story-62fkQYrnADLXsZzB13wt1M.html

20-07-2020||India||BJP chief JP Nadda accuses Rahul Gandhi of indulging in mudslinging||Training his guns on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda said on Monday his allegations against the Union government are “weak on facts and strong on mudslinging”.In a series of tweets, Nadda said the former Congress president prefers to believe the Chinese army over his own government.“We saw yet another (failed) edition of ‘Project RG Relaunch’ today. @RahulGandhi Ji was, as usual, weak on facts and strong on mudslinging. Attempts to politicise defence and foreign policy matters shows one dynasty’s desperation to wash their past sins of 1962 and weaken India,” Nadda tweeted.His comments came in the wake of Gandhi’s second video on the India-China border standoff, in which he said the Chinese are attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s image as they understand that for him to survive as a politician, he has to protect the idea of his image.Gandhi also said that if Modi “allowed the Chinese to understand that they can manipulate him because of his image, the prime minister will no longer be worth anything for India”.Reacting to the attack on Modi, Nadda tweeted: “In recent years, be it Doklam or the present, @RahulGandhi Ji prefers briefings from the Chinese instead of believing India’s armed forces. Why does one dynasty want a weak India and a strong China? Many leaders in Congress also disapprove of one dynasty’s shenanigans!”Nadda criticised the Gandhi scion by saying that just as he had tried to allege wrong-doing in the deal for the Rafale combat jets, he was again trying to create a wrong impression about China.He also made a reference to donations received by the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation from the Chinese embassy.“Since the 1950s, China has made strategic investments in one dynasty that has given them rich dividends. Remember 1962, giving away of a UNSC seat, losing lot of land to China in the UPA years, MoU signed with much fanfare in 2008, funds to RGF and more,” Nadda said in another tweet.The BJP and the Congress have been engaged in a verbal duel over the India- China face-off. While the Congress has accused the BJP-led central government of not being transparent about the developments in Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the BJP has retorted by accusing the Congress of lowering the morale of the army and politicising a critical national security issue.“For years, one dynasty has been trying to destroy PM @narendramodi. Sadly for them, PM Modi’s connect with 130 crore Indians is deep-rooted. He lives and works for them. Those who want to destroy him will end up only further destroying their own party,” Nadda said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nadda-accuses-rahul-gandhi-of-indulging-in-mudslinging/story-SIewhJy9H8g61Z2lmP9NyN.html
20-07-2020||India||‘Who knew person with such innocent face will…’: CM Gehlot roasts Sachin Pilot||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot turned the heat on his former deputy Sachin Pilot on Monday when he criticised the rebel leader with an “innocent face” for trying to dislodge his government. Gehlot, who in an interview to a TV channel admitted that he was not on speaking terms with his former No 2 for last 18 months, accused Pilot of working in cahoots with the BJP to bring down his government. “He (Sachin Pilot) was conspiring from past six months with BJP’s support. Nobody believed me when I used to say that conspiracy is going on to topple the government. Nobody knew that a person with such an innocent face would do such a thing. I’m not here to sell vegetables, I am the CM,” Gehlot was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Watch l ‘With an innocent face...’: CM Ashok Gehlot’s fresh attack on Sachin Pilot Last week, Gehlot had taken a swipe at Pilot telling mediapersons that “speaking good English, giving good television bytes and being handsome” was not everything in politics. Pilot, who has ruled out joining the BJP, was sacked as deputy chief minister and pradesh Congress committee chief last week over his failure to attend the two Congress legislature party meetings and leading a rebellion against the CM. The 42-year-old leader and his MLAs supporting him have been served a notice by the assembly speaker. They have appealed against the speaker’s notice in the Rajasthan high court. Even though the party has made repeated efforts to reach out to Pilot, credited with leading the Congress’s successful 2018 assembly campaign, CM Gehlot has been taking hits at the rebel leader, accusing him, repeatedly, of trying to topple the government. Contrasting the situation of his MLAs with those in team Pilot, the CM alleged that the latter were held against their wishes and have been calling him. Earlier today, a video surfaced where Gehlot and his MLAs at the resort were seen singing “hum honge kamyab (We shall overcome)”.“Our MLAs are staying without any restrictions but they have held their’s (MLAs) captive. They are calling us and crying over phone while explaining their ordeal. Their personal mobile phones have been snatched. Some of them want to join us,” said CM Gehlot.On Sunday, Congress’s Rajasthan in-charge Avinash Pande said the party would decide on “merit” whether to allow some rebel MLAs back into the Congress fold. Over the weekend, the two MLA of a regional outfit pledged support to the Gehlot government and submitted letters of support to the CM.Sachin Pilot, when the drama began, claimed the support of 30 MLAs, however that number now stands at 18. On the other hand, Gehlot claims the support of over 100 MLAs. In the 200-member assembly, 101 is the majority mark. With 72 MLAs, the BJP has been watching the developments from the sidelines. Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, who is named in the conspiracy to topple the state government after audiotapes appeared to give the impression that he was one of the parties in the alleged discussion to destabilise the government, said he ready to face an investigation but the police should first check the authenticity of the audio clips.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-knew-person-with-such-innocent-will-cm-gehlot-roasts-sachin-pilot/story-cFPBvTt1RrAq8jcf4dvt5H.html
20-07-2020||India||Air India’s pilot association says change in wage settlement is illegal||Air India’s pilot association informed the national carrier’s management on Monday that changes in wage settlement would be illegal and such a situation has the “potential to [flare up] to an unprecedented magnitude”.This comes days after Air India approved a leave without pay (LWP) scheme for permanent employees for a period of six months to two years, extendable up to five years,“Any unilateral change by Air India from agreed upon wage settlement would be illegal and will not be in the interest of our National Carrier at this crucial juncture. Such a situation has the potential to [falre up] to an unprecedented magnitude,” the Indian Commercial Pilot Association (ICPA) wrote in a letter addressed to Air India chairman and managing director Rajiv Bansal, a copy of which was reviewed by Hindustan Times.“In the interest of the company and due to the Covid scenario, ICPA supports temporary austerity measures at all fronts, only if such a restructuring is done in true spirit of the Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. Flying allowance and flying related allowances constitute 70% of our wages. These allowances remain unpaid since April 2020,” the letter said.“Furthermore, all the wages are being paid with constant delays. The proposal was verbally explained to us without any written true copy...the management cannot and should not unilaterally implement any restructured wage,” it added.In a statement issued on Friday, the airline had said: “Air India is in a very challenging financial situation and is taking recourse to several initiatives with a view to ensuring the continuance of its operations.”It added, “Air India has introduced the Leave Without Pay (LWP) Scheme on July 14, 2020. The scheme primarily enables employees to avail the benefits of proceeding on leave without pay on VOLUNTARY basis. The LWP scheme has been introduced for grant of leave without pay and allowances for permanent employees for a period of six months/two years, which is extendable up to 5 years.”Air India had introduced a similar LWP scheme in September 1998, June 2009 and August 2009. Several hundred employees have in the past availed of LWP, the letter said.The pilot’s body said no negotiations had been held by the management with pilots.“In the press conference by Hon’ble Minister Shri Hardeep Singh Puri dated 16th July 2020, you had stated ‘we are in negotiation with the pilots’, which is far from reality. It was not a negotiation, but the diktat of MoCA which was conveyed to us. We would also like to place on record that the so-called negotiation was ‘not harmonious’ in any aspect,” the ICPA letter alleged.At a news conference on Thursday, Bansal had said the national carrier is working on four fronts to reduce costs by reducing debt, cutting on lease rentals, trimming staff costs and reducing operating costs.“We are trying to increase the topline, and are trying to contain costs,” Bansal said at a news conference along with civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri. “We have cut down staff cost, we have laid off employees working with us post-retirement and we are in negotiations with pilots, cabin crew and other employee categories.”Puri had said airlines across the world are implementing cost cutting measures.The cost cutting drive dovetails with a government plan to sell its stake in Air India amid increasing debt and mounting losses. The Centre started the process in January by releasing an information document for investors and offering access to financial and other data of Air India and its subsidiaries.The government’s stake in Air India, its 100% stake in low-cost subsidiary Air India Express Ltd and 50% stake in ground handling unit Air India SATS Airport Services are on offer.An attempt to auction a majority stake almost two years ago failed to draw bids. The airline’s accumulated debt is estimated to be more than Rs 69,000 crore. It posted a loss of Rs 8,556 crore in fiscal 2018-19, against a net loss of Rs 5,348 crore in the previous fiscal.When contacted by HT on Monday, an Air India spokesperson said: “We wouldn’t like to make any comment on these internal issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-s-pilot-association-says-change-in-wage-settlement-is-illegal/story-GQNYdKO9HbS4ToUbs1IKON.html

20-07-2020||India||Elderly couple burnt to death in another witch-hunt in Odisha||An elderly couple was burnt to death in their sleep on suspicion of practising witchcraft while a witch doctor allegedly branded a woman’s face with hot iron and forced her to eat pig’s excreta to cure her of an ailment in Odisha on Sunday, police said.In Nimapali village of Jajpur district, miscreants set fire to the house of an elderly couple - Shaila and Basanti - Balumuch late Sunday night when they were sleeping in their home. Villagers suspected the couple of practising witchcraft after about half a dozen people of Nimapali died due to different causes over the last two weeks. The couple was killed in the blaze.Tipu Buliuli, brother-in-law of Basanti said they were not on good terms with other villagers over some reasons. “The villagers used to falsely accuse them of practicing witchcraft,” said Buliuli. Jajpur’s Superintendent of Police Charan Singh Meena said the circumstances under which the couple died are being ascertained. “We have seized the burnt bodies of the couple and sent them to the hospital for postmortem. We are looking into the allegation of the couple being killed over suspicion of sorcery,” he said.This is second such witchcraft-related murder in Jajpur district this month. A few days ago, a woman was also murdered on suspicion of practicing witchcraft.In another incident on Sunday, a woman was admitted to the district headquarters hospital in Malkangiri with burn injuries on her face after a witchdoctor branded her face with hot iron to cast off an evil spirit.Lipika Orao, a resident of MV-6 village under Malkangiri block in the district had been sick for about a week following which locals suspected that she was possessed by an evil spirit. They called for a witch doctor who thrashed the woman, branded her face with hot iron and fed her pig excreta as part of the treatment. The women’s condition turned serious after which they called an Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) worker.ASHA worker Laxmi Munda who admitted the victim to the Malkangiri district headquarters hospital said Orao’s condition was critical. “She was already sick before the witch doctor applied his bizarre treatment. The feeding of excreta and beating has turned her health condition critical,” said Munda.The witch doctor is said to be a relative of the woman.“The witch doctor has been arrested,” Malkangiri’s Superintendent of Police Khilari Rishikesh Dnyandeo said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elderly-couple-burnt-to-death-in-another-witch-hunt-in-odisha/story-W6N2cDiKunu7vwS4EzEfrJ.html

20-07-2020||India||From Ladakh to Japan’s Senkaku Islands, ‘bully’ China is in an overdrive||China complained to Japan early this month about its fishing boats moving in the vicinity of Senkaku islands in the East China Sea. Beijing also wanted Japan to cancel the resolution passed by the Ishigaki city assembly last month to change the name of the southern Japan area from Tonoshiro to Tonoshiro Senkaku. Japan, as expected, has told off China.Beijing’s latest complaint to Tokyo falls into a pattern and is part of its tactic to push the envelope with its neighbours - one step at a time. In the East China Sea, the demarche was designed to build its claim over the archipelago that includes five uninhabited islands and three barren rocks spread across 7 sq km. It wasn’t just the presence of Japanese military around the islands east of the Chinese mainland that Beijing was going to object to but fishing boats too.Also Read: Donald Trump spotted a pattern in China’s standoff with India. Here are 21 reasonsTo be sure, China has been attempting to expand its territories over the last two decades but it has only been after the latest round of steps, or mis-steps that Beijing has been called out for bullying its neighbours, first by the United States. For instance, it has been laying the ground for the Ladakh adventure nearly 20 years ago.ALSO WATCH | Indian Americans protest in Washington; massive anti-China protest in TorontoFactsAccording to the western sector maps shared by India and China in 2002 on their respective claim line, there are 12 areas of differences in perception of the Line of Actual Control. The maps were never exchanged due to Chinese objections.These are:Samar Lungpa 176 sq kmTrig heights and Depsang bulge 972 sq kmKonh Ka La (3 pockets) 56 sq kmPangong Tso (Both banks) 83 sq kmSpanggur Gap 24 sq kmMount Sajum 129 sq kmDumchele 40 sq kmDemchok 150 sq kmChumar 80 sq kmSource: The Himalayan Face-off: Chinese Assertion Indian RiposteThat is when teams of Indian and Chinese officials, in an effort to understand each other’s perceptions about the Line of Actual Control and narrow the differences, produced maps of the western sector at the meeting of the expert group of the two countries on 17 June 2002. But the Chinese side declined to exchange these maps that would have formalised their claims and perception about the LAC. China hadn’t, for example, made claims over Gogra, or the fingers overlooking the Pangong lake.Over the next 18 years, China has been attempting to nibble away territories that it claimed as its own, and the ones that it traditionally hadn’t. Like parts of Galwan valley that China has discovered can be strategically useful after India scaled up its border infrastructure and brought the Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie close to the LAC.Indian officials concede that there had been this lurking suspicion about China for years. But there was a belief within Indian diplomatic and military community that with close interaction over the years, the mindset of Han Chinese would change. “This has been a singular big mistake,” a senior official said.But the Indian government isn’t the only one to have gone wrong with its assessment of China.Also Read: US carrier Nimitz to conduct exercise with Indian Navy en route to Middle EastSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has conceded that consecutive US administrations had gone horribly wrong with their policy that deepening ties with China could help democratize the country and the Trump administration was fixing this policy approach.US Attorney General William Barr expanded on the administration’s approach last week, warning US business and academia that China means to co-opt, destroy and eventually replace them altogether.The Trump administration has increasingly been focused on China bullying countries in the region, right from India and Japan to the smaller Southeast Asian countries.China claims almost the entire South China Sea and the islands and reefs that dot it. As the world struggled with the virus that originated in its Wuhan, Beijing announced 2 districts to administer islands and reefs of Paracel Islands and the Spratly Islands to strengthen its claim to sovereignty over the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-senkaku-islands-to-ladakh-bully-china-is-on-an-overdrive/story-4RCrFUoWlbkaHdYMji33PI.html

Attempts to politicise defence and foreign policy matters shows one dynasty’s desperation to wash their past sins of 1962 and weaken India,” Nadda said in his first tweet.China, he said, has made strategic investments in “one dynasty that has given them rich dividends” since the 1950s in an apparent attack on the Congress’ first family.“Remember 1962, giving away of a UNSC seat, losing lot of land to China in the UPA years, MoU Signed with much fanfare in 2008, funds to RGF and more,” he posted the list.“In recent years, be it Doklam or the present, @RahulGandhi Ji prefers briefings from the Chinese instead of believing India’s armed forces. Why does one dynasty want a weak India and a strong China? Many leaders in Congress also disapprove of one dynasty’s shenanigans!” he posted.The senior BJP leader went on to accuse that “one dynasty” has been trying to destroy PM Modi for years. “Sadly for them, PM Modi’s connect with 130 crore Indians is deep-rooted. He lives and works for them. Those who want to destroy him will end up only further destroying their own party,” he said.The Congress has targeted the Prime Minister since the June 15 clash in the eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Vallery in which 20 Indian Army soldiers were killed, accusing him of giving away Indian territory to China.The attack has mostly been led by Rahul Gandhi and the verbal duel has been on since then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/weak-on-facts-strong-on-mudslinging-jp-nadda-handles-rahul-gandhi-s-video-attack/story-svo3ColSdfL12ZqnOov6NJ.html
20-07-2020||India||Chhattisgarh govt wants withdrawal of ordinance on farm produce trade||Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel has joined his counterpart in Punjab and has drawn Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attention to the farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020, promulgated on June 5.He has stated in a letter to the PM that the ordinance is against the agrarian community’s interest and has pleaded for its withdrawal at the earliest.On Sunday, the CM wrote to the PM, claiming the ordinance would reduce employment opportunities and is at odds with the country’s federal structure and the welfare state model.The CM said that Chhattisgarh is an agriculture-dependent state and 70% of its population is engaged in farming and allied activities.Baghel stated that significant progress has been made in the production of paddy, maize, sugarcane, and soybean through the advanced technology, quality seeds, and various schemes of the state government that sought to safeguard farmers’ interest.The state primarily grows paddy, which is procured by Chhattisgarh State Cooperative Marketing Limited in Raipur, on behalf of the Central government-run Food Corporation of India (FCI), at a minimum support price (MSP).Chhattisgarh supplies locally-produced usna (parboiled) rice, which helped the country successfully combat the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, the CM said.He pointed out that the ordinance allows farmers and traders to buy and sell farm produce outside mandi premises, exemption on a fee on the sale of notified agricultural produce, and transactions can also be made by those who don’t even have a licence and a Permanent Account Number (PAN).Baghel joined the issue for a uniform rule, citing that “different types of agricultural produces are produced in various parts of our country, where marketing practices are influenced by the corresponding nature and conditions of the farmers, whose interests are safeguarded under the Mandi Act”.He batted for farmers and said that farm folks are at the mercy of market forces.“The efforts to increase agricultural production are meaningless and unprofitable until the marketing of agricultural produce at a reasonable price can be ensured in the interest of farmers. The Mandi Act has been implemented in a bid to achieve this objective. The Act is periodically amended by the Central government to include single registration, online trading, private mandi premises, direct purchase, single-point market fee, and marketing of livestock. The mechanism seeks to enforce a transparent and competitive system in the private and public sector,” he stated in the letter.Baghel cited that the Mandi Act is rational in its present form. However, if any modification is required, the state government is equipped and open to such a suggestion, he added.The CM warned that the ordinance seeks to make the Mandi Act ineffective and lakhs of farmers in the unorganised sector would be at the mercy of unbridled market forces amid the adverse economic impact of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.At present, the Mandi Act stipulates that a farmer can sell his agricultural produce anywhere outside or inside his native state without paying any market fee.But the ordinance aims to do away with the existing mechanism, much to the dismay of hapless farmers, Baghel added while pointing out the cascading effect such as joblessness to hamals (porters), tulais (those who are engaged in weighing the farm produce) and many others indirectly connected to the mandis, including officials and employees, which don’t augur well for a welfare state like India, the letter stated.He also urged the PM to take note of the proposed closure of an open auction bid at a mandi -- an electronic tender process -- that seeks to ensure competitive price mechanism for agricultural produces that could immensely harm farmers’ commercial interests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-govt-wants-withdrawal-of-ordinance-on-farm-produce-trade/story-sHV7pyhEc91BooquYMOyOK.html

Called “Passex” in naval parlance, the basic manoeuvre comes at a time when Indian and China are locked in a tense border confrontation in Ladakh, people familiar with the developments said on Monday. The drills also come amidst mounting tensions in the South China Sea where the US Navy just conducted a major exercise involving USS Nimitz and USS Ronald Reagan. “The Passex is nowhere near Andamans and Nicobar Islands. It is en route to the Gulf Region,” said a senior government official. The Nimitz Carrier Strike Group is transiting through IOR. During the passage, #IndianNavy units undertook Passage Exercise (PASSEX) with #USNavy.Indian Navy had also conducted similar PASSEXs with #JMSDF and #FrenchNavy in recent past.@USNavy@SpokespersonMoD @MEAIndia pic.twitter.com/ntj5gFFNqCThe Eastern Fleet of the Indian Navy is currently carrying out drills near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.The two navies will conduct a passage exercise near the islands to hone interoperability, the people said.“A passage exercise is normally undertaken whenever an opportunity arises, in contrast to pre-planned maritime drills. While the Malabar exercise will be conducted later this year, it is always good to exercise with like-minded navies and exchange best opportunities whenever there is a chance,” said naval affairs expert Captain DK Sharma (retd).There was no official word from the navy on the exercise with the Nimitz carrier strike group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supercarrier-nimitz-to-conduct-basic-exercise-with-indian-navy-en-route-to-middle-east/story-Qbz0Sjq1FzzchLmTQ3LqLK.html
20-07-2020||India||Air India Pilots’ Association says not consulted on leave without pay scheme||The Air India’s Pilot Association (ICPA) has written to the national carrier complaining that the leave without pay scheme, which Air India calls a ‘win-win’ for both’, was finalised without consulting the pilots.“In the press conference by Hardeep Singh Puri dated July 16, you had stated “we are in negotiation with the pilots” which is far from reality. It was not a negotiation, but the diktat of MoCA which was conveyed to us. We would also like to place on record that the so called negotiation was ‘not harmonious’ in any aspect,” the letter by the Indian Commercial Pilot Association alleged.In an order last week, Air India said it has begun the process of sending some employees on leave without pay ranging from six months or two years that can also be extended up to five years. The scheme is applicable to permanent employees of the company.Defending the arrangement, Air India had said it will give the employees freedom to engage themselves with another employer for the said period, the airline too will be able to save its cash flow on the other hand.In an earlier statement, the airline said that in a challenging financial situation, it is taking recourse to several initiatives with a view to ensure that its flight operations continue.The cost-cutting drive dovetails with a government plan to sell its entire stake in Air India amid increasing debt and mounting losses. The Centre, in January, started the process by releasing an information document for investors and offering access to financial and other data of Air India and its subsidiaries.The government’s entire stake in Air India, its 100% stake in low-cost subsidiary Air India Express Ltd. and 50% stake in ground handling unit Air India SATS Airport Services Private Limited. are on offer.An attempt to auction a majority stake almost two years ago failed to draw any bids. The airline’s accumulated debt is estimated to be more than Rs 69,000 crore. It posted a loss of Rs 8,556 crore in financial year 2018-19, as against a net loss of Rs 5,348 crore in the previous financial year.When contacted by HT on Monday a spokesperson for Air India said, “We wouldn’t like to make any comment on these internal issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilots-association-writes-to-air-india-saying-leave-without-pay-scheme-was-finalised-without-consultation/story-Ka0kul9qwMm5EkYDkdhAfP.html

A team of 50 personnel is on patrolling duty along with Thane Police authorities to discourage overcrowding at marketplaces,” said Malvi.All roads leading to markets have been closed and vehicles are not allowed in these areas, including Hajuri, Kalwa Naka, Jawahar Baug, and Kopri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thane-civic-authorities-deploy-50-personnel-in-marketplaces-to-discourage-overcrowding/story-AvmWE7N9U02PCRXfkjfSDI.html
20-07-2020||India||‘Can’t spare SC judge for Vikas Dubey encounter probe’: Court to Uttar Pradesh||The Supreme Court on Monday ruled out sparing a sitting top court judge to be part of gangster Vikas Dubey’s encounter probe committee, advising the state of Uttar Pradesh to employ the services of an ex-judge of the very court and a retired police officer for it.“We cannot spare a sitting top court judge to become part of the inquiry committee,” said the apex court.The court also said that the retired SC judge should be from the state as other judges are unwilling to go to Allahabad due to the Covid situation.Appearing for the UP police, senior advocate Harish Salve agreed to bring notification of persons to be included. The Court will consider and approve the same on Wednesday. The court also reminded the state that it is duty bound to uphold rule of law.Commenting on the lapses in the system, the court observed: “We are appalled at the fact that such a person [Vikas Dubey] was released on bail. As an institution we have failed to keep a person behind bars. The Committee must examine this aspect too.”UP police received a lot of flak when it demolished the gangster’s family home and his cars after it failed to nab him. In its defence, the police said it was trying to find the stolen arms. There have also been several questions about the Dubey encounter - following the car accident while he was being brought back to Kanpur from Madhya Pradesh. On Friday, the UP government categorically denied before the court that the gunning down of history-sheeter Vikas Dubey on July 10 was a “fake encounter”.The People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) filed an application highlighting how encounters have increased in UP since 2018. The court asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta appearing for the state government to look into this aspect as well. The bench said, “What is at stake is not one incident in UP but the whole system.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-t-spare-sc-judge-for-vikas-dubey-encounter-probe-court-to-uttar-pradesh/story-majnQiMsTZaIKNr7GcEm0H.html

The Congress has accused the BJP of indulging in horse-trading to bring down the Gehlot government. The BJP has rejected the allegations.The Congress government in Rajasthan continues to be in turmoil after the simmering differences between Sachin Pilot and Ashok Gehlot came out in the open.Pilot was sacked from the posts of Rajasthan deputy chief minister and state unit president last week. The 42-year-old leader and 18 MLAs who are supporting him, were also issued disqualification notices by the speaker of the state assembly.The battle has now reached Rajasthan High Court, where a two-judge bench is hearing petitions filed by Pilot and 18 MLAs challenging their disqualification notices.On Friday, the high court had directed that no action be taken against Pilot and the other rebel Congress MLAs until Tuesday and had deferred the hearing of their plea challenging the speaker’s notices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antakshari-movies-cooking-lessons-for-congress-mlas-amid-rajasthan-crisis/story-YFRDfQkRfuoHgFj6f1MjPM.html

The two navies will conduct a passage exercise near the islands to hone interoperability, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. USS Nimitz has transited the Malacca Strait and is on its way to the Persian Gulf, they said.“A passage exercise is normally undertaken whenever an opportunity arises, in contrast to pre-planned maritime drills. While the Malabar exercise will be conducted later this year, it is always good to exercise with like-minded navies and exchange best opportunities whenever there is a chance,” said naval affairs expert Captain (retired) DK Sharma.There was no official word from the Indian Navy on the exercise with the Nimitz carrier strike group.The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are more than 1,200 km from the mainland. A significant volume of China’s oil imports passes through Malacca Strait, 350 km from these islands.The nuclear-powered USS Nimitz, one of the largest warships on the planet, is returning from an operational deployment in South China Sea. A carrier strike group led by USS Ronald Reagan was part of the US drills in South China Sea.The US deployment to South China Sea came after China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy conducted drills in the contested waters, provoking a sharp reaction from neighbouring countries and Washington. The US Navy has said its operations in South China Sea are designed to support a “free and open” Indo-Pacific.The stage is also set for Australia to be part of the next Malabar naval exercise conducted by India with the US and Japan, as reported by Hindustan Times on July 17. The next edition of Malabar, already delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, is set to be held by the end of the year.The formal invitation to Australia is expected to be extended after some time in view of delicate negotiations between India and China on disengagement and de-escalation to end their standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).China has also been wary of the Quadrilateral security dialogue or Quad that was revived in late 2017 by India, the US, Australia and Japan, and these suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-us-navies-to-conduct-drills-off-andamans-amid-border-row/story-GU1r3rCGb1BT7EzAN03DWI.html

At least 24 of the state’s 33 districts are affected due to floods triggered by heavy monsoon shower.“Over 70 lakh people have been affected due to Assam floods. People, as well as animals, are being rescued from the affected areas and being shifted to relief camps and safer locations,” chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal told news agency ANI.“On one hand, people are troubled due to Covid-19 and on the other hand, there are challenges arising out of Assam floods. Still, the people of our state continue to fight the battle. Central and state governments are providing all kinds of assistance to the people,” he added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Sonowal on Sunday to take stock of the flood, erosion and Covid-19 situation in the state.“The PM said that the central government was keeping a close watch and standing closely with the people of Assam during these difficult times,” said a statement from the chief minister’s office.According to a Central Water Commission (CWC) bulletin, most rivers in the state continue to be in spate. The Brahmaputra, Dhansiri, Jia Bharali, Kopili, Beki, Kusiyara and Sankosh flowed above the danger mark at several places.The latest alert from CWC on Monday said that the Brahmaputra is expected to rise more by Tuesday evening. The river had burst its banks two weeks ago, swamping more than 2,500 villages. Goalpara is the worst-hit district with over 4.53 lakh people affected, followed by 3.44 lakh in Barpeta and 3.41 lakh in Morigaon.Personnel of the State Disaster Response Force, district administrations and locals have rescued 366 persons during the last 24 hours, the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) said. Over 50,000 people uprooted by floods have taken shelter at 521 relief camps.The rapidly rising water level has also inundated the Kaziranga National Park, home to the world’s largest concentration of one-horned rhinoceros, with an estimated 2,500 out of a total population of some 3,000 of the animals.“Nine rhinos have drowned and over 100 other animals have been killed,” said Assam’s agriculture minister Atul Bora. Sixty other animals (36 hog deer, eight rhinos, three wild buffalo, one python, seven wild boar, two swamp deer, one Sambar and two porcupines) have so far died due to drowning, according to state government.Assam, famous for its tea plantations, is hit by flooding every rainy season despite flood-control efforts.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-devastated-by-floods-during-covid-19-cm-says-70-lakh-people-affected/story-I7piE129hTY2ksdvKHF0JN.html

20-07-2020||India||Chhattisgarh CM writes to PM requesting supply of iron ore to Bastar steel industries at 30% concession||Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting him to make iron ore available to steel industries in the underdeveloped Bastar region at a 30% concession rate through National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC), a central government-run undertaking.In the letter written on Sunday, the CM said that the concession would help the steel industries to operate on a larger scale, make them profitable, and would also create employment opportunities for local youth.The concession would accelerate remote Bastar’s development and economic growth, he said.The state government has also sent a similar proposal to NMDC, he added.The CM pointed out to the PM that the mineral-rich Bastar held a special place in the country.“Bastar region is more abundant in mineral and forest resources than other parts of the country. However, economic activities are limited in Bastar due to dense forest cover and in strict compliance with the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The growing unemployment can be attributed to the rise of Left-wing extremism activities, which have further hindered the region’s growth. However, the launch of the district mineral foundation (DMF) scheme in 2015 aims to alleviate the condition of the families, who have been affected by indiscriminate mining in the region,” the letter stated.The CM drew the PM’s attention to NMDC’s mining activity in the Dantewada district for over 50 years and pleaded for a 30% concession for iron ore for Bastar’s growth and development.“Steel industries have not become a profitable venture for private entrepreneurs, despite the abundance of iron ore. If NMDC provides iron ore to Bastar-based steel industries at a 30% concession, they will soon become profitable and can create more job opportunities for the region’s youth,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-cm-writes-to-pm-requesting-supply-of-iron-ore-to-bastar-steel-industries-at-30-concession/story-C4sNDrvnBELrKNyKkiK5vK.html

20-07-2020||India||In renewed attack on border row, Rahul Gandhi connects PM’s image and China’s plan||In one of the sharpest attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the India-China border standoff, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has said the Chinese are attacking the premier’s image as “they understand that for him to survive as a politician, he has to protect the idea of ‘Chhapan Inch’ (56-inch)”.He contended that if Modi “allowed the Chinese to understand that they can manipulate him because of his image, the Prime Minister will no longer be worth anything for India”.Gandhi on Monday released the second of his series of short videos on the India-China face-off. Through the videos, he wants to share his thoughts on national issues.Also read: Has Modi government accepted Chinese occupation in Ladakh? asks CongressIn his first video on Friday, Gandhi had said the “troubled economy, foreign policy and neighbourhood” prompted China to take an aggressive stand against India.Titled “China’s Strategic Game Plan”, the second video of two-and-half-minutes focuses on how the Chinese have used the border issue to put pressure on Modi.“And they (Chinese) are thinking of putting pressure in a very particular way. And what they are doing is that they are attacking his image. They understand that it in order for Mr Narendra Modi to be an effective politician, in order for Mr Narendra Modi to survive as a politician, he has to protect the idea of ‘Chhapan Inch’. And this the real idea the Chinese are attacking. They are basically telling Mr Narendra Modi that if you do not do what we say, we will destroy the idea of Mr Narendra Modi as a strong leader,” Gandhi said.The former Congress president asked how Modi will react to the situation: “Will he take them on? Will he take on the challenge and say absolutely not, I’m the prime minister of India. I do not care about my image, I’m going to take you on. Or will he succumb to them?”He further said: “It is simply not a border issue. The worry I have is that Chinese are sitting in our territory today. Chinese don’t do anything without thinking about it strategically. In their mind they have mapped out the world and they are trying to shape the world. That’s the scale of what they are doing.”He added, “That’s what Gwadar is, that is what Belt and Road is. It is a restructuring of the planet. So when you’re thinking about the Chinese you have to understand that that is the level at which they are thinking.”Also read: Galwan braves get a pat on the back from Rajnath Singh in Ladakh’s LukungAt the tactical level, Gandhi said, the Chinese are trying to improve their position. “Whether it is Galwan, whether it’s Demchok or whether it is Pangong Lake, the idea is to position themselves,” he said.Gandhi said the Chinese are disturbed by a key Indian highway in the area and want to make it redundant. “And if they are thinking larger scale, they want to do something with Pakistan in Kashmir. So it is not simply a border issue. It is a border issue designed to put pressure on the prime minister of India.”The Congress leader has repeatedly targeted Modi and his government over Chinese transgressions and said the prime minister isn’t being transparent on the issue. The Congress has been demanding that status quo ante should be restored at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and Chinese troops be pushed to their side.He alleged that Modi has succumbed to China’s pressure and refuted claims that Chinese troops are occupying Indian territory in Ladakh.“The worry I have so far is that the prime minister has succumbed. The worry I have is, the Chinese are sitting in our territory today and the prime minister has said publicly they are not, which to me tells me that he is worried about his image and defending his image,” Gandhi said.“And if he allows the Chinese to understand that they can manipulate him because of his image, the Indian prime minister will no longer be worth anything for India,” he said in his concluding remarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/idea-of-narendra-modi-as-a-strong-leader-rahul-gandhi-s-fresh-attack-over-china/story-SO3dCPxs98zpnlrfQQyNBN.html

The Bombay high court (HC) has restrained a Mumbai-based businessman and his parents from creating any third party rights in the movable or immovable properties held by them either independently or jointly after he had failed to clear his pending dues of interim maintenance to his estranged wife and minor daughter.Last Friday, a two-member division bench, comprising Justices Prasanna Varale and Milind Jadhav, also directed the owner of an elevator-manufacturing firm to submit an inventory of all the movable and immovable properties belonging to him and his parents.The directives were issued following a petition filed by the estranged wife complaining about non-compliance of an order passed by a metropolitan magistrate court in Mumbai on June 30, 2018, directing the businessman to pay monthly interim maintenance of Rs 75,000 and Rs 1.5 lakh to his minor daughter and the estranged wife, respectively.The order was passed by the magistrate on a complaint lodged by the petitioner invoking provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence (DV) Act, 2005.In the petition, filed through advocate DP Singh, the petitioner had complained that her husband had not complied with the magisterial order, and as of June, he had not paid arrears of over Rs 44 lakh.Advocate Amogh Singh, the petitioner’s counsel, pointed out that on June 9 another division bench had also directed the Andheri-based businessman to clear the arrears by the next date, but he has not complied with the HC order.The businessman responded to the petition and cited that he had paid Rs 15 lakh to his wife so far. However, he expressed his inability to pay the balance amount on account of partial closure of business because of coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced lockdown restrictions.He offered to deposit Rs 5 lakh in his estranged wife’s bank account in a week.The offer, however, failed to impress upon the bench. It took note of the reference made by the petitioner to certain movable and immovable properties held by her husband and his parents in her application under provisions of the DV Act and issued the restraining order.The HC has also observed that the non-compliance on part of the businessman may amount to a wilful breach of its order, inviting action for contempt of the court, and has kept the issue pending for future consideration.The court will hear the case next after two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-freezes-family-properties-of-businessman-who-failed-to-pay-maintenance-to-wife-daughter/story-m41we4KPhJYiejH9XZm04O.html

20-07-2020||India||PAC files application in HC to become part of plea filed by Pilot camp MLA||Jaipur: Public Against Corruption (PAC), a civil society group that fights against graft, has filed a plea in the Rajasthan high court (HC), urging its name to be added among those of the respondents in the petition moved by rebel Congress lawmaker PR Meena, a supporter of sacked deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and a challenger to assembly Speaker CP Joshi’s disqualification notices. Last Thursday, the Pilot faction, which is locked in a bitter power struggle with the Ashok Gehlot-led government, had challenged the disqualification notices under the anti-defection law that pertains to the 10th Schedule of the Constitution.The writ petition has argued that the dissident members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) have not done or said anything that would indicate that they were snapping their ties with the Congress.The MLAs argued that they had neither given up their membership of the assembly nor did their failure to attend the two Congress legislature party (CLP) meetings, held on July 13 and 14, make them liable for disqualification on the grounds of defection.Senior advocate PC Bhandari, general secretary, PAC, through an application requested the HC that the petitioner is a registered society formed to fight against corruption with the object to fight against graft in various social sectors. It reasoned that the petitioners have challenged in its prayer clause 2(1)(a) of the 10th Schedule read with Article 191 of the Constitution to be declared as illegal, which will give a fillip to horse-trading and corruption in society and across states.The plea stated that “… all public dealings in various government offices have been put on hold and the public is feeling cheated to whom they voted for.”It added: “The PAC wants to be a party in the present petition in a bid to put public grievances before the court and get them redressed.”A division bench of the HC is expected to hear the plea of the 19 rebel MLAs, including Pilot, who were served show-cause notices last week, on Monday.Earlier on July 15, the show-cause notices were served on the dissident lawmakers on the petition of chief whip of the assembly Mahesh Joshi, Speaker Joshi had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pac-files-application-in-hc-to-become-part-of-plea-filed-by-pilot-camp-mla/story-2wB07YciVU3C26mNFbg87J.html

Taking to Twitter, the Congress leader posted a video message and wrote, “PM fabricated a fake strongman image to come to power. It was his biggest strength. It is now India’s biggest weakness.”In the video message, speaking on “China’s Strategic Game Plan” the Congress leader said: “What is China’s strategic and tactical game plan? It is simply not a border issue. The worry I have is that the Chinese are sitting in our territory today. Chinese don’t do anything without thinking about it strategically.”“In their mind, they have mapped out the world and they are trying to shape the world. That’s the scale of what they are doing.

Earlier, he was booked under six different cases in Ashok Nagar. On Thursday, Vikas was roaming in grain market where some shopkeepers raised suspicion that he was trying to steal a packet of pesticide. They beat him up and dragged him with a piece of cloth around his neck on the street. Vikas got injured in the incident,” said Singh.“We are investigating whether he was stealing some thing or not but we can’t allow people to take law in their hands to punish someone. We have lodged an FIR against eight unidentified people under section 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 294 (using obscene words) and 506 (criminal intimidation),” said Singh.The Opposition has launched an attack on the government. MP Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta said, “The law and order condition in MP is deteriorating due to indifference attitude of BJP-led state government. People are losing trust in law enforcement machineries. Poor people from SC/ST and OBC communities are being targeted and harassed unnecessarily.”BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “Congress is unnecessarily trying to give a political angle to every incident.

20-07-2020||India||Tribal dies in Madhya Pradesh, family members allege harassment by forest officer||Villagers in Dhana area of Sagar district in Madhya Pradesh staged a road blockade on Sunday morning and placed the dead body of a tribal on the road, the police said.They accused a forest range officer Devesh Gautam of subjecting the tribal, Maniram Gond, to harassment in connection with a seizure case. The 40-year-old, was a resident of Didohniya village in the district, which is a part of the Bundelkhand region.Public Works Department (PWD) minister Gopal Bhargava joined the villagers’ protest demanding FIR against the forest department officer, who allegedly demanded a bribe of Rs 1 lakh from Gond to free his seized tractor-trolley.After the protest of the minister, Chief Conservator of Forest (CCF), Sagar division Amit Dubey suspended Gautam for not handling the case properly. An inquiry has also been ordered for allegedly demanding bribe from the tribal. Sagar district collector Deepak Singh also ordered a magisterial inquiry.Gond’s younger brother Mukesh said, “The tractor-trolley of my brother was seized by forest personnel accusing him of encroaching upon forest land and promoting others in encroachment. My brother requested them not to take tractor-trolley with them as it is the time to sow seeds and he has taken a contract of farming of 5 acre land but they didn’t listen to my brother’s request. Later, forest range officer Devesh Gautam demanded a bribe of Rs 1 lakh.”Gond also lodged a complaint at Dhana police outpost 15 days ago.Gond’s wife Ashok Rani, who is a sarpanch of Belai Mafi panchayat, said, “On Saturday evening, my husband requested the forest officer to free the tractor. He called him at forest range office. He went to meet the ranger Devesh Gautam with Rs 30,000, the amount he could arrange but the officer refused to accept less than Rs 1 lakh. The officer scolded him. While returning he suffered cardiac arrest and died.”“My husband was mentally disturbed and couldn’t bear the trauma,” she added.Talking to media, minister Bhargava said, “I requested forest officer many times to leave the tractor but he didn’t listen. I also approached district forest officer (DFO) but he also didn’t pay attention to my request. Being a minister when they are not listening to me, I can understand how they are harassing tribals. That’s why I joined the protest against the officer of forest department. Suspension is not enough, we want FIR against him.”Meanwhile, DFO, Sagar south range MS Uika said, “Gond had encroached upon two acre forest land in Dhana range. He was sowing crop on the encroached land with tractor when the range officer Devesh Gautam seized his tractor. Minister Gopal Bhargava called me and I explained the matter to him but I was not aware that Gautam was demanding bribe.” Sagar Superintendent of Police Amit Sanghi said, “Police are investigating the matter. Further action would be taken after magisterial inquiry.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tribal-dies-in-madhya-pradesh-family-members-allege-harassment-by-forest-officer/story-obbDOl54Vd0A6agjv2fkVO.html
20-07-2020||India||Rajasthan HC resumes hearing on Sachin Pilot, 18 other rebel Congress MLAs’ plea||A two-judge bench of Rajasthan High Court on Monday resumed hearing on petitions filed by former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and 18 other dissident Congress MLAs challenging their disqualification notices from the state assembly speaker.Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and justice Prashant Gupta started hearing the case in Court No 1 as Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing Speaker CP Joshi, resumed his arguments.Senior counsel Harish Salve and Mukul Rohtagi, representing Sachin Pilot and other MLAs, have completed their side of arguments.On Friday, the high court had directed that no action be taken against Pilot and the other rebel Congress MLAs until Tuesday and had deferred the hearing of their plea challenging the speaker’s disqualification notices.Speaker Joshi had on Friday assured the court that he would not act till 5.30pm on Tuesday on the notices issued to dissident legislators over their failure to attend two Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meetings on July 13 and 14.The MLAs had moved the court challenging the notice issued to them by Joshi on July 14 seeking an explanation on why they should not be disqualified from the assembly.They had told the court that ruling party legislators’ disagreement with the manner of functioning of the chief minister cannot be seen as indicating their intention to leave the party so as to trigger the anti-defection law.They said that criticising the party leadership is an exercise of freedom of speech and cannot be a ground to disqualify a lawmaker on the grounds of defection.The petitioners through their counsel contended that a party whip applies only when the assembly is in session and that airing of grievances against party leadership cannot be construed as voluntarily giving up party membership under 2 (1) (a) of the Tenth schedule of the Constitution.The petition challenged the speaker’s notice, which was based on a complaint by Congress’ chief whip Mahesh Joshi, that the MLAs should be disqualified from the Rajasthan assembly for defying the whip.Mahesh Joshi sought action against Pilot and the other dissidents under Clause 2 (1) (a) of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, which provides for disqualification of MLAs if they “voluntarily” give up the membership of the party which they represent in the House.Mahesh Joshi cited the absence of the dissident MLAs in two Congress legislature party meetings despite specific direction to attend them along with hostile and prejudicial conduct against the party, as an indication of the dissidents’ intention to leave the party.Sachin Pilot, the 42-year-old leader credited with leading the Congress’ successful 2018 assembly election campaign, has categorically ruled out joining the BJP, asserting that attempts to link him to the opposition party were a ploy to tar his image.If the rebel MLAs are disqualified, the majority mark in the 200-member assembly will come down, making it easier for chief minister Ashok Gehlot to win a floor test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-hc-to-resume-hearing-on-sachin-pilot-18-other-rebel-congress-mlas-plea-today/story-M3msm3P6Xl0odq7Upc1H5O.html

Police have booked 50 unidentified persons for creating ruckus and voluntarily causing hurt. “Faruq Khan and his family members were sowing paddy crop on land located between Dobra and Beelkhera village of the district at around 9am when more than 250 unidentified people attacked them with sharp-edged weapons and started pelting stones. In reply, Khan’s family members also pelted stone,” Bundela said.The stone-pelting continued for half-an-hour. Police reached the spot and opened fire at least four rounds in the air to disperse the mob. “The accused belong to Beelkhera village and wanted to destroy the crop as they are trying to encroach upon this forest land, which I have taken on rent for farming,” Khan said.The injured were admitted to the district hospital where the condition of two people is stated to be serious, said police. “We are trying to identify the accused.

He said the BJP was playing this “game for long and contacted me few months back.

20-07-2020||India||Delhiwale: A head that wears the forest||His face is almost invisible under the huge load of goat fodder he is carrying on his head. All that you see are glimpses of his glinting eyes and flashes of his nose and lips. The young man is dressed in a green T-shirt and black shorts printed with the word “TikTok”. He’s walking along a central Delhi alley.“These are leaves from the gular trees,” he says, introducing himself as Kalu. His voice seems to be coming out of the green bundle, as one cannot see his mouth.Kalu is in his late teens. A labourer, he says he does whatever assignment comes his way. “Right now I’m transporting fodder from a supplier to a stall in the bazaar,” he informs. Kalu has never been to a school. He frees his right arm and flicks his palm, in synchronisation with his speech. “Mummy Papa gone.”Kalu was very young when his parents passed away, he says. Without being prompted, he discloses that he is not from some far-off part of the country, but from this very city. “I was born in Delhi.” His half-hidden lips spread into a very visible smile, revealing his paan-stained teeth.So who does he live with?Kalu’s eyes continue to sparkle as he shakes his head. The bundle is almost like a mini-jungle in itself, and moves with him. He explains that he is alone in the “duniya”, the world.He sleeps on the footpath nearby, outside the closed shutters of a motor pump shop. “Many other labourers sleep there.”And who cooks his meals?He again shakes his head, more vigorously. “I have nobody, I myself look after my food.” He doesn’t cook, because he explains he has no stove. “I eat outside, in the dhabas.”Kalu says he doesn’t feel alone, though. He has many friends who are like his brothers and sisters. “When I fall ill they look after me... once they even took me to a doctor.”Besides, he doesn’t find time to feel lonely. In his free time, he watches movies and music videos on his cellphone, though right now it’s not with him. He has left it in his bag, a bag he keeps safe in the custody of one of his friends, close to where he sleeps at night.While Kalu’s days are hectic, he does avail himself a few hours of rest in the afternoon. These days, he spends it watching film bits starring Shah Rukh Khan on YouTube. “He is better than Salman (Khan),” Kalu observes. “Shah Rukh dances better, though he doesn’t have as much muscle as Salman.” The boy is talking of both the superstars very casually, and uses only their first names, as if he were on friendly terms with them.But now Kalu politely asks to be excused. He quickly wants to complete his assignment so that he can rush to the dhaba he frequents for his breakfast — bun with butter, and a glass of “doodh chai”. He walks away, his face hidden under his load. It’s a surreal sight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-a-head-that-wears-the-forest/story-yuoiIDsNN2mkju8wHgMrdM.html
20-07-2020||India||In Gehlot vs Pilot, Congress backs regional leadership||It’s a long-held perception that the will of the Congress high command is the final word for everyone in the party. While the composition of the high command has transitioned from Indira Gandhi’s and Rajiv Gandhi’s teams to those of Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, this rule has remained a constant. The Ashok Gehlot versus Sachin Pilot fight in Rajasthan is another instance, and maybe even mark a trend of the high command realizing that it is better to go with the regional leader than impose its own favourites on a state unit.That Sachin Pilot is a favoured face is undeniable. Pilot and Rahul Gandhi both belong to the 2004 batch of first- time members of Parliament. As young MPs, they formed a clique that would, among other things, attend live music concerts at Blue Frog (a now defunct club) where their colleague Milind Deora would be playing the blues. As Rahul Gandhi became party general secretary, Pilot also grew, becoming a minister of state in the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. They both went to St. Stephen’s College, although Rahul Gandhi didn’t complete his degree there, but they also shared other, deeper commonalities. Both had fathers who were trained pilots and both lost them too early in life.Also read: Buzz grows over Rajasthan special session, floor test And yet, a week after Pilot’s rebellion against Gehlot, the message to him is unequivocal: he is welcome to come back, but it won’t be by undermining his boss. Gehlot has proved he has the numbers and while Pilot may have genuine complaints against him, they cannot afford to upset a man who commands the maximum number of legislators in Rajasthan. This despite the fact that Pilot has Priyanka Gandhi’s ear. The two have spoken at least twice in the course of the week. Rahul and Sonia have also conveyed to mediators that they would like him to stay, but not at the cost of overriding party discipline.It’s as if things have come a full circle in Rajasthan since 2014. That’s the time when the same high command handpicked Pilot to lead the party in Rajasthan after its worst-ever performance of winning just 21 seats out of 200 in the 2013 assembly elections. Pilot took on that assignment after eliciting a promise that Gehlot wouldn’t interfere in the state. And for two years or so, Gehlot held no real position other than being part of a screening committee for Punjab polls in 2016. In 2017, he was made a general secretary in Delhi, which meant that Pilot got full credit for winning the three crucial by-polls in early 2018. Despite chief minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia holding helm in the state, Pilot delivered the Lok Sabha seats of Ajmer and Alwar and Mandalgarh assembly seats with record margins. His word would now be the last word in the state.Also read: Rajasthan ‘horse trading’ probe: Jain had Rs 100 crore budget to buy 3 MLAs, claims police That’s the reason why a contentious rule brought by Pilot for ticket distribution in the assembly polls that year was enforced despite major opposition. According to that rule, all those who had lost the elections twice would not get a ticket. Many like general secretary in charge Avinash Pandey opposed it, arguing that it was unfair as many contenders had lost in 2013 due to a wave in favour of Narendra Modi. But Pilot’s insistence on that rule led to the alienation of many Congress politicians in the state. Alok Beniwal, Laxman Meena, Mahadeo Khandela, Sayam Lodha and Deep Chand Kharia were all denied party tickets so they contested as independents and won. Zubair Khan got his wife to contest and she won, Richpal Mirdha’s son contested and won; there are several other such names. This decision became one of the major factors behind the Congress’s lukewarm win (99 out of 200 seats). When Ashok Gehlot was installed as chief minister and Pilot only as his deputy, it was after feedback that the older man would be able to command a larger group of people during a crisis. It also helped that Gehlot had won over Rahul Gandhi’s trust during the 44 days they spent together in Gujarat. Incidentally, Rajasthan’s independents now form a chunk of the support base for Ashok Gehlot.A recap of these circumstances is perhaps necessary to understand the bewildering sequence of events in the week gone by. It explains why we’ve constantly been hearing two voices. That of Ashok Gehlot mocking his “good-looking, English-speaking” challenger while Randeep Surjewala (the voice of the high command) encourages him to come back; The Gehlot-led legislature party issuing a show-cause notice and removing him as deputy chief minister while Surjewala says “the doors of the party are always open.” At one point, it would have been unimaginable to hear two voices; the high command’s would drown out all else. Whatever happens to Pilot, this change in the emergence of regional power is here to stay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-gehlot-vs-pilot-congress-backs-regional-leadership/story-94VKTXugoooWvXKaYaKIEI.html
20-07-2020||India||ED files new charge sheet to aid Mehul Choksi’s extradition||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a charge sheet against fugitive jeweller Mehul Choksi, elaborating how he allegedly ran an organised racket to cheat customers and lenders in India, Dubai and the US, including top financial institutions, by dealing in “lab grown diamonds” and selling off properties, details accessed by Hindustan Times reveal.The charge sheet is aimed at bolstering India’s extradition request for Choksi to Antigua and Barbuda sent under the UN Conventions against Corruption in March 2019. An official said on condition of anonymity that the charge sheet was filed a “few weeks back”. He, however, did not give a specific date.Choksi, a key accused in the Rs 13,500-crore Punjab National Bank fraud case along with his nephew Nirav Modi, became a citizen of Antigua and Barbuda under a programme in which a certain quantum of investment entitles an individual to citizenship. While investigators say Choksi fled the country to avoid arrest, he claims he left India in January 2018 to undergo a bypass surgery, and not to avoid prosecution. ED previously filed a charge sheet in 2018 to underline the role of Choksi and others in the PNB fraud case.Also read: ED brings back jewels owned by Nirav Modi, Mehul ChoksiThe new charge sheet, relying on statements of several top executives of companies based in the US, UAE, Hong Kong and India, reveals how “lab grown diamonds” were being sold in the garb of natural diamonds through Choksi’s companies M/s Shanyo Gong Si Ltd in Hong Kong and M/s Voyager Brands and M/s Samuels Jewelers Inc in the US. The factory for lab-grown diamonds was run in Surat, where large-scale production took place, personally monitored by Choksi, the charge sheet says. These diamonds appear similar in size, quality and colour when compared to natural diamonds, it adds.According to the charge sheet, in December 2017, Choksi called a meeting of his top employees in Hong Kong, informing them that “coming two-three months would be very tough for Gitanjali Group companies as they would be facing forensic audits”, while directing them not to travel to India during this time. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) initiated a probe into the PNB fraud on January 31, 2018.In January 2018, Choksi tried to dispose of his company Gitanjali Infratech Ltd’s “Tatva Project” in Borivali (Mumbai) by transferring its development rights to one Laxmi Infra Developers Ltd, a Surat-based company owned by Vasant Gajera, according to the charges. Gajera has been charge-sheeted by ED along with Choksi.After the CBI filed a case in January 2018, Choksi and Gajera signed an agreement, according to which, the latter was allowed to develop the project against the transfer of 50 unsold flats to Gitanjali Infratech apart from a payment of over ~30 crore, ED has said. Quoting a February 2019 report of a US Bankruptcy Court-appointed examiner John J Carney, which is now part of the ED charge sheet, the agency has said that Texas-based Samuels Jewelers Inc was used by Choksi for circulating money taken from PNB.Also read: Govt sets up panel to probe 3 Gandhi family-run trusts “Choksi and an international web of co-conspirators used Samuels and a series of puppet vendors to create the false appearance that Samuels was purchasing and/or selling jewellery to and from unrelated third parties. In fact, Samuels and related entities – were secretly selling inventory and laundering money themselves at the directions of Choksi and individuals under his control” the charge sheet says.ED has stated that there were transactions worth $121 million in the form of purchases and sales from Samuels.The primary goal of this, according to the charge sheet, “was to fraudulently induce Samuels’ primary lenders, Wells Fargo and Gordon Brothers, to authorize tens of millions of dollars of credit in advances which were ultimately funnelled outside the US to Choksi-controlled entities in India, Dubai and Hong Kong”.The agency has alleged that puppet vendors in Hong Kong such as Shanyo Gong Si Ltd and Taipingyang Trading Ltd were established by Choksi by providing false paper and monetary trails, which allowed Choksi to use Samuels’ US affiliates as shipping hubs for inventory purchases from Gitanjali affiliates.The agency has recorded a statement of a US national – Curtis Alan Lowrey – who previously co-owned M/s Independent Gemological Laboratories Inc; the firm was later bought by Choksi. Lowrey said that when he pointed out that lab-grown diamonds were being sold as natural diamonds, Choksi called him and directed him not to discuss such matters with anyone except him.Former CEO of Samuels, Farhad K Wadia, also sent a “sworn affidavit and statement” to ED by post, now part of the charge sheet, in which he said that Choksi asked him to rebrand the whole business of Gitanjali in the US under the name of Voyager Brands and told him that his son – Rohan Choksi – was the boss of the group business in the US.According to Wadia’s statement to ED, Choksi’s sister Neena Seth, daughter-in-law Snagda Talera and son Rohan Choksi would oversee Voyager Business in Austin and both Rohan and Snagda worked as his “eyes and ears”. Reacting to questions on the charge sheet, Choksi’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal said: “Evidence is very weak. It shall not stand judicial scrutiny. Reverse burden of proof under fiscal laws doesn’t mean that prosecution need not prove even bedrock facts.” Calls made to Laxmi Developers could did not go through. An email query remained unanswered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-files-new-charge-sheet-to-aid-mehul-choksi-s-extradition/story-gFGXZyKikbi0QxKc2PcQqO.html
20-07-2020||India||Buzz grows over Rajasthan special session, floor test||Amid the political crisis in Rajasthan following a rebellion by ousted deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and 18 of his followers in the state assembly, the government ’s intention of calling a special session of the House may be to gain the moral high ground, political experts said on Sunday.Chief minister Ashok Gehlot called on governor Kalraj Mishra on Saturday evening for a “courtesy meeting” to brief the latter on the Covid-19 pandemic and the state’s efforts to control it.A state government official said, requesting anonymity, that the CM also gave the governor a list of 103 MLAs in the 200-member assembly supporting his government and discussed the possibility of holding a special session so he can face a floor test to prove he has a majority. The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has not demanded one.“The CM has gone ahead and suggested a floor test to attain the high moral ground,” said political commentator Narayan Bareth. He said the meeting was also aimed at removing any doubt in the mind of the state’s constitutional head about the government being in a minority.Prakash Bhandari, another Jaipur-based commentator, said the list that the government gave to the governor doesn’t have names of the 19 Congress MLAs— that of Sachin Pilot and his 18 followers. “The government wanted to give out a message that it was ready to face the House without these rebel MLAs,” he said.BJP leaders said the government should have opted for a floor test much earlier if it actually had the numbers. “If they have the numbers, they should not have herded their MLAs and put them in a hotel for a week,” said Rajendra Rathore, deputy leader of the opposition in the assembly.Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi didn’t rule out a special session next week for a floor test. “If a session is called, we will take all MLAs supporting us in buses from the hotel to the assembly,” he said.The Rajasthan high court will resume hearing on joint petitions by 19 rebel MLAs against the disqualification notices served on them by speaker CP Joshi. The speaker has given them until 5.30 pm on Tuesday to reply to the notices.Leader of Opposition in the state assembly Gulab Chand Kataria on Sunday said only a floor test can decide whether a government has the required numbers to stay in power or not.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/buzz-grows-over-rajasthan-special-session-floor-test/story-GCpKTci7g6Sff5sGlVxgmO.html
20-07-2020||India||How BJP tackles infighting, revolt||When four National People’s Party (NPP) lawmakers withdrew support to Manipur’s N Biren Singh-led government on June 17 and threatened to bring it down, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s central leadership quickly swung into action. Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP chief JP Nadda immediately met the disgruntled lawmakers and NPP chief Conrad Sangma to deal with the crisis. The crisis blew over by June 25 when Singh shook hands with his detractors. Similar intervention in February helped resolve a potential crisis in Karnataka, where several BJP leaders were upset over the denial of cabinet berths. The grievance redress mechanisms of political parties in such situations have been in the focus again as the Congress government in Rajasthan faces a rebellion by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot’ and his followers. The fresh crisis for the Congress comes months after its government was toppled in Madhya Pradesh when 22 lawmakers resigned to pave the way for the BJP’s return to power. In both cases, rebels have expressed dissatisfaction over the party’s grievance redress system.BJP general secretary Anil Jain, who is the party’s Haryana and Chhattisgarh in charge, said the party has multiple systems for addressing issues. “...decisions are taken collectively; it is the party’s position, not an individual’s choice. So clashes do not occur. Our party is not an individual or a personality-centric party; it is based on an ideology,” said Jain, who was instrumental in sorting out differences between Haryana chief minister M L Khattar and his cabinet colleague, Anil Vij.Bhupinder Yadav, BJP’s general secretary and Bihar in-charge, echoed Jain. “...there is a mechanism for addressing issues and decisions are made in a democratic manner. The other difference is that while in the BJP, the highest decision-making body is the Parliamentary Board, in Congress, it is the Gandhis.”A third BJP leader, who did not wish to be named, said tensions and disagreements are expected and all parties have safety valves to prevent spillovers. “Differences or clashes between personalities is not a new phenomenon. We have seen this happen between Sardar Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru, between L K Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee. In such cases, these leaders used to supplement each other or even surrender to the other leader,” the third functionary said. He said Advani had to show deference to Vajpayee, who was seen as a mass leader. In the BJP, there is also a third authority, which is sometimes seen to serve as the safety valve—its ideological fount, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. “The RSS can be described as a friend, philosopher and guide. People can share their views with the [RSS] functionaries and also seek advice,” this leader said.To be sure, not all disagreements were amicably solved. Yashwant Sinha and Jaswant Singh, who served as finance and external affairs ministers in the Vajpayee government, had a bitter parting with the BJP after complaining of being sidelined. Shatrughan Sinha, Kirti Azad and Navjot Singh Sidhu, who also quit the BJP, made public their disagreements with the party’s leadership. Congress leader Pranav Jha rejected the suggestion that his party does not have a proper redress system and said the BJP not only irons out but steamrolls and eliminates differences. “From L K Advani to Uma Bharti and Sushma Swaraj, [these] are all examples. We, on the contrary, are a democratic party of living individuals, who aspire and compete like it happens all across the world.”Ashoka University assistant professor Neelanjan Sircar said it is the very construct of the Congress’s structure that is not based on ideology and makes it vulnerable to defections. “A fundamental challenge for political parties in India is how they prevent defection and how they engineer defection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-bjp-tackles-infighting-revolt/story-8hHsl6Kyg9z1kQsy7x3IHO.html
20-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The US Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency authorisation, its first for the use of pooled testing in the country, on July 18, as the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases continued to rise, and with many states struggling to meet demand for testing. The 7-day average of new cases in the US, on July 18, according to the New York Times database, was around 66,000.Pooled testing isn’t a new concept, and even in the current context of Covid-19, there has been talk of using it in India to boost testing capacity (Hindustan Times wrote about this in the early days of the pandemic here). Pooled testing is simply about pooling samples into lots, testing the lots and then testing individual samples in lots that test positive for the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes the coronavirus disease. India has been an early adopter of antigen testing, and the Indian Council of Medical Research has now asked states to aggressively use rapid antigen tests, HT reported late last week. It should consider pooled testing too, for this will increase testing capacity. India, as I’ve said time and again in the column, should be testing a million people a day. It does around 300,000 a day on average currently.India registered 37,774 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, taking its total tally of infections to 1,076,479 (according to the Hindustan Times dashboard). Of this, 26,812 people have died and 677,565 have recovered — resulting in 372,102 active cases. The number of new cases continues to rise (there’s a new daily record almost every other day) and India is on course to add another million cases before August 15. Now, imagine daily cases not rising but beginning to come down, perhaps two weeks from now.That’s well within the realm of the possible.Last week, in a speech and then an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention, said the disease could be controlled in four to eight weeks if “we could get everyone to wear a mask right now”, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. Redfield cited research in the US on health care workers that showed that universal masking significantly reduced infections passed on by patients even in this high-risk group. Yet, despite universal masking rules that many US states have imposed, law enforcement agencies indicate that they probably will not be actively enforcing the rule. The general opinion seems to be that it is a little disproportionate to penalise someone for something as trivial as not wearing a mask (although, in current circumstances, a person not wearing a mask is probably as dangerous as one waving a gun).Yet, when things head south, the first thing administrators do — the most recent case being Melbourne over the weekend — is to make the wearing of masks mandatory. Masking and social distancing are the only guaranteed ways to prevent infections.There are a variety of reasons why people do not wear masks but all of them can be traced back to plain stupidity. There can be no medical reason for the majority of people not to wear a mask. Research has shown that wearing a mask (or actually multiple masks) does not affect oxygen intake in any way — although the exhalation does cause glasses to mist up. If India continues on its current trajectory, it may well be seeing at least around 75,000 cases a day by the middle of August. The US is the only country to have seen those levels (it recorded a little less than 75,000 cases on July 17). Now, imagine a scenario where India isn’t seeing 75,000 cases by August 15, but a much lower number. Universal masking can make that happen — provided the federal government and the states get serious about enforcement.Can India and Indians, famed for the inability to maintain queues (or understand the concept of personal space) in good times do better than the US in bad times?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-MRJ5Ekd2Ejk1cYHeZDOqIL.html
20-07-2020||India||Rajasthan ‘horse trading’ probe: Jain had Rs 100 crore budget to buy 3 MLAs, claims police||Sanjay Jain, the man arrested on charges of offering money to MLAs to topple Ashok Gehlot government, was given a budget of Rs 100 crore to buy out three MLAs, the Special Operations Group (SOG) claims to have found in its investigations.Jain was arrested on Friday night and is currently in four-day remand of the SOG. “The money game was being controlled from the National Capital Region (NCR),” said police officers, who are part of the investigations.The SOG is investigating three cases of alleged sedition and conspiracy, including the two based on the audio tapes, in which three people--Jain, Ashok Singh and Bharat Malani – have been arrested. “Singh was tasked to give Rs 25 crore to an Independent MLA,” one of the officers mentioned above alleged.The three arrested men were middlemen, he claimed.SOG claims that its preliminary probe into the three cases suggests that Jain was a small link to a long chain trying to lure members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) with crores of rupees to topple the government. “Both Jain and Singh have strong financial background and political links,” one of the police officers said.State BJP spokesperson Pankaj Meena however refuted the claims calling it a trap laid by some senior Congress leaders to defame BJP. “Jain has been block president of Congress in Bikaner in past and has nothing to do with our party,” Meena said.Reacting to the allegations of BJP, Archan Sharma, spokesperson of Congress party highlighted that the audio tape which has surfaced clearly reveals that Jain was acting as middlemen between central leadership of BJP and Sardarshahr MLA Bhanwarlal Sharma to topple the government. “Jain has been office bearer of BJP and this case it is clear that an attempt was made by him with some central leadership of BJP to topple the government,” Sharma added.A top police official related to the probe claims that other than Jain, there were at least three to four other chains of people including businessmen and politicians, who were trying to negotiate with Independents and Congress MLAs. The police are trying to trace the chain of links to the handlers behind the alleged attempt to topple the government.“There have been definite attempts to induce the independents and Congress MLAs and the police has obtained messages and recording to prove that. Messages which talked about arranging money in crores of rupees have been obtained. We are trying to find out the main source of the entire game plan. People like Jain, who was arrested on Friday night, Malani of Ajmer and Singh of Banswara, arrested on July 11, are just the middlemen of different chains,” the police official quoted above added.On Saturday along with the SOG, crime branch and city police were also roped in to investigate the different aspects of the case.Jain was called at the SOG on Thursday night for interrogation followed by registration of an FIR on Friday that named him, Sardarshahar MLA Bhanwarlal Sharma and a person identified as Gajendra Singh.The FIR was registered against the trio on the basis of three audiotapes of purported conversations relating to alleged attempts to destabilise the Gehlot government.In one audiotape, one of the MLAs can be heard purportedly speaking to another agent discussing the plot.In another tape, Jain is allegedly introducing one MLA to Singh and one person is heard saying that more legislators are needed to dislodge the Gehlot government and another person responds exuding confidence that the current dispensation would not last long.In a claim made in a conversation, recorded in another audio clip, one person says Gehlot government is unlikely to last more than 10-15 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-horse-trading-probe-jain-had-rs-100-crore-budget-to-buy-3-mlas-claims-police/story-TExP12eUurnxd3w5JaP1TL.html

Of them, 24,883 people have been cured while 1,112 people have died of the infection till now, according to state government’s daily health bulletin. On Saturday, the state government said in a statement that only 13% of the total number of active Covid-19 patients in West Bengal need to be hospitalized.“That means only 1,912 patients out of the 14,709 patients need to be hospitalized. The rest 87% are asymptomatic and mild. There is no need to panic,” the statement said.The statement also said that the daily Covid-19 testing rate in West Bengal is 144 per million population, which is above the WHO threshold of 140.Chief secretary Rajiva Sinha on Saturday also ruled out the possibility of clamping a total lockdown in Kolkata or across the state, asserting that the restrictions would be enforced strictly only in containment zones. He was reacting to a letter from the Union health ministry that expressed concern about rise in cases in the city and adjoining districts.Coronavirus cases in Bengal rose exponentially in Bengal in July. On July 5, West Bengal registered 895 new Covid-19 cases and 21 deaths marking the highest single-day spike since the pandemic started. Till that day, 757 people had died and the number of active cases was 6,658.It was first time the single-day spike crossed the 800-mark. Out of those 895 new cases, 244 cases were reported from Kolkata while the adjoining districts of North and South 24 Parganas registered 214 and 118 cases.To contain the spread of the infection the state government has asked the civil aviation ministry to stop flights from Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Chennai and Ahmedabad. Also, lockdown restriction have been placed in new areas in the districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-record-one-day-jump-of-2-278-cases-36-deaths-bengal-covid-19-tally-over-42-000/story-H8OUahd97PUCRWDmD67ltK.html

He said the BJP has been playing this game for a long time and contacted him a few months back. They were trying but they failed.The Congress MLA said, “We supported Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot in his last and this government without any conditions. It is unjustified to make attempts to destabilize the government, especially when the country is suffering from Covid-19.” BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek questioned Gudha about the timing of his “revelation”. “Why was he quiet for eight months? There was an assembly session; he could have raised it in the House, he said.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot has claimed that the rebel MLAs were acting in tandem with the BJP to bring down his government.But rebel leader Sachin Pilot has refuted the allegations and denied that he was joining the BJP.On Friday evening, there was a lot of drama at the hotel in Manesar where the dissident Congress MLAs are staying after an SOG team was not allowed to enter the premises by the Haryana Police.

20-07-2020||India||India’s fatality rate lower than global average: Govt||Fewer patients are dying in India from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) compared to the rest of the world, with the case fatality rate (CFR) falling below 2.5% for the first time in five months, according to data shared by the Union health ministry on Sunday.CFR is the ratio of confirmed deaths and confirmed Covid-19 cases. The global CFR as of July 18 was 3.41%.The highest CFR that the country has seen so far since first death was reported on March 12 was 3.23%, and that was reported around mid-May. Since then, the CFR had largely been hovering around 2.8%, one of the lowest in the world.“With effective containment strategy, aggressive testing and standardized clinical management protocols based on holistic standard of care approach, the case fatality rate has significantly dipped. The Case Fatality Rate is progressively falling and currently, it is 2.49%. India has one of the lowest fatality rates in the world,” the health ministry said in a statement.Also read | Coronavirus in India: Highest single-day spike of 40k pushes count past 1.1 millionCertain states are managing the disease quite well and have not reported any deaths due to Covid-19. States such as Manipur, Nagaland, Sikkim, Mizoram and the Union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands have a zero case fatality rate.There are at least 29 states that have a CFR of below the national average currently, and there are about 14 states that have a CFR of less than 1%.“It’s a good sign that people are getting better and our mortality is low. Most positive cases do not require hospitalization, and those needing intensive care is actually a minuscule number. Most people in hospitals have moderate disease with good chances of recovery. The need is to take care of our old and vulnerable population with co-morbidities that is at high risk of developing severe illness,” says Dr Rommel Tickoo, senior consultant, department of internal medicine, Max Healthcare.Those with a CFR below the national average include Tripura (0.19%), Assam (0.23%), Kerala (0.34%), Odisha (0.51%), Goa (0.60%), Himachal Pradesh (0.75%), Bihar (0.83%), Telangana (0.93%), Andhra Pradesh (1.31%), Tamil Nadu (1.45%), Chandigarh (1.71%), Rajasthan (1.94%), Karnataka (2.08%) and Uttar Pradesh (2.36%).“Being able to aggressively test, track and treat cases has been one of the key reasons for effective management of cases as infected people are being picked up early. Early case detection is an absolute must for controlling any disease of epidemic proportions successfully,” said a senior official in the ministry of health who did not wish to be identified. Also read | ‘Some think Covid-19 will vanish by building Ram Temple’: Pawar ahead of PM’s likely Ayodhya visitThe past 24 hours also saw a sharp increase of 23,672 patients recovering. The gap between recovered patients and active cases has widened to 304,043. The total number of recovered patients is 677,422, with the current recovery rate being 62.86%, government data shows.Integrating services of both the public and private sector has also led to effective handling of the cases. “Many states have conducted the population surveys to map and identify the vulnerable population like the elderly, pregnant women and those with co-morbidities. This, with the help of technological solutions like mobile apps, has ensured keeping the high-risk population under continuous observation, thus aiding early identification, timely clinical treatment and reducing fatalities,” the health ministry said.At the ground level, drafting of frontline health workers like Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) and Auxiliary Nurse Mid-wives (ANMs) has been effective in conducting door-to-door surveillance, and to create awareness within the community, especially in managing the migrant population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-fatality-rate-lower-than-global-average-govt/story-lQ9v0HH4fVw4XtQjxP7eQL.html
20-07-2020||India||230kg gold smuggled via diplomatic route: Probe||A multi-agency team probing the seizure of 30 kg of gold from the Thiruvananthapuram airport cargo terminal on July 5 found that at least 230 kg of gold has been smuggled into the country in similar fashion, using some employees of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) diplomatic mission in the Kerala capital over the past year, a senior officer familiar with the investigation said.The gold was contained in a carton with an assortment of pipes, taps, and door handles, food and electronic items. The 24-carat gold — the best quality — estimated to be worth at least Rs 15 crore was hidden inside the pipes. “At least 13 such consignments came to the country in one year, and they all passed without any check due to diplomatic immunity. Some of them were heavier than the latest consignment, which weighed 70 kg. We are also probing some events organised by state government departments,” the officer cited above sai on condition of anonymity, adding that all people whose names cropped up during the questioning will be summoned. This include chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s deposed secretary M Sivasankar and former information technology fellow Arun Balachandran. Last week, customs officers questioned Sivasankar for nine hours. The team is also likely to question a minister in the Vijayan government whose number appeared in the call list of former IT consultant Swapna Suresh, which was leaked to the media. Suresh is the second accused in the case; the first was P. Sarith Kumar, who went to the cargo terminal to pick up the consignment Meanwhile, reports from Dubai on Malayalam TV channels said that the third accused in the case, Faizal Fareed, was arrested in the city and he will be extradited soon. On the request of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) , Interpol issued a blue corner notice against Fareed. A resident of Thrissur, he is a key operative in the smuggling racket, according to the NIA. He is reportedly running a gym and garage in Dubai.The NIA has arrested four people and the customs department 13 in connection with the case. The team has also started a massive operation to trace the smuggled gold and seized 10 kg from two jewellers in Kozhikkode on Saturday, the officer cited above said adding that once the investigation gathered speed, many who were part of the smuggling syndicate had come up with voluntary disclosures. But he admitted that it was difficult to trace all smuggled gold. The team has conducted raids in last two days including two apartments belonging to Suresh and a business establishment of the third suspect, Sandip Nair, in the state capital and seized documents.The NIA filed a first information report (FIR) on July 10 against Sarith Kumar, who was arrested by customs officials on the day the gold was seized. Five days later, Suresh and Nair, a friend of hers, were arrested from a hideout in Bangaluru. A a Malappuram-based businessman, K T Rameez, was held by the customs on July 15 and NIA issued a blue corner notice against Fareed. All five were charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act . Chief minister Vijayan’s powerful secretary was suspended after reports surfaced that he was close to Suresh.State opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala on Sunday asked investigating agencies to question CM Vijayan. “Involvement of his two key aides (Sivasankar and Balachandran) surfaced.

20-07-2020||India||Coronavirus in India: Highest single-day spike of 40k pushes count past 1.1 million||Daily cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) surpassed the 40,000 mark for the first time since the outbreak on Sunday, taking the national tally of infections past 1.1 million, with the latest 100,000 cases being reported in three days.India reported 40,118 new cases and 675 deaths on Sunday, taking the total number of cases to 1,116,597, and deaths to 27,487.While the spread of the virus, Sars-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, is beginning to show signs of plateauing in some urban epicentres of the contagion such as Delhi, other regions such as Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Bihar have started showing spikes in daily new cases.Nearly half the new cases on Sunday came from three states, Maharashtra (9,518), Tamil Nadu (4,979) and Andhra Pradesh (5,041) – all record single-day highs. Several states and UTs such as Uttar Pradesh (2,211 new cases), West Bengal (2,278), Bihar (1,412), Rajasthan (934) and Jammu and Kashmir (701) reported record single-day case spikes on Sunday.Also read: PM Modi takes stock of Covid-19 situation in seven statesDelhi reported 1,211 new cases, Karnataka 4,120 and Telangana 1,296, according to respective state bulletins.In the past week, until July 19, India recorded more than 34,000 new cases a day on average, compared to 26,000 a week before — a statistic that highlights the rate of cases growing in the country. The doubling rate of cases — the number of days it takes for infections to double — is currently 20.2 days.Experts have said that the focus of the battle against the virus now needs to shift to rural parts of the country that traditionally have been beyond the reach of adequate health care mechanisms, and where new hot spots are now feared to surface.The number of recovered Covid-19 patients in India has crossed 700,000, with the recovery rate standing at 62.7%.In graphics: Coronavirus Live TrackerAs of Sunday, the country had 388,786 active cases and the case fatality rate (CFR) — the proportion of people who have died among known infections — was 2.5%, against the global average of 4.2%. The US, which has 3,859,590 cases and 143,042 deaths, has a fatality rate of 3.7%; and Brazil, with 2,076,635 cases and 78,871 deaths, is at 3.8%.Amid an increase in the number of new cases recently, several states such as Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Goa, Jammu and Kashmir, and Uttar Pradesh have announced reimpositions of lockdowns of various degrees in several districts to curb the spread of the outbreak.Also read | ‘Some think Covid-19 will vanish by building Ram Temple’: Pawar ahead of PM’s likely Ayodhya visitThe Union ministry of health and family welfare said on Sunday that India’s CFR is “progressively falling” and is one of the lowest in the world, crediting the country’s “efficient clinical management of hospitalised cases”. Proactive measures such as aggressive testing and timely diagnosis of the central, state and Union territory governments have helped in detecting cases early, the ministry said in a press statement. “Effective clinical management of the moderate and severe cases through a well executed standard of care protocol has ensured high rate of recovery among the Covid patients,” it said.Testing has been ramped up across the country in the past few weeks. According data released by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the country has tested 300,000 samples every day over the past week. This is a two-fold increase from the average 150,000 samples being tested every day a month ago.Experts said that India’s low mortality rate points to the country’s effective management of infections. “There may be a rise in cases but the good thing is that our mortality rate is low, meaning we are losing fewer patients to Covid-19. It speaks a lot about how we are effectively managing our positive cases. Our health care system isn’t at all overwhelmed so we are able to provide treatment to everyone who needs it,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head, community medicine department, Safdarjung Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/highest-single-day-spike-of-40k-pushes-count-past-1-1-mn/story-eTLElMrU8idNSMuxiXmVYK.html
20-07-2020||India||AIIMS to start Covaxin trial this week||Five healthy volunteers are likely to receive the first shot of Bharat Biotech’s anti-coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine candidate, Covaxin, by this weekend at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi.AIIMS, one of the 12 approved sites in the country for conducting early human clinical trials on vaccine candidates, on Saturday received approval of the institute ethics committee to begin the trial.“The ethics committee has granted its approval for the trial. Recruitment of healthy volunteers will begin from Monday,” confirmed Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS.In just 24 hours after having sought applications from people willing to be volunteers for the trial, the hospital received 1,000 applications against its requirement of 100 volunteers.“The response has been tremendous. Our phone has not stopped ringing since we publicized the number, and of the 1,000 applications 400 queries have come just through emails. We have already replied to each email but people also connected through text and WhatsApp messages which will take longer to reply to. We have stopped taking applications and have started inviting people for the screening process,” said Dr Sanjay Rai, professor, community medicine, AIIMS.Dr Rai is the principal investigator for the study in AIIMS.“We applied for the ethics committee’s approval on June 30; they suggested a few things and raised a few concerns for safety that needed minor changes to be made in the trial protocol. Those gaps were addressed and we finally got the approval on Saturday. The registration and screening process of the volunteers will begin from Monday. The entire subject recruitment process is likely to finish in about two weeks,” said Dr Rai.The applications will need filtering, and applicants will be made to undergo a battery of tests before qualifying for the trial, as the volunteers need to be healthy adults between 18 and 55 years.“We have called a select number of people on Monday to take their naso-pharyngeal swab and blood sample, to ensure they are Covid-19 negative. Also, they should have no co-morbidities (known or unknown) such as hypertension, diabetes, abnormal kidney or liver function etc. for which we would require them to undertake certain tests. After first screening is complete and test results are out, we should be able to inject the first batch any day between Thursday and Saturday,” said Dr Rai.The investigators intend to inject at least five selected people in a day.“Five is what we are looking at, but it will not go beyond 15 volunteers in a day. It will be too premature to say when the results will start showing. The process takes its time,” said Dr Rai.Covaxin has been jointly developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Bharat Biotech International Limited.The virus strain for Covaxin was isolated at ICMR-National Institute of Virology in Pune, and transferred to the company on May 9.The Drugs Controller General of India granted approval for Phase I and II human trials for safety and efficacy of the vaccine candidate on June 29.“…. Covaxin initiated phase-1 clinical trials across the country on 15th July 2020. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 375 volunteers in India,” the company said in a statement on Saturday.Apart from Covaxin, the other indigenous vaccine candidate, ZyCov-D, that has received drugs controller’s nod for early human trials is from pharma company Zydus. The human trials for ZyCov-D began last week. Experts say eventually it is a vaccine that will work in breaking the Covid-19 transmission cycle.“Government has taken several steps such as bringing in lockdown to ensure the disease spread is curtailed. The vaccine, however, is going to be the ultimate tool in our fight against the disease. A good vaccine is the most cost-effective way of preventing a disease,” said Dr Amita Jain, head, microbiology department, King George’s Medical University, Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiims-to-start-covaxin-trial-this-week/story-VyEWHfghVVmRtdLZAIEyjP.html
20-07-2020||India||No intention of new land transfer: Jammu and Kashmir||The Jammu and Kashmir government on Sunday clarified that it had no intention of transferring any new land to the armed forces or declare land outside military cantonments as strategic.The clarification came after the union territory (UT) administration’s decision to notify some locations as “strategic areas” for the armed forces to enable construction activity there. The decision triggered outrage among political parties who have termed it an attempt to disempower the people and turn the UT into a military establishment. The UT’s administrative council on Friday approved the proposal to amend the Control of Building Operations Act, 1988, and the J&K Development Act, 1970 to provide a special dispensation for carrying out construction in strategic areas.“The decision has nothing to do with the transfer of any land to the armed forces. The transfer, both acquisition or requisition, continues to be governed by the existing law and the norms on the subject. There is no decision to either transfer any new land or declare areas outside cantonments or army land as strategic. In fact, it is the stated policy of the Government to regulate and harmonize the requirement of land by the armed forces to meet the competing demands of development and internal security, “ an official spokesman said on Sunday. The National Conference, People’s Democratic Party and People’s Conference have been critical of the amendments. “A few political parties are deliberately misleading people as if land is being transferred to armed forces and entire J&K is being turned into a military establishment. It is being alleged that new areas are going to be declared as strategic where laws regulating development will not prevail. All these are baseless comments being made without reading facts, “ the spokesman said.The spokesman said that keeping in view the strategic importance of constructing infrastructure within a defined timeframe, it has been felt that a special mechanism needs to be put in place for such strategic infrastructure needs. “It simply means that in the so called notified “strategic areas”, within existing armed forces land, the responsibility of ensuring that construction activities are undertaken as per the developmental control regulation of the master plan and all environmental safeguards are observed, has been delegated to the Armed Forces themselves, “ the spokesman said. The political partie alleged that notifying ‘strategic areas’ was an attempt to unrecognisably alter the destiny of the people of Kashmir and construction activities in strategic areas is ruse to allow “demographic change.”The spokesman said that adequate safeguards have been kept to ensure that the provisions are not misused. “Only an army authority, not below the level of a corps commander, could make a request to the government for earmarking such area as strategic only for direct operational and training requirements of armed forces. Additionally, the government will satisfy itself about the reasons cited for declaring the areas as strategic area and will have such area notified accordingly, to the extent and with such conditions as may be required, “ the spokesman said. It said that the special dispensation neither gives any powers to the armed forces to acquire more land in the Jammu & Kashmir, nor does it allow them any unbridled powers without observing environmental safeguards and development control regulations.“ It only facilitates fast tracking of the construction of strategic assets, in the overall national interest, while observing all norms”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-intention-of-new-land-transfer-j-k/story-N4dyqsCjnAdYG2ce8kwy3J.html
20-07-2020||India||PM Modi takes stock of Covid-19 situation in seven states||Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to chief ministers of seven states over telephone on Sunday and discussed strategies to combat the coronavirus disease that has infected more than one million Indians and killed at least 27,000. On the prime minister’s call sheet were the chief ministers of states such as Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Bihar, which have logged nearly 300,000 cases between themselves, Assam, where devastating floods have displaced 2.5 million and killed 85, and the Himalayan states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh.In Uttarakhand, PM asked chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat about the condition of soldiers infected with the virus and discussed ways to curb its spread, said a top state government official. On Sunday, Rawat announced that 110 army personnel had tested positive for the virus. “PM Modi spoke to CM Rawat in the afternoon in which he enquired about the health condition of the army personnel affected by Covid-19 virus. During the conversation, he [Modi] asked him [Rawat] to provide every possible help to the army personnel in treatment with proper coordination between the state government and army,” said the official quoted above on condition of anonymity. Rawat assured the PM of all possible help to the soldiers and said, according to the official, “We are in constant touch with the army authorities and providing them all the facilities required in treatment.”Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal said Modi assured all support to the north-eastern state in dealing with the floods and landslides. The PM also inquired about the Covid situation and the ongoing efforts to douse the blaze at Oil India’s Baghjan gas well that has been burning for six weeks, the CM added.“Hon’ble PM Shri @narendramodi ji took stock of the contemporary situation regarding #AssamFloods2020, #COVID19 and Baghjan Oil Well fire scenario over phone this morning,” Sonowal tweeted. “Expressing his concern & solidarity with the people, the PM assured all support to the state,” he said. The state has around 22,000 coronavirus infections. The conversation between Modi and Tamil Nadu chief minister Edapaddi K Palaniswami centred around Covid, which has infected 170,000 people in the state. During the phone conversation, Palaniswami apprised Modi that the state was conducting 48,000 tests daily – the highest in the country – an official release said.The PM was briefed about infection prevention measures and information related to treatment for people who test positive. The state government took all steps for prevention of virus spread and to facilitate an early return to normalcy, the statement quoted Palaniswami as having told Modi.There was no confirmation of the PM’s call from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar and Himachal Pradesh.

20-07-2020||India||Hyderabad encounter: Judicial panel moves Supreme Court for more time||A judicial commission, which the Supreme Court has set up to investigate the alleged encounter killings of four rape-murder accused on the outskirts of Hyderabad in December 2019, has filed a plea seeking more time to complete the probe that it said was impacted due to Covid-19 and the lockdown announced in March-end to contain its spread.In its application filed on July 16, the three-member commission headed by retired Supreme Court judge Justice VS Sirpurkar requested the top the court to extend the deadline by six more months. As things stand now, the deadline ends on September 3.“Even though the work of the commission is continuing, the same could not be completed because of the prevailing pandemic situation…Therefore, the inquiry commission is constrained to apply for an extension of time of six months from the date the commission is able to function with physical hearings, spot inspections etc.,” the application said.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde set up the panel on December 12 after two lawyers — GS Mani and Pradeep Kumar Yadav — approached the apex court seeking an independent probe into the killings of the four men accused of raping and murdering a 26-year-old veterinarian on the outskirts of Hyderabad on November 27.The court asked the panel, also comprising former Bombay high court judge Rekha Baldota and former Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) director DR Karthikeyan, to complete its probe and submit a report within six months from the date of its first sitting. The commission held its first sitting on February 3 and the deadline, as per the Supreme Court order, for submitting its report will expire on September 3.The commission was scheduled to meet on March 23 and 24, but the meetings were cancelled in view of the pandemic and the lockdown. India announced a nationwide lockdown on March 25, and it continued in different phases for 68 days.The plea also pointed out that the commission has its office within the Telangana high court complex and that the high court’s regular administrative and judicial work has been put on hold due to Covid -19.“These circumstances hindered the sittings of the commission since the three members of the commission reside in different cities and the place of enquiry is in a wholly different city,” the plea said.“The Government of India has extended the lockdown from time to time, severely affecting the inter-state movement. Though the lockdown restrictions have been relaxed now, the situation in Hyderabad has further deteriorated. Several persons working in the premises allocated to the commission were found to be Covid positive. There are no other premises available for the commission to hold hearings. Travel between states is still not feasible because of the increasing rates of infection,” the application said.The commission, however, clarified that though its sittings were affected, its functioning was not completely halted. The collection of records, documents and evidence continued, the plea said.The commission’s lawyer, K Parameshwar, declined to comment.Lawyer GS Mani, who approached the top court demanding an independent inquiry, said: “The lockdown due to Covid-19 was unforeseen and a reasonable extension of time can be given to the commission to complete the probe. It is up to the court to decide how much time should be given to finish the inquiry. My only concern is there should be speedy justice.”Officials in Telangana have insisted that the four men — Mohammed Areef, Jollu Shiva, Jollu Naveen Kumar and Chintakunta Chenna Keshavulu — were killed in an exchange of fire on December 6 after they snatched weapons from policemen after they were taken to the crime scene for the reconstruction of the incident. The killings created uproar with various rights groups and members of the legal fraternity calling it a fake encounter and demanding an independent probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-encounter-judicial-panel-moves-sc-for-more-time/story-5TJADyiK2ctfaydPPnjBXJ.html
20-07-2020||India||In a first, law student gets mother’s name added to degree certificate||A law student has succeeded in getting her mother’s name added to her provisional degree certificate after the private university, from which she graduated, originally provided her with a certificate that carried her father’s name alone.The student, Samrita Shankar, who graduated with a BBA LLB (Hons.), originally received her provisional certificate on July 10 carrying her father’s name alone as is the common practice.The certificate read, “This is to certify that Samrita Shankar, the ward of Shankar Narasimhan....”.Shankar requested the examinations officer to include the names of both her parents, but she was informed that it would not be possible since the practice until then was to mention the father’s name alone. Shankar then wrote an email to the dean of the university the same day, highlighting the issue. “When I first received my provisional degree, I noticed something odd in it; it included only my father’s name and not both my parents’ names. Considering that this was a special milestone in my academic life, I wanted to see both my parents’ names because they have been equal contributors in the successful completion of my law degree. Upon doing some research on this, I found out that this was a practice adopted by most universities in India. It is easy to look over such rules and practices as harmless, but they may actually have a huge impact on how gender equality is perceived in society. In the war against gender inequality, fighting the smaller battles is as important as fighting the bigger ones”, Shankar told HT.The dean responded to Shankar’s email within half an hour, thanking Shankar for drawing the attention to the issue, and also said that he had already given instructions to university officials to make necessary changes and to issue her a revised certificate with Shankar’s mother’s name as well.Shankar got her revised certificate within five days on July 15.“I am extremely thankful to my university administration for immediately implementing these changes. I hope other universities also take note of this and bring about the necessary changes in all academic procedures”, Shankar said.In her letter to the dean, Shankar also pointed to a directive issued by the University Grants Commission (UGC) in 1998 after taking note of the discriminatory nature of the practice of including the father’s name alone in the degree certificate of a student. The directive stated that all universities and affiliated colleges must clearly include the student’s name, the father’s name and the mother’s name in all academic testimonials.The letter also said the archaic practice was a blow to efforts to achieve gender equality.“In today’s world, mothers are equally working hard and contributing (financially and otherwise) towards their child’s development and education. Therefore, continuing with an anachronistic practice such as only including the father’s name in educational procedures and certificates is not only a step-back in achieving gender equality, but also disrespectful to single/unwed/divorced mothers and their children”, she wrote in her letter.Shankar requested the University to change the practice and to give students the option to decide whether or not the degree certificate should bear the names of both parents.“Yes, Samrita, you are absolutely right and we have already changed this practice. I have told the Controller’s officer to correct this grave error and ensure that we re-issue a revised provisional certificate immediately. Thank you for bringing this to our notice, a problem that we decided to address in the last few days”, the dean said in his response to Shankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-law-student-gets-mother-s-name-added-to-degree-certificate/story-3LYGPX4n5R1RRuCKugAYoO.html
20-07-2020||India||Indian railways to introduce private trains in phases||Indian Railways plans to introduce private trains on its network in phases, with the first dozen due to start running in the 2023-24 financial year and all 151 by 2027, officials aware of the plan said on condition of anonymity.According to the railway ministry’s projections, the transporter will select the companies that will run the private trains by April 2021; the first 12 are expected to start plying by 2023-24, followed by 45 more in FY 2024-25, the next 50 in FY 2025-26 and the last 44 by 2026-27.“It may be noted that private trains are slated to run from March 2023 only. Tenders will be finalised by March 2021 and Trains will operate from March 2023,” the railway ministry said in a statement on Sunday.The railway ministry on July 1 began the formal process of allowing private trains on 109 routes -- a process that aims to, for the first time, to open up one of the government’s most prominent enterprises that has in recent decades been outpaced by the demands of a rapidly growing economy.The ministry issued what is known as a request for qualification (RFQ) private companies to run 151 trains spread over these routes, laying down specific conditions that will need to be met in a move that is meant to “introduce modern technologies and world class services” for one of India’s most popular modes of transport.The railway ministry plans to run the trains along 12 clusters across Indian Railways’s network. It has planned two clusters each it Delhi and Mumbai, and one cluster each in Secunderabad, Chennai, Howrah, Jaipur, Prayagraj, Chandigarh, Bengaluru, and Patna. According to the ministry, the planned investment will come to around ₹30,000 crore, and a majority of the rakes (70%) will have o be manufactured in India; private entities cleared to run the train services shall be responsible for financing, procuring, operating and maintaining the trains.“The investment by private sector will enable Indian Railways to spend its existing resources for accelerated development of railway infrastructure in the north-eastern states, other socially, economically backward regions and also upgrade its existing infrastructure for running more trains and at higher speed,” an official said.The trains will be designed to run at a maximum speed of 160 kmph. The ministry expects a reduction in journey time by around 10-15% at 130 kmph and around 30% at 160 kmph. Initially, they will run at 130 kmph and are slated to run at 160 kmph by March 2024.“The private entity shall pay to Indian Railways fixed haulage charges, energy charges as per actual consumption and a share in gross revenue determined through a transparent bidding process. Railways is expected to receive total haulage charges of around Rs. 3,000 crore per annum from operation of these 151 trains,” the official cited above added.Railways is currently operating in losses in the passenger segment, and the national carrier aims to meet its expenditure through a minimum guaranteed cost that the private train operator will have to pay to the national carrier.Fares will be based on competition with other modes of transport in the same segment, including airfares and fares of air-conditioned buses.“Railways have been progressively moving towards having a greater role for private sector. This move of getting the private sector to run 151 trains is an excellent development, with not only private capital moving into railways, but also the benefit of fresh talent and expertise being injected into the railways. However, Railways needs to commit to service-level agreements (SLAs) to the private players so that the private players can in turn provide dependable services,” said Jaijit Bhattacharya, president of the Centre for Digital Economy Policy Research (C- DEP), a think tank||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pvt-trains-to-be-introduced-in-phases/story-DxeVrUhn7uT97DvHYQKSBO.html

The team went to a resort where it suspects the rebel Congress MLAs are staying, but was allowed to enter the premises by the hotel management, according people aware of the developments. The team was asked to come back in the morning.“Acting on a tip-off, a team has been sent to Manesar to quiz Sharma. A notice has been sent to the residence of Sharma in Churu and Jaipur,” said Ashok Rathore, additional director general of police, SOG. “Important details have been obtained from [alleged middleman Sanjay] Jain. We are verifying that,” Rathore added.Jain was arrested on Friday night on charges of offering money to Congress and independent MLAs with an aim to dislodge the Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan. A court in Jaipur remanded Jain to four days in police custody on Saturday.He received Rs 100 crore from an unidentified mastermind to lure three lawmakers, said an official of SOG, which is probing the case.The SOG official said Jain, Ashok Singh and Bharat Malani – all suspected middlemen — were arrested in the case. Another police officer said: “Messages which talked about arranging money in crore of rupees have been obtained. We are trying to find out the main source of the entire game plan.”SOG has filed three FIRs. On Saturday, three officers from the crime branch of the state and one from Jaipur city police were roped in to investigate the case along with SOG.BJP spokesperson Pankaj Meena said the Congress laid a trap to defame the BJP. “Jain had been block president of the Congress in Bikaner and has nothing to do with our party,” he said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cops-reach-haryana-to-quiz-rebel-congress-legislator/story-NRzwPi5weBrFpmisbvYHlO.html
20-07-2020||India||Congress demands Shekhawat’s resignation, BJP hits back||The Congress demanded the resignation of Union water resources minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat over the political crisis in Rajasthan on Sunday, reiterating its allegation that he is involved in a plot to topple the state government.Shekhawat, a BJP parliamentarian from Jodhpur, has no moral authority to continue in office and he should resign to ensure that the probe is not influenced, Congress leader Ajay Maken said.Rajasthan’s ruling Congress says Shekhawat’s voice can be heard in audio tapes purportedly recording conversations detailing a plot to topple the state government. Shekhawat denies the charge and says he is ready for a probe.At a press conference, Maken, who is visiting Jaipur as a Congress observer, said Rajasthan Police’s Anti-Corruption Bureau has registered a case over the audio tapes and named Gajendra Singh, rebel Congress MLA Bhanwarlal Sharma and alleged middleman Sanjay Jain, who has been arrested. Separately, the police’s Special Operations Group (SOG) has filed three first information reports, or FIRs, in connection with the case.“If Union minister Gajendra Singh claims that it is not his voice [in the clips], and the reference in the audio clip is to some other Gajendra Singh, then why is he afraid of giving voice sample?” Maken asked.One of the FIRs filed by the SOG does not identify “Gajendra Singh” as Union minister Shekhawat.Maken also alleged that the police in Haryana and Delhi were giving protection to rebel Congress MLAs from Rajasthan.CM Ashok Gehlot is locked in a power tussle with former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, who has the backing of 18 Congress legislators and three independents. These MLAs are believed to be camping in Gurugram.Maken also asked why a team of the Rajasthan Police was “stopped by the Haryana Police” on Friday while trying to take voice samples of Congress MLAs Sharma and Vishvendra Singh at a Gurugram hotel.Maken, who has come to Jaipur as a Congress observer, said it is the betrayal of people’s mandate and the murder of democracy if an elected government is toppled with money power.“If the BJP has no role in it, then why the MLAs took shelter in the party-ruled Haryana?” he asked.While the BJP has sought a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into what it called a “saga of illegalities and concocted lies”, the Congress says the demand amounted to “admission of guilt”.Hitting back, BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said the Congress has no right to ask for Shekhawat’s resignation.He said the state government “violated the Constitution” and illegally tapped phones, adding that there is no question of giving a voice sample when the audio tapes are illegal. “The government should prove its mandate and stop misguiding people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-demands-shekhawat-s-resignation-bjp-hits-back/story-v8GtkklWVkxrtonbRuNnfK.html
20-07-2020||India||Confident that PM Modi will come for bhumi pujan: Nritya Gopal Das||Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust chairman Mahant Nritya Gopal Das’s long wait for construction of the Ram temple to begin will end with the bhumi pujan ceremony likely to place on August 5. Das wrote an emotional letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month, requesting him to visit Ayodhya for the ceremony. It was after this letter that the Prime Minister’s Office sought tentative dates from the trust for PM Modi’s Ayodhya visit for the bhumi pujan. Now, with the PM likely to visit Ayodhya on August 5 for the ceremony, Das is close to seeing his dream being fulfilled. The Mahant wants a bhumi pujan on lines of the one performed for the Somnath temple in Gujarat.A day after the trust, formed to construct the Ram temple in Ayodhya, held a meeting, Das, who heads the trust, spoke in an interview with Hindustan Times. Excerpts from the interviewYou always wanted a grand bhumi pujan for the Ram temple. But will the Covid-19 pandemic keep the ceremony low-key?We had planned a grand bhumi pujan for Ram temple like the one organised for the Somnath temple. Then President of India Rajendra Prasad and home minister Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel attended the Somanth temple bhumi pujan. The ceremony continued for three days. It was a grand and elaborate event. We wanted something like this. But due to the Covid-19 pandemic, this is not possible now. After much effort, we were able to get the PM’s consent to attend the bhumi pujan.The tentative date for bhumi pujan is August 5. But if due to some unavoidable circumstances, the PM is not able to visit Ayodhya, what will the trust do?We are confident that the PM will definitely come to Ayodhya for the bhumi pujan.However, if due to some unavoidable circumstances and national issues, the PM is not able to come to Ayodhya on August 5 for bhumi pujan then, in the nation’s interest, we will delay the ceremony and will wait for the PM’s visit. Finally, has the trust agreed to make changes in the existing model of the proposed Ram temple?The Ram temple model prepared by VHP (Vishva Hindu Parishad) in 1989 will not be changed. It will remain the same. Ram temple will be constructed on the existing model. But some additions have been made to the temple’s model and that is what saints had been demanding. Now, the temple’s height will be 161 metres instead of 128 metres. The number of domes has been increased from three to five. Ram temple’s chief architect Chandrakant Sompura has approved these changes. A grand Ram temple will be constructed. In the meeting (Trust meeting on Saturday), we also discussed these changes.Will stone slabs lying at Shri Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas Karyashala be used in construction of the Ram temple?Yes.

20-07-2020||India||Ayodhya gears up for 3-day rituals to start temple work||Hindu religious figures in Ayodhya plan to organise three days of Vedic rituals starting on August 3 and ending with the bhumi pujan on August 5 that will mark the start of construction of a Ram temple in the holy town.Prime Minister Narendra Modi may lay the foundation stone for the temple at around 12.15 pm on August 5, the religious figures said.“Timings for foundation laying ceremony for the Prime Minister has been decided according to Hindu calendar and the most auspicious time (12.15 pm) on August 5 has been selected,” said Mahant Kamal Nayan Das, heir to Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, chairman of the Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, formed to oversee the temple construction. An official communication from the Prime Minister’s Office on his Ayodhya visit is yet to be released, he added.Vedic rituals for bhumi pujan will start on August 3 with a special puja to Lord Ganesha. According to Hindu belief, every auspicious ceremony begins with offerings to Lord Ganesha. Next day, the priests will perform the Ramacharya puja. An 11-member team of priests (Acharya) from Varanasi and Ayodhya will perform the three-day rituals. In the entire ceremony, priests from Varanasi, which is parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Modi, will play a prominent role.On his visit to Ayodhya, Modi is likely to remain in temple town for two hours.“PM’s visit will be short and will only be confined to bhumi pujan,” said Mahant Nritya Kamal Nayan Das, who was also present at the Trust’s meeting in Ayodhya on Saturday.On the occasion, chief minister Yogi Adityanath will also be present. Only a select few will be present at the bhumi pujan because of the Covid-19 pandemic.According to members of the Trust, PM Modi is also likely to announce projects for Ayodhya worth several thousand crore during his visit to Ayodhya.Chief minister Adityanath has already instructed senior officials of the state government to prepare a proposal for Ayodhya’s development which will be forwarded to the Centre.Ram temple construction committee chairman Nripendra Misra, who is also considered the PMO’s emissary on Ayodhya, was in the temple town for three days to discuss essential matters related to the construction of the temple ahead of what will be Modi’s maiden visit to Ayodhya .Misra reached Ayodhya late on July 15 evening. He left on Sunday morning after paying obeisance at the Hanuman Garhi temple.“During his stay in Ayodhya, Nripendra Misra examined pre-construction activity carried out at the Ram Janmabhoomi till date. He also discussed all important aspects related to construction of Ram temple and PM Narendra Modi’s visit to Ayodhya for bhumi pujan of the Ram temple,” said Mahant Kamal Nayan Das.Engineers of Larsen and Toubro, the company that will construct the Ram temple, and Nikhil Sompura, son of chief architect Chandrakant Sompura, were also present in Ayodhya. Misra discussed the issue of soil testing with the engineers. Larsen and Toubro is carrying out soil testing from 60 metres below the ground. It will carry out construction of the Ram temple without charging any fee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayodhya-gears-up-for-3-day-rituals-to-start-temple-work/story-1WaUZ2CMcK8thfferXz3XJ.html

The PLA warships also enter the Indian Ocean through Malacca Straits and operate in the international waters.After the Galwan flare-up in East Ladakh, the Indian Navy’s forward posture has ensured that three PLA Navy warships have taken to safe waters in Gulf of Aden, off the coast of Djibouti and three other warships have exited through Malacca Straits to home base. “A Chinese warship which was entering through Indonesia towards the Indian Ocean also turned back as the Indian forces were fully prepared for any contingency,” said a senior commander.Also Read: Apex China Study Group reviews East Ladakh: Key stand-off points record withdrawalThe PLA Navy has acquired a string of ports in Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Iran and east Africa to not only contain the Indian Navy but also challenge the presence of US Central Command forces as well as French and British Navy. Beijing has 70 per cent stake in Kyaukpyu port in Myanmar, which sits in the Bay of Bengal, Hambanthota port in South Sri Lanka dominates the Indian Ocean, Gwadar port in Pakistan sits on the mouth of Gulf of Oman and the port of Jask in Iran is located on the edge of Persian Gulf. While the countries in which these ports are may justify the Chinese tie-up due to push by the US, fact is that all these ports have been acquired through huge infusion of cash and muscle. With the PLA Navy moving full speed to acquire blue water navy status, it is only a matter of time that the global trade will be at mercy of the Chinese warships.Also Read: US backs ASEAN on South China Sea, challenges China’s predatory world viewWith a clear understanding of the Chinese posture, the Indian national security planners are working towards building of advance landing grounds in some of the 1062 islands under its sovereignty. Rather than buy more aircraft carriers, the Indian plan is to totally upgrade the military facilities in Andaman Nicobar Islands on eastern seaboard as well as Lakshadweep on western seaboard. To counter the Chinese threat, the plan is to have a network of Indian airbases on these islands in both Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal so that freedom of navigation and overflights is maintained and not restricted like in South China Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-navy-s-forward-posture-against-pla-aggression-in-ladakh-muscles-out-chinese-threat-on-high-seas/story-mRYUXdkrCmGQznQod5lWFK.html
20-07-2020||India||TB vaccine averts severe infections, deaths from Covid-19: Study||The inexpensive and widely-used Bacillus Calmette–Guerin (BCG) vaccine that protects against childhood tuberculosis also prevents severe infection and death from coronavirus disease (Covid-19), concluded two peer-reviewed studies released last week, including one led by Indian researchers from the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Delhi.The JNU study from India found that the quality of protection depends on the BCG strain used to make the vaccine, with Mixed, Pasteur and Japan strains being superior to the three other strains which together account for more than 90% of the BCG vaccines being used in the world. The peer-reviewed study was published in Cell Death and Disease, which part of the Nature group of journals. The second study from the US, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, also linked BCG vaccination with reduced Covid-19 deaths.  “Those who got BCG vaccination, not just in India but in other countries, are more protected than those who were not, shows this analysis of data for countries with over 1,000 reported cases. We think BCG-mediated immune response would help in lowering both incidence and severity of infection,” said study author Gobardhan Das, professor, Centre for Molecular Medicine, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. Around 100 million children around the world get the BCG vaccine every year.Also read: Coronavirus pandemic is going to get worse and worse and worse, says WHO chiefThe six major BCG strains that now account for at least 90% of the BCG vaccines employed worldwide are Pasteur, Danish, Glaxo 1077 (derived from the Danish strain), Tokyo, Russia, and Moreau. “The data shows that BCG offers some degree of protection against Covid-19, but all the countries (that give BCG vaccines to their children) do not do equally well, so we looked at which strain offered better protection. We analysed all the strains being used and found that some of the strains, such as BCG Mix, BCG Pastuer, and BCG Tokyo do better compared to others, such as BCG Russia and BCG Danish. India uses BCG Mix vaccine,” said Das.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage BCG vaccination of children began in India in 1949; in 2019, at least 97% of the 26 million Indian children born that years received it. The vaccine protects against disseminated TB and meningitis in childhood, but doesn’t offer protection from adult pulmonary TB, which has led to several countries discontinuing its use.“BCG is a potent immune-modulator, especially of the cell-mediated immunity. BCG has protective effects against leprosy, buruli ulcer, bladder cancer, type-1 diabetes and several other diseases, including those not associated with mycobacteria. Macaques immunised with BCG have incidence of pulmonary infections, which led to a proposal for BCG immunisation for the prevention against various respiratory infections. Since Covid-19 is also a respiratory infection, it gives another basis for the study,” said Das, who did the study with researchers from the JNU School of Computer and System Sciences, and School of Computational and Integrative Sciences.Many clinicians and epidemiologists are unconvinced about the findings. “I don’t think there’s convincing evidence, which we can only get from randomised controlled trials that enroll a large number of people. It is highly unlikely that the protection will last till adulthood, we have convincing evidence from India that it does not protect against adult TB, even in children, it just prevents simple TB from becoming systemic and affecting the brain and other organ,” paediatric pulmonologist Dr Krishnan Chhugh, director of paediatrics at Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram.Epidemiologists are concerned that most countries with high BCG vaccination rates are not testing enough and those that are registering a sharp increase in numbers. “Several countries now have rapidly escalating Covid-19 outbreaks, including Brazil, India, Russia, Mexico, Peru, Chile. And they all routinely give BCG at birth. So, it is dangerous to make conclusions in such a dynamic situation. We simply cannot act on these correlations and must wait for randomised trials on BCG and Covid-19,” tweeted Prof Madhukar Pai, director, McGill Global Health Programmes, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.“We can’t say `We have been vaccinated, we are safe’. If it works to some extent, it will be great, but even then, it will not be a game changer,” said Dr Chugh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tb-vaccine-averts-severe-infections-deaths-study/story-CERDmGhb0rWdjvUfCz8BKL.html
20-07-2020||Today's||India must share its good green tech with other developing nations||The story of India-Africa ties is rich, bubbling over with positive news. There’s ancient trading, Indian professors teaching children mathematics, and Indian traders for whom one or the other country in Africa is home. But today is good news day. In Kenya’s Owino Uthuru, outside Mombasa, a community fought lead poisoning from Kenya Metal Refineries EPZ Limited, that recycled lead acid batteries. The factory shut down, but in 2016, a class action suite was initiated by the community, demanding compensation. The chemical and lead-laced remains from the factory continue to be a challenge. A former worker, Phyllis Omido, who led the struggle, just got a ruling for compensation of about ~85 crores (11.3 million USD). The bad news is not only that people were poisoned, but that this was the subsidiary of an Indian company. In photos, the former factory looked like an unsafe, crude, medieval operation.Meanwhile, India has managed to get excellent local technology off the ground. While regulation in many African countries is poor, and while India can’t stop its entrepreneurs from doing all kinds of business, we can showcase such our own environmental technology that meets our regulatory standards. We must set criterion, identify tech and let other developing countries know of these. If regulatory authorities in other countries know of these technologies, they might safeguard their citizens and environment by using good tech from India, not the kind of stuff we ourselves don’t allow, and which brings us disrepute.(The writer is the founder and director of the Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/india-must-share-its-good-green-tech-with-other-developing-nations/story-WetvRz1o44dVqSwVPyCWjO.html
20-07-2020||Editorials||India’s regional challenge||Last week, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi offered his explanation on why the Chinese decided to be aggressive at the border at this juncture. Among other reasons, he attributed this to the failure of the Narendra Modi government’s foreign policy, in particular, when it comes to the neighbourhood. External affairs minister S Jaishankar countered Mr Gandhi — and on the neighbourhood, listed out India’s engagement with smaller countries, the development assistance being offered, and landmark deals.Between the political black-and-white worldview — where Mr Gandhi sees a failure in India’s handling of the neighbourhood, and Mr Jaishankar sees success — lies a complex truth. India is more invested in the neighbourhood than it has been, but it has also become more challenging for New Delhi to secure its interests in the region. This is due to two factors. The first reason is the increased presence of China. Beijing has decided to engage with political parties, official institutions, media, businesses, and societies in South Asia — with the objective of increasing its control, and eroding Indian influence. India has historic advantages of connectivity, people-to-people linkages, and cultural convergence. But it lacks the resources, single-minded determination, and is often caught between conflicting objectives and ad-hoc policymaking, which makes meeting the China challenge more difficult. The second reason is the nature of democratic contestation in the neighbourhood. Given India’s size and role in the domestic politics of Nepal, Bangladesh or Sri Lanka, there is a “nationalist” constituency in each of these countries that earns political advantage by being seen as adversarial to India. These domestic constituencies then become a natural, receptive partner for China.These twin challenges affect the policy matrix in Delhi. The government has sought to break out of this challenge by taking a firm position against hostile governments and encouraging friendly parties which have come to power (Maldives), working with supposedly antagonistic partners to neutralise their hostility (KP Oli in Nepal, the Rajapaksas in Sri Lanka), or backing its allies (the Awami League in Bangladesh). But these methods are not foolproof, and have thrown mixed results, and will be a challenge for New Delhi. As the neighbourhood gets more complex, India’s government and Opposition should develop a bipartisan approach. Mr Gandhi and Mr Jaishankar should go offline, and have a chat about these complexities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/india-s-regional-challenge/story-kzg9ACO70PiB32BzPFjVUL.html
20-07-2020||Editorials||Delhi’s annual infrastructure shock||On Sunday, heavy rainfall (between 64.5 mm and 124.4 mm) hit Delhi for three hours (5.30am-8.30 am), the season’s first major shower since monsoon arrived on June 24. The rains are an annual feature, but so is the collapse of Delhi’s infrastructure. This year too, the deluge led to the inundation of parts of the city, water-logging of main roads, traffic congestion, uprooting of trees, and damaged scores of hutments in the slum areas. Two deaths were reported. The sharp downpour and the collapse of the civic infrastructure sparked a blame-game between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led city government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-controlled municipal corporations. While the BJP blamed the government for not undertaking pre-monsoon works such as desilting, the AAP said there was need for better coordination between government departments and corporations since cleaning and desilting of the drains are a joint responsibility.However, the flooding problem cannot be solved by desilting the drains alone. The city will have to undo decades of bad developmental planning and overconcretisation, which has destroyed or built over the city’s natural drainage system. It will have to check construction on the Yamuna floodplains because they reduce the water-carrying capacity of the river. And it will have to restore wetlands, lakes and ponds which act as sponges to control flooding. A few years ago, experts recommended solutions, which included restoration of the intricate natural drainage network that work as waterways; removal of encroachment of storm water drains; stopping of construction and dumping of garbage inside storm water drains; separating sewage network from the drainage network; and covering the access points of drains so that de-silting of drains can be carried out regularly.The government must look into these recommendations, and consider setting up a single agency to tackle the drainage-flooding problem so that Delhi does not suffer every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/delhi-s-annual-infrastructure-shock/story-i6q8auSrajEX8Gqd9cPv4O.html
20-07-2020||Editorials||John Lewis: A champion of social justice||John Lewis is no more. He would have died a broken man — for the nature of the current United States (US) administration led by Donald Trump is, in so many ways, the opposite of all that Lewis stood for. But he would also have died a hopeful man — for the protests that have engulfed the US after George Floyd’s brutal killing by the police have brought back to centre-stage the issues of racial equality, non-discrimination, dignity, legal reforms, and political rights that Lewis fought for. Indeed, it was because men like him fought that today’s protests have even become possible.Lewis was a US civil rights hero, who in the 1950s and 60s led and participated in the movement against segregation and for equality. In the US South, he was among the original freedom riders who challenged segregated inter-state travel. In Selma, he marched for equal voting rights — and was brutally beaten by state authorities. In Washington, where Martin Luther King Jr delivered his historic address at the Lincoln Memorial, Lewis spoke out against racism. And in the US Congress, where he was a member for close to 25 years, he became a voice of conscience.It is men like Lewis who ensured that the US overcame one of its most shameful legacies of institutionalised racial discrimination. And in this, along with King, he was inspired by the Gandhian path of non-violent resistance. This courage of conviction — to challenge the most oppressive of structures through peaceful and democratic methods — is a lesson to all social justice movements across the world. This persistence — he said it was important not to be afraid of making noise and getting into good trouble, necessary trouble — is a lesson that speaking up against wrong and retaining an ethical core is integral to progress. For all those who want to fight for a better world, Lewis will be an inspiration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/john-lewis-a-champion-of-social-justice/story-1KY2jjOOtVQwkXrFOksD5J.html
