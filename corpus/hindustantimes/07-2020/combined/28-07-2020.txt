It’s hard to avoid a sense of déjà vu — different versions of this political drama have played out in the past few years in Karnataka, in Madhya Pradesh and elsewhere.The Tenth Schedule, originally inserted in the Indian Constitution in 1985, has a chequered history. But there appears to be a growing consensus that it has failed to achieve its objective of curbing opportunistic defections from one political party to another. A more accurate manner of putting it, perhaps, is that it has controlled or streamlined the permissible means of changing political direction midstream, and in a way, made it costlier in a crude transactional sense.The Kihoto Hollohan judgment of the Supreme Court (SC) in 1992, in the course of upholding the constitutional scheme enshrined in the Tenth Schedule, highlighted the importance of political parties in the Indian democratic system. Members of Parliament (MPs) and Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) are elected, in principle, if not always in fact, on the political and ideological platform of their party. So it is legitimate, the SC said, to hold them to that. If they wish to step away from that ideology, they are free to do so but must seek a fresh mandate from the people.A constitutional amendment in 2003 significantly narrowed the permissible exceptions to this prohibition on party-switching, effectively permitting legislators to escape disqualification only in the event that a minimum of two-thirds of the legislators chose to switch, rather than one-third as was the case with the original clause. It further sought to close other potential means of “compensating” defectors by also disqualifying such persons from holding any remunerative political posts within the government.It is difficult to fault the underlying ethos of the Tenth Schedule, even if we ruefully accept the fact that it can often be circumvented one way or the other. However, looking more intensely into important characteristics of our polity, and to certain features that have assumed outsized importance in recent years, the virtues of the Tenth Schedule appear less substantial and its drawbacks larger.This constitutional mechanism is, as the SC has recognised in its judgments, premised on a recognition of the political party as the fulcrum of the polity. In and of itself, this may be broadly correct. But the associated assumption, that an electoral contest between political parties will involve reasoned debate and deliberative decision-making with respect to defined electoral programmes and manifestos, is far more questionable. Part of this goes to the lack of democracy within political parties themselves.The Congress attracts much grumbling, even from well-wishers, for its complete lack of intra-party democracy and the continued dominance of the Nehru-Gandhi family. But in the era of Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is equally dominated by his unrivalled popularity and broad national appeal. Examples can be cited at the regional level too: Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal, the Thackerays in Maharashtra, Mayawati in the context of the Bahujan Samaj Party.National and state elections, in that sense, appear to have become quasi-presidential in nature. And so, while the tendency of critical masses of legislators to jump ship at crucial moments has not changed substantially since the enactment of the Tenth Schedule in 1985, the political backdrop has evolved significantly. In the 1990s, and arguably extending until the election of PM Modi, we witnessed an era of unstable coalition governments — the United Front governments, and then that of the first National Democratic Alliance and United Progressive Alliance.In that era, the pragmatic objective of providing some stability to the coalition precariously stitched together would have further increased the perceived relevance of the Tenth Schedule.Today, things look very different. The lack of intra-party democracy and the uber-dominance of certain political leaders is only one aspect. The lack of public debate and reasoned decision-making on the most critical issues of the day is conspicuous. Polarisation and the proliferation of fake news on social media have only compounded the problem. In this radically-changed political context, the broader argument being made today by former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot — on the value of outspoken dissent within political parties — has greater resonance. We need more stirrings within political parties, and within governments, not less.Consider the presidential primary contest in the United States, for example, where prospective nominees of the Republican and Democratic parties must necessarily engage in a rigorous and extended state-by-state process before even emerging as candidates for the general election. Or, if it is felt that a proper analogy may be made only to parliamentary systems, take the intense contests for leadership in the prominent political parties in the United Kingdom.The Tenth Schedule doesn’t directly impede intra-party democracy or deliberative decision-making. The point is that the factors impeding the success of India’s parliamentary democracy are less attributable to straying legislators (dubious though their motives may be, and unsavoury though the spectacle might be) and more to deep-seated systemic challenges. Irrespective of the Tenth Schedule, there are grave dangers these broader challenges pose to our democracy. These cannot be ignored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/what-the-tenth-schedule-signifies-analysis/story-Vfv0X14MKtPEj95Xcm762K.html
28-07-2020||News||India must speak up for human rights at UNSC | Analysis||When India joins the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) as a non-permanent member in January 2021, it will confront a range of issues. How can the UN help wind down conflicts in Syria, Yemen, and Afghanistan, while ensuring humanitarian aid for civilians and justice for wrongdoers? How can it protect refugees fleeing these and many other conflicts? How to address the human rights impact, including structural racism and inequality, of the coronavirus pandemic?Human rights groups have repeatedly criticised UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres for his reluctance to rebuke powerful countries such as China, Russia, or the United States (US) for their human rights violations. In response, he initiated a “Call to Action on Human Rights” aimed at urging the UN and member-states to focus more attention on growing rights challenges. People facing oppression around the world will have high expectations of India to firmly defend their rights. The Indian government has said that on the Council, it would “act as a voice of reason and moderation and a firm believer in respect for international law.”Unfortunately, India’s record on promoting respect for rights abroad is poor. At the UN Human Rights Council, India has usually abstained on country-specific resolutions. It has failed to support UN initiatives to address Myanmar’s ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya or Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s “drug war”.India has, at times, spoken, whether to support a call for accountability for alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka in the past, or recently, when it said that concerns around rights protections in Hong Kong should be considered “properly, seriously and objectively”. Human rights abuses are typically either a cause or effect of international crises on the Security Council’s agenda. India is a significant contributor of UN peacekeepers to missions around the world and has aspirations of becoming a permanent member of an expanded Security Council. UN peacekeeping missions increasingly focus on monitoring, investigating, and reporting human rights abuses in post-conflict situations. India should demonstrate leadership and support, expanding such efforts.To stand for rights abroad, India should also address its record at home. While it has long contrasted its more open society with China’s one-party authoritarian State, the government has recently emulated some of China’s restrictions. India’s large number of capricious Internet shutdowns puts it in league with Myanmar, Iran, and Zimbabwe. Despite a Supreme Court ruling that Internet communication is a fundamental freedom, access remains restricted in Jammu and Kashmir. Even during a lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19, when the Internet has become the primary means of information, communication, entertainment, education, and business, the authorities have not relented.Nor did the spread of the Black Lives Matter movement around the world, after police in the US killed George Floyd, have a noticeable impact in India. The Indian police continued their longstanding practice of torturing suspects, resulting recently in the deaths of a father and son for keeping their electronics shop open longer than Covid-19 lockdown rules allowed. The authorities remain silent on the need to protect marginalised groups at home.While on international platforms, leaders like to speak of India’s feisty civil society, its independent media, and other democratic institutions, these, too, have suffered severe setbacks. Numerous activists are in jail or facing politically-motivated charges for expressing critical views of the government. The authorities recently opposed 80-year-old activist Varavara Rao’s bail, saying that he was seeking “undue benefit,” on account of “Covid-19 and his old age”.India’s constitutional protections are in decline, including in its commitment to secularism. Members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and their followers have repeatedly stigmatised Muslims.When Indians protested the government’s discriminatory citizenship policies, the authorities hit back hard. Like US President Donald Trump, who has described anti-racism protesters as “thugs” or Chinese authorities who said that the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong were the first signs of “terrorism”, some ruling party politicians have described peaceful protesters as “traitors”. The police not only used excessive force and failed to protect protesters but, in some cases, joined in the attacks. But far from holding the police to account, the authorities have instead arrested peaceful protesters.India appears to be at a crossroads. When it joins the UNSC, it will have a choice: Align with rights-respecting countries or make common cause with countries such as China, Russia and Brazil that are trying to tear down the global rules-based legal system that has human rights at its core. With a pivotal US election in November, an increasingly belligerent China, and a world in twin health and economic crises, early 2021 will be a key moment for India to align itself with those who support rights, not those who undermine them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-must-speak-up-for-human-rights-at-unsc/story-g3oE4yWGniSaCU1NOBlmkJ.html
28-07-2020||City||Kalyan hospital loses Covid status, registration suspended for overcharging patients||The Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) cancelled the recognition of A and G Hospital in Murbad Road, as a Covid hospital and suspended its registration till August 31 for overcharging Covid patients ₹9.36 lakh, and other irregularities. “This particular hospital had been given permission to treat Covid patients by the civic body. We have received numerous complaints about overcharging. Our flying squad and auditor that looks after the bills of private hospitals found irregularities in the bills as most patients were overcharged,” said Vinay Kulkarni, in-charge, KDMC’s flying squad.“Under the norms of the Bombay Nursing Homes Registration Act, 1949, the registration of the hospital has been suspended till August 31 or till they return ₹9.36 lakh to the patients and follow all norms. Permission to treat Covid patients has been terminated. The hospital will not admit any new Covid or non-Covid patients. There are 35 patients admitted there who will be treated and discharged under the inspection of a medical officer appointed by us,” added Kulkarni. As per the civic body’s findings, the 35-bed hospital has been charging patients above the rates fixed by the state government. In the 19 bills audited by the flying squad, ₹9.36 lakh was charged in excess. The hospital had charged above MRP for Tocilizumab injections, and a bill for the same was not provided to the patient. It also sold a ‘Covid package’ worth ₹12,000. “The hospital failed to update the list of beds available for Covid patients online despite several warnings. They have not maintained a separate registration for 80% of beds meant for Covid patients,” said Kulkarni. The civic body had also served a show-cause notice to the hospital on July 7, asking for a reply by July 17. However, no explanation was provided by the hospital. Ganesh Pawar, owner of A and G Hospital, said, “We are trying to understand the situation, especially when we are working under a lot of pressure, dealing with Covid patients on a daily basis. Whatever explanation we had given to the civic body was through letters. We will also try to talk to them personally.” He, however, refused to comment on overcharging patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kalyan-hospital-loses-covid-status-registration-suspended-for-overcharging-patients/story-BlEsfzq9FkxRl8BbvFdLwK.html
28-07-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab-origin politician Pritam Singh is Singapore’s first leader of opposition||Indian-origin politician Pritam Singh was on Tuesday designated as the LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION in Singapore, the first such appointment in the history of the city-state.The 43-year old Singh’s Workers’ Party won 10 parliamentary seats out of the 93 contested in the July 10 general elections held, making it the biggest opposition presence in Singapore’s Parliament.Singh is the secretary-general of Workers’ Party. Singapore’s legislatures have never had formally designated leaders of the opposition, and such a position is not provided for in the Constitution or the standing orders of parliament,” the parliamentary offices said in its statement on Tuesday.“Singapore’s legislatures have never had formal leaders of the opposition, not even in the 1950s and early 1960s when there were substantial numbers of opposition legislative assemblymen,” the Channel News Asia quoted the statement as saying.Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s ruling People’s Action Party won 83 seats in the general elections and his government was sworn in on Monday.Singh will take on more duties and be accorded additional privileges in his role as the leader of the opposition, authorities said on Tuesday in a statement, laying out the details of the new post.“Similar to other Westminster parliamentary systems, Singh will lead the opposition in presenting alternative views in parliamentary debates on policies, bills and motions,” said the office of the speaker of parliament and office of the leader of the House in a joint statement.He will also lead and organise the scrutiny of the government’s positions and actions in Parliament, and be consulted on the appointment of opposition members to Select Committees, such as the Public Accounts Committee.Singh, who is also a lawyer, will receive an annual package of 385,000 Singapore dollars (over Rs 2 crore) as allowances for his new role.Prime Minister Lee said on July 11 that Singh will be designated the leader of the opposition.After his swearing-in on Monday, Lee said that the election results have shown a strong desire among Singaporeans for a greater diversity of views in politics and that the trend is here to stay.“We have to give expression to it and evolve our political system to accommodate it while maintaining our cohesion and sense of national purpose,” said Lee.“As with any new political appointment, the role of the LO (Leader of the Opposition) will evolve as our political system develops,” the statement from Parliament said.“We look forward to working with the LO to create a robust but stable political system serving the interests of Singapore and Singaporeans,” it said.The statement added that these duties and privileges have been conveyed to Singh, and the Leader of the House will make a statement in Parliament to formally set out these terms.Singapore’s 14th Parliament will have its first sitting on August 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-origin-politician-pritam-singh-is-singapore-s-first-leader-of-opposition/story-Xo1zUkrOFeiwaXupm5a1PL.html
28-07-2020||Gurugram||PM2.5 exposure reducing lifespan in Gurugram by 8.8 years, finds study||Exposure to PM2.5 — the most prominent pollutant in the city air — is potentially reducing the lifespan of the average citizen in Gurugram by 8.8 years, showed a recently updated study by the University of Chicago’s Energy Policy Institute. However, the interactive report (known as the Air Quality Life Index or AQLI) also showed a reduction in the annual concentration of PM2.5 in Gurugram between 2016 and 2018, leading to a relatively favourable outcome for life expectancy.The AQLI was first published in 2018, using available data till two years prior, i.e. til 2016. Hindustan Times had reported, on November 25, 2018, that the average reduction in life expectancy in Gurugram (due to exposure to PM2.5) was about 8.7 years. However, updated figures released on Tuesday, showed that the reduction in average lifespan at the time of the first publication of the report was, actually 11.6 and not 8.7 years. This when compared to the present estimate of 8.8 years, indicates an improvement in the life expectancy between 2016 and 2018. The AQLI also found a 23% reduction in the annual average concentration of PM2.5 in Gurugram, from 124.7ug/m3 in 2016, to 99.4ug/m3 in 2018. Across Haryana, this figure reduced from 113ug/m3 in 2016 to 91.4ug/m3 in 2018, as per the AQLI. Nationally, too, India recorded a 10.7% reduction in the average annual concentration of PM2.5 pollutants.As per the updated numbers, the national average reduction in lifespan due to PM2.5, according to the AQLI is 5.2 years for every Indian, while across Haryana the reduction in life expectancy is eight years.“The AQLI converts particulate air pollution into perhaps the most important metric that exists: its impact on life expectancy,” read a press release issued along with the report. Experts said the report is an advancement from a standard Air Quality Index, which analyses air toxicity, but does not quantify its impact on human health.In the case of Gurugram, an average lifespan reduction of 5.8 years was first calculated as per India’s National Ambient Air Quality Standards, in which the annual average safe level of PM2.5 is 60ug/m3. This number, 5.8 years, also indicates the potential gain in life expectancy if PM2.5 is brought to under 60ug/m3. In other words, Gurugram residents would add 5.8 years to their lives if the national average safe level of PM2.5 is maintained.However, according to international standards prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO), life expectancy in Gurugram district has more accurately reduced by 8.8 years, the AQLI suggests. Therefore, if PM2.5 was brought to a level under 10ug/m3 (the international safe limit), then citizens could potentially add 8.8 years to their lives.Dr Piyush Goel, a city-based pulmonologist, explained that PM2.5 particles are minute enough to enter the alveoli in human lungs, where the exchange of respiratory gases takes place. “When this alien material, which comes from vehicles, construction and many other sources, enters the alveoli, the body begins to secrete mediating enzymes which cause destruction of lung tissue,” he said. These particles can even be tiny enough to pass through the alveoli and enter the blood stream, from where they get deposited in other organs, making them degenerate prematurely.“On the whole, inhalation of PM2.5 leads to a gradual degeneration of various parts of the body, which results in accelerated aging. This is why we’re seeing younger people having chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), heart attacks and similar other ailments,” Dr Goel said, cautioning that citizens should take care and avoid going outdoors when PM2.5 level is high, or equip themselves with appropriate protective gear, such as masks, when doing so.Niranjan Raje, a city-based air quality expert and former member of the Supreme Court-appointed Environmental Pollution (Prevention & Control), said, “I cannot confirm the efficacy of the findings, as I am unaware of the methodology or the assumptions made in correlating PM2.5 data with life expectancy. However, India has taken several steps towards reducing particulate matter pollution in the past two years, by launching the National Clean Air Programme and enforcing Bharat Stage-6 emission norms for vehicles. If there has been an improvement, that’s a good sign. But a reduction of 8.8 years life span per person, on average, is akin to a public health crisis and means that there is a lot more work to be done.”“Though the threat of coronavirus is grave and deserves every bit of the attention it is receiving — perhaps more in some places — embracing the seriousness of air pollution with a similar vigor would allow billions of people around the world to lead longer and healthier lives (sic),” Michael Greenstone, one of the authors of the report, from the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago said in a statement.“The reality is, no shot in the arm will alleviate air pollution. For a country like India, the solution lies in robust public policy. The AQLI tells citizens and policymakers how particulate pollution is affecting them and their communities, and can be used to measure the benefits of policies to reduce pollution,” Greenstone said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/pm2-5-exposure-reducing-lifespan-in-gurugram-by-8-8-years-finds-study/story-rWFA1zinCvpORUOPyr6DhK.html
28-07-2020||City||Gurugram: Four Iraqi nationals arrested for smuggling Covid-19 and cancer medicines||Gurugram Haryana drug control authorities, along with local police, have busted an international drug racket and arrested four Iraqi nationals for allegedly smuggling Covid-19 and cancer treatment medicines to Iraq. The suspects were nabbed on Monday night from two different locations in Gurugram and medicines worth ₹45 lakh and more than ₹75 lakh in cash were recovered from them, the police said.Forty eight vials of remdesivir, 55 strips of Fabiflu (favipiravir) and 18 packs of Lopikast -- the three medicines used in the treatment of Covid-19 patients -- were among a huge cache of medicines seized during two separate raids in sectors 47 and 57 lasting over eight hours, the police said. Apart from drug control department authorities and local police, officials of CM flying squad and crime branch were part of the raiding team. The total value of seized medicines is estimated to be over ₹45 lakh in India, which is worth several crores of rupees in the black market, said police officials. The officials said that the suspects, who have been staying in the city for several years allegedly on expired visas, used to hoard the medicines using local contacts and then smuggle them to Iraq where one 100mg vial of remdesivir, which costs ₹5,400 in India, is sold at an exorbitant price of over ₹1 lakh. The suspects enlisted medical tourism patients or students who were visiting India, often paying for their air fare, and used them as a conduit to smuggle medicines to Iraq. “Prima facie, it appears that they used to source medicines from two local contacts and then send the consignment to Iraq through patients, who came to the city for treatment. Their aide would collect the medicines and drugs at the airport in Iraq. The recovered batch of medicines was scheduled to make its way to Iraq on a recent flight, which was grounded, and hence such a large inventory was found from their possession,” said Chander Mohan, deputy commissioner of police (east). “We are also tracing the two local suppliers, and trying to ascertain how they were able to source drugs used to treat Covid-19 since they are in short supply,” Mohan said. The police said that they were probing if the suspects had a nexus with medicine distributors, health care professionals, chemists and hospitals. Amandeep Chauhan, drugs control officer, Gurugram, said, “The suspects said that Fabiflu, which costs ₹2,500 per strip in India, is sold in Iraq at ₹7,500 per strip. Lopikast, whose one bottle containing 30 tablets costs around ₹3,000 in India, is sold at ₹15,000 per bottle there.” Remdesivir is an experimental drug administered to Covid-19 patients in emergency situations, as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines. It is an injectable drug only given to Covid-19 patients who are moderate to severely ill, especially those who are fresh admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The drug is in short supply compared to its high demand across the country, the officials said. Remdesivir is manufactured by USA-based Gilead Sciences. In India, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) granted the permission to manufacture and market the drugs to Hetro, Cipla and Mylan. The officials said that in Gurugram, currently 60 vials manufactured by Cipla and 20 by Hetro are available in five multispecialty hospitals where patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus are undergoing treatment. On July 6, the enforcement division of CDSCO had directed all state drug controllers to ensure that remdesivir is not sold illegally after they received complaints regarding black marketing and over pricing of the drug. With the possibility of hoarding and black marketing of the drug, the district drug control department was on high vigil. The other two antiviral medicines, Fabiflu and Lopikast that were seized, are oral medicines easily available at pharmacies. Fabiflu is a 200mg tablet used to treat mild to moderate coronavirus cases. RAIDS AND ARRESTS Acting on a tip-off, the first raid was conducted at a condominium in Sector 57, where two Iraqi nationals -- identified as Akram Faiz (21) from Baghdad and Aws Raad Nealmah Al Hendi (31), a BCA graduate -- were arrested. A large amount of medicines worth ₹30 lakh and ₹35.5 lakh in cash were seized from the house. The police said that Faiz and Al Hendi had come from Iraq to Pune on a student visa in 2013 and arrived in Gurugram in 2016, following which they started hoarding and smuggling medicines to Iraq. After their visas expired, they acquired ‘refugee’ status, they said. In the second raid at a house in Sector 47, two Iraqi nationals from Baghdad, Mohanad (26) and Othmana (27), were arrested. They told the police that they had come to India in 2017 for study and later got into black marketing of medicines. Both are currently enrolled in a pharmacy course in Bengaluru, said the police. The police have also seized an SUV in the second raid in which some Covid-19 medicines and ₹39.05 lakh in cash were recovered. A police official, who was part of the raid in Sector 57, requesting anonymity, said, “The suspects worked as translators earlier and took to smuggling medicines for money. They had a database of foreign nationals coming to Gurugram for medical tourism. One of the suspects, well versed in Hindi, said that they used to source medicines from two contacts. Some of the medicines were smuggled through flights, hidden in chess boards. Two of the suspects had studied pharmacy, so they had contacts in the supply chain and had knowledge of the medicine sector. ”Two separate FIRs were registered on Tuesday at Sector 56 police station and Sadar police station. None of the suspects had valid licences to stock the medicines or relevant record for their scientific or medical use or sale/purchase record of the recovered medicines, the police said. A woman from Uzbekistan was also detained from the Sector 47 house. According to the police, during questioning, the woman said that she had come to Gurugram in January this year but could not return due to the lockdown and subsequent closure of flights. The police said her role is being probed, and they have written to the embassy concerned to verify her documents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-four-iraqi-nationals-arrested-for-smuggling-covid-19-and-cancer-medicines/story-xlVb4rppsXBnWGSSzhtxKO.html
28-07-2020||Gurugram||Three buildings partially demolished in a disputed area around IAF ammunition depot in Sector 14||Three large buildings falling within the 900-metre disputed area around the Indian Air Force (IAF) ammunition depot in Sector 14 were partially demolished by a joint team of the department of town and country planning (DTCP) and the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Tuesday. The demolition drive was met with stiff resistance from the local residents and the owners of these buildings. However, the police personnel present at the spot managed to push back the protesting demonstrators and carry on with the drive. Officials of the civic agencies said that these buildings had come up illegally in the disputed area, where according to a Supreme Court directive issued in 2012 all new constructions that come up in that area will be deemed illegal. The demolition was carried out in three areas, namely Ashok Vihar, Dharm Colony and Noble Enclave, by the joint team led by district town planner RS Bhath and MCG joint commissioner Gaurav Antil. They were assisted by a police team of around 500 personnel. The demolition team allegedly witnessed a strong resistance in Ashok Vihar Phase-3, where residents led by local Congress leader Gaje Singh Kablana — whose wife happens to be the deputy mayor of MCG — opposed the demolition, alleging that it was politically motivated and that the drive specifically targeted him. It took the joint team of officials around two hours to convince the protesters that the building under question was illegally built. Protesting against the demolition, Kablana said that no notice had been served by the departments concerned and around 150 persons are living in the building in Ashok Vihar Phase-3. “There are over a lakh of such structures in 900-metre area but only one building has been targeted as it belongs to my family. We will take up this matter in the court and fight the battle legally,” he said. RS Bhath, district town planner said that partial demolition has been carried and the owner of the building in Ashok Vihar Phase-3 has been given time to remove household items as people were found to be living there. “All under-construction buildings in the area will face demolition as it is illegal to construct a residential building within the 900-metre area of the ammunition depot,” he added. Reacting to Kablana’s allegations, Gaurav Antil, joint commissioner, MCG, said, the due process of law has been followed in carrying out the demolition drive. “Questions are often raised during such drives by violators to purchase time. However, all norms have been followed and action has been taken as per the law,” he said. The enforcement team later demolished two similar multi-storey buildings in Dharm Colony and Noble Enclave, both of which fell within the 900-metre disputed area. Police personnel from different police stations, including Udyog Vihar, Palam Vihar, Sector 5, Bajghera, were deployed as a part of the drive. Jitender Gahlawat, ACP, Udyog Vihar, said that adequate police force was deployed to carry out the demolition drive. “There was some resistance shown by locals but we managed to keep the situation under control,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/three-buildings-partially-demolished-in-a-disputed-area-around-iaf-ammunition-depot-in-sector-14/story-3QzU6hHy7NX7J0w42hN8PJ.html
28-07-2020||Gurugram||Domestic help, her family arrested for robbing valuables worth ₹20 lakh||The Faridabad Police arrested three members of a family, including a woman, from Sector 80 on charges of robbery. According to the police, the woman had allegedly posed as a domestic help and laced her employers’ food with sedatives at their house in Sector 9 in Faridabad and robbed them of valuables and cash worth ₹20 lakh on July 14, said the police. The police said the gang was involved in several robberies in Delhi, Faridabad, Gurugram, Noida and Palwal and followed the same modus operandi. The police said the woman started working as a full-time household help of the family in May this year. The suspect had approached the family through another domestic help and planned to rob them in connivance with her husband and her son. Inderjeet Singh, a resident of Sector 9, approached police on July 15 and complained that their domestic help had robbed them of jewellery worth ₹18 lakh and ₹1.20 lakh in cash, following which a case was registered, said the police. The police said Singh is a businessman and lives with his wife, son and a daughter in a double-storey house. He was looking for a full-time domestic help and had called a number of people for reference. “We hired her in May and she worked well. Her responsibility was to cook and clean the house. On July 14, she served us dinner, after which we all fell unconscious,” said Singh. When the family got up the next morning, they found all the doors and the cupboard open. When Singh went on to check on his children in another room, he found them lying unconscious. He rushed them to a private hospital, where doctors conducted tests and informed him that their food was laced with sedatives. However, they were out of danger. Like Singh, his wife also got up on her own and required no medical assistance, the police said. Police commissioner OP Singh said that they formed investigation teams as soon as they received the complaint. We took the help of a cybercrime cell and put the suspect’s numbers on technical surveillance. “The woman had involved her son and husband in the incident. As soon as the family fell unconscious on the night of July 14, the suspect called them to Faridabad from Delhi. Together, they carried out the robbery,” he said. The police also roped in secret informers, who told them that the suspects had changed three locations within four days after robbing the family and would be visiting Pahladpur in Sector 80 on Monday. The police surrounded the area and arrested all three of them. “ We have recovered all the jewellery and ₹50,000 from their possession. The remaining money is yet to be recovered,” said Singh. The suspects were identified as Anjali Kumar, Vijay Kumar and Rajesh Kumar of Odisha, who lived in a rented accommodation Sangam Vihar in Delhi. The police said they would start an awareness drive to get verification of tenants and servants done to avoid any untoward incidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/domestic-help-her-family-arrested-for-robbing-valuables-worth-20-lakh/story-3WO0a8lKeAu9aDW2Go29wJ.html
28-07-2020||Gurugram||Summer vacation ends, teachers back in school even as Covid crisis looms||Government school teachers and administrative staff resumed work in schools across the district on Monday, after almost a month of summer vacation. The state government had declared summer vacations for schools from July 1 till July 26. With Covid-19 cases emerging in some schools last month, many teachers had applied for leave while the teachers’ union had requested that teachers are allowed to work from home. After they reopened on Monday, attendance in schools has improved with most teachers reporting back to work and carrying out admission formalities. Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, Urban Estate, said that most teachers were back to school and carrying out the admission formalities that need to be completed before the end of the month. “Barring a handful of teachers, most are back. Teachers are now more mentally prepared about carrying out work as before. We are trying to ensure that each teacher has their own separate classroom to work from in the school,” said Sharma. Asha Miglani, principal of Government Model Sanskriti Senior Secondary School, sector 43, said that teachers were back at work and busy with the admission process and maintenance of monthly records. “Our hands are full and with so much work that we cannot afford to miss school anymore. Teachers are bound to report to school and comply with government rules. There has been an uptick in admission applications since the declaration of board results and teachers are busy processing that,” said Miglani. She added that the school was being sanitised on a daily basis as a preventive measure. “Besides regular sanitisation, we are taking all efforts to ensure that physical distancing is maintained. These measures have helped to quell concerns which teachers might have had. We are seeing full attendance since the school reopened after vacations,” said Miglani. Manju Bala Bhardwaj, an English teacher at a government school, said that teachers were adopting precautions and reporting to work, as per the directive issued by the department. “The department has asked all teachers to be back at work and complete various tasks ranging from maintenance of records to carrying out admission formalities. We will be taking classes along with doing official paperwork,” said Bhardwaj. Geeta Arya, principal, Government Boys’ Senior Secondary School, said that while teachers with underlying health conditions and chronic illnesses had been given a reprieve from visiting schools in person before the vacations, there was no clarity if the relaxations would continue now. “Right now, we are not sure about the guidelines in place and if the relaxations continue to be in effect. While we await a written directive, some teachers continue to be on leave either due to health concerns or because they live in containment zones. Most others are back to work,” said Arya. District education officer Indu Boken, however, said that as per guidelines shared by the Central government, pregnant women, people with disabilities and those with comorbid conditions were exempt from coming to work. “The guidelines shared by the MHRD earlier have not been withdrawn. We will continue to abide by the guidelines unless there is another new development. The message will be communicated to those teachers, who are not aware,” said Boken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/summer-vacation-ends-teachers-back-in-school-even-as-covid-crisis-looms/story-LAAvt172TUpn1nKqy08VUP.html
28-07-2020||Delhi||HC pulls up DU for lack of preparation regarding exams for differently abled students||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday pulled up the Delhi University for its lack of preparation and facilities, including the arrangement of scribes and CSE Centres, for differently abled students to facilitate them to appear in the Open Book Examinations (OBE) for final-year undergraduate courses.“This is how you are concerned about the career of differently abled students who have to appear for final-year exams. We are aware of the challenge to UGC guidelines that is before the Supreme Court. But we will surely ask questions about your preparation for the exams,” a bench comprising justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad said.“I am sure DU is cognisant of the fact that the career of students is at stake, how can you be so slow,” Justice Kohli asked the university.The court sought to know how many students in the Persons with Disabilities (PwD) category have applied to take exams through Common Service (CSE) Centers, which have been set up to provide services to students who do not have the infrastructure to attend OBE.The counsel appearing for the University said he would require time to get the details.The court was hearing a plea by a law student Prateek Sharma and the National Federation of Blind through a senior advocate SK Rungta seeking to set up effective mechanisms for visually impaired and specially abled students so that educational instructions can be imparted to them properly via the online mode of teaching during the Covid-19 pandemic.Appearing for one of the petitioners, senior advocate Rungta told the court that about 200 students could not appear for the mock test because of lack of assisting devices, reading material and scribes. He said when colleges were informed about the need for writing scribes, one of the principals said they could not provide them without knowing the health status of the student during the pandemic.The high court sought to know whether the claim of petitioners was true while noting that the Ministry of Human Resource Development and the Ministry of Electronics and Technology were earlier directed to file affidavits about the CSE centres and their preparation, including the availability of scribes.“However, the affidavit filed by the Ministry of Electronics and Technology is silent on the number of non-functional CSE centres”, the bench said, adding that the issue of absence of infrastructure at the centres is yet to be addressed. It said despite directions, DU has not filed its affidavit in the matter and sought time to do so.“It is important for us to know that if the students who have asked for scribes will be able to interact with them two days before the exams,” the bench said while noting the submission of senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared for Sharma, that as per the varsity’s guidelines, scribes will be given to the students before the exams to check for suitability.The high court asked the representative of CSE Academy, which has an agreement with DU to help the varsity in conducting the OBE, to be present before it on July 30, to know how many CSE centres across the country are situated in metropolitan and rural areas.It also sought to know that out of 2,75 lakh students who have applied for OBE, how many have asked for the services of CSE centres and how many reside in remote places.DU’s professor Anil Aneja, who handles the issues of PwD students at DU, said that students had to buy assistant devices on their own but they have not received any request for reimbursements.The matter will be now heard on July 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-pulls-up-du-for-lack-of-preparation-regarding-exams-for-differently-abled-students/story-cF8crrC7PYchSsd1NhiP7O.html
28-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram civic body goes on war mode to reserve beds for Covid patients||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has set itself a grand aim to tide through the current Covid pandemic — to keep at least 6,000 beds ready for accommodating virus-infected patients.Working towards this goal, the MCG is assisting resident welfare associations (RWAs) in setting up isolation centres within their areas, building centres of its own, and reaching out to owners of hotels, guest houses, PGs, banquet halls, educational institutions, and religious and charitable institutions to persuade them to lend their buildings for setting-up temporary isolation centres.Surender Singh, additional commissioner, MCG said that the civic body has made arrangements to ensure the city has “sufficient” number of beds ready, in the eventuality, that there is a sudden spike in cases.“Besides having around 1,500 beds located in isolation centres of residential areas, by August 1, we will have at least 4,700 beds on standby. Around 3,500 of these have been arranged in hotels, while 1,200 beds have been arranged in government guest houses and buildings. Currently, the occupancy of beds in hospitals is very low and we believe that the existing arrangement is more than sufficient. However, apart from these 6,000 beds, we have also made preparations in advance and collected requisite information for quickly converting banquet halls, PGs, guest houses, hostels, and educational institutions into isolation centres if beds in hotels, government guest houses and buildings start running low,” said the additional commissioner.He further said that the MCG presently does not have any “fixed-target” with regard to the total number of beds needed for Covid-19 patients and is making arrangements according to the existing needs.At present, across 45 public and private hospitals in the city, the district administration has reserved 1,486 hospitals for Covid-19 patients. These include 192 beds in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), 92 beds with ventilator support system, while the remaining are general isolation ward beds.Till July 23, only 335 — or around 22% — of the total 1,486 Covid-19 beds were occupied.Isolation centres with RWAs As cases of coronavirus in Gurugram started to surge in early June, MCG officials reached out to RWAs for setting up isolation centres in their own vicinity.Between May 31 and June 11, the total number of virus cases in the district saw an increase by at least four times, from 774 to 2,737 cases. The total number of fatalities during the same period saw a six-fold increase from three to 19.In a nutshell, an isolation centre in a residential area can be as basic as a vacant apartment where each bedroom has two beds, with an attached bathroom, while the hall has basic medical equipment such as oxygen cylinders, oxymetres, thermometer, BP machine, IV drip, and a variety of vitamin, fever, and cough tablets.The same equipment and facility could also be set up in the local community centre, clubhouse, vacant in-house playschool, or the RWA’s empty office space which will have spaces to accommodate more beds.MCG officials said that so far at least 25 RWAs have set up such facilities and cumulatively have around 1,500 beds ready.Civic body officials claimed that their purpose was not only to reduce the load on hospitals, but to also create the “first layer of treatment” or “segregation” for Covid-19 patients.The official SOP issued for RWAs, titled the “Guiding document for creating local isolation centres (Covid Care Centres)” states that the purpose of creating such an infrastructure is to separate asymptomatic and mild Covid-19 patients from the community, monitoring them to see if they develop more serious symptoms of Covid-19, and accordingly provide them with preventive care.“As per the guidelines listed in the SOP, we have set up an isolation centre in our society last month, which has provisions of accommodating six residents at any given time. We have kept one more apartment empty to quickly accommodate six more residents if a need arises. Even though we have had 10 cases in our society so far, we haven’t faced an instance yet when a resident needed to avail the facility. Regardless, the option of having one, has assured residents to some extent,” said Puneet Goyal, president, Tulip Violet RWA.The SOP clearly stated that the facility is not for “serious/critical” Covid cases, but should have provisions for giving emergency oxygen therapy to a patient.“The rationale behind creating isolation centres within residential areas was to ensure that mild and asymptomatic cases do not need to go to hospitals and occupy beds. Instead, if they didn’t have adequate space to self isolate within their homes, they have the option of using the isolation centres within their residential area. The biggest advantage of this was that the health centres could focus on severe cases and give such patients adequate care,while the mild cases could self isolate and make-do with basic treatment, if needed,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.In the SOP, MCG has prepared guidelines on the requisite medical equipment, health management, do’s and dont’s for attendants, protocol for transfer to health centres and waste and disinfection management for RWAs to follow.Community Centres Although at a very nascent stage, the MCG is also looking to create another “layer of segregation” for patients by creating isolation centres in sector community centres, where Covid patients who need oxygen support but not ventilators can be kept for treatment.Currently, the MCG is in the process of setting up its first-such infrastructure at a community centre in sector 27 and has already arranged 50 beds for the facility through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds. At the facility, officials said that over 100 patients can be treated by doctors from the district health department or any volunteer doctors from private hospitals that are IMA recognised.“Between asymptomatic, mild, and severe cases of coronavirus, we wanted to create an extra layer of segregation to help further reduce the load on hospitals. At a few community centres, we are aiming to create facilities that can give treatment to those Covid-19 patients that only need oxygen support. We are aiming to start this in sector 27 on a pilot basis and depending on its success replicate the same in other areas,” said a senior MCG official in its health branch.Back-up isolation centres As a last resort, the MCG is also making preparations for the worst-case scenario where the existing isolation centres in RWAs, community centres, and hospital beds, all run out of space.The civic body has identified at least 1,360 properties, which include banquet halls, clubs, hotels, guest houses, paying guest accommodations, hostels and religious institutions as potential sites for establishing such backup isolation centres, if need be.Using data from its property tax records and with the help of locals RWAs, the MCG has identified 64 banquet halls, 57 clubs, 174 hotels, 321 hostels, PGs, guest houses, and 744 religious and charitable institutions in the city as potential isolation centres.Separately, around 5,000 institutional properties such as schools, universities, and government buildings are also being monitored by the civic corporation as potential sites.Out of the 1,300 such buildings, with the help of RWAs, the MCG is currently in the process of further sub-categorising the properties that meet its demand.“Only those properties that aren’t located in congested, narrow lanes, and are situated in secluded spots and have enough space to accommodate more than 30 beds are being considered. We are in the process of further identifying such properties with the assistance of locals RWAs. Once identified, either the RWA or the MCG will approach owners of such establishments for further assessment,” said the MCG additional commissioner.He further said that owners of such establishments — who show interest in leasing their properties for setting-up isolation centres — will be asked to give details such as the total number of beds that can be accommodated in their building, types of entry and exit, the type and number of toilets, water connection, electricity connection, for creating a database.Singh further said that the first stage of segregation has already been done by the MCG and found that 93 of the 174 identified hotels met all the required norms“Our first stage of isolation centres would be in hotels, and then banquets halls. When both these facilities start running out of space, then we will approach owners of other buildings for leasing their infrastructure. We are simply preparing for the worst-case scenarios and are in the process of creating a database which can be used for setting-up isolation centres even at short notice in the future,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-civic-body-goes-on-war-mode-to-reserve-beds-for-covid-patients/story-F5CRbEg20fzvA5m0mShLcM.html

The case was registered against Anokh Singh, who has been arrested, and Jagir Singh after they filed a complaint with director generals of police (DGPs) of Punjab and Chandigarh on July 9 against dismissed Punjab Police cop Gurmeet Singh “Pinki”, alleging that they were lured by him to give statement against former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini in the 32-year-old disappearance case of CITCO employee Balwant Singh Multani.A local court has sent Anokh to two-day police remand. The cops were booked under Section 195-A (fabricating evidence) on the complaint of Kharar (sadar) station house officer Sukhvir Singh. In their complaint on July 9, the two ex-cops cited audio recordings to prove that they were lured by Pinki at the behest of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s political adviser Bharat Inder Singh Chahal to give statement against Saini. Anokh and Jagir claimed that they were invited by Pinki to his farmhouse near Landran on June 3 and 6 where he offered to appoint their children as sub-inspectors in Punjab Police with the help of Chahal. The complainant in this case, Gurmeet Singh Pinki, told the police that both the retired cops were threatening him to change his testimony in the Multani disappearance case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/multani-disappearance-case-ex-chandigarh-cop-arrested-sent-to-2-day-police-remand/story-5xBJnE5fGbCnkiLNoE3xOP.html
28-07-2020||City||Journalist murder: ₹25,000 reward announced on arrest of absconding suspect||Ghaziabad police have obtained a non-bailable warrant (NBW) against an absconding suspect, who was allegedly involved in the murder of journalist Vikram Joshi (35) on July 20.The police have also announced a reward of Rs 25,000 for any information that can lead to the arrest of the Akash Bihari, who is on the run.. The police said that Bihari was part of the group of assailants, who were present at the scene of crime when Joshi was fatally shot at on the fateful night.Joshi , a journalist with a local Hindi newspaper,had been attacked by the assailants near Mata Colony in Ghaziabad’s Vijay Nagar late in the night on July 20, when was going back home on his two-wheeler with his two minor daughters riding pillion. He succumbed to his critical gunshot injuries a day later , with police having arrested nine people till then in connection with his murder. Preliminary investigations had revealed that suspects had a fight with Joshi’s family on July 16. Later, though Joshi’s family members had wanted to file a complaint against the men for allegedly harassing his niece, the police purportedly did not register the first information report (FIR). “Akash Bihari, the 10th suspect in the murder case, is absconding. We have obtained a non-bailable warrant against him and a reward of Rs 25,000 has also been announced. Bihari is on the run since the shooting incident and several teams are trying to trace him. He was present with others at the scene of crime on the night of July 20,” said Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (SP), Ghaziabad city. “An inquiry is underway in the case on the allegations of laxity shown by police,” he added. One of the accused, Shahnoor alias Chotu, had allegedly shot at Joshi from point-blank range. The bullet had gone through Joshi’s head that ultimately led to his death around 4am on July 21. The police filed an FIR for harassment on the day Joshi had succumbed to his injuries and named two persons from the group as accused , along with two others. The Pratap Vihar police post in-charge has been suspended for not registering a complaint that Joshi’s family had wanted to file on July 16. The station house officer (SHO) of Vijay Nagar police station was also shunted to police lines for his alleged lack of supervision in the case that led to Joshi’s murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/journalist-murder-25-000-reward-announced-on-arrest-of-absconding-suspect/story-PYQVcseWTwJFMAnmKJSU4N.html

Saplings of 30 such species were planted in Noida. According to the forest department, which led the drive, spalings of miswak and camphor were planted in the city, part from 28 other species, each with medicinal properties and rarely seen. Officials said at least 12 saplings each of over 240 species were planted within an hour across the districts of Gautam Budh Nagar, Meerut, Lucknow, Faizabad, Banda, Chitrakoot, Barabanki and Sitapur. “This is a first-of-its-kind plantation drive in the country and we planted all saplings within one hour to attempt a record. The idea is to promote the biodiversity of the state, which has the geography to sustain a large variety of species. The selection of each species -- be it flowering, ornamental or fruit bearing -- was done in keeping with the environment and geography of each district. Some of the species planted on Tuesday are now rare and we want to conserve and promote them,” Anupam Gupta, chief conservator of forest (CCF) and mission director of the plantation drive, said. He said a world record was also attempted by completing the plantation within an hour, between 10am and 11am, and the timing, the number of saplings and species have been sent to the Guinness Book of World Records for its consideration. In Noida, the plantation drive was led by the district forest department near Yamuna Expressway. “The drive was a success and we also received help from the Botanical Survey of India and the officials of Botanic Garden. Camphor and miswak trees were planted for the first time in the district under the initiative,” Pramod Kumar Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said. He said all the trees were distinct and none of the species planted shared a common mother species. The other rare species planted in Noida included aru, krishna siras, harar, and tun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/saplings-of-rare-species-planted-across-eight-up-districts-noida-gets-its-first-camphor-tree/story-5Ph9ebjjk9uoKlkSVKRhfO.html
28-07-2020||Noida||Kidnapped two-year-old boy rescued within four hours in Noida||A two-year-old boy was kidnapped from outside his house in Sarfabad village on Tuesday morning by unidentified men, the police said. The boy was rescued from a park within four hours of the kidnapping, and the police are on the lookout for the suspects.The incident was reported to the police around 12.30pm after the infant’ s father had received a call from the suspected kidnappers. In his complaint, the father alleged that the child was playing outside the house in the morning and was last seen around 9.30am. “Afterwards we could not find him anywhere. Around noon, I got a call from an unknown number who said that they had kidnapped my son and were going to kill him,” the father said in his complaint to the police. However, the caller did not ask for a ransom, he said. The family approached the Sector 49 police after getting the call.“The child was rescued from a park in Sector 71 within an hour of getting the complaint. The abductors had fled by the time the child was found. We have a few leads in the case and a search is on for them. They will be nabbed soon,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Sankalp Sharma.Based on the father’s complaint a case of kidnapping under section 364 of the Indian Penal Code was registered.Police officers said that so far the family has not mentioned any dispute or animosity which could be the reason behind the kidnapping. “As the family did receive a call, it seems to be a targeted abduction. We will know more soon,” said Sharma.The child’s father is a landlord and owns agricultural land. The police said they are probing all angles including monetary and property disputes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/kidnapped-two-year-old-boy-rescued-within-four-hours-in-noida/story-FpdyaugD8sJVsCm81Dr3XO.html
28-07-2020||Noida||Noida: Elderly woman found murdered in Sector 15 home||A 70-year-old woman was found murdered in her house in Sector 15 Tuesday, the police said. They added that it appears that the woman, who used to live alone, was strangulated to death.According to the police, the woman’s body was discovered by a family friend, and no signs of forced entry were found at the house.The deceased was identified as Santosh Kumari who lives in a three-storey house in Sector 15 with tenants occupying the ground and second floor. Her two sons live abroad, the police said.“Her younger son was trying to reach her over the phone. When she did not answer his calls, he asked a friend in Delhi to go and check on her. The friend, Kunal (single name), came to her house today (Tuesday) morning and found her dead,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Sankalp Sharma.Police officers said they found out about the incident around 9.30 am. Based on a complaint by the family friend, a case of murder has been registered at the Sector 20 police station and the body has been sent for an autopsy.The friend had found the door of her house open suggesting that she probably knew the murderer and had opened the door for them, the police said.“She was found in the washroom and, prima facie, it seems that she was strangled. However, we will know more about the cause and time of death once the autopsy report is out. A few neighbours said that they had seen the woman in the balcony on Monday around 7pm, however, Kunal told us that she hadn’t answered his calls around 6.45 pm. So we suspect that the incident may have happened around that time only,” the DCP said.The police said they are questioning all people who were in regular contact with the elderly woman.“It has also come to light that she had sold the house she was currently living in February this year. We are looking into that angle also. We have a few leads and are working on them,” said the DCP.The DCP further said that it does not seem to be a case of robbery as most valuables were found intact. “But we cannot be absolutely certain if anything is missing or not. There are no obvious signs of struggle. But the house has been ransacked suggesting that someone may have been looking for something. However, that could be staged to divert attention as well,” said Sharma.“It is a gated community but the security guards, tenants or neighbours have not provided us any concrete clues. We are looking at the CCTV camera footage from the area as well,” he said.A forensic team and the dog squad also visited the crime spot. Five teams are currently working on the case, the police said.44-year-old woman found dead, husband detainedIn another incident, the body of a 44-year-old woman was found by passersby in a field on Tuesday in Mangroli village.The police have detained her husband for questioning in connection with the alleged murder. “The woman was identified as Tara Devi. According to her family members, her husband and she had an argument on Monday night. We have detained him for now and are questioning him,” said Yogesh Malik, station house officer, Expressway police station.The woman had injury marks on her body and was sent for an autopsy to ascertain the cause of death. Police officers said that the husband was a compulsive alcoholic and have murdered her following a domestic dispute.Based on her family’s complaint, a case of murder has been registered, and a probe in the matter is underway.The police suspect that the woman might have been killed on late Monday night itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-elderly-woman-found-murdered-in-sector-15-home/story-ncW68qdIl650QHlDgWI28L.html
28-07-2020||Mumbai||Centre’s report on tigers boosts campaign against infra projects||A report released by the Centre on precise details of tiger presence across India has encouraged habitat connectivity and conservation along the Mollem-Netravali corridor in Goa.Highlights of the report give impetus to signature campaigns gaining momentum in Goa and India demanding cancellation of three infrastructure projects. They include the proposed widening of an existing National Highway (NH) 4A, a railway line double-tracking, and construction of power transmission lines through the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary and Mollem National Park. The projects would lead to the diversion of 185-hectare forest land and roughly 55,000 trees with 35,762 trees within protected areas.Among other campaigns, the ‘Save Mollem National Park, Goa’ citizens’ signature campaign gained momentum with 6,000 citizens opting against the projects. Coordinated by Bengaluru-based digital advocacy organisation, Jhatkaa.org, the campaign is addressed to the member secretary of the Supreme Court constituted Central Empowerment Committee (CEC) to overturn approvals issued to the projects by the Centre earlier this year.“Lessons in this pandemic show how crucial it is to make choices that are in harmony with nature,” said Meghna Amin, campaigner at Jhatkaa.org.The report released on Tuesday, conceived by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, identified a drop in tiger numbers in Goa from 5 in 2014 to 3 in 2018. It also identified the lack of source population in the region owing to fragmented corridor connectivity, development pressures and changes in habitat quality coinciding with mining activities around the forest ranges of Mollem, Kulem, Malpon in Goa.“The Western Ghats region extending from the Kali Tiger Reserve, Karnataka right up to Sahyadri Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra has a delicate ecosystem. Linear infrastructure projects proposed in these areas require a host of mitigation measures (appropriate wildlife passageway) to ensure the ecological impact is minimal. Only if there is a great national interest, should these projects be allowed,” said YV Jhala, author of the report and senior researcher WII.Santosh Kumar, chief wildlife warden, Goa said, “Whenever there is an infrastructure project of national importance, there will be some disturbance to wildlife habitat during the construction phase. All these three projects are from the Centre and Goa is going to be benefitted. The only thing we can do is minimise the impact and that is what we are doing.”The 240 sq. km expanse of the Bhagwan Mahavir wildlife sanctuary and Mollem National Park are together home to more than 721 plant species, 235 bird species, 70 mammal species along with a host of other biodiversity. “The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, clearly identifies that development in and around the sanctuary can only be done in the interest of wildlife and better management of habitat. However, arguments that it benefits tourism and economic development are attempts to modify the Act. Under such circumstances, the public is never consulted and we are faced with a fait-accompli situation,” said Claude Alvares of Goa Foundation that filed a petition before the Goa bench of the Bombay high court against the projects. The biodiversity is not getting disturbed the way it is being projected, said Johnson B Fernandes, director, department of environment and climate change, Goa, adding, “The Gadgil Committee Report itself has said there is no requirement of public consultation because Goa is a small state. These are requirements of the national level and national importance. Those opposing these projects were party to public consultations of the Gadgil Committee Report and did not raise any objections at the time.”The Goa State Board for Wildlife (SBWL) accorded clearance to the projects in December 2019. “The decision-making process for these projects was faulty. The agenda and copies of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) were provided to non-government members minutes before the meeting leaving no time for prior research or deliberation. Additionally, EIAs for a few projects were developed in a shoddy manner. There is a need for community assessment, which has not happened,” said Parag Rangnekar, representing Goa Bird Conservation Network as a member at the SBWL.Compensatory afforestation for projects in Karnataka instead of GoaThe Goa forest department said several mitigation measures had been proposed for all three projects including eight underpasses for the railway project, 3% of the total project cost for each project to be allocated for wildlife conservation, elevated construction of the majority of the national highway on viaducts, and minimum loss of forest cover for the transmission line since pillars would be placed.Surprisingly, compensatory afforestation for the project would be carried out across 800 ha of degraded forest land in north Karnataka rather than. “Unfortunately, there is a paucity of land and the Goa government finding it difficult to acquire any degraded forest areas. The corridors have tiger presence but no harm can come to them or their habitat due to these projects,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/centre-s-report-on-tigers-boosts-campaign-against-infra-projects/story-UvbQv7NtCzPg20jihAXSzN.html
28-07-2020||Mumbai||56% of Maha tigers from Chandrapur; region sees most conflicts with humans: Report||Home to over 175 of the 312 tigers, the forest patches of Chandrapur district accounts for 56% of estimated tiger numbers in Maharashtra, a report released by the Centre said on Tuesday. The report further said that this landscape faces a maximum of human-tiger conflict in India.Ahead of International Tiger Day on Wednesday, the Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar released the 650-page report, ‘Status of tigers, co-predators and prey in India 2018-19’, jointly conceived by National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun.Across Chandrapur district, apart from the 82 tigers in Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR), the study identified 23 in Central Chanda, 31 in Chandrapur forests, 39 in Brahmapuri, taking the tally to 175 tigers. Combined with wildlife sanctuaries of Umred, Karandla (11 tigers) and Tipeswar (5 tigers) and Bor (6), tiger population in Vidarbha block was estimated at 219 (ranging from 185 to 252), the report said. “It is in this landscape that conflicts with humans and tigers are maximum. Predation by tigers on livestock being common and attacks on humans being occasional. A swift, dispassionate, and professional removal of problem individual tigers, as per NTCA protocol is essential to permit long-term tiger occupancy and prevent community retaliation towards the population and the species as a whole,” read the report.Human population in the Vidarbha landscape is 1.45 crore. There have been 27 human deaths reported due to tiger attacks between January and July this year. So far, four tigers, involved in the conflict, have been captured by the forest department this year.“The Vidarbha area, especially Chandrapur, has got overpopulated, which is a worry and there is a need for controlling the tiger population,” said YV Jhala, lead author of the report and senior researcher, WII.Last month, the forest department submitted a proposal to the state suggesting the translocation of 50 tigers from Chandrapur to areas with low density and sterilise male tigers to curb population.“The Centre’s report reiterates our concerns. An exponential increase in human-tiger conflict is expected with more tiger captures if steps are not taken,” said Nitin Kakodkar, state chief wildlife warden.Jhala identified other methods of controlling overabundance of tigers. “Intervention by vaccination through immuno-contraception where an injection to a tigress leads to temporary sterilisation for 3-5 years. Being a reversible process, we do not lose an animal’s genetic contribution to the entire gene pool but manage to control reproduction. No policies have been formed on this yet neither is it being discussed,” he said.SP Yadav, member secretary, NTCA said, “With a satisfactory performance by the state, there is a need for active management. Focus is needed on ensuring tiger carrying capacity is equally distributed from Chandrapur to all other areas within the state to ensure a balance is achieved. However, there is no need for tiger relocation to other states or other measures such as sterilisation at the moment.”Overall tiger population in Maharashtra has increased from 103 in 2006 to 168 in 2010, 190 in 2014 and 312 as per the latest assessment (2018-19).The report highlighted that the carrying capacity of each tiger reserve (tigers numbers a reserve can sustain) based on tiger density (number of individuals per 100 sq. km) showed that TATR, Bor, Navegaon-Nagzira and Pench fell in the ‘brown’ category (satisfactory) while Melghat fell under ‘yellow’ (falling below carrying capacity). STR was the only reserve that fell under the ‘red’ category (extremely low carrying capacity where tiger density cannot be calculated).“There is a contrast in Maharashtra with some reserves performing very well while a few remain vulnerable. Isolated issues are concerned with poaching and developmental pressures around reserves but major concerns include overpopulation (for Chandrapur) and extremely low density (for Sahyadri),” said Jhala. Tiger numbers across sanctuariesTiger numbers increased across all major reserves. Maharashtra has six tiger reserves spread over five national parks and 14 wildlife sanctuaries across 7,194.58 sq. km. They include Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR), Bor, Melghat, Navegaon-Nagzira (NNTR), Pench and Sahyadri (STR). The report broke down numbers of reserves, transient population around reserves, and wildlife sanctuaries. With 106 tigers using TATR, 82 individuals were identified against 51 in 2014. Similarly, 82 tigers using Pench, 53 were resident big cats against 35 in 2014, and 49 using Melghat with 46 resident tigers against 25 in 2014. Six tigers were identified in Bor (five in 2014) while NNTR recorded six in 2018-19 against seven in 2014.Sahayadri Tiger Reserve (STR) a cause of concernWith only three big cats identified at STR based on tiger signs (scat, DNA) and one camera trap image, Jhala said low tiger density was due to fragmented corridor connectivity. “Corridor connectivity for this linear strip along the north Western Ghats has a delicate balance of the ecosystem. Any linear infrastructure coming in will be detrimental. If appropriate mitigation measures are in place, it will take another 10 years for regular tiger movement into STR,” he said. The recent declaration of Tillari Conservation Reserve south of STR will help ensure a safe passage for tigers along the Western Ghats to STR, said Kakodkar. State board of wildlife member, Kishor Rithe said, “Enhanced protection and investments in restoring prey and habitats is needed for STR.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/56-of-maha-tigers-from-chandrapur-region-sees-most-conflicts-with-humans-report/story-yqBMVZcrSrG56zbE6r6nKP.html

Based on her parents’ complaint, her husband and in-laws have been arrested on charges of murdering her for dowry and the case has been transferred to the Bulandshahr police as the crime had taken place there.The police said pictures of the victim were shared on social media in an effort to identify her and one of her relatives who saw the appeal came forward and also informed her parents in Aligarh district. The police said the woman, Warisha (single name), had got married to Amir Khan, a fish trader and resident of Islamnagar locality in Bulndshahr, on June 1. Her family has filed a police complaint in Bulandshahr accusing her in-laws of killing her for dowry. They told the police that her husband’s family was “harassing her for not bringing a washing machine and refrigerator”. Police said based on the parents’ complaint, Amir Khan, his father Muslim Khan and his mother Jameela have been arrested and booked under the IPC sections 304b (dowry death), 498a (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and also levied provisions of the Dowry Prohibition Act.Yogendra Singh, SHO of Kotwali police station in Bulandshahr, said her in-laws allegedly murdered the woman and dumped her body near New Hindon Vihar in Ghaziabad on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday. He added that Amir Khan and Muslim Khan hired a car and drove to Ghaziabad to dump the suitcase stuffed with the body. “After her body was found in Ghaziabad, we circulated her pictures over the social media and also informed the nearby districts. One of her relatives saw the pictures and informed her parents. They arrived in Ghaziabad and identified the body as that of Waisha’s. The autopsy was conducted in Ghaziabad but the rest of the legal action is being taken up by Bulandshahr police,” Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city), Ghaziabad, said.“The three suspects have been arrested. The cause of her death will be known only after the autopsy reports are received from Ghaziabad. The suspects told us that after the murder, they stuffed her body in a suitcase and hired a car to drive towards Ghaziabad on Sunday night and dump the body,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/woman-s-body-found-in-suitcase-identified-husband-in-laws-held-for-murdering-her-for-dowry/story-9Xu28bSR3aSUk6sRnly8oI.html

28-07-2020||Mumbai||IIT-B turns to alumni to pay salaries of contractual staff||With non-tuition fees waived off or reduced, the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), has turned yet again to its alumni to pay the contractual workers engaged on campus.The institute launched a donation drive last week to raise ₹50 lakh through faculty and alumni networks. Subhasis Chaudhuri, director, IIT-B, said, “This (donation drive) is mostly to help those workers who were working in hostels and other facilities on campus. Now that many hostels are closed and various student hostel related fees have been reduced, we have launched this initiative.”This was preceded by another donation drive from alumni for buying laptops and broadband for students ahead of the online semester. Around ₹7 crore was raised for the purpose.The donation drives are indicative of the financial implication of the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown on the institute. On June 25, the institute announced that the entire autumn semester will be conducted in an online mode. Subsequently, the administration slashed or waived off several non-tuition components of fees collected from students.While the gymkhana fees has been slashed ₹2,000 per semester to ₹500 per semester, medical fees, hostel rent and electrical and water charges have been waived off for students who are not on campus.According to professor Prasanna Mujumdar, deputy director of finance and external affairs, the cut in gymkhana fees results in a loss of around ₹1.4 crore and waiver in other components amount to around ₹6 crore. With the institute deferring any increase in fees to the next academic year, the difference in income and expenses can further swell.“IIT-B has deferred implementation of any increase in both tuition and non-tuition fees to academic year 21-22. Further, the income from fees will reduce due to the fee components which have been reduced/will not be charged,” added Mujumdar. In view of the pandemic, the institute is also allowing students to defer the payment of their fees till September. Meanwhile, the sanctioned and released funds from the central government agencies are lower than the initial allocation, said Mujumdar. The institute is wading through the crisis by following the cash management guidelines of the central government and keeping expenditure control in first and second quarters.“In view of the pandemic, lockdown and orders to keep educational institutes closed during the lockdown period, students are not permitted to stay on campus. Therefore, expenditure has also reduced somewhat. Overall, we are able to manage the balance between income and expenditure, and the institute’s finances are not largely affected by the pandemic,” he said.HT had earlier reported that the institute was facing a severe cash crunch and in November last year, Chaudhuri had asked faculty members to explore fundraising options.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iit-b-turns-to-alumni-to-pay-salaries-of-contractual-staff/story-wxBKdf67j9OdgsxP6WR77I.html
28-07-2020||Chandigarh||Committee to meet on August 4 on issue of rates of Chandigarh housing scheme||: A meeting of the six-member committee on the issue of rates of UT employees housing scheme has been scheduled for August 4. The development comes in the wake of the directions of the Punjab and Haryana high court. On a petition, the high court had directed the Union home secretary to convene a meeting with UT adviser and chairman of Chandigarh Housing Board to make efforts to resolve the issue and submit the report by next date of hearing, September 1. The high court had also directed that three representatives of the petitioners may be also be associated in the proceedings. The CHB had floated the special housing scheme for employees in 2008. Around 3,000 flats were to be constructed in Sectors 52, 53 and 56. Later, the scheme was shelved because the flats were too expensive. It was revived after the employees took up the matter with local MP Kirron Kher. But, the ministry of home affairs allowed the administration to transfer land to the CHB with the current collector rates. The employees then moved the high court alleging that the CHB was charging five times the initial price for land after the launch of the scheme for UT administration employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/committee-to-meet-on-august-4-on-issue-of-rates-of-chandigarh-housing-scheme/story-VZ0MZTHeMJczhlfgJMlduJ.html
28-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad family robbed of cash, jewellery worth ₹13 lakh at gunpoint||Several armed men broke into a house in Ghaziabad on Tuesday early morning and robbed the family of jewellery and cash worth ₹13 lakh at gunpoint. The police have registered a case of dacoity (robbery committed by five or more persons) and said the family members have raised suspicions about one of their relatives. The family told police that at least six armed men broke into their house in Chiranjeev Vihar’s Sector 9 around 1.30am Tuesday and fled around 4am with the valuables after threatening the occupants of the house with dire consequences if they tried to raise the alarm. The Chiranjeev Vihar area is close to Harsaon police lines. The family later alleged that their calls to the police went unanswered. “The men left our house around 4am Tuesday. The police did not take our calls and we had to go to the local police post to alert them about the robbery. As per our initial assessment, the robbers took away jewellery worth ₹11 lakh besides about ₹2 lakh in cash. They also took away money which my father had withdrawn on Monday,” said Kanchan Sharma, the house owner. “They broke into the house by cutting through the window grilles. They were six in number and carrying weapons and knives. There are a total of 11 members, including children, living together in our family home. After they entered the house, they held the children at gunpoint. They tied us up and gaged us before ransacking the house,” Sharma said. “They locked all of us in the bathroom. The men seemed to be in the age group of 35-40 years and were well built. They did not speak in the local dialect and seemed to be from eastern UP. After they were done looting, they got us out of the bathroom and locked us in one of the rooms. They left soon after,” she added. Kalanidhi Nathani, senior superintendent of police (SSP), said the robbers fled with jewellery and cash. He declined to comment on whether there was a lack of adequate police patrolling in the area. “We have roped in several teams and are also scanning the CCTV footage. The CCTV cameras at the house were not functional. The family informed us that six men broke into their house and fled with jewellery and cash. We are probing the case and are also trying to ascertain if any person known to the family was involved,” Naithani told reporters later in the day. The police on the basis of complaint given by Sharma’s father, Bhopal Sharma, registered an FIR under IPC sections 395 (dacoity) and 397 (robbery with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt) at the Kavi Nagat police station. In his complaint, Bhopal Sharma has raised suspicions about one of his relatives who has a property dispute with him. “While the robbers were in the house, they offered water to my son-in-law, telling him that he was their ‘mehman’ (term generally used for sons-in-law in western UP) and apologised for the incident,” the FIR stated. “The family has raised suspicions about one of their relatives. So, we are investigating his role and are also working on other angles to crack the case,” Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city), said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-family-robbed-of-cash-jewellery-worth-13-lakh-at-gunpoint/story-xdKdSr2t4nA2T0qbCRu7pL.html
28-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad to procure more high-flow oxygen system to aid patient recoveries||The Ghaziabad health department, in order to keep the fatality rate low, has planned to purchase more high-flow nasal cannula — an oxygen supply system capable of delivering up to 100% humidified and heated oxygen at a flow rate of up to 60 liters per minute.Officials said that during the last one month, 20 patients were administered oxygen with high-flow nasal cannulas and 19 of them recovered. The Ghaziabad district has so far witnessed 64 deaths, of which 51 were added in the month of June. Only four deaths had been reported between March to May. The present fatality rate of the district stands at 1.35% as on July 28 ,out of total 4,708 Covid-19 cases. The officials said that their experience with high-flow nasal cannulas has shown positive results while dealing with patients requiring critical care in L3 hospital. The L1 hospitals deal with asymptomatic patients while the L2 hospitals treat Covid-19 patients having mild or moderate symptoms. The L3 hospitals on the other hand are meant for patients having severe complications and require critical care.“At present we have only three high-flow nasal cannulas available at our L3 hospital, while the L2 has none. The three high-flow nasal cannula units were provided to the L3 hospital during the last week of June. In one month time, we treated 20 patients with it and there was only one fatality. All the remaining 19 patients recovered,” said an officer from the health department “So, we have now planned to buy 20 units of high-flow nasal cannulas, eight each of which will be given to our L2 category hospital and to ESIC hospital, which is getting converted from L1 to L2 category. The remaining four will go to our L3 hospital,” the officer, said, adding that high value drugs like Remdesivir will also be procured.Medical experts said that high-flow nasal cannulas have shown better results than the ventilator systems for patients who are infected with Covid-19. “The high-flow nasal cannulas, unlike the ventilator systems, is non-invasive and helps in supplying high quantity of oxygen to patients. Their usage has shown improved results. Further, it also does not require team of experts to handle the equipment, unlike specialised staff required to handle ventilators. In Ghaziabad, there were hardly any high-flow nasal cannulas available during initial days of Covid-19 spread. If the health department is planning to purchase more units, it will help during treatment of critical patients,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association, Ghaziabad. “In the ventilator systems, the oxygen supply is invasive and may result in trauma or injury to lungs if oxygen is supplied with high level of force. So, ideally the decision for purchase of more high-flow nasal cannula units is encouraging and should help L2 and L3 hospitals,” he added. After the UP government directed for home isolation facility for asymptomatic patients, the Ghaziabad authorities are focussing more on strengthening the facilities in L2 and L3 hospitals. “We have introduced early identification, early testing and early referral of Covid-19 patients and as a result our case fatality rate has come down considerably. The demand for equipment by the health department will be taken care of and all available funds will be provided for purchase,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. Even the UP government is focussing on providing all available amenities and medical facilities to patients who are getting treated for Covid-19. “The chief minister has directed that all beds in L2 and L3 category hospitals should be provided with oxygen facilities and at all time there should be availability of oxygen stock which is sufficient for 48 hours. The CM has also directed that anti-viral drug Remdesivir should also be provided to patients,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-to-procure-more-high-flow-oxygen-system-to-aid-patient-recoveries/story-RJsJJyzx6PEKNvvBD76fiL.html
28-07-2020||Mumbai||Tulsi lake overflows; water stock in seven lakes is 32%||Of the seven lakes that supply drinking water to Mumbai, Tulsi lake on Monday night became the first to overflow this monsoon. Tulsi lake is the smallest of the seven and supplies only 1% of Mumbai’s total annual water needs. Despite spells of intense rain in the city, the water level of the lakes is lower this year than in July 2019.Tulsi lake, located within Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), is usually the first to overflow. The other lakes – Vihar, Upper Vaitarna, Middle Vaitarna, Modak Sagar, Tansa, and Bhatsa – are in Thane and Palghar districts. The seven lakes can store up to 14.47 lakh million litres of water and bifurcate into two systems – the Vaitarna system, which supplies water to the western suburbs and the island city; and the Bhatsa system, which supplies water to the eastern suburbs. Three weeks ago, Powai lake had overflowed, but it supplies water only for industrial purposes.As of Tuesday, the water stock in the seven lakes that supply water to Mumbai is just 32%, which could last a little over 100 days. On the same date, the stock had been 75.25% and 83.34% of full capacity in 2019 and 2018 respectively. According to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials, though there has been good rainfall in the city, catchment areas in lakes and dams have not received much rainfall. BMC said it is closely monitoring the situation and no decision on water cuts has been taken for Mumbai. The civic body supplies 3,750 million litres of water daily against the city’s demand for 4,200 million litres.Data shared by BMC showed the seven lakes had 4.73 lakh million litres of water – 32.69% of full capacity – on Tuesday. Bhatsa dam, which supplies 55% of the city’s total water requirement, stood at 36.15% of the total capacity, compared to 76.40% at this time in 2019.Of the total required rainfall for the year, 15% was expected in June and 35% in July. In August, 35% of required rainfall is expected, followed by 15% in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tulsi-lake-overflows-water-stock-in-seven-lakes-is-32/story-WoRv2I3K3lY70d4DsMTpdN.html
28-07-2020||Mumbai||City’s July rain is highest in 76 years||After surpassing its July average (840mm) within the first 15 days of the month, the city broke its all-time record for July rainfall on Tuesday. The rain tally between July 1 and July 28 (8.30pm) was 1,474.4mm, which is the highest in 76 years. Previously, 2014 had been the wettest July with 1,468.5mm rain.On Tuesday, south Mumbai recorded intermittent intense spells through the day, with 87.6 mm (heavy) rain from 8.30am to 8.30pm while the suburbs recorded 7.8 mm rain. A yellow alert (heavy rain) has been issued for Wednesday and Saturday by the weather bureau.Between July 1 and Tuesday, Mumbai has recorded 1,474.4mm rain, which is an all-time record. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) maintains rain data from 1944 onwards, when the Santacruz observatory was established. Though Mumbai had received a record 944.2mm rain over 24 hours in July 2005, when there were floods in the city, the monthly total was 1454.5 mm. Last year, the city recorded 1,464.8 mm rain in July. Other landmark years include 1965 (1,455.5 mm), 1961 (1,385.5 mm), 2011 (1,312.9mm), 2010 (1,250.4mm) and 1988 (1,226.1mm) in 1988.This month, Mumbai has recorded 75.5% excess rain and witnessed eight days of heavy to very heavy rain. Apart from July 2, the city has received rainfall every day of the month, with five days of very heavy rain. Maximum rain was recorded between July 4 and July 5 (200.8 mm) followed by 191.2mm between July 15-16. IMD classifies 15.6-64.4mm in 24 hours as moderate rain; 64.5-115.5mm rain as heavy; 115.6-204.4mm as very heavy; and over 204.5mm as extremely heavy rain. IMD officials said rain during July was consistent as opposed to June, when there was a rain deficit with the city falling 98mm short of its rain target and recording the lowest monthly rainfall in five years.“Weather systems in the Arabian Sea and larger factors such as a weak positive Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) – an ocean-atmosphere phenomenon with difference in sea surface temperatures characterised by cooling in parts of the Indian Ocean, leading to enhanced rain – ensured active monsoon conditions through most of the month,” said an IMD official.Professor Sridhar Balasubramanian, department of mechanical engineering and IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, said, “Positive IOD indicates a warm pool of water in the west Arabian Sea (near Somalia). This is good for bringing moisture over to the west coast.”However, showers have evaded catchment areas. “Since catchment areas are located further interior from the coast, cloud bands have not penetrated owing to weak wind drag. However, this is likely to change in August as the Bay of Bengal gets ready to churn a system,” said Balasubramanian, adding that the city could expect “above normal” rain in August.Mumbai has received 82.6% of its seasonal average rainfall from June 1 to July 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/city-s-july-rain-is-highest-in-76-years/story-GUdg6472XVYChPIaGC8jEJ.html
28-07-2020||City||Improved recovery rate reduces sealed area count in Ghaziabad||With the recovery rate in the district improving, active cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Ghaziabad are coming down steadily with none of the 275 hotspots having double-digit infections anymore, said officials. According to the latest list released by the administration on July 27, the district has 89 category-1 containment zones having at least one Covid-19 case, while there are 186 category-2 containment zones with multiple cases. In less than ten days, the number of total containment zones has also reduced by 42, as per the administration’s data.“With the rate at which we are discharging patients now, our recovery rate is better, and active cases in containment zones are on the decline. Currently, there is no containment zone which has more than nine cases or any zone with active cases in double digits. This has been achieved through the faster discharge of patients.” a senior official from the district health department, who wish not to be named, said.According to a list released on July 19, the district had at least 21 hotspots with 10 or more active cases out of the total 317 containment zones. These 21 hotspots included areas in Brij Vihar, Raj Nagar Extension, Lajpat Nagar, sector-4 at Vaishali, Nandgram, Shipra Sun City (Indirapuram), Ahimsa Khand-1 at Indirapuram, Nyay Khand in Indirapuram, Arthala, Chiranjeev Vihar and Gyan Khand-1 in Indirapuram among others.According to data by the health department, a total of 1,045 patients have been discharged between July 19—when the active cases were 1,322— and July 27 which has reduced the burden of active cases in containment zones.The Ghaziabad district, till July 27, had reported a total of 4,639 total cases including 947 active cases. With 3,628 total recoveries, the recovery rate stood at 78.2%—an improvement from the recovery rate of 64.93% on July 19 till when 2,583 people were discharged out to total 3,978 cases. Till June 30, the recovery rate was a mere 45.69% with 738 patients discharged out of 1,615 cases.“After July 19, the number of active cases is on the decline and at present (Tuesday) we have less than 800 active cases as per the state portal. We are planning to bring down the number of active cases further with the help of the revised discharge policy. Reduction in the number active cases will help us reduce the number containment zone which will benefit residents who face restrictions because of sealing” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.According to the revised discharge guidelines issued by the state government on July 21, asymptomtic patients in home isolation will be considered as recovered if they do not show any symptoms in 10 days. Mild category patients will be discharged after a follow up test on eighth day (of the first sample, under any of the three conditions – tenth day of the first sample, tenth day of the symptoms or if such patients remain without fever for three consecutive days.On Tuesday, the recovery rate further improved to 81.96% with total 3,859 recoveries out of 4,708 total cases (after deleting duplicate entries and cross-notification of patients).“There have been areas like Khoda, Vaishali, and Loni where we had taken up strict containment exercises and now the number of active cases there have reduced. Dealing with containment zones is one of our priority areas in fight against Covid-19,” he added.The latest list released by the district administration includes 244 zones having anything between one to five cases, while the rest zones of 31 zones have cases between six to nine.There are five zones which have nine number of active cases. The areas are Shalimar Garden Extension, Mata Colony at Vijay Nagar, Patel Ngar-2 and Janakpuri in Sahibabad and sector-12 at Vijay Nagar. Besides these, there are only two zones of Nandgram and Sihani having eight cases, while there are 11 zones having seven cases each. These include areas of Chiranjeev Vihar, Shastri Nagar, sector-2 at Vaishali and Khoda among others.“We are taking up containment exercises, sanitisation drives and also focussing on increased testing in category-2 zones. This is helping us identify positive cases and referring them for treatment,” the officer quoted above said. According to the official figures, till July 27, the district had tested 90,879 samples.“The size of the new containment zones have also been reduced,” the health department official said. As per an order issued by RK Tiwari, UP chief secretary, on July 24, the boundary of containment zones areas has been reduced by half. Areas within the 100-metre radius of a category-1 containment zone in city areas will be sealed now as compared to areas within a 250-meter radius. The boundary of category-2 containment zones (multiple cases) has also been redefined and the earlier 500-metre range has been reduced to 200 metre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/improved-recovery-rate-reduces-sealed-area-count-in-ghaziabad/story-13YeOXbVHapqColqMbMIpO.html

28-07-2020||City||Gambhir visits Ghazipur landfill, AAP questions height reduction claim||New Delhi: East Delhi MP and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Gautam Gambhir on Tuesday visited the Ghazipur landfill site to inspect measures that the municipal corporation had taken to reduce the height of the landfill site. He was accompanied by East Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Nirmal Jain and the civic agency’s commissioner Dilraj Kaur. Gambhir said that the height of Ghazipur landfill site had been reduced by 40 feet by segregating and treating legacy waste on the landfill with the help of trommel machines. “It was possible because of continuous efforts of EDMC. Our objective is development of the area, so it is expected of the Delhi Government to encourage and support us in development works,” Gambhir said. In 2019, the landfill had touched a height of 65 metres. In September 2017, a portion of the Ghazipur landfill collapsed and came tumbling on the road, trapping two passers-by, who died. Last week, Gambhir had claimed that the height of the landfill has been reduced by 40 feet.Dilraj Kaur, EDMC commissioner, said approximately 140 lakh tonnes of waste is being segregated and treated with the help of eight machines set up at the site. She said the size of landfill site is a serious challenge to EDMC. “These trommel machines process 640 metric tons of waste every day. We plan to install four more new machines to speed up the work of processing of legacy waste. The waste is separated in three parts with a separator. First- light waste such as plastic, polythene, and cloth, etc. Second, heavy waste such as glass and metal and third, other small substances and inert soil. The segregated waste is sent to treatment plants for processing,” she said. Reacting to Gambhir’s visit, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA from the area, Kuldeep Kumar, said the BJP leader was misleading people by spreading ‘lies’ such as the reduction in the height of the landfill by 40 feet. “If he had informed me about his visit, I would have accompanied him and apprised him about the worries of the public there,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gambhir-visits-ghazipur-landfill-aap-questions-height-reduction-claim/story-2aIWcezIc5f69eXvAlqnFP.html

At least half a dozen rounds were fired and at least four bullets hit the man, identified by his first name Ravi, police said. The police said that they suspect that Ravi, who also had a criminal background, may have been killed either over personal enmity or because of the rivalry between two gangs, whose leaders are presently lodged in Tihar jail. Ravi was a witness in a murder case of 2018 registered in outer Delhi. “We are probing if his murder is linked with that case,” said deputy commissioner of police (outer-north) Gaurav Sharma. Around 9 pm on Monday, Ravi was standing outside his home when three-four men arrived and opened fire at him.After hearing the gunshots, Ravi’s father, Vikram, rushed out and found his son bleeding. The suspects fled in a car after seeing Ravi’s family members and neighbours, said a police officer, quoting the statements by local residents. “Ravi’s family rushed him to Baba Saheb Ambedkar hospital, where he was declared brought dead. A case of murder has been registered at the Narela Industrial Area police station. It is being probed from all possible angles,” said DCP Sharma. There were rumours on local social media groups that Ravi had recently been taken to Tihar jail to identify a prime accused in the 2018 murder case and that he may have been killed for becoming the witness. “As of now, we have not come across any such development. Ravi’s family has also not alleged anything, so far,” the DCP added. The police said that they were scanning footage of CCTV cameras on the possible routes that the attackers may have taken while fleeing the crime spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-shot-dead-outside-his-house-in-narela-village/story-EfzGFw1mbzBddBS9FysnHL.html
28-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi ties up with US Embassy to train English teachers in govt schools||To enhance training of government school teachers, the Delhi government has launched a professional development programme for English teachers in a tie-up with the Regional English Language Office (RELO), US Embassy India. As part of the programme, around 550 teachers will be offered an eight-week online course, the government said on Tuesday. “About 550 teachers of the Delhi government schools will join the prestigious eight-week online Professional Development for English Teachers (PDET), conducted jointly by the Delhi government and the US Embassy,” the government statement said. The programme is an asynchronous course designed for English teachers to enhance their skills in teaching -- whether they are freshers or experienced. While this programme is for 550 middle and secondary grade teachers, the government said it is also exploring the option to have similar courses for primary level teachers. While launching the programme, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said the course “provides practical ideas for the English language classroom”. “The course emphasis on scaffolding students, critical thinking and use of techniques such as storytelling, drama, games and music will not only enhance children’s ability to learn a new language but also raise their confidence,” he said. “In the last four years, we have worked on both fronts -- learning opportunities for students and capacity building for teachers. While we have engaged renowned agencies to conduct Spoken English classes for students which benefitted nearly 65,000 children, we believe that giving new opportunities to our teachers to acquire global perspective and skills to teach English is a more sustainable approach,” the education minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-ties-up-with-us-embassy-to-train-english-teachers-in-govt-schools/story-IFPbVwX0BhBwXLhwD0bIuO.html

28-07-2020||City||Reopen 2007 blasphemy case against Dera Sirsa chief: Pargat to Punjab CM||Congress MLA from Jalandhar cantonment, Pargat Singh, has written to Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday demanding reopening of the 2007 blasphemy case registered against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim for allegedly getting dressed as Guru Gobind Singh.His letter to CM comes amid heated allegations and counter allegations between the SAD and Congress over action against the dera chief.Pargat told the CM that he has received information that advocate Jaspal Singh Manjhpur, of Ludhiana, has filed a petition in the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking reopening of the case.“I think the CM should take notice of this case through the advocate general and give instructions to take all possible legal action to reopen the 2007 case so that the dera chief can be punished.The former hockey Olympian said that they should expedite investigation in Bargari sacrilege, Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura firing incidents and take the cases to their logical end.He said that it is a political dishonesty that IG rank official of the Punjab Police had given an affidavit in the high court that there was sufficient evidence to prosecute the dera chief in the 2007 case but cancellation report was filed in the court just four days before the 2012 assembly elections.“If the SAD-BJP government led by the then CM Parkash Singh Badal had taken proper action in the case against the dera chief, there would not have been any sacrilege incident,” added Pargat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/reopen-2007-blasphemy-case-against-dera-sirsa-chief-pargat-to-punjab-cm/story-uwvX0XW26hrZZR7loMkI2J.html

28-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh adviser says admn helpless in removing beggars, but experts beg to differ||UT adviser Manoj Parida’s recent Twitter appeal to Chandigarh residents “not to give money to beggars who rush to you at traffic points” has in turn highlighted the administration’s failure to solve the problem despite laws and infrastructure in place.Parida’s appeal invited a mixed response as he cautioned people that beggars “could be corona spreaders”, and expressed helplessness, stating that: “We can’t jail them since beggary is not a crime. When put in shelter homes, they run away to make money from streets.”The same sense of helplessness pervades down the UT administration hierarchy. Harjinder Kaur, chairperson of the Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said: “We keep conducting drives, but without Mohali and Panchkula’s cooperation, it is very difficult to solve the problem in the city.” Kaur said most of the children removed from streets are from the two satellite cities, and they can’t be rehabilitated without their parents’ permission.118 DRIVES SINCE APRIL 2019Navjot Kaur, director, social welfare, said: “During awareness drives, a head count of beggars was conducted in 2018-19. Approximately 50 adult beggars and 80 to 100 children were covered.” Since April 2019, 118 anti-beggary rescue drives have been carried out in convergence with other stakeholders, wherein 51 children have been rescued, she said.“Rescued children are later admitted to shelters and need-based interventions, like education, vocational training and bridge courses, are provided to them. Adult beggars are presented before the magistrate, and if admitted to an institute, they are provided with some professional skill. Psychiatry treatment is also provided,” she said.ADMN CANNOT SHIRK RESPONSIBILITYEven as the administration contends that teams have been constituted under three subdivisional magistrates, children homes have been constructed and services of adoption agencies have been availed, on the ground the problem has only worsened. Residents agree that giving money to beggars should be avoided, but also argue that the administration cannot shirk its responsibility.Stating that the problem is becoming acute by the day, Baljinder Singh Bittu, chairman, Federation of Sector Welfare Associations of Chandigarh (FOSWAC), said: “As soon as there is a red signal at a crossing, beggars, both adult and children, rush to vehicles and harass people to dole out money. It is a big mafia that exploits people’s empathy.”“Even if we accept the adviser’s reasoning that people cannot be arrested for begging, they can at least be removed for obstructing traffic and arrested for exploiting children,” said Hitesh Puri, chairman, Chandigarh Resident Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED).LEGAL FRAMEWORK AVAILABLEIn reply to Parida’s tweet, Rajesh Jogpal, a Haryana-cadre Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer and former Panchkula MC commissioner, highlighted: “The Chandigarh administration has adopted Haryana Prevention of Beggary Act 1971, under which beggary is a crime. Chandigarh has three certified institutions to house arrested beggar. Sure the beggars can’t be jailed, but after being arrested, they can be put in these institutions.”This was also admitted by the administration in the Punjab and Haryana high court in January 2019.Stating adequate legal provisions are available for stopping begging, Ajay Jagga, a city-based advocate, said: “Begging can be split into two parts: just begging and use of children for begging. As far as adult beggars or for that matter vendors of goods at traffic points are concerned, the drive has to be conducted by both the MC (for removing these encroachers) and police (to ensure free flow of traffic).”Those who are using children for begging can be booked under Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, he said.Prof Devi Sirohi, former chairperson of the CCPCR, emphasised regular monitoring and coordinated effort by different government agencies to solve the problem, “In 2016, we had conducted a survey for estimating its scale. By the beginning of 2017, we could achieve much success, but, this is an ongoing exercise. Constant monitoring is a must if the problem is to be solved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-adviser-says-admn-helpless-in-removing-beggars-but-experts-beg-to-differ/story-0hSnP8yzwhULxjqAMCWABM.html
28-07-2020||City||PMC appeals to state government to help set up jumbo medical facilities||PUNE: Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has asked the state government to provide financial assistance for setting up jumbo medical facilities in the city. Hemant Rasne, PMC standing committee chairman said, “The civic body is facing a financial crisis. It has already spent Rs250 crore for Covid-related work. To ease the monetary strain, the Maharashtra government must provide funds to erect three jumbo Covid care centres in the city.” Pune district guardian minister Ajit Pawar has approved three jumbo Covid care centres with a combined capacity of 2,400 beds. The minister has asked the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal commissioners to set up these centres in the city as the number of critical patients is set to rise in the coming days as per the projected figures released by civic officials. Though Pawar had given instructions to erect these centres, there is no clarity on who will bear the cost. Bharatiya Janata Party’s Rasne, said, “The civic body is trying its best to control the virus spread, but the state government is also expected to help us financially.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-appeals-to-state-government-to-help-set-up-jumbo-medical-facilities/story-ZjFQpOZkuVmtKBRAMK7XxN.html
28-07-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai records its wettest July, breaks all-time high monthly rain record||The city surpassed its July 2014 record (1,468.5mm) for the all-time high monthly rainfall on Tuesday with intermittent intense rain spells taking the monthly rain tally to 1,474.3 mm from July 1 to July 28 5.30pm.On Tuesday, south Mumbai recorded intermittent intense spells through the day with 83.6 mm (heavy) rain from 8.30 am to 5.30 pm while the suburbs recorded 7.7 mm rain. Over the last 24 hours moderate rain was recorded in the suburbs and south Mumbai.A yellow alert (heavy rain warning) was issued for Wednesday and Saturday by the weather bureau.Read latest updates on Mumbai rains here. Meanwhile, the city had surpassed its July average rain target of 840 mm in the first 15 days itself, and has currently recorded 75.5% excess rain for the month. Mumbai has witnessed a total of eight heavy to very heavy rain days this month, which paved the way for previous records to be broken.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) maintains rain data from 1959 onwards. Though Mumbai received 944.2 mm rain during July 2005, the monthly total was 1454.5 mm. Last year, the city had recorded 1,464.8 mm rain during July. Other landmark years over the past 61 years include 1,455.5 mm in 1965, 1,385.5 mm in 1961, 1,312.9 in 2011, 1,250.4 in 2010, and 1,226.1 mm in 1988.IMD classifies 15.6-64.4 mm as moderate rain while 64.5-115.5 mm rain as heavy, 115.6-204.4 mm as very heavy, and over 204.5 mm as extremely heavy rain for a period of 24-hours. The city witnessed five ‘very heavy’ rain days through the month so far with maximum rain recorded between July 4 and 5 at 200.8 mm followed by 191.2 mm on July 15-16. Additionally three ‘heavy’ rain days. Apart from July 2, the city has received rainfall every day of the month.Also read: Mumbai records its second highest July rain in 44 years, highest in 10 yearsIMD officials said rain during July was consistent as opposed to the pattern during June. Mumbai witnessed a deficient rain during June with the lowest rainfall in five years as the city fell 98 mm short of its monthly average target. “Weather systems in the Arabian Sea and larger factors such as a weak positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) - an ocean-atmosphere phenomenon with difference in sea surface temperatures characterised by cooling in parts of Indian Ocean leading to enhanced rain - ensured active monsoon conditions through most of the month allowing westerly winds to bring in a lot of moisture over the city,” said a senior IMD official.Professor Sridhar Balasubramanian, department of mechanical engineering and IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay said weather synoptic conditions were more active in Arabian Sea than Bay of Bengal, resulting in good rains over Mumbai during July. “Positive IOD indicates a warm pool of water in the west Arabian Sea (near Somalia). This is good for bringing moisture over to the west coast. The favorable IOD was witnessed last year as well. The presence of a moderate to strong offshore trough throughout July ensured steady and consistent rains breaking an all-time record,” he said.Thundershowers were reported on at least 15 days in July as against the normal of three days for Mumbai, said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom. “A preliminary analysis suggests that the number of rainy days in Santacruz this July has been higher than the normal of 23 days. Intense rain on most days occurred after midnight instead of early afternoon. Thus, increased thunderstorm activity seems to have played a major role in enhancing rainfall,” he said.Also read | 10 yrs of 26/7 deluge: Is Mumbai better prepared? Answer is ‘No’Though the city received excess rain for the month, showers evaded catchment areas. Even as Tulsi Lake overflowed on Tuesday, water stock across seven lakes supplying water to Mumbai was 32.7% of the required amount. Last year, it was 75% of the required quantum by this period. “Since catchment areas are located further interior from the coast, cloud bands have not penetrated owing to weak wind drag. However, this is likely to change in August as the Bay of Bengal gets ready to churn a system,” said Balasubramanian adding, “The city could expect above normal rain for August.”Mumbai has so far received 82.6% of its seasonal average rainfall from June 1 to July 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-its-wettest-july-breaks-all-time-high-monthly-rain-record/story-9HrxP2n7JHZoxdj75zU4FI.html

28-07-2020||Chandigarh||UT hospitals allow home isolation for suspected Covid-19 cases||Chandigarh Hospitals in the city are now allowing people suspected to have contracted Covid-19 and awaiting test results to isolate at home, officials have said.Earlier it was mandatory for such cases to admitted in hospital isolation wards until the test reports confirmed their condition.People are currently being sampled at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Government Medical College and Hospital in Sector 32 and Government Multi-Specialty Hospital in Sector 16. UT health secretary Arun Gupta said the step has been taken for the optimisation of resources. “The home isolation option was not followed earlier here but with the rising number of tests we have decided that the persons who have the requisite facilities at their residence can be isolated there. This will help us test more persons than before,” Gupta added.However, those opting for home facilities will have to sign an undertaking similar to one given by a confirmed case for isolation. Rules in such cases will require persons to stay in a well-ventilated room separated from others at home, especially the elderly and those with comorbid conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, renal disease and follow respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette.Also, personal items will not be shared and the isolated person will have to -monitor his/her health, taking temperature daily and reporting to health authorities immediately in case of health problems.Caregivers with the isolated persons are also required to follow all the precautions.₹2,000 fine for violating rulesUT health secretary Arun Gupta has said that violations in home isolation rules will be technically dealt with under rules notified earlier for home quarantine.

Traders in the Dattanagar– Jambulwadi road area in Katraj put up banners on their shop shutters and demanded cancellation of the odd-even rule. “We have been struggling to survive since the past three-four months because of the lockdown. After the second lockdown ended, we all started our shops again with a hope that our financial conditions will improve. However, all of us were orally told by Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials on Monday that we need to keep our shops open as per P1 and P2 regulations. The rule is not acceptable and so immediately we closed our shops to protest against this order,” said Vaibhav Dhekane, executive president of Dattanagar-Jambhulwadi road traders’ association. PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar, said, “The odd-even rules for shop owners has not been decided by us. It is a regulation of the Maharashtra government. We need to wait for the revised regulations issued by the state government in this regard and once it comes, we will work accordingly. However, till then, I appeal to all the shop owners to please cooperate with us and be safe.” On Tuesday, traders gathered at Dattanagar chowk at 10am. A group of traders also approached other shops in the area and requested them to participate in the protest by keeping their shops closed. “It was our first protest and we submitted our demand letter to the PMC’s Dhankawadi ward office.

28-07-2020||Delhi||Raksha Bandhan 2020: Denizens send rakhis to corona warriors||Across the country, and even abroad, sisters have started sending rakhis, to their brothers, ahead of Raksha Bandhan (August 3). Wrapped in envelops with a few grains of rice and a pinch of roli/tika, these rakhis that are symbolic of the love shared between siblings, have now become carriers of ‘thank you’; for those who have been frontline warriors at the war against corona. To recognise the selfless service of doctors and police personnel, amid the pandemic, residents of Delhi-NCR have taken up something special. “Doctors have been the backbone of our country in this pandemic. They are the true protectors and that’s why the women in our residential society have started sending rakhis to hospitals such as AIIMS and GTB. We will also send rakhis to our nearby police station. The cops must feel that we value their protection,” says Santi Sankar, a resident of DLF Phase 1, Gurugram. Families of Covid-19 survivors are taking this festival as an opportunity to express gratitude to the docs who protected lives of their dear ones. “My husband recently recovered from Covid-19, and I’ve huge respect for the services that the doctors are rendering, to protect us all from the virus. At this moment, they are the true soldiers. Therefore, I felt that making a handmade rakhi and card along with my children will be a sweet way to say thank you to our doctor, and also teach children the real meaning of the bond of protection that Raksha Bandhan is all about,” says Malvika Khanna, a resident of Greater Kailash. Doctors who are receiving rakhis are feeling touched by this gesture. “My brother is a doctor and he has been getting rakhis via couriers to his house, clinic and even the hospital that he visits. They are often addressed to ‘corona warriors’. A lot of the packets are accompanied with a handwritten thank you note,” says Avantika Mishra, a resident of DLF Phase II. And Dr Devina Bajpayee, a resident of Vasant Kunj, adds, “I feel overwhelmed to receive so much love from my patients. Originally rakhis have been for brothers, but for every rakhi that I have received for myself, I feel immense gratitude. Kids of some of my patients have also sent me their drawings where doctors wearing rakhi are sketched... The festival of rakhi is indeed going to be special this year.”Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFor more stories follow Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/raksha-bandhan-2020-denizens-send-rakhis-to-corona-warriors/story-jjjWm2MV1xJsX5PJWkYYQK.html

However, the civic body received a poor response from private doctors and hence, municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar floated the proposal in front of the standing committee.The standing committee approved the proposal to hire medical college students and interns at the Covid-19 care centres and fixed payments for them.Kumar in his proposal stated that the PMC tried to appoint doctors for a six-month contract, twice, and even issued appointment letters to these doctors, but very few of them joined duty. “As the Covid-19 cases are increasing in the city and the medical infrastructure is also improving, we are hiring more medical staff. Recently guardian minister Ajit Pawar asked us to appoint final-year medical students or who are doing internship, at Covid centres. As decided in the meeting, PMC is appointing medical students from various colleges.”Standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne, said, “We have given a nod to the administration’s proposal to appoint students from medical colleges. PMC standing committee approved the stipend as suggested by the administration.”These students have already completed their medical education and are either practising or completing their internship. Some of them are also volunteers at the PMC and government hospitals, claimed officials from the administration.Payment planStanding committee of the Pune Municipal Corporation approved the following stipend for medical college students who will work with the civic body:MBBS student- Rs30,000 per monthBAMS student- Rs25,000 per monthBHMS student- 20,000 per monthMBBS student in any year rather than final year - Rs500 per dayNursing college student - Rs400 per dayStudent for swab test- Rs100 per day||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-to-appoint-final-year-medical-college-students-at-covid-care-centres/story-DchFvbuoA2G4CfhSGWwEdJ.html

28-07-2020||Kolkata||‘Isolation lockups for those who contract Covid-19 in custody’: Kolkata police||The police in Kolkata have floated the idea of ‘isolation lockups’ to quarantine arrested persons who develop Covid-19 symptoms during interrogation. The move comes after more than a dozen police officials of the city police’s detective department had to be quarantined earlier this month after an accused, who was sent to police custody for interrogation, developed Covid-19 symptoms and was later detected with the virus. One officer in the team has already tested positive. “We are planning to set up isolation lockups in the headquarters so that arrested persons who develop Covid-19 symptoms could be quarantined and isolated from other arrested persons,” said a senior officer of the Kolkata police. During this period of lockdown, the incidents of crime have dropped drastically. On an average, Kolkata police register 1400–1500 crime incidents every month. In April, this number dropped to around 300 after pan-India lockdown was put in place on March 25. In June, around 900 cases were registered.Local police stations have been asked to look for such arrangements where isolation lockups could be set up. Officials said that not all police stations may have the necessary infrastructure.More than 1,000 cases have been detected in West Bengal Police till date. Three police personnel have died. Local police stations are also booking hotels and community centres that will act as temporary barracks. In some police stations, glass cubicles are being set up where officers can meet people coming to the police stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/isolation-lockups-for-those-who-contract-covid-19-in-custody-kolkata-police/story-03bcwN5ao4mXbn5XTPc11I.html

28-07-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab health department on toes after 38 contacts of Bathinda cop test positive in four days||Bathinda: The district health authorities are baffled after 38 people, including 28 police personnel, have tested positive for coronavirus from a single source in the past four days. Official sources said the number may swell further as testing and tracing of contacts of all these asymptomatic patients is underway. An assistant sub-inspector posted at Nathana police station, about 40 km from the district headquarters, first tested positive on July 22. Two days later, most of the staff of Nathana, including the station house officer (SHO), were found infected with coronavirus. District authorities said nine family members of the ASI and one nurse at the community health centre tested positive on Monday. Since the ASI, who had a recent travel history, and other cops may have met several more persons before being tested, the administration has decided to launch intensive testing in the area. Though Bathinda senior superintendent of police (SSP) Nanak Singh was not available for comment, inspector general of police, Bathinda range, Jaskaran Singh said the ASI had gone to Uttar Pradesh for investigation in a murder case. “An accused was nabbed from UP who tested negative for coronavirus. But 28 other personnel at Nathana police station tested positive. They all are asymptomatic and being treated at the government isolation facility,” the IGP said. Deputy commissioner B Srinivasan said the ASI had possibly contracted the infection in UP or while travelling back to Bathinda. “The health department is working to trace primary contacts of all police personnel. It is a challenge to determine the possible source from where the ASI may have contracted the virus. Though no case of Covid-19 was reported earlier from Nathana, the health department has been directed to undertake intensive testing in the area,” the DC said. RETURN OF MIGRANT WORKERS A CHALLENGE Bathinda civil surgeon Dr Amrik Singh Sandhu said of the total 282 cases in the district, 140 alone are from a quarantine facility established by Guru Gobind Singh Refinery at Rama Mandi. According to the DC, a large number of workers from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal had come to Bathinda to work at the refinery but all of them were sent to a 2,000-bed quarantine colony. “The spike in the number of cases in Bathinda is due to the workers coming from different places. The source of their infection is still not known but the refinery management has ensured testing of each resident in the quarantine colony that is a separate place earmarked for workers on the refinery compound,” Srinivasan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-health-department-on-toes-after-38-contacts-of-bathinda-cop-test-positive-in-four-days/story-lfwSy6ucjrkaovzpgCM6jN.html
28-07-2020||Chandigarh||Despite collection of cow cess, Jalandhar has no cattle pound||Despite the persisting stray cattle menace, which has led to several road mishaps in the district, the Jalandhar municipal corporation (MC) has not built any cattle pond or cowshed to tackle the problem. However, the MC continues to collect a hefty cow cess from locals every year. The MC had approved Rs 50 lakh for constructing a cattle pound in Shahkot in 2019. However, the MC stopped work last year after spending Rs 34.51 lakh and is yet to resume work. Besides, the MC has no other government establishment to house stray cattle in the district. Moreover, the existing cowsheds being run by NGOs are already filled to capacity and are refusing to take in any more cattle. They are also not rising to the MC’s aid as the civic body does not provide any aid for running cowsheds. A senior MC official, on request of anonymity, said the MC had collected Rs 1.72 crore from cow cess in 2019-20, Rs 1 crore in 2018-19 and Rs 19.64 lakh in 2017-18. The state government has been levying cow cess on liquor, fuel and some other items since 2016. Deputy director of animal husbandry Dr Mohinder Pal said, “Everyday at least one animal is injured after being hit by a vehicle. Our teams provide the best possible treatment. However, in absence of a proper place where the animal can be shifted after being provided first-aid not many survive.” He said many animals had been shifted to a cattle pound in Kanian Kalan village under the Shahkot tehsil. The cowshed is run by an NGO with the help of the state government but is also now almost full. “The MC has been dilly-dallying on the matter and is not constructing a cattle pound in the district,” Dr Pal said. A Jalandhar-based NGO People for Animals, which treats sick animals, including cows, had brought an injured cow from Hazara village. “The MC officials did not assist us though many locals offered to help,” says Manpreet Kaur of Hazara resident. MC health officer Dr Krishan Shama said, “There are two gaushalas being run by NGOs that are already overcrowded. The MC has an agreement with a Faridkot-based NGO.” He said work at a cattle pound in Shahkot was stopped months ago and he was unaware its status. He, however, blamed rural cattle owners for letting their animals loose in the city. MC commissioner Karnesh Sharma could not be reached for comments. District BJP president and councillor from ward two Susheel Sharma said corruption was rampant in the municipal corporation. “Every year, they approve funds for cattle pounds but they have not constructed it so far. “I have taken up the matter of proper utilisation of MC cess but to no avail,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/despite-collection-of-cow-cess-jalandhar-has-no-cattle-pound/story-ArCCjXSH2Ujb2bPkVxF6hL.html

28-07-2020||Pune||Rural students of Gorhe Budruk ZP school get tablets, laptops to attend classes||Covid-19 pandemic has changed the dimensions of education. With schools shut, teachers have started with the new academic year through online classes. However, students from rural areas are facing a setback because of no access to electronic gadgets which can facilitate their need to attend online classes.To solve the issue, Pune Zilla Parishad (ZP) education department along with ThinkSharp Foundation started a pilot project, Home School, at Gorhe Budruk village in Haveli taluka of Pune district. Under the project, all students of Class 4 to 7 from Gorhe Budruk village have been given educational tablets and other necessary facilities to enable them to attend online classes. “We have planned to implement a home-schooling model which will provide educational tablets and other facilities to all 75 children from Classes 4 to 7 of the Zilla Parishad school in Gorhe Budruk village. These tablets will help students connect with their teachers and attend online classes and will also have a library of 1,500 e-books to read along with other educational apps. This will allow them to study online and offline,” said Santosh Phad founder of ThinkSharp Foundation. Rajnikant Mendhe, Zilla Parishad teacher from the village school, said, “In rural areas, disinterest in studies accounts for 20.24 per cent of schoolchildren, hence, some students, especially younger ones, may totally lose their interest in studies, making it difficult to incentivise them back into school. More importantly a crisis like Covid-19 pandemic, forces the parents to take their kids to work to earn money and as soon as money starts flowing in, parents become reluctant to send their kids back to school. We are currently working through all obstacles such as lack of resources, connectivity issues, and rural stereotypes to make this mission a success. Despite these hurdles, the children that could attend these online classes, even for a short period of time, showed a high amount of interest and motivation towards learning more about the world around them. This showed us the need for the development of digital infrastructure for these students, so that their learning never stops.” The ThinkSharp Foundation has raised Rs 4 lakh along with the help of students of an international school for the project. Last week, Maharashtra education minister Varsha Gaikwad also acknowledged the project through a virtual meeting with the students and teachers of the school who have started using tablets. Apart from the regular curriculum, due to digital learning, children are also getting the opportunity to learn foreign languages through volunteers.

28-07-2020||Bangalore||‘Congress is another name for horse trading’: Kumaraswamy slams ally||“Congress is another name for horse trading” said JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy on Tuesday as he slammed the party’s erstwhile state ally for its nationwide “Save Democracy” campaign against the BJP, accusing it of trying to topple democratically elected governments. The former Chief Minister said Congress is an expert in dividing political parties and purchasing MLAs. In fact, the term horse trading in politics came to be in use because of it, he said. “Congress has launched a nation-wide Save Democracy, campaign against the BJP which is buying MLAs to topple democratically elected governments. What has Congress done it? Haven’t they lured all BSP MLAs who supported the Congress to form the government in Rajasthan? Is this not a buyout?” Kumaraswamy asked. In a statement, he sought to know whether luring MLAs of the party which supported them through political shenanigans and merging the party which supported them was democratic behaviour. “If you are dividing like minded party MLAs supporting (you) through deceit, who would support you? Are these mistakes not visible to you?” he asked the Congress. In a politically significant development in Rajasthan, all six Bahujan Samaj Party MLAs had merged the legislative party with the Congress in September last year. Kumaraswamy also reminded the Congress, which was crying hoarse about purchase of MLAs, that it had divided the JD(S) in Karnataka in the past. “Haven’t they made attempts to divide? Is it not a fact that for the sake of one Rajya Sabha seat, the Congress government in Karnataka purchased eight JD(S) MLAs? Is this democracy? Both parties (Congress and BJP) are criminals in purchase matters.” Eight JD(S) MLAs had voted against the party’s official candidate and supported Congress in the biennial elections to Rajya Sabha from Karnataka in 2016. “When S M Krishna was the CM (of Karnataka), didn’t the Congress buy our MLAs? Didn’t the Congress conspire to form a government after the 2018 Assembly polls by buying our MLAs? Does Congress have the moral courage to answer these questions?” Kumaraswamy asked. In 2004, the Congress tried to divide JD(S), he said, adding that to avoid the party being hijacked by them, he had to oust the Dharam Singh led Congress-JD(S) coalition government through a political coup. Noting that the Anti Defection Law is not effective because of which these “anti-democratic farces” are being enacted, Kumaraswamy said it is imperative to make those who defect and their family members not contest elections at least for two terms, besides disqualifying them from holding any office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/congress-is-another-name-for-horse-trading-kumaraswamy-slams-ally/story-TeJjchQLyF0UmhHmUMutvK.html

28-07-2020||Lucknow||Online ‘Qurbani Ke Bakrey’ drums up sales on wheels||With open goat markets not functioning due to the Covid pandemic, Pashu Bajaar -- a dedicated website for selling goats from the Goat Trust – has come up with a unique way of advertising its business. The Pashu Bajaar has sent out a couple of e-rickshaws with ‘Qurbani Ke Bakrey’ posters on them and their staff in the e-rickshaws, besides distributing pamphlets and rate list of their product, also deliver the goats at the door steps of people who have placed orders online. For the past few weeks, these e-rickshaws have been doing the rounds of various parts of the city -- especially the Muslim dominated areas of Lucknow. They are inviting Muslims to buy ‘certified’ goats for Bakrid sacrifice. The festival is likely on August 1. So far Pashu Bajaar has sold and home-delivered 683 goats and 3,000 more are in the process of being home-delivered. Though most buyers opt for one or two goats through the website, but some like Mohammad Sameer of Chowk booked a goat online but went to the Kukrail farm area of the Goat Trust and picked up five goats. “I live in Chowk. Learnt about this and came here. The goats are really good and well priced. There is no surge pricing here. I am very happy to have bought the goats for sacrifice this way for the first time.” The Goat Trust is a voluntary organisation engaged in promoting and supporting goat rearing, especially in Bundelkhand and Lucknow region. Sanjeev Kumar, a social entrepreneur and an Ashoka Fellow (2013), had founded the Goat Trust in 2013 to promote systematic goat rearing as a means of livelihood. A total of 442 goat farmers are linked to the organisation. An alumnus of the National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, Kumar said: “All the goats on our website are actually owned by these farmers in villages and we are just facilitating the sale and profit earning for them. These farmers so far have made between Rs 2,200 to Rs 2,500 profit per goat this Bakrid. We issue a health certificate for each goat before its sale that mentions the details of when the goats were de-wormed and vaccinated and their age and weight.” “People go to the site, book the goat of their choice by looking at the pictures, health certificate and other descriptions such as weight, age etc. A buyer first books his preferred choice by paying 20% amount online, then once the delivery is done the buyers send full payment,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/online-qurbani-ke-bakrey-drums-up-sales-on-wheels/story-h7CMP6pX0pzjiUFr2lypiP.html

28-07-2020||Chandigarh||Sikhs in Pakistan want Imran Khan government to tackle Lahore gurdwara row at its own level: PSGPC||AMRITSAR: Sikhs in Pakistan want the Imran Khan government to deal with those staking claim over the historical Gurdwara Shaheedi Asthan in Lahore at its own level and restore confidence among minorities. Days after a video clip showing two local men laying claim to the gurdwara and threatening to convert it into a mosque, the Sikh community in the neighbouring country said the Pakistan Government should act against the culprits at its own level. Gurdwara Shahidi Asthan is a historical gurdwara where Bhai Taru Ji made the supreme sacrifice in 1745. Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) president Satwant Singh said, “Sikhs across the world are sad to hear the news about Gurdwara Shaheed Bhai Taru Singh. The vision of the Pakistan government, especially Prime Minister Imran Khan, is to promote peace and brotherhood. The incident that happened at Shaheedi Asthan is the act of an individual. There is a plot behind the gurdwara, which is a property of the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETBP). They plan to grab that plot. This is wrong and can’t be tolerated.” “If we take action, it will damage the brotherhood of Sikhs and Muslims. Nor will it be a solution to the problem. I have raised this issue with the ETPB and other government departments. We want the government to tackle such issues at its level,” Satwant Singh said. COMPLAINT LODGED WITH POLICEMeanwhile, the ETPB, a Pakistan government body under which the PSGPC works, has lodged a complaint against Suhail Butt Attari, who is seen intimidating the Sikh community in Pakistan. In his complaint to the deputy inspector general (operation) of Lahore, ETBP secretary Sanullah Khan, said, “On July 25, Suhail Butt Attari, s/o Salah ud Din Butt, a local resident from Darbar Hazrat Shah Kaku Chisti in Lahore, tried to defame Pakistan by uploading a baseless propaganda video against Sikhs in Pakistan, the PSGPC and ETPB, and the Government of Pakistan. The DVD of the footage is enclosed.” ‘VIDEO CLIP DAMAGING PAKISTAN’S IMAGE’ “The PSGPC is the only official representative regulatory body of the Pakistan Sikh community and is playing a vital role in the image building of Pakistan as a minority-loving country. After the success of the Kartarpur Corridor project and appreciation of Pakistan at the international level, multiple conspiracies of anti-state elements are being hatched to malign the country,” the complaint said. The ETBP said that Suhail Butt and his associates Raza Butt, Umair and others are conspiring to provoke people against Gurdwara Taru Singh and trying to occupy the adjoining vacant plot in Landa Bazaar, Lahore. “To project his immoral acts, he is damaging the image of Pakistan at the international level. Strict disciplinary action should be taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sikhs-in-pakistan-want-imran-khan-government-to-tackle-lahore-gurdwara-row-at-its-own-level-psgpc/story-FVPGh8SEbygFoCwCkA4vXM.html

The cops said that they are investigating the incident and also probing if any known person was behind the dacoity (robbery committed by five or more persons).The family said that at least six armed men broke into their house in Chiranjeev Vihar’s sector-9 at around 1:30 am on Tuesday and left at around 4 am while threatening them of dire consequences if they tried to raise an alarm or alert police. The Chiranjeev Vihar area is close to Harsaon police lines. The family alleged that their calls to the police were not answered. “The men left our house at 4am on Tuesday. The police did not take calls and we had to go to the local police post to alert them about the incident. As per our initial assessment, the robbers took away jewellery worth Rs 11 lakh besides about Rs 2 lakh in cash. They also took away money which my father had withdrawn from a bank on Monday,” said Kanchan Sharma, the house owner.The incident comes at a time when night curfew - between 10pm and 5am - in wake of Covid-19 is in place and police patrolling is beefed up.Kalanidhi Nathani, senior superintendent of police (SSP), said that the robbers fled with jewellery and cash during the incident. He however declined to comment whether there was a lack of police patrolling in the area.“We have roped in several teams and are also scanning CCTV footage. The CCTV at the house was not functional. The family informed us that 5-6 robbers had come and fled with jewellery and cash. We are probing the case and also trying to find if there is involvement of any known person or not,” Naithani told reporters.Sharma recounted how they entered the house and held the members at gunpoint.“They broke into the house by cutting through the window grille. They were six in number and were carrying weapons and knives. There were a total of 11 members, including children, of our family. After they entered the house, they had children at gunpoint while threatening all of us to keep quiet. They tore the bedsheets and tightly fastened our mouths with it,” said Sharma.She said that her sister, along with her family, had come to visit her on Monday. The family said that they thrashed several family members, including a girl.“After they took us at gunpoint and fastened our mouths, they locked all of us in the bathroom. The men seemed to be in the age group of 35-40 years and were well built. They did not speak in local dialect and seemed to be from eastern UP. After they were done looting, they pulled us out again from the bathroom and locked us in one of the rooms. They left soon after,” she added.Sharma said that she lost her husband and five other family members to the tragedy resulting out of flash floods in Kedarnath in 2013.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/family-robbed-of-cash-jewellery-worth-rs-13-lakh-at-gunpoint-in-up-s-ghaziabad/story-OueXcivLHIYginuxK8ydVK.html

28-07-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The end of a beauty parlour||She would do facial, manicure, pedicure, haircut and many other things in a space she created all by herself. But the dreamworld has ended. She finally shut down her beauty parlour for women on 22 June. “In these days of physical distancing, very few people are ready to be in such close proximity with somebody outside their immediate family,” observes Preeti Sachdeva.In her 40s, Ms Sachdeva was getting very few customers after she reopened the parlour, in May, when the coronavirus triggered lockdown was lifted. “It was no longer viable... I was finding it tough to pay the rent to the landlord, and I also had to pay her monthly salary to Mamta, my helper.”Ms Sachdeva had founded the parlour in 2008 in Jyoti Park, a neighbourhood in Gurugram’s Sector 7. She had named it Roopshree, “which is one of the names of Matarani, Lakshmi Ma.” This mother of two had many reasons to start her own business. Talking on WhatsApp video from her home in Devilal Colony, she lists them one by one.a) “My husband was still establishing his business. I thought it would be convenient to have some extra money at hand.”b) “It is nice to regularly get out of home, to dress up daily, to have an active professional life, and to stay busy and productive. It makes one feel good and confident about oneself.”c) “Many of my (female) relatives had their own parlours too. In fact, I learned beauty tips from my sister-in-law, Shashi Ahuja, who runs a parlour in Faridabad. I also did initial training under the supervision of Sunita Didi, who runs a beauty parlour in Arjun Nagar.”D) “Earning on my own, I hoped, would make me independent, powerful and well-respected in my circle of relatives and friends.”There was one more advantage of engaging with the wide world outside that Ms Sachdeva learned later. Everyday she would get to meet women from a variety of backgrounds and ages, all of which, she says, enriched her experiences and helped her in learning new ways of looking at the world and at herself. “Working in the parlour gave me a chance to see the world through the lives of other people, and since I’m very chatty by nature, my clients would always feel comfortable sharing stories about themselves.”The lady gives an example. “One of my regular customers was an aunty, in her 70s, almost my mother’s age, but very tiptop.” Sometimes Ms Sachdeva’s other, much younger, clients would curiously ask the elderly woman why she cared so much for her grooming in her advanced age and “Aunty” would cheerily shoot back, saying, “Why shouldn’t I?!” That response made Ms Sachdeva rethink her views on aging, and how she would like to be when she reaches 70.In the early years of the parlour, Ms Sachdeva’s school-going kids were still little. Every afternoon she was obliged to close the parlour for a couple of hours, and hurry back home to feed them lunch. It was a ten-minute walk between the house and the parlour. Lately, both her son and daughter were busy in their higher studies, her husband involved in his business, and she was freely immersed in her thriving parlour that would open six days a week from 10 am to 8 pm. (Even so, she would be single-handedly cooking the dinner every night.)And then the pandemic arrived, “just when everything was running so nicely, and we all were so happy with our routines.”After giving the shop space back to the landlord, Ms Sachdeva crammed up all her beauty parlour furniture and make-up stuff at her home. It occupies a corner of the upstairs room. Showing it through the mobile phone screen that connects her to this reporter, she says, “I had built my parlour with so much care.” The lady is speaking very matter-of-fairly, as if she didn’t like the indulgence of wallowing in regrets and disappointments. Looking at the mirror, she declares that not everything is lost. “I have already started working from home, and maybe my old customers will start coming back.”With this hope, she calls her son to hold the mobile as she poses for a portrait.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-end-of-a-beauty-parlour/story-ugRQAmDO3rkewrpS0VzGSI.html

28-07-2020||Mumbai||Aviation sector needs urgent plan to deal with crisis: CAPA-India asks government to intervene||For the second time in a month, aviation consultancy Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) - India, on Monday reiterated that the Indian aviation industry needs an immediate plan to deal with the ongoing financial crisis and warned that the sector is headed for a “challenging future” owing to the restrictions imposed by the government. In a series of tweets, CAPA- India said, “Indian aviation is headed for a very challenging future given the regulatory constraints imposed on the sector 1) domestic capacity limited to 45% 2) fare bands extended for three months 3) int’l travel restricted to a handful of travel bubbles. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that demand is very weak. Load factors are just 50-55% even with limited operations. And all this is happening at a time when most carriers have no cash and raising capital is very challenging. The viability of Indian aviation will be critical to support India’s economic recovery post-COVID.” Kapil Kaul, chief executive officer (CEO) of CAPA-India, said, “Aviation is at a breaking point. We need a clear strategy to deal with this crisis.” The consultancy recently predicted that two Indian airlines would have to shut down in the coming months, owing to the crisis created by the Covid-19 pandemic. Flight operations in India were suspended on March 25 after the nationwide lockdown was imposed. While the international sector continues to remain suspended, domestic flights resumed operations in a restricted manner from May 25. According to aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the domestic air traffic dropped by 83.5% in June in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. A recent DGCA report revealed that Air India, AirAsia India, Vistara and GoAir, which are among the top airline companies in India, witnessed a passenger count of 2.9 lakh, 1.62 lakh, 1.3 lakh and 89,000, respectively in June. An industry expert, who did not wish to be named, said, “If the government does not come up with ways to offer financial help to the airlines, the industry will not be able to rise in the coming years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/aviation-sector-needs-urgent-plan-to-deal-with-crisis-capa-india-asks-government-to-intervene/story-BVIIQ0zciaCz2gUg3AHujJ.html

28-07-2020||Mumbai||10 X-ray mobile vans for screening in housing societies||With residential complexes reporting a sudden surge in the number of Covid-19 cases in the past few weeks, the civic body, in a bid to diagnose more patients from housing societies, has decided to screen residents using X-ray machines. For the purpose, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has procured 10 X-ray mobile vans to detect abnormalities in the chest, owing to the presence of Sars-Cov-2 – the virus that causes Covid-19. The X-ray machines in the vans will be synced for analysis with the radiology department of King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, Parel. “When a person gets screened with an X-ray machine, the X-ray plates will automatically get synced with the radiology department of KEM Hospital. So, there is no need to manually take the reports to the hospital. Doctors from the hospital can easily access all the reports of the patients across the city,” said Ranjit Dhakane, deputy municipal commissioner, BMC. If an X-ray report raises suspicion among doctors, the resident will be tested either through rapid antigen test or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. The 10 vans will visit housing societies that have witnessed the highest number of Covid-19 cases.In May, the civic body had installed 10 such X-ray machines at jumbo centres to detect high-risk contacts of Covid-19 patients as well as and asymptomatic patients. “We have received quite a success in identifying patients with the pathogen of coronavirus at Covid-19 jumbo centres and slums. Now, we will use the same technique for residential areas in containment zones,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. According to doctors, Sars-Cov-2 affects the lungs of patients. Hence, X-rays may help in identifying the virus earlier. The radiological screening of lungs helps in distinguishing Sars-Cov-2 from other respiratory infections. “These scans help in identifying small patchy, translucent white areas in lungs that we call ‘ground glass opacities’ or GGOs. It forms cotton-like white spots in lungs,” said Dr Natasha Nanda, a radiologist from Dr LH Hiranandani Hospital. China, where the virus first broke out and spread to the rest of the world, first started using X-ray as a way to screen suspected individuals and installed the machines in all the fever clinics in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/10-x-ray-mobile-vans-for-screening-in-housing-societies/story-JX1rwZvTPpQpARPCvVFzJO.html

Every year during Bakri Eid, goats are sold at an open ground. However, this year, owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, TMC has allocated a hall at Kausa, for residents to purchase the goats. Mumbra residents have decided to keep the celebrations low-key amid the Covid-19 outbreak. Religious leaders have also requested residents to stay at home and celebrate Eid.“We have ensured strict implementation of lockdown rules within the city. Our officials visited Gulab Park market on Sunday to ensure that the rules are maintained. Shops are kept open based on the odd-even rule. We will soon have a meeting to decide how to ensure that the rules are maintained on the day of Bakri Eid,” said TMC assistant commissioner Mahesh Aher.At the hall in Kausa, authorities have arranged for sanitisers for customers. “We will ensure that everyone adheres to the norms. Only those wearing masks will be allowed to enter. Each of the goats is priced at Rs13,000 to Rs35,000,” said Zameer Surme, manager of the market set-up at Kausa. Mumbra was one of the areas that was struggling to follow the lockdown strictly and had also recorded 547 positive cases in June. Although the figures have come down this month, residents and TMC are ensuring that there is no room for complacency. Meanwhile, Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) has released a circular that stated that there will be no sale of goats at the APMC market in Kalyan, as it is located in a containment zone. “On July 19, it was announced that the market would be kept open ahead of Eid. However, owing to the increasing crowd at the market, we have decided to close it until further notice,” said KDMC commissioner Vijay Suryavanshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tmc-keeps-vigil-on-markets-ahead-of-eid-festivities/story-V9dXeCilkZzBviuz3Wa8uM.html
28-07-2020||Mumbai||Air India pilots seek a meeting with civil aviation minister; Indigo announces second pay cut||After running a campaign against its management on social media, Air India pilots on Monday wrote to civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri, requesting for an urgent meeting to discuss their grievances. Alleging that the officials briefing Puri have “grossly misinformed” him, as the pay cuts in the airline are not across the board, the letter read, “The current industry standard in India is a cut of 15-23% on gross salary i.e. cost to company. However, the Air India management is trying to show cost cutting by slashing cherry picked allowances instead of a fair cut on gross wages (the true cost to company of an employee). They have safeguarded their perks, privileges and entitlements while shifting extreme financial burden on the pilots.’’ Despite repeated attempts, Air India spokesperson did not respond to HT’s calls.The pilots also said that the imbalance in the pay cuts, which were part of a “deliberate and unethical agenda of creating industrial disharmony, reeks of a vested interest and a conspiracy to sabotage the national carrier and derail the privatisation process”. Around 1,800 pilots and more than 2,000 cabin crew members are employed with the national carrier.“We feel that the top management is not aligned with the PMO’s [Prime Minister’s Office] vision of privatisation. They are trying to create unrest and disharmony among employees. The pay cut is not uniform across board, and nowhere close to the market standard,” a senior Air India pilot said. He also claimed that the pilots have written to the aviation minister based on the figures and evidences they have. “Instead of applying genuine cost-saving measures, the top bosses are trying to avoid any pay cuts for themselves, while still retaining their perks such as luxury club memberships, free cars, petrol etc. We would like to connect with the honourable minister directly to apprise him of the matter and also give some real cost-saving suggestions to help the company,” the pilot added. Meanwhile in an internal email, IndiGo, India’s largest airline by market share, announced a second round of pay cuts. The airline’s spokesperson did not respond to HT calls for a comment on the issue.However, HT has accessed the email, in which the airline’s chief executive officer (CEO) Ronojoy Dutta said that the step had to be taken to adjust the airline’s cost structure to the decline in revenues. While Dutta announced a 35% pay cut for himself, the salaries of the senior vice-presidents of the airline will be reduced to 25%, while those of associate vice-presidents to 15%. The pilots will lose 28% of their salaries. Moreover, each department of the airline has been asked to make a monthly decision on the number of employees to be sent on leave without pay. Recently, the airline had also announced to lay off 10% of its employees.In May, IndiGo had announced a pay cut ranging between 5% and 25% till the end of the 2020-21 financial year. The airline had also implemented leave without pay for employees ranging from one-and-a-half days to five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/air-india-pilots-seek-a-meeting-with-civil-aviation-minister-indigo-announces-second-pay-cut/story-1TKgY4XUujbxMmS88tSopJ.html

In a letter sent to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday, the Maharashtra Navnirman Vidyarthi Sena (MNVS) said wrote that many students had made representations to them over the issue. “Students have not got sufficient time to procure their caste validity certificates and will have difficulty in getting them now owing to the travel restrictions during the lockdown. The state should consider this as an unforeseen circumstance and grant provisional admissions to students now. They can be given a year’s time to submit their documents,” said Chetan Pednekar, vice-president MNVS. The student wing of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) has asked the government to give such a relaxation for students for all admissions, including those for junior colleges, undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, for academic year 2020-21 in the state. Officials at the education department said that they would make a representation to the state government in this regard. “We have got such requests from students and shall forward them to the government,” said a senior official.Last year, the education department had decided to allot provisional admissions to students who fall under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) and Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), as the two reservations came into force a few days before the admissions. Students were asked to submit their documents within six months from the time of admission and were granted provisional admissions on the basis of an undertaking signed by them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/allow-students-to-submit-caste-validity-within-a-year-maharashtra-navnirman-vidyarthi-sena/story-3mDQQErspG9gYp5H5cfwdP.html

Former minister Baba Siddique said that though the community has no issues over buying goats online, the trucks and tempos transporting them are not allowed to enter the city. “The Motor Vehicle Act allows transportation of a certain number of animals depending upon the vehicle’s size,” said Siddique, who attended the meet along with his son and legislator Zeeshan. The meeting was held hours after NCP chief Sharad Pawar asked senior ministers to discuss the issue with CM. Some days ago, the state government had issued guidelines over the celebrations. Pawar earlier held a meeting with leaders from the ruling parties, along with Muslim community leaders, on the issue. Sanjay Kumar, director general of police Subodh Jaiswal, Mumbai Police commissioner Sanjay Barve, civic commissioner IS Chahal and other senior officials were also present for the meeting. The state has allowed buying animals online or over phone to avoid crowding. It has further suggested of a ‘symbolic qurbani’ or sacrifice.of animals. Unhappy with the rules, Muslim leaders on Monday met the NCP chief. “There is nothing called “symbolic qurbani [sacrifice]” in Islam and the community should be allowed to follow the practice. Those who have bought animals online should also be allowed to transport them as around 300 trucks carrying animals have been stopped at various borders across the state,” Congress legislator Amin Patel said. “The NCP chief also said that animals should be allowed to be transported as they have been bought following the guidelines,” said a leader, who did not wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-look-into-problems-pertaining-to-eid-festivities-says-maharashtra-cm/story-VTSCpaOP8wBLazRTeX4FVM.html

28-07-2020||City||Mumbai to see more rapid antigen tests||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) plans to procure more rapid antigen kits and increase the number of teams to carry out the aggressive testing in more areas across the city in phases. BMC had procured one lakh kits in the first week of July from a South Korean firm, which was the only company approved by ICMR. On July 2, BMC had announced that it would start rapid antigen tests at five wards with the most Covid-19 cases then – R-North (Dahisar), R-Central (Borivli West), R-South (Kandivli), P-North (Malad) and P-South (Goregaon). However, the plan was later extended to all 24 administrative wards. The civic body has so far tested 17,331 people, of whom, 1,460 have tested positive for Covid-19, with a positivity rate of 8.4%. Senior civic officials said the rapid antigen testing has been getting good response. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “Apart from the frontline staff and shopkeepers, there is a significant number of local citizens approaching health camps for the tests. We are going to procure more rapid antigen test kits in the future. We want to focus on finding maximum Covid positives and quarantine them at our centres. Our immediate plan is to increase the number of testing teams from 34 to 50 and take one ward at a time. This will help cover more areas quickly.” Rapid antigen kits deliver test results within 15-20 minutes, but are less sensitive compared to RT-PCR tests.

28-07-2020||Chandigarh||PEC’s online semester gets mixed response from students||Online semester conducted by Punjab Engineering College (PEC) Chandigarh, deemed to be a University, has garnered a mixed response from students. PEC had earlier decided that classes will go online for the first semester of 2020-21 academic sessions as no classes will be held in person due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Many students said that there were few technical glitches during virtual classes. Bhaviya Chopra, a student of electronic and communication engineering said, “There were some technical glitches during a class. I hope this will be streamlined in the coming days.”PEC has recommended Google classroom to teachers for taking online classes but some liberty has also been given to them for choosing the platform. PEC has also offered accommodation to students who have poor internet access, to facilitate online teaching.“Overall the experience was good. I think more time should be given to students to clear their doubts,” said Harinder Singh, a fourth-year, electronics and communication engineering student.PEC director Dheeraj Sanghi said, “If any student is facing issues during online classes, they can approach me and we will try to solve their problems.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pec-s-online-semester-gets-mixed-response-from-students/story-0z96WdDBiUr6S1oJvCXOGM.html

In their letter, they had stated that the request to stop the election process is nothing but to impede the democratic process of the senate election.Other senators have also written to the chancellor demanding that elections be held as per schedule.Navdeep Goyal said, “Over 50% election process has already been carried out. Members from various constituencies have filed their nominations as well, so there is no point in rescheduling the senate elections now.”PU senator Varinder Singh Gill, who wants the elections to be rescheduled said, “We had also taken opinion from the fellows in Delhi, Punjab and Chandigarh and they feel that senate elections should be rescheduled taking into account the high risk of Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/groups-at-loggerheads-over-conducting-senate-polls-at-panjab-university/story-QXOt2n95yKXGKJTzI9L82J.html

28-07-2020||Mumbai||State setting up hospital in city to tackle future outbreaks: CM||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday said the Maharashtra government is setting up a jumbo hospital in or around Mumbai to counter virus outbreaks in the future, which will be equipped with facilities for research, treatment and vaccine development. He said the government was also planning an immunology laboratory and research centre in the city. The CM has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi for supporting the jumbo hospital project in the city.Speaking during the online inauguration of the state-of-the-art testing facility in Mumbai by Modi, Thackeray said Covid-19 would not be the final virus for the world and that governments should be prepared for more outbreaks in the next two to five years. “The coronavirus has not attacked us all of a sudden. We have been facing various viruses in the last eight to 10 years and those were indications for us human beings. The attacks of SARS, H1N1, Ebola, Zika in the last few years were underestimated by us. To be prepared for more such attacks in the future, we are planning the hospital and research centre with the hope that we will not go through the same ‘pause’ mode we are in now,” Thackeray said.Thackeray also requested Modi to continue supply of N95 masks and PPE kits even after September. “We have been aggressively tracking patients through our ‘chase the virus’ mantra and have been treating them at our jumbo facilities. Our jumbo facility at Mumbai was set up in just 20 days. More such facilities are coming up in other cities like Pune. I will request the Centre to continue the supply of masks and PPE kits even after the September deadline,” he said.Maharashtra has 2,665 Covid-19 dedicated centres and hospitals with 3.06 lakh isolation beds, 42,813 oxygen and 11,882 ICU beds.

They have paid for the kits procured from the manufacturing unit in Manesar. Five to six other companies have also approached us to provide Covid-19 testing kits under their CSR funds. Also, state government will be allocating new kits,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer of the district. A group of more than 20 companies — Gurugram Covid-19 Volunteers Group — that are running the Medeor Hospital in Manesar as designated Covid-19 hospital for patients requiring tertiary care, have now contributed almost Rs 50 lakh in providing the testing kits to the health department.The group comprises business leaders from McKinsey, MakeMyTrip, DLF, Harvest Gold, Nestle, Medanta-The Medicity, Clix Capital, Sembcorp, Renew Power, SRF Foundation, Tech Mahindra, Egon Zender among others, said Latika Thukral, co-founder, IamGurugram, a city-based NGO.

28-07-2020||Delhi||SDMC introduces professional tax, doubles levy on rented commercial property||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Monday passed the proposal to levy a professional tax on self-employed persons — a first for Delhi — and doubled the tax on rented commercial property. The municipal body also announced hike in tax on transfer of property in new tax proposals aimed at ramping up revenue collection hit by the national lockdown to contain spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The Aam Aadmi Party, which is in the Opposition in the SDMC House, threatened to launch an agitation against the move and called the introduction of a new tax and hike in other levies “inhuman”. AAP Delhi convenor and cabinet minister Gopal Rai said the move exposes the “anti-people mindset” of the BJP. He said the BJP should immediately release a white paper on the money spent by the municipal corporations.An SDMC officials said the professional tax would be levied on self-employed professionals such as doctors, lawyers, chartered accountants and architects, etc and those working in private firms for using civic amenities. As per the proposed tax slabs (see graphic), those earning less than Rs 50,000 per month won’t be taxed. Since it is a new tax, the proposal will now have to be cleared by the Delhi government before it is implemented. The SDMC House also approved the proposal to double the property tax on rented commercial property as per the recommendations of the municipal valuation committee-3 (MVC-3). The amount of tax will depend on the location of the property. “Under SDMC jurisdiction, there are around 9,000 to 10,000 commercial properties that have been rented out. So we hope to generate a revenue of Rs 90 crore to Rs 100 crore per annum. The move will not impact residential and commercial properties that are being run by the owners,” said Narendra Chawla, leader of the house in SDMC.For instance, the current commercial tax payable by a 83.6-square metre shop in a locality such as Defence Colony or South Extension is Rs 25,333. But if the shop is a rented property, then the owner will now have to pay Rs 50,666 as tax.The SDMC House, however, deferred the proposal to increase the electricity tax from the current 5% on the bill amount to 6%. The South corporation also approved hike in the tax on transfer of property. SDMC officials explained that the hike would be applicable on only those properties that have a circle rate of more than Rs 25 lakh. As per the new proposal, the transfer duty will now go up to 4%in case of male buyers from the current 3%; and to 3% from the current 2% for female buyers. “We hope to generate Rs 20 crore additional revenue with this move. We are not able to pay our doctors, engineers, sanitation workers, teachers, etc due to fund crunch. We have been compelled to take these tough steps as the Delhi government did not pay us our due amount of Rs 1300 crore as per fifth finance commission recommendations,” Chawla said.Senior AAP leader Durgesh Pathak, however, said the Delhi government owes no dues to the municipal bodies. He said the corporations in fact are receiving more money from the Delhi government under the AAP dispensation. The SDMC has also announced waiver of property tax for residents of unauthorised colonies between 2004 and 2018, if they pay house tax dues for 2019-20 and 2020-21.Anamika Mithilesh, SDMC mayor, said, “Due to Covid-19 pandemic, our financial condition has worsened, so we have decided to levy professional tax and hike tax rates in certain other categories. Professional tax will bring additional revenue of Rs 25 crore to the cash-strapped SDMC.” Professionals working in south Delhi, however, said that it would put additional burden on their pockets. “During the Covid-19 crisis, any additional tax will make hit the professionals hard since they are already reeling under pay cuts and job losses. Authorities at this juncture should be announcing allowances for them and schemes to help their businesses. The decision to levy a professional tax at this juncture is irrational,” said Shaunali Nanda, an architect, who runs an interior design business in Andrews Ganj.Dr Akanksha Singh, a gynaecologist who has a clinic in Lajpat Nagar, also criticised the move and said that when people were already struggling to pay so many different taxes, a new tax makes no sense. “Coronavirus pandemic has already broken the backbone of many professionals be it self-employed people or the service class. People are going through a lot of problems due to Covid-19 and imposing one more tax will only make things worse. They levy tax but do not do their job properly which is evident in Delhi roads get flooding every monsoon. Who is responsible for this?” she said.The new tax proposals triggered a political slugfest in the BJP-ruled corporation.The AAP threatened to take to the streets to protest the SDMC’s decision. Addressing a digital press conference, senior AAP leader Durgesh Pathak and Sangam Vihar MLA Dinesh Mohaniya said SDMC went ahead with the ‘triple tax burden’ despite Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta assuring on Sunday that no taxes would be increased.“The SDMC’s decision to impose three new taxes today is a price people will pay for the corruption of BJP councillors. Yesterday we opposed the BJP-ruled SDMC’s decision to hike taxes. The BJP wanted to increase professional tax, tax of residents of unauthorised colonies, property transfer tax and electricity tax. After strong opposition from AAP, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta intervened and tweeted he had spoken to the SDMC mayor and requested him to withdraw the tax hike proposals. But unfortunately, today, the tax proposals were accepted. This means now the people of South Delhi will have to pay extra tax to SDMC,” Pathak said. Mithilesh said the professional tax slabs and 1% increase in transfer duty had been designed in a manner that it would not cost trouble the public. “We have taken these initiatives to increase our revenue so that we can pay our employees and serve better. Due to the pandemic, our financial condition has worsened and we are unable to pay our employees. AAP believes in blame-game politics. If AAP is so concerned about taxes, they should ask their government to clear our dues so that the corporations can function properly,” she said.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta did not reply to the calls and text message sent to him for comment on the matter.Mohaniya said when the BJP came up with the tax proposal, the Congress supported the decision inside the house whereas AAP immediately staged a walkout.In response, the Congress called AAP a ‘B-Team of the BJP’. Abhishek Dutt, vice-president of the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee said, “AAP is the B-team of the BJP. The AAP councillors walked out because they knew it very well that by walking out, the agenda will be passed. In fact, the Congress’ councillors stood in the House till the very end and objected to all agenda points.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sdmc-introduces-professional-tax-doubles-levy-on-rented-commercial-property/story-2m6w81l1aaKFeHYeLm0GsM.html
28-07-2020||Delhi||Kejriwal launches job portal to help boost Delhi’s economy, allows street vendors to operate||In a bid to revive Delhi’s economy, hit by the three-month nationwide Covid-19 lockdown, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday launched a job portal named ‘Rozgaar Bazaar’ and allowed all street vendors and hawkers in the city to resume their businesses. Addressing a digital press briefing, Kejriwal said the web portal will bridge the gap between job-seekers and employers and help boost the economy from the impact of the lockdown. “The people of Delhi have successfully fought Corona in the last three months. Now we have to move to the next stage, which is the economy. In this pandemic, many have lost their jobs, shops, other businesses, and factories were shut down. Many suffered from hunger. Even though the government arranged for their food during the lockdown, people need jobs. Businesses, shops and factories want to reopen, but they are not getting adequate workers. This is where our new web portal will help,” he said. The chief minister said hawkers and street vendors will now be allowed to operate from 10 am to 8 pm every day. He said it will be mandatory for them to ensure social distancing and take all other precautionary measures to avoid the spread of Covid-19. The order issued by chief secretary Vijay Dev stated that this system will initially be in place for a week, and its extension will be subject to compliance with Covid norms of social distancing, sanitising, not spitting in public and wearing masks. The order also made it clear that in Delhi, weekly markets will continue to be prohibited.“Due to some confusion, street vendors were not allowed to work. The Delhi government is now taking out special orders, under which the street vendors and hawkers will be allowed to operate their businesses,” Kejriwal said. The web portal -- jobs.delhi.gov.in -- allows job providers to recruit people and job-seekers to apply for multiple employment opportunities without having to pay a fee. Within the first six hours since the launch of the web portal at 12 noon on Monday, 51,403 job-seekers had registered and 1,071 employers had posted 18,585 vacancies. The biggest demand in terms of application received was for data entry operators (17,527), followed by teaching (7,567) and sales/marketing/business development roles (7,429), which also was the category with the highest number of vacancies (11,367) posted by employers. Around 1,298 job roles were for construction works, 1,051 for accountants and 1,030 for delivery persons.Kejriwal appealed to traders, industrialists, NGOs, and the media to join hands to revive Delhi’s economy. Employment minister Gopal Rai said a visitor will have to select between two options on the portal. “If you are looking for a job, choose the ‘I want a job’ option and if you are looking for an employee, choose the ‘I want staff’ option. Enter your 10-digit mobile number to register yourself, and get an OTP number. Enter the OTP on the screen. If you are looking for a job, choose the job categories of your interest, and create your profile by filling in the information requested in the form. Jobs matching your interest will be displayed. Click on the job of your choice and contact your employer by WhatsApp or call.” “Any employer you contact will be enlisted in your application list. With the ‘My Profile’ option, you can update your profile and you can log out,” he said. “If you are looking for an employee, please give all the information related to the job posting and your company. All the employment opportunities you post will be visible on the ‘My Jobs’ option. Whenever a person wishing to work will apply to your posted job, you will see it under ‘My Jobs’,” Rai explained. Kejriwal said shops, professionals, industries, construction companies, etc., are not able to find the required manpower to restart. “Many migrant workers had left for their homes during the lockdown.

28-07-2020||Pune||Next on administration’s radar - to bring nursing homes in Covid-19 network||After having taken control of the majority of beds from large private hospitals, the district administration now has nursing homes on their radar to bring them into Covid-19 network.Officials from district administration on Monday held a meeting with representatives of Indian Medical Association (IMA), management of nursing homes, doctors and nursing bureaus to discuss with them the possibility of bringing their facilities in Covid-19 network as part of boosting health infrastructure to tackle the pandemic.According to Officer on Special Duty at Pune Divisional Commissionerate Saurabh Rao, there are around 700 small, medium and large nursing homes in the city of which around 100 are already are a part of the fight against Covid-19.“In today’s (Monday’s) meeting, we discussed the feasibility of bringing remaining nursing homes in Covid-19 network in our fight against the virus. We cannot bring all nursing homes into Covid-19 grid given that there are multiple challenges including treatment of non-covid patients. We are therefore exploring how many beds from some nursing homes can be used for Covid-19 patients,” said Rao.During the meeting, which came days after government constituted infra-task force, doctors from nursing homes and nursing bureaus raised issues including weekly offs and duty hours. “They basically wanted clarity on rules with the demand that those rules should be at par with government hospitals,” said Rao.Apart from the nursing home, the task force also discussed the possibility of bringing in PMC-run hospitals in Covid-19 network. According to Rao, the general practitioners association has over 600 members who have offered their services to private as well as government hospitals.The PMC has already taken control over 80 per cent beds from big hospitals in the city. Despite this, there have been complaints about the shortage of beds as the number of critical patients are goring while many from other districts are also coming to Pune for treatment.Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has projected that by August 31, there will be a shortage of 1,982 ventilators, 4.065 ICU beds without Oxygen, 7084 beds isolation beds with oxygen considering the rise of critical patients in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/next-on-administration-s-radar-to-bring-nursing-homes-in-covid-19-network/story-DCKYF6LFv3bzsXIcIsyS6N.html
28-07-2020||Pune||Pune to have three jumbo Covid care facilities soon||Pune will have three jumbo Covid care facilities soon, with a total capacity of 2,400 beds, it was decided on Monday, at a review meeting chaired by deputy chief minister and Pune guardian minister Ajit Pawar. As the number of Covid-19 patients are increasing and critical patients are not getting access to beds immediately in private hospitals, Pawar instructed the administration to create a total of three facilities.Already, an 800-bed facility is coming up at the Balewadi sports complex.The review meeting was attended by the district administration’s top brass involved in managing the Covid-19 pandemic in Pune, including the collector, the divisional commissioner and the police commissioner Saurabh Rao, officer on special duty at the divisional commissioner’s officer, said, “It has been decided to create three jumbo Covid care facilities which would be temporarily hospitals dedicated to critical Covid care. Each facility would have 800 beds. Of the 800 beds, 600 are oxygenated beds and 200 are ICU beds.”Rao said, “PMRDA is erecting one facility at Balewadi. The other two facilities would come up in city areas. Four places have been identified, but considering the infrastructure like water and electricity, the administration still has to finalise the locations. Right now, the locations under consideration are AIMISS college, Sanas Ground, College of Engineering Pune and Sangvi.”Divisional Commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar said, “It is decided that the contractor would provide man power for the jumbo facilities. The administration is also upgrading Sassoon hospital. The expression of interest for two of the jumbo facilities will be published very soon.”Mhaisekar added, “July-end and August is critical. We are considering the worst-case scenarios as per various forecasts for doing the planning. As instructed by the guardian minister, we are preparing the infrastructure by considering the maximum critical patients and trying to give treatment to each patient.”Police Commissioner K Venkatesham said, “Administration is doing their duty, but citizens also need to take care. Citizens must need to keep social distance and wear masks. Citizens need to come out only if it is necessary and important.”Ajit Pawar said that the government would erect the infrastructure, but the city needs to take care of the manpower. Pawar instructed the administration to co-ordinate with medical universities and asked all medical students studying in their final year to join the medical corps involved in the Covid fight, for which a stipend would be provided.Box 1Cases in rural areas on the rise: collectorDistrict collector Naval Kishore Ram said that along with Pune, the number of cases in Pune’s rural districts are increasing. “Cases are increasing mainly in Haveli taluka and villages near the Pune. A large number of people from these areas are coming to the city or going to nearby industrial areas. The district administration cannot seal the rural areas completely,” Naval Kishore Ram said, adding that, for example, 1,500 residents of Manjri are working at the Serum institute. “How can the administration execute a strict lockdown in these villages? Rural areas have a scarcity of doctors but we are deputing more medical manpower,” he said.Box 2Keep watch on bills issued by private hospitals: PawarGuardian minister Ajit Pawar instructed the administration to keep a strict vigil on bills being issued by private hospitals and the cross-check the same. “Complaints are coming in that private hospitals are charging Covid patients exorbitant bills. If necessary, take action against the concerned hospitals,” Pawar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-to-have-three-jumbo-covid-care-facilities-soon/story-hDv8s89AhE90oGuFZPV0WO.html
28-07-2020||Pune||Pune’s Sassoon reports case of vertical transmission of Sars-Cov-2 virus from mother to new-born||BJ Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital in the city has reported a case of vertical transmission of Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection, from a mother to her baby, which doctors claim is the first such case in the country.The baby girl was delivered by the 22-year-old mother at the hospital on May 27.Vertical transmission involves the passing of the virus from a female vector to her offspring, both males and females.According to officials of the hospital, although the mother had tested negative for the virus in the RT-PCR test, the virus was detected in the baby’s nasopharyngeal swab, placenta and umbilical cord, which confirmed that the transmission was vertical.Dr Aarti Kinikar, head, paediatric department, said, “We had tested the mother for Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection through RT-PCR and she had tested negative. The baby, however, started showing symptoms like fever, lethargy and other signs of Covid-19, along with abnormal blood tests suggesting severe inflammation. The baby required intensive care, but recovered completely over a period of three weeks.”“The mother had a fever the day before the delivery and also signs of weakness which we presumed to be due to pregnancy,” she said.She further said, “Although she tested negative for the virus, she did transmit the infection in the child. However, after four weeks when we did an antibodies test, there was evidence of Covid-19 infection by a strong antibody response. It is possible that she recovered on her own. This was a very challenging case for us.”Dr Kinikar added that such confirmed cases have been reported in some cases in China and one case in the UK.Dr Murlidhar Tambe, dean, Sassoon General Hospital, said, “This is the first case report of vertical transmission from India. I congratulate the faculty and team members from all the concerned departments who have worked hard to treat the baby and the mother.”In an official statement, the hospital stated that the impact of Covid-19 in pregnant women and babies is still not known to the full extent. Vertical infection is well documented in the Zika virus and HIV.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sassoon-reports-case-of-vertical-transmission-of-sars-cov-2-virus-from-mother-to-new-born/story-9TuTCJff10vBOaFdaH5ftO.html

28-07-2020||Delhi||Cinema halls in Delhi gear up to resume operations||While the Centre is yet to take a final call on when to allow cinema halls to resume operations, multiplexes are putting measures in place to ensure the safety of moviegoers.From paperless tickets and online bookings to staggered seating and show timings, multiplexes have prepared detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure social distancing to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Multiplexes have been shut since March 12 in Delhi due to the pandemic.Most cinema halls, especially multiplexes, are doing away with the system of issuing paper tickets at the counters. All bookings will be done online, even those who walk into the theatres can book tickets online using QR codes.Gautam Dutta, CEO, PVR Cinemas, said, “In order to minimise human contact, digital transactions have been enabled via e-wallets and other online aggregators…To facilitate paperless movie ticket purchases at the box office, QR codes that can be scanned to enter the cinema will now be sent to customers’ phones.”The seating arrangement will be staggered depending on the Centre’s guidelines. Most halls plan to leave one seat between individuals while others are planning to leave one seat between two distinct bookings. They also plan to rework show timings in such a way that intermissions and endings don’t clash.Rajiv Patni, COO, INOX Leisure Ltd, said, “From a distancing perspective, we already have our back-end algorithm ready, which would leave a seat’s gap between two distinct bookings. Our shows will be programmed in such a manner that there are no simultaneous entries, intermissions or exits.”Most multiplexes are planning to do away with frisking individuals at the entrance. But they will be screened using thermal scanners and it will be mandatory for people to wear masks.People can order food online, but they will have to go to the counter to collect it, as most multiplexes are planning to discontinue delivery services inside the hall to minimise contact.To ensure a safe environment inside the halls, there is a detailed plan to sanitise them after each show. Devang Sampat, CEO, Cinepolis India and director of the multiplexes association of India, said, “Touchpoints such as handrails and door handles will be sanitised before, during and after each show. Seats will be sanitised after each show. After each show, row-wise exit in a social distanced manner will be facilitated by our staff. Our washrooms will also be sanitised and disinfected every two hours and cleaned throughout the day.”For the safety of its staff, PPE kits with masks, gloves and sanitiser will be provided to each employee. “Employees will share their Aarogya Setu status prior to entry, on a daily basis. They will also be thermally screened at the entrance and provided new face masks for safety,” said Sampat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cinema-halls-in-delhi-gear-up-to-resume-operations/story-fYp6GZCw9r5gq1dxqUxP9H.html
28-07-2020||Delhi||Debris dumped on Yamuna floodplains and river bed, NGT asks pollution body to file report||The National Green Tribunal (NGT)-appointed Yamuna Monitoring Committee has asked the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) to submit a report on the dumping of waste, including material used for manufacturing face masks, and construction debris at two sites on the Yamuna floodplains that could be “constricting” the flow of the river.The waste has been dumped underneath the Signature Bridge and the Sarai Kale Khan flyover. NGT asked for the report after an NGO, South Asian Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP), posted pictures and videos of the dump on the floodplains.As per an NGT order of 2015, any kind of dumping of waste or construction and demolition debris in and around the floodplains is prohibited. Anyone who is found violating the order is liable to pay an environmental compensation charge of up to ₹50,000 under the ‘polluter pays’ principle.A team of DPCC environmental engineers inspected the two sites on Monday. “We are inspecting the sites for the violations both on the floodplains as well as the river bed. We may continue till Tuesday, after which we will be able to submit a report,” said a senior DPCC official, who did not wish to be named.According to activists who flagged the issue, discarded material used for making face masks was dumped on the floodplains beneath the Signature Bridge.“Besides, there is a 3-4 foot tall mound of debris on the floodplains, some of which has toppled into the river bed underneath the Sarai Kale Khan bridge. There is so much debris that an active river channel is now disconnected from the main river. The debris was dumped recently by government agencies, which have been engaged in construction activity around the river,” said Bhim Singh Rawat of SANDRP.He added that the situation regarding bridges on Yamuna river in Delhi is alarming as so far 25 road bridges, including three barrages-cum-bridges, four Metro bridges and two railway bridges have come up on the river while the debris has continuously been dumped on the floodplains. It is cleared after much effort and resurfaces with every new construction.The two-member Yamuna Monitoring Committee comprising former Delhi chief secretary Shailaja Chandra and retired expert member BS Sajwan said it has ordered an inspection and a detailed report is awaited. “We have asked DPCC to examine the issue in detail and submit a report to us,” a member of the committee said.Earlier this year also, debris had been dumped underneath the Nizamuddin Bridge and the committee had asked the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), which is the primary custodian of the floodplains to clear the floodplains of the debris. “DDA is responsible for preventing any kind of dumping on the floodplains. They had earlier told us that CCTV cameras have been installed and security personnel deployed to prevent such violations,” the member said.The DDA spokesperson did not respond to request for comment.In April 2019, the NGT committee had questioned the public works department (PWD), the Delhi Tourism department and Transport Development Corporate Ltd (DTTDC), the government agencies responsible for the construction and management of the Signature Bridge, about the dumping of construction debris into the river, affecting its flow. The agencies were also fined for the violations.Manoj Misra, the convenor of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, said that dumping of construction debris has been continuing unabated despite NGT orders and needs to be stopped immediately to save the river. “Unfortunately, government agencies have been dumping debris on the floodplains time and again, which is capable of altering the flow of the river. NGT must take a strong view in the matter and ensure dumping is prevented at any cost,” said Misra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/debris-dumped-on-yamuna-floodplains-and-river-bed-ngt-asks-pollution-body-to-file-report/story-wJLT8KRyHIghwj856gYI4N.html

28-07-2020||Pune||Hyacinth menace breeds mosquitoes as PMC waters down the issue||Pune: The Covid situation has impacted various civic works in the city, including removal of hyacinth from water bodies. Lack of coordination between Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) health department and transport department over the removal of the dangerous invasive plant has left residents living on the banks of lakes complain about increase of mosquito intensity in their localities. In May, PMC under former civic chief Shekhar Gaikwad had decided to hand over the hyacinth removal work to transport department as the health department was busy tackling the coronavirus situation. The surface of Mula-Mutha riverbed, Nanasaheb Peshwe lake, Sarasbaug Peshwe Park lake, Pashan lake and the Mula-Mutha stretch from Sangamwadi till Mundhwa Jackwell project are covering up with hyacinth. As a standard practice, hyacinth is removed before monsoon by the health department with the help from regional ward offices. Though the transport department was tasked with the removal process, the release of tender has ran into issues leading to the department asking its health counterpart to complete the task. Officials of the transport department, on condition of anonymity, said that the department had agreed to only provide vehicles and equipment for the removal of hyacinth, while the main responsibility lay with the health department. However, the health department officials maintained that the onus laid with the transport department for keeping water bodies clean. RTI activist Vijay Kumbhar alleged that the hyacinth tender is a moneymaking exercise. “Whatever be the crisis, work at the corporation for the benefit of citizens’ health must not be stopped, ignored or delayed. Water hyacinth could cause many health issues for residents and it is harmful to the aquatic life. PMC should have completed the cleaning task before monsoon,” he said. Pashan resident Satish Pande said, “This year too, hyacinth removal work has been delayed, and Covid-19 situation has added to our woes. Residents have reported of suffering from fever and dengue,” he said. Despite many attempts, PMC health chief Ramchandra Hankare could not be reached as his phone was switched off. Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol said that the civic body will ensure that the hyacinth is removed at the earliest. “Our health department has a big task to handle. Hence, we will take help from different departments to address this issue,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hyacinth-menace-breeds-insects-as-pmc-waters-down-the-issue/story-em00pnWc9Pd1S0SJkkM84J.html

28-07-2020||World||Inflation threat looms for Dollar as reserve currency, Goldman warns||Goldman Sachs Group Inc. put a spotlight on the suddenly growing concern over inflation in the U.S. by issuing a bold warning Tuesday that the dollar is in danger of losing its status as the world’s reserve currency.With Congress closing in on another round of fiscal stimulus to shore up the pandemic-ravaged economy, and the Federal Reserve having already swelled its balance sheet by about $2.8 trillion this year, Goldman strategists cautioned that U.S. policy is triggering currency “debasement fears” that could end the dollar’s reign as the dominant force in global foreign-exchange markets.While that view is clearly still a minority one in most financial circles -- and the Goldman analysts don’t say they believe it will necessarily happen -- it captures a nervous vibe that has infiltrated the market this month: Investors worried that this money-printing will trigger inflation in years ahead have been bailing out of the dollar and piling furiously into gold.“Gold is the currency of last resort, particularly in an environment like the current one where governments are debasing their fiat currencies and pushing real interest rates to all-time lows,” wrote Goldman strategists including Jeffrey Currie. There are now, they said, “real concerns around the longevity of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency.”The Goldman report makes clear that Wall Street’s initial reluctance to sound the alarm on inflation back when the pandemic began is fading. Having been burned badly by ominous forecasts of runaway price gains following the fiscal and monetary stimulus that followed the 2008 financial crisis, many analysts have been hesitant to repeat such calls now, especially as the economy sinks into a deep recession.But with gold surging to record highs and bond investors’ inflation expectations climbing almost daily, albeit from very low levels, the debate on the long-term effects of stimulus has gotten louder.The 10-year breakeven rate, the gap between nominal and inflation-linked debt yields, has risen to about 1.51%, up from as low as 0.47% in March. That’s seen real yields, which strip out the impact of inflation, plunge further below zero -- to about -0.92% on similar-maturity bonds.Adding to the upward pressure on inflation expectations are forecasts that the Fed will soon link guidance on the policy rate to prices. That would provide at least some temporary space for inflation to run above the central bank’s 2% target.“The resulting expanded balance sheets and vast money creation spurs debasement fears,” the analysts at Goldman wrote. This creates “a greater likelihood that at some time in the future, after economic activity has normalized, there will be incentives for central banks and governments to allow inflation to drift higher to reduce the accumulated debt burden,” they said.Gold’s record-breaking rally highlights growing concern over the world economy. Goldman raised its 12-month forecast for gold to $2300 an ounce from $2000 an ounce previously. That compares with a value of around $1930 currently. The bank sees U.S. real interest rates continuing to drift lower, boosting gold further.Meanwhile, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is on course for its worst July in a decade. The drop comes amid renewed calls for the dollar’s demise following a game-changing rescue package from the European Union deal, which spurred the euro and will lead to jointly issued debt.Of course, people have been wrong-footed in calling for the dollar’s demise for years -- including when the Fed was aggressively easing in the wake of the 2008 crisis.The ICE U.S. Dollar Index hasn’t had more than three constitutive years of annual declines since the early 1970s. That’s in part because there are few viable alternatives to dollar assets such as Treasuries, the world’s biggest bond market with nearly $20 trillion outstanding.The dollar is used in 88% of all currency trades, according to the latest triennial Bank for International Settlements survey. And it still accounts for about 62% of the world’s foreign-exchange reserves, although that’s down from a peak of more than 85% in the 1970s, IMF data showRichard Franulovich, head of FX strategy at Westpac Banking Corp., says that while Europe’s plans to finance stimulus via bond issuance is a plus for the euro, it won’t materially dampen the dollar’s dominance.“The USD’s position won’t be fundamentally challenged,” he wrote in a report this week.Ballooning Debt PileFor Goldman, the growing level of debt in the U.S. -- which now exceeds 80% of the nation’s gross domestic product -- and elsewhere, boosts the risk that central banks and governments may allow inflation to accelerate.Investors are poised to hear more about the Fed’s view on inflation with its latest policy decision Wednesday.“Until we get through the Fed, the dollar could strengthen as investors lock in profits,” Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda Corp. said in a note.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/inflation-threat-looms-for-dollar-as-reserve-currency-goldman-warns/story-VlSo7aKz1PGBH4Mme5jIIL.html
28-07-2020||World||High time for world to question China’s genocide of Uyghurs, says activist||As China blatantly continues to commit crimes against the Uyghurs in the name of homogenisation, the global community has only now realised the way Beijing used the global war on terror post 9/11 attacks as a pretext to carry out the elimination of the ethnic clan.The irony is not lost on the Uyghur community that the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and all Muslim-majority countries, in particular, are displaying absolutely no interest in the welfare of the Uyghur Muslims, as they are also victims of China’s massive campaign of lies. It is essential that Islamic countries, and our Muslim brothers and sisters, wake up and stand with us before they also become enslaved as our people are. Uyghurs today are a picture of what could be the future for them as China is waging war on Islam and announcing to the world that they are re-writing the Holy Qur’an. The Campaign For Uyghurs compiled a report last week named “China’s Genocide in East Turkistan - referred to as the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region by the Chinese government. This report lays out how each condition of genocide as defined by the United Nations is being met by the Chinese regime’s actions towards the Uyghurs. There must be greater recognition of the need to label these atrocities as what they are: Genocide. The report includes numerous case studies of Uyghurs being forced out of their homes and thrown into concentration camps. Women and children are special targets of the Chinese officials as they attempt to bring down the Uyghur population. Women are subjected to forced sterilisations. According to the news reports, Communist Party cadres are appointed to live inside of the Uyghur homes under a “pair up family” program to supervise the family. For most women, whose husbands are in the concentration camps or prisons, making them subject to sexual abuse, as many of these Chinese men have been photographed and filmed sharing their beds. There are also reports that more than 500,000 Uyghur children are sent to state-run orphanages. There they are made to forget their habits and religion, their identities, and their language. The homes vacated by the Uyghurs are given to Han Chinese from other parts of China who migrate to our homeland. They are given jobs, money and other preferential treatment in order to change the demographics while the Uyghurs are transferring out to be used as slave labour across China in the excuse of “unemployment”.The United Nations should set up an independent commission, preferably in consultation with the International Court of Justice, to physically probe the atrocities against Uyghurs. There are many necessary actions to be taken, and we must remember that this is not just the calamity of the Uyghurs, it is a test for humanity. As China continues to push the limits of what atrocities it can get away with, the civilized nations of the world must defeat a common enemy, which is in this case, the worldview of the Chinese regime that justifies the use of concentration camps and slavery, making this acceptable, and even rewarded behaviour in the modern age, by hosting the 2022 Olympic Winter games.We must no longer perpetuate the belief that decoupling from China is costly. What is the cost of human life? What is the cost of an entire ethnicity, my people? On the contrary, it is too costly to continue to have any cordial relationship with China! 13 tons of hair, perhaps but a portion of what is being taken from prisoners, seized recently, a product of this genocide. How can this image not pierce our conscience? Is this the hair of my sister? Who is benefiting from my sister’s forced labour? We know what this hair represents, a very physical representation of never again happening again. We must act now before the only voice left to speak is one of regret.My sister Dr Gulshan Abbas was taken as a victim for my activism in the US, and her daughters, American citizens, haven’t had any information on her whereabouts since September 2018. Yet, I am the one repeatedly smeared by China’s state media.China may buy the corrupt hearts of men. They may threaten, they may punish, they may smear our names and remove earthly possessions, but they will never succeed in silencing us. Will you hear us?

28-07-2020||World||‘Second wave’ coronavirus fears strike blow to tourism industry||Concerns over a “second wave” of coronavirus infections brought on by returning holidaymakers is wreaking havoc across Europe’s tourism industry, particularly in Spain, following Britain’s effective ban on travel to the country.In a move that reflects the continent’s piecemeal approach to keeping the virus at bay, the British government has recommended against all but essential travel to the whole of Spain following an upswing in new infections.As part of the new stricter approach to travel to the country, all travelers arriving in Britain from that country will have to undergo a 14-day quarantine.“I’m afraid you are starting to see in some places the signs of a second wave of the pandemic,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Tuesday in defending his government’s new travel advice.“I’m afraid if we do see signs of a second wave in other countries, it is really our job, our duty, to act swiftly and decisively,” he added.The move has not only dashed the hopes of many British holidaymakers for a getaway this summer, but also fanned renewed uncertainty within Europe’s tourism industry over how to plan ahead amid authorities’ responses to new COVID-19 outbreaks.Johnson indicated that there could be further changes to the government’s travel advice for other holiday destinations in Europe.Germany also tightened its travel advice for Spain, but did not go as far as the U.K. Instead, it is advising against travel to the northeastern regions of Catalonia, Aragón, and Navarra.The head of Germany’s national disease control center also warned of “really, really worrying” developments over the last two weeks amid a resurgence of virus outbreaks.Robert Koch Institute chief Lothar Wieler pointed to “a lot of small outbreaks in various places at the same time” that are becoming more frequent.Wieler urged his country’s citizens not to let their guard down and to stick to social distancing, hygiene and mask-wearing rules that “must never be questioned,” after new studies showed that people have become more complacent about Covid-19.“We don’t know if this is the beginning of a second wave, but of course it could be. It would begin with rising figures,” Wieler said. “If we all keep to these rules, I am still optimistic that we can prevent this.”Britain’s new travel advice prompted holiday companies TUI UK and Jet2 to suspend flights to Spain, which is traditionally the most popular summer destination for British vacationers.“The U.K. government must work closely with the travel industry as this level of uncertainty and confusion is damaging for business and disappointing for those looking forward to a well-deserved break,” TUI UK said in a statement.The U.K. has the highest official coronavirus death toll in Europe, with nearly 46,000 deaths. One of the reasons cited for that is that many travelers brought the virus back during the February school break after skiing trips in France, Italy and Spain.Professor Keith Neal, an epidemiologist at the University of Nottingham said it makes sense to advise against travel to Spain during the summer holiday season.“Some people have criticized the lack of notice, but with cases rising any delay would only increase cases in the U.K,” he added.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called the new recommendation “a mistake,” saying that the upsurge in new COVID-19 cases is only focused in the regions of Catalonia and Aragón, and is much less severe than the number of cases reported in the U.K.Sanchez spoke as figures were released showing that his country lost more than a million jobs in the second quarter of this year. Spain’s official statistics agency INE said that most of the 1.07 million lost jobs were in the service sector, with the worst-hit areas being Catalonia, Andalusia and Madrid.Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Ayala tried to strike a conciliatory tone, saying that Madrid is trying to get the British government to concentrate on the scientific data, since the outbreaks are contained in specific areas within Spain, while coronavirus infection rates on the country’s vacation islands are much lower than in the U.K.Spain is still in talks with the British government, “trying to find a solution which meets epidemiological criteria,” Ayala told a press conference in Athens during an official visit to Greece Tuesday.Meanwhile, Madrid’s regional government made the use of face masks mandatory in all public areas and limited the number of people that can gather in one place, part of a drive to curb new coronavirus outbreaks.Regional government head Isabel Díaz Ayuso said that no more than 10 people can be present at private gatherings, while nightlife venues must close their doors at 1 a.m. — early by Spanish standards.Díaz Ayuso said an information campaign will focus on young people, who are largely blamed for spreading the coronavirus through their social life. She said young people “have it in their hands to reverse the trend.”Anyone caught drinking a beer in the street in Barcelona or elsewhere in the Catalonia region could be fined a maximum of 15,000 euros ($17,600).The new measure coming into effect Tuesday aimed to crack down on street parties mostly frequented by young people.Britain’s travel advice comes on the heels of similar decisions by other European governments, including Norway, which ordered a 10-day quarantine for people returning from the entire Iberian peninsula, and France, which urged its citizens not to visit Catalonia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/second-wave-coronavirus-fears-strike-blow-to-tourism-industry/story-7Yi41vlSUPJfTCU6BB2HQJ.html
28-07-2020||World||Taliban to halt military operations over 3-day Eid holiday||The Taliban announced Tuesday they won’t carry out military operations in Afghanistan for three days during the Muslim holiday of Eid ul Adha that starts this weekend.In a statement promising a brief respite to the fighting, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahed said commanders have been ordered not to carry out operations for three days and nights, but are allowed to defend themselves if attacked.The statement also said Taliban fighters are not to fraternize with Afghan security forces personnel and neither side is to cross into the other’s territory.The Afghan government welcomed the Taliban announcement and presidential spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said Afghan security forces were ordered not to attack but only defend themselves.The Taliban announcement follows a conciliatory message by leader Maulvi Hibatullah Akhunzada earlier Tuesday to mark the Muslim holiday. Both communiques come as Washington’s peace envoy returns to the region to try and jump-start negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban.In his Eid message, Akhundzada said the Taliban doesn’t seek to monopolize power in a future political makeup of Afghanistan. He also said they support education for all and are abiding by the peace deal signed with the U.S. in February. The lengthy message repeatedly references an Islamic government the Taliban seek to establish, without elaborating how it would be different.U.S. peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad was expected in the Afghan capital of Kabul, as well as in Qatar, where the Taliban maintain a political office. He was also expected in Islamabad, but there was some question about whether Pakistan was still part of his itinerary.The U.S.-Taliban deal signed Feb. 29 was touted as the best hope for peace in Afghanistan after decades of war. While the U.S. and NATO have already begun reducing their troop strength, the second phase of the deal — which calls for talks between the Taliban and the Kabul political leadership — has been delayed. Much of the delays have been as a result of Kabul’s reluctance to free several hundred of the Taliban prisoners identified for release as part of the agreement.Kabul had claimed those Taliban prisoners were hardened criminals, guilty of major crimes.But on Tuesday, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said he was ready to free the remainder of the prisoners, without specifying why the change of heart or if an agreement had been reached with the Taliban to substitute some of them, a proposal the Taliban earlier rejected.Under the deal, Kabul is to release 5,000 Taliban and the insurgents had promised to free 1,000 government and military personnel. So far, Kabul has freed bout 4,000 and the Taliban nearly 800.“With this action, we look forward to the start of direct negotiations with the Taliban in a week’s time,” said Ghani in the Afghan capital Kabul.Ghani also called for a permanent cease-fire but the Taliban have consistently said they were ready to negotiate a cease-fire in the talks with Kabul — whenever they begin — and accused the Afghan government of attacking the Taliban in their homes.Last week, the Taliban announced they were ready for talks with Afghanistan’s political leadership after the Eid al-Adha holiday, providing the last of the Taliban prisoners had been freed by then. The announcement followed one of the most significant shakeups in the Taliban in years.The Taliban have stuck to their promise not to attack U.S. and NATO troops, but have carried out scores of attacks on Afghan military targets. The United States would like to see those attacks reduced or stopped.“The Islamic Emirate has fulfilled its obligations regarding signing an agreement with the United States ... and efforts toward launching intra-Afghan negotiations,” said Akhunzada. “It is now up to the other parties to determine how they utilize this opportunity.”The Taliban, whose regime was ousted in 2001 by the U.S.-led invasion, said they would allow girls to go to school and women to work, should they return to power. Under a Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, girls were not allowed to go to school and women were barred from working.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-to-halt-military-operations-over-3-day-eid-holiday/story-hdDIXnksZfN2iPidDAfpVL.html
28-07-2020||World||Global air travel expected to not recover before 2024, says trade association for airline industry||Global air travel is recovering more slowly than expected and will take until 2024 to return to pre-pandemic levels, the trade association for the airline industry said Tuesday.The International Air Transport Association pushed back its prediction by one year due to the slow containment of the outbreak in the U.S. and developing countries.The industry is seeing a rebound from the depths of the shutdowns in April, but the bad new is that any increase “is barely visible,” IATA chief economist Brian Pearce said Tuesday during an online briefing for journalists.Pearce said that air travel is not rebounding along with rising levels of business confidence in Europe, the U.S. and China. Traffic was down 86.5% in June from the same month a year ago, compared with a drop of 94.1% in April, measured as revenue passenger kilometers, or the distance travelled by all revenue-generating passengers.That improvement is “nowhere near the increase in business confidence,” Pearce said. China is bouncing back more than some other places, while an upturn in the U.S. has been knocked back by the recent upsurge in COVID-19 cases in a number of states.Besides renewed outbreaks, travel is also being held back by weak consumer confidence and constrained travel budgets at companies that are struggling.Despite parking many of their planes, airlines are struggling to fill seats with enough people to make money. Planes were only 62.9% full on domestic flights around the world, well below levels at which airlines make money, and an abysmal 38.9% for international travel.The U.S. is seeing more coronavirus cases after some states moved to lift restrictions on public life and business. The summer vacation season in Europe has seen more people move around and a rise in cases in Germany, which had earlier done better than many other countries in mitigating the outbreak.The head of the Robert Koch Institute there expressed concern over the rise in cases. Germany issued a travel warning for three regions in Spain and the U.K. has imposed a 14-day quarantine for travellers returning from Spain, a popular holiday destination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-air-travel-expected-to-not-recover-before-2024-says-trade-association-for-airline-industry/story-ZpnEyXXETwfiYaiJiTAZeO.html
28-07-2020||World||Experimental Covid-19 vaccine is put to its biggest test||The biggest test yet of an experimental Covid-19 vaccine has got underway with the first of some 30,000 Americans rolling up their sleeves to receive shots created by the US government as part of the all-out global race to stop the outbreak.The glimmer of hope came even as Google, in one of the gloomiest assessments of the coronavirus’s staying power from a major employer, decreed that most of its 200,000 employees and contractors should work from home through next June - a decision that could influence other big companies.Final-stage testing of the vaccine, developed by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc., began on Monday with volunteers at numerous sites around the US given either a real dose or a dummy without being told which.“I’m excited to be part of something like this. This is huge,” said Melissa Harting, a 36-year-old nurse who received an injection in Binghamton, New York. Especially with family members in front-line jobs that could expose them to the virus, she added, “doing our part to eradicate it is very important to me.” It will be months before results trickle in, and there is no guarantee the vaccine will ultimately work against the scourge that has killed about 650,000 people around the world, including almost 150,000 in the US. “We’ve been sitting on the sidelines passively attempting to wear our masks and social distance and not go out when it’s not necessary. This is the first step of becoming active against this,” researcher Dr. Frank Eder said at the trial site in Binghamton. “There’s really no other way to get past this.” As if to underline how high the stakes are, there were more setbacks in efforts to contain the coronavirus.In Washington, the Trump administration disclosed that national security adviser Robert O’Brien has the virus — the highest-ranking US official to test positive so far. The White House said he has mild symptoms and “has been self-isolating and working from a secure location off site.” The move to restart the national pastime ran into trouble just five days into the long-delayed season: Two major league baseball games scheduled for Monday night were called off as the Miami Marlins coped with an outbreak — the Marlins’ home opener against the Baltimore Orioles, and the New York Yankees’ game in Philadelphia, where the Marlins used the clubhouse over the weekend. As for relief from the economic damage done by the virus, Republicans on Capitol Hill planned to roll out a USD 1 trillion package that could include a new round of USD 1,200 stimulus checks but reduce the extra USD 600 a week in federal unemployment benefits that are expiring for millions of Americans this week.In Europe, rising infections in Spain and other countries caused alarm only weeks after nations reopened their borders in hopes of reviving tourism. Over the weekend, Britain imposed a 14-day quarantine on travellers arriving from Spain, Norway ordered a 10-day quarantine for people returning from the entire Iberian peninsula, and France urged its citizens not to visit Spain’s Catalonia region.Scientists set speed records getting a made-from-scratch vaccine into massive testing just months after the coronavirus emerged. But they stressed that the public shouldn’t fear that anyone is cutting corners. “This is a significant milestone,” NIH Director Francis Collins said after the very first test injection was given, at 6:45 a.m. in Savannah, Georgia. “Yes, we’re going fast, but no, we are not going to compromise” on proving whether the vaccine is safe and effective.“We are focusing on speed because every day matters,” added Stephane Bancel, CEO of Massachusetts-based Moderna.After volunteers get two doses a month apart, scientists will closely track which group experiences more infections as they go about their daily routines, especially in areas where the virus is spreading unchecked. The answer probably won’t come until November or December, cautioned Dr. Anthony Fauci, NIH’s infectious-diseases chief.Among many questions the study may answer: How much protection does just one dose offer compared with the two scientists think are needed? If it works, will it protect against severe disease or block infection entirely? Don’t expect a vaccine as strong as the measles vaccine, which prevents about 97 per cent of measles infections, Fauci said, adding he would be happy with a Covid-19 vaccine that’s 60 per cent effective.Several other vaccines made by China and by Britain’s Oxford University began smaller final-stage tests in Brazil and other hard-hit countries earlier this month. But the US requires its own tests of any vaccine that might be used in the country. Every month through the fall, the government-funded Covid-19 Prevention Network will roll out a new study of a leading candidate, each with 30,000 volunteers.The final US study of the Oxford shot is set to begin in August, followed by a candidate from Johnson & Johnson in September and one from Novavax in October. Pfizer Inc. plans its own 30,000-person study this summer.That’s a stunning number of people needed to roll up their sleeves for science. In recent weeks, more than 150,000 Americans filled out an online registry signaling interest, Collins said. But many more are needed. NIH is working to make sure that the study isn’t just filled with healthy, younger volunteers but includes populations hit hardest by Covid-19, including older adults, those in poor health and African-Americans and Latinos.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/experimental-covid-19-vaccine-is-put-to-its-biggest-test/story-dPrpIbnPqbl9bFZ3vR1bvJ.html
28-07-2020||World||Indian-origin politician Pritam Singh appointed Singapore’s first Leader of Opposition in Parliament||Indian-origin politician Pritam Singh was on Tuesday designated as the Leader of the Opposition in Singapore, the first such appointment in the history of the city-state.The 43-year old Singh’s Workers’ Party won 10 parliamentary seats out of the 93 contested in the July 10 general elections held, making it the biggest opposition presence in Singapore’s Parliament.Singh is the Secretary-General of Workers’ Party. Singapore’s legislatures have never had formally designated Leaders of the Opposition, and such a position is not provided for in the Constitution or the Standing Orders of Parliament,” the parliamentary offices said in its statement on Tuesday.“Singapore’s legislatures have never had formal Leaders of the Opposition, not even in the 1950s and early 1960s when there were substantial numbers of opposition legislative assemblymen,” the Channel News Asia quoted the statement as saying. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s ruling People’s Action Party won 83 seats in the general elections and his government was sworn in on Monday. Singh will take on more duties and be accorded additional privileges in his role as the Leader of the Opposition, authorities said on Tuesday in a statement, laying out the details of the new post. “Similar to other Westminster parliamentary systems, Singh will lead the Opposition in presenting alternative views in parliamentary debates on policies, bills and motions,” said the Office of the Speaker of Parliament and Office of the Leader of the House in a joint statement.He will also lead and organise the scrutiny of the government’s positions and actions in Parliament, and be consulted on the appointment of opposition members to Select Committees, such as the Public Accounts Committee.Singh, who is also a lawyer, will receive an annual package of 385,000 Singapore dollars (USD 2,79,025.98) as allowances for his new role. Prime Minister Lee said on July 11 that Singh will be designated the Leader of the Opposition.After his swearing-in on Monday, Lee said that the election results have shown a strong desire among Singaporeans for a greater diversity of views in politics and that the trend is here to stay.“We have to give expression to it and evolve our political system to accommodate it while maintaining our cohesion and sense of national purpose,” said Lee.“As with any new political appointment, the role of the LO (Leader of the Opposition) will evolve as our political system develops,” the statement from Parliament said.“We look forward to working with the LO to create a robust but stable political system serving the interests of Singapore and Singaporeans,” it said.The statement added that these duties and privileges have been conveyed to Singh, and the Leader of the House will make a statement in Parliament to formally set out these terms.Singapore’s 14th Parliament will have its first sitting on August 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-politician-pritam-singh-appointed-singapore-s-first-leader-of-opposition-in-parliament/story-5tr5ahOvLCAAjQreSnNaoI.html

Yesterday, Trump criticized Twitter for automated trends that portray him negatively, saying that its “ridiculous, illegal, and of course, very unfair!” -- Mario Parker||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-suspends-donald-trump-junior-s-account-over-purported-coronavirus-cure/story-DqHBQWM4To8zkpVcmJkbTJ.html
28-07-2020||World||Donald Trump again pushes unproven drug as Covid-19 treatment||A week after appearing to project a more serious tone about the coronavirus, President Donald Trump is back to pushing unproven claims that an anti-malaria drug is an effective treatment and challenging the credibility of the nation’s leading infectious disease expert.Dr. Anthony Fauci pushed back Tuesday, saying he will keep doing his job.Numerous studies, meanwhile, have shown that the drug, hydroxychloroquine, is not an effective treatment for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. And the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently withdrew an order that allowed the drug’s use as a emergency treatment for Covid-19.Yet overnight, after returning from a trip to North Carolina where he promoted efforts to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, Trump retweeted a series of tweets advocating for hydroxychloroquine.The president also shared a post from the Twitter account for a podcast hosted by Steve Bannon, a former top White House adviser to Trump, accusing Fauci of misleading the public over hydroxychloroquine.Fauci, a leading member of the White House coronavirus task force, pushed back Tuesday during an appearance on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”“I go along with the FDA,” said Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “The overwhelming prevailing clinical trials that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it is not effective in coronavirus disease.”It’s not the first time Fauci has come under attack from Trump and those close to him.The president’s top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, who has clashed with Fauci over hydroxychloroquine, recently penned a scathing attack on the doctor that was published by USA Today. The newspaper later said the opinion piece did not meet its standards.In recent nationally televised interviews, Trump himself has described Fauci as “a bit of an alarmist” and accused him of making “mistakes” in his coronavirus guidance to the American people.Asked if he can continue to do his job when Trump continues to publicly question his credibility, Fauci said Tuesday he’ll press ahead “no matter what” because of the stakes involved.“I don’t tweet. I don’t even read them, so I don’t really want to go there,” Fauci said. “I just will continue to do my job no matter what comes out because I think it’s very important. We’re in the middle of a crisis with regard to an epidemic, a pandemic. This is what I do. This is what I’ve been trained for my entire professional life and I’ll continue to do it.”Asked about claims he’s been misleading the public, Fauci said: “I have not been misleading the American public under any circumstances.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-again-pushes-unproven-drug-as-covid-19-treatment/story-HI5NBaB41GNssvNmC6RDTJ.html
28-07-2020||World||Signs of second wave of Covid-19 in Europe, says UK PM Boris Johnson||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said there are signs of a second wave of coronavirus in Europe after the UK removed Spain from the list of countries deemed safe to travel to and return from, making a 14-day quarantine mandatory for arrivals from there.Spain has seen a spike in the number of cases in recent days, prompting UK officials to impose the 14-day quarantine on Britons and travellers arriving from that country. The decision has thrown holidays of millions of Britons into disarray.Johnson said: “Let’s be absolutely clear about what’s happening in Europe, amongst some of our European friends, I’m afraid you are starting to see in some places the signs of a second wave of the pandemic”.“What we have to do is take swift and decisive action where we think that the risks are starting to bubble up again”, he added.Figures in the UK continued to plummet. As of Monday night, seven new deaths were reported in the last 24 hours, taking the overall figure to 45,759 and the number of cases to 300,111. Scotland did not report any death for several days.UK’s decision to impose quarantine has riled Spanish ministers, who insist the rise in cases is limited to two or three regions, and claim that the country is in a better position than the UK. The quarantine has severely hit Spanish tourism industry.Johnson defended the quarantine decision, adding: “These are decisions (about going on holiday to Spain and elsewhere) for families, for individuals, about where they want to go”.The latest Foreign and Commonwealth Office travel advice on Spain says: “From 27 July, the FCO advise against all non-essential travel to Spain, including the Balearic and Canary Islands, based on the current assessment of Covid-19 risks in the country”.“This advice is based on evidence of increases in cases of Covid-19 in several regions, but particularly in Aragon, Navarra and Catalonia (which include the cities of Zaragoza, Pamplona and Barcelona)”.On Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez calling the UK’s quarantine decision “unjust”, minister of state for housing Simon Clarke said: “We respectfully disagree with the Spanish government’s position on this”, adding that there had been a “sharp increase” in cases in Spain.“We obviously continue to work closely with them (Spain) and we wish them every success in managing this outbreak, but we’ve seen a very sharp increase in cases in Spain. A 75% increase in cases reported between the middle of last week and the end of last week. That’s why we took the action that we have,” he told BBC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/signs-of-second-wave-of-covid-19-in-europe-says-uk-pm-boris-johnson/story-51NCPNeFk4zFWIot0Oa3fO.html

On Sunday, the 29-year-old Yair, who is very active on social media and often defends his father’s policies, posted a picture of the Hindu goddess Durga, with the face of Liat Ben Ari, the prosecutor in his father’s corruption cases, superimposed over the goddess’ face. Her many arms were also raised giving the middle finger. “I’ve tweeted a meme from a satirical page, criticising political figures in Israel. I didn’t realise the meme also portrayed an image connected to the majestic Hindu faith. As soon as I realised it from comments of our Indian friends, I have removed the tweet. I apologise,” Yair said in a tweet. Attorney General Avichai Mandelbit’s face was superimposed over that of a tiger accompanying the goddess under a caption that said, “know your place you despicable people”. The Twitter users were split in their reaction over the post with some Indians harshly criticising him for the offensive tweet while others giving him the benefit of doubt and attributing it to general ignorance about the Hindu faith in the West. Yair, who has been at the centre of several controversies, was appreciated by some Israelis for “showing courage in apologising for his mistake”, but was also condemned in equal measure by others for “being irresponsible”. Earlier this month, Yair issued an apology to journalist Dana Weiss for appearing to suggest the top news anchor had attained her position through sexual favours, according to a local media report. Prime Minister Netanyahu’s trial on charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes opened in May in a Jerusalem court. He has said that the allegations are baseless and that he is a victim of a wide-ranging conspiracy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netanyahu-s-son-offends-indians-with-hindu-goddess-durga-tweet-issues-apology/story-BpFazTsRhuuZiPkYX4OdhO.html

Over the weekend, thousands of mostly Vietnamese tourists cut short their summer holidays in the popular beach destination. The lockdown has dealt a hard blow to the city’ tourism industry, which was just being revived after earlier coronavirus cases mostly subsided at the end of April.Hotel guests quickly ended their stays and canceled upcoming trips upon the news of the first case, one hotelier said on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.“Our hotel is now empty,” the hotelier said. “But we had to help our guests leave the city when they still had the opportunity yesterday.”Da Nang beaches, which host some 50,000 people a day, are now closed. Only security personnel were seen on the beaches Tuesday as they patrolled to ensure no one was gathering.Authorities estimated several thousand people would be stranded by the transportation shutdown and asked hotels to shelter them.“We did not want to rush to the airport to leave the city because of the risk of being in a crowded place. So we are now stuck here,” said Lien Nguyen, who is traveling with her family of four for their summer vacation.“But it is not a bad place to get stranded for two weeks,” she said.On Sunday, the government ordered unessential business to close and required people to practice social distancing in the city of 1.1 million people.All 15 cases in the new outbreak are patients and health workers at Da Nang hospital.With the new infections, Vietnam has reported 431 cases of Covid-19 without a death.It had recorded no local transmissions of the virus since April, with all new cases coming from overseas.

But that was before President Donald Trump got involved.After months of hearing Trump denigrate mail-in balloting, Republicans in the critical battleground state now find themselves far behind Democrats in the perennial push to urge their voters to cast ballots remotely. While Democrats have doubled the number of their voters who have requested mail ballots compared to 2016, Republicans have increased their numbers by about 20% since then.The recent tally is the hard evidence confirming many Republicans’ fears about Trump’s tweeting about mail-in voting: GOP voters are listening and appear less likely to take advantage of what many election and health officials agree is the easiest and safest way to vote in a pandemic.The numbers are so clear that Florida Republicans are shifting their emphasis from years past and are now trying to persuade voters to use another alternative to Election Day voting: in-person early voting.“Did the president’s tweet cause it? Maybe a little bit, but it’s been shifting for years now,” said Susie Wiles, who has been tapped by the Trump campaign to help buoy the president’s newly troubled Florida campaign. “If COVID is still the level of concern that it is now, early vote is, after absentee, probably the next best option.”Political campaigns in both parties typically push their voters to cast ballots by mail because they can bank votes for their side in advance, freeing up scarce resources to chase down less-frequent voters and turn them out by Election Day. Amid the coronavirus, that push has become all the more urgent.But while Democrats have tried to expand access to voting by mail, Republicans have struggled with what to tell their voters. Some have pushed for it, while Trump and his allies at the Republican National Committee have tried to limit expansion of remote voting.Increasingly, GOP operatives and officials are voicing their concerns with that strategy. “Why give Democrats 10 or 11 days to vote and expect Republicans to vote on one day?” asked Rohn Bishop, Republican Party chair in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin. “It puts us at a disadvantage.”Trump has called mail ballots “corrupt” and “substantially fraudulent,” even though the five states that now send ballots to all voters have had no signs of substantial fraud. Despite the president’s objections, numerous states have loosened restrictions on mail voting amid the pandemic.Trump’s own campaign isn’t heeding his warning. It continues to encourage its voters to sign up for mail ballots when possible — even as the RNC is fighting in court against Democratic efforts to further expand mail voting and issuing statements like one last week saying the expansion has led “to delays, disaster and dysfunction.”That’s led the GOP to make some political contortions. In Florida, state Republicans recently sent a mailer urging their party members to request mail ballots. It included part of a tweet from Trump saying, “Absentee ballots are fine because you have to go through a precise process to get your ballot.”But the mailer did not include the rest of the president’s tweet: “Mail-In Voting, on the other hand, will lead to the most corrupt Election in USA history.”In most states, there is no difference between absentee and mail-in voting.Democrats are chortling. “It’s something to watch the President just torch 30 years of @FloridaGOP superiority in Florida on vote by mail with each and every tweet,” Steve Schale, a veteran Florida Democratic operative who runs a super PAC for Trump’s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, tweeted Sunday after another Trump tweet denigrating mail ballots.It’s not just Florida where Republicans are facing a gap. In North Carolina, another swing state where the GOP once dominated absentee voting, Republicans also cherry-picked a Trump tweet in a mailer pleading with their voters to request mail ballots.North Carolina Republicans have requested about 50% more ballots than in 2016, but Democrats have asked for a whopping seven times more absentee ballots.In Pennsylvania, another presidential battleground, more than 1 million Democrats voted by mail in that state’s June primary compared to just fewer than 400,000 Republicans, according to data from the Pennsylvania secretary of state’s office.In the Georgia primary the following week, the gap continued — Democrats outvoted Republicans by 182,000 ballots out of 2.1 million cast.While some Republicans argue that Democrats were more motivated to vote because they had a contested presidential primary, Iowa held a primary the same month well after its February presidential caucuses. In that primary, 24% more Democrats than Republicans voted by mail, and more Democrats voted overall even though the two parties have an almost equal number of registered voters there.In Michigan, where the Democratic secretary of state sent absentee ballot applications to all voters, Trump supporters last month set their own applications on fire.Glen Bolger, a veteran Republican pollster, warned that his swing state polling finds a huge partisan gap in desire to vote by mail.“Waiting for Election Day for most of your voters to cast their votes — what if there’s really bad weather or long lines?” Bolger said. “It just makes it harder for state and local parties to do their jobs.”Still, the lack of GOP interest in voting by mail has made Bishop worried about numerous down-ballot races in Wisconsin that depend on the presidential election driving mail ballot turnout. It’s hard for Republicans to find early in-person options in his remote corner of the state, and no one knows how easy it will be to access the polls there in November.Bishop said that after he started tweeting about the problem in May, he was told the administration wasn’t happy with him, but some Wisconsin Republicans have stood by him.“The president, how he’s talked about this hasn’t been very helpful,” said Wisconsin Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke. “The absentee ballot system here in Wisconsin is safe and responsible and should be used as much as possible during a pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/here-s-how-trump-s-opposition-to-mail-voting-hurts-the-gop/story-vcHOkjsIgo9AtHkWyx0eKK.html
28-07-2020||World||UK’s Covid-19 strategy hit by lack of advice translation||Over 8.6 lakh people in England and Wales speak little to no English, but lack of translation in various languages – including some Indian – is adversely affecting official measures to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, campaigners said on Tuesday.Gujarati, Punjabi, Urdu and Hindi are among major languages the UK government translates official communication, but translation services have not been able to keep up with frequent virus-related updates. Some key advice is only available in English.Campaign group Doctors of the World UK and other organisations joined several local authorities, including the Greater London Authority, to write to health secretary Matt Hancock and housing secretary Robert Jenrick, highlighting the issue.The letter says: “We write to raise our concern about the lack of availability of Covid-19 public health guidance in languages other than English, which is preventing people in England who do not speak or read English well from accessing essential public health information and limiting their ability to keep themselves, their families, and their communities safe”.“At present the ‘Stay alert: what you can and cannot do’ guidance and information on NHS test and trace is not available in any languages other than English”.The group said that so far it had translated UK-wide guidance into over 60 languages, which have been accessed by people nearly 60,000 times. It cited a recent report by Public Health England that called for “culturally competent Covid-19 education and prevention campaigns.”The letter states that during the pandemic local authorities and civil society organisations have made efforts to translate guidance, but as lockdown measures are eased and guidance changes regularly, it is not sustainable or practical for them to meet this need.One of the reasons for the recent spike in cases in the east Midlands city of Leicester was official guidance not reaching thousands of Indian and other non-white people unfamiliar with English, particularly those working in the large number of garment manufacturing factories.The letter says: “The production of accessible and translated public health information for the public during a public health emergency is a central part of the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care’s statutory duty to protect the nation’s health and wellbeing, and to address health inequalities in England”.“To tackle the huge challenge of Covid-19 together, it is critical that everyone is supported to stay healthy and included in overall public health measures. We urgently seek reassurance that the government will consider and include non-English speakers in its response to Covid-19 and commit to produce and maintain accessible Covid-19 guidance in languages that reflect England’s multilingual communities”, it adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-covid-19-strategy-hit-by-lack-of-advice-translation/story-fuO57F9dCTnIkOyx0Z15yH.html
28-07-2020||World||North Korean officials abused repatriated women: UN Report||The UN human rights office reported Tuesday that scores of North Korean women who had traveled abroad in a desperate search for work were abused by security officials and police through beatings, detention in unsanitary conditions, undernourishment and invasive body searches after being sent back home.The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights presented the findings in a new report that alleges “multiple and serious human rights violations by state security and police officials” in North Korea, based on 100 accounts from women who were detained in the secretive country from 2009 to 2019 after being forcibly returned home.The women spoke to U.N. human rights officials after eventually fleeing North Korea following their detention.Testimonies suggest the women, who often fell into the custody of human traffickers, faced bonded labor or sexual exploitation in other countries — then were deemed traitors or punished for contacting Christian groups abroad after their return.“It is heartbreaking to read these stories of women who fled their country looking to make ends meet, but who ended up being punished,” High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet said in a statement accompanying the report. She said the women ”should be taken care of, not detained and subjected to further human rights violations.”“These women have a right to justice, truth and reparation,” she added.North Korea’s diplomatic mission in Geneva did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The U.N. rights office also called on foreign countries where the women fled — at times including neighboring China — to respect the principle of “non-refoulement,” or not returning people to countries where they could face a real risk of human rights violations.“These accounts show once again the systemic nature of human rights violations in the DPRK, and the need to keep seeking pathways to proper accountability for such crimes,” Bachelet said, using the acronym for North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.The report only focused on women who had fled abroad, not the many people held in political prisons in North Korea which are believed to also be a site of human rights violations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korean-officials-abused-repatriated-women-un-report/story-NbpHSrHE82VQlJeoEUbb6O.html
28-07-2020||World||US-China spats rattle world, prompting calls for unity||Antagonisms between the United States and China are rattling governments around the world, prompting a German official to warn of “Cold War 2.0” and Kenya’s president to appeal for unity to fight the coronavirus pandemic.Global trade already was depressed by the 2-year-old tariff war between the world’s two biggest economies. That rancor has spread to include Hong Kong, Chinese Muslims, spying accusations and control of the South China Sea.Caught in the middle, other governments are trying to defend their own interests.GERMANY:Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government wants to preserve trade and cooperation on global warming but says a security law tightening Beijing’s control over Hong Kong is a “difficult issue.”The Hong Kong security law’s potential disruption of the autonomy Beijing promised to the former British colony is no reason to stop talking but is “a worrying development,” Merkel said.Europe’s biggest economy has yet to take a final position on Chinese tech giant Huawei despite U.S. pressure to exclude its equipment from next-generation telecom networks as a possible security risk.“China is an important partner for us but also a competitor,” Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in a statement after a videoconference Friday with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi.Peter Beyer, the government’s coordinator for trans-Atlantic cooperation, expressed alarm in an interview with the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland newspaper group.“We are experiencing the beginning of a Cold War 2.0,” Beyer said. He criticized both sides but said, “the U.S. is our most important partner outside the EU, and that is how it will stay.”FRANCE:President Emmanuel Macron calls President Donald Trump “my friend” but is trying to avoid riling Beijing.France has not echoed Trump’s criticism of Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus, but legislators applauded Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian last week when he condemned abuses of minority Uighurs in China’s northwest.Le Drian mentioned “mass arrests, disappearances, forced labor, forced sterilizations, the destruction of Uighur cultural heritage.” He said France has asked that the camps be closed.“All these practices are unacceptable,” the minister said. “We condemn them.”Trump’s ambivalence toward U.S. allies and flouting of diplomatic norms has alarmed France.“Sino-American tensions don’t benefit France,” said Valerie Niquet of the Foundation for Strategic Research, a think tank. “We share the same interests as the United States towards China, we adopt more or less the same positions, so it doesn’t bring us any positive element.”EUROPE:Europe’s “strategic relations” with China will be an issue for the European Union while Germany holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation bloc, Merkel said this month.EU foreign ministers have not managed to agree on a common position on China.Regarding Hong Kong, options include closer scrutiny of exports of sensitive technology to the territory and changing visa policies for its residents. But there is no talk of economic sanctions or targeting Chinese officials with penalties.“The message is that the recent actions change the rules,” said the top EU foreign policy official, Josep Borrell. “This will require a revision of our approach and will clearly have an impact on our relations.”SOUTH KOREA:South Korea is squeezed between its main military ally and its biggest trading partner.In 2016, Beijing destroyed supermarket operator Lotte’s business in China after the conglomerate sold a plot of land in South Korea to the government for an anti-missile system over Chinese objections.Washington is unhappy with South Korea’s desire to ease sanctions on North Korea to encourage disarmament and uneasy about its use of Huawei technology.Trump complains about the cost of stationing 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea to protect against North Korean threats. A cost-sharing agreement expired in 2019 without a replacement.The U.S.-Chinese row “has thrown a question to South Korea” about which side to choose, the newspaper Dong-A Ilbo said in an editorial Monday.“Sooner or later we will be forced to provide an answer, no matter how hard we tried to avoid it,” the newspaper said.INDIA:Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tried to embrace both Chinese President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump, but the pandemic and a border clash that killed at least 20 Indian soldiers have fueled anti-Chinese sentiment.Protesters have called for boycotts of Chinese goods and burned Chinese flags. They applauded the government’s ban on the popular Chinese video-sharing app TikTok and some other Chinese apps.Washington wants stronger ties with India and supported its controversial move a year ago to split its only Muslim-majority state, restive Jammu and Kashmir, into two federally controlled territories. This month, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said the United States would stand up to China on the Indian border dispute.“For India it is opportune that the U.S. is applying more pressure on China, and if it can get it to behave, that would be welcomed by the entire neighborhood,” said Jayadev Ranade, president of the Center for China Analysis think tank in New Delhi.AFRICA:China-U.S. tensions are taking a toll: The African Development Bank said last year trade disruption due to the tariff war could lead to a 2.5% drop in economic output for some African countries.Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said political disputes should be set aside to better fight the coronavirus.“Let’s not be sucked back into isolationism or unilateralism. We need each other today more than ever,” Kenyatta said an Atlantic Council event last month. “We’re not going to fight coronavirus if one country fails and another succeeds.”SOUTHEAST ASIA:The 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations has avoided taking steps that would alienate Washington or Beijing, both important trading partners.“The great powers, as they escalate their rivalry, will woo us into their side,” said Harry Roque, a spokesman for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. “We will advance our national interest.”The region’s most sensitive conflict — over control of the South China Sea — escalated when the Trump administration publicly rejected most of Beijing’s claims to one of the world’s busiest waterways.“We are making clear: Beijing’s claims to offshore resources across most of the South China Sea are completely unlawful,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a July 13 statement.The Philippines and Vietnam, among the most vocal critics of Chinese assertiveness, could benefit from that stance but will move cautiously, said Greg Poling of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.“They aren’t going to stick their necks in a noose until they see real follow-through from Washington,” Poling said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-china-spats-rattle-world-prompting-calls-for-unity/story-dLdPE0kQbhMVgFY503IOcN.html

We have held four rounds of commander-level talks and three meetings of WMCC,” Wang added.Also Read: Disengagement is complex, our aim is status quo ante, says Army“Now the frontline border troops have completed disengagement in most locations and the situation on the ground is easing,” he said.“Now we are preparing for the fifth round of commander-level talks to study the settlement of the remaining issue. We hope India will work with China to implement our consensus and uphold peace and stability along our border areas,” Wang added.Following last Friday’s WMCC meeting, a statement from the external affairs ministry had said that the two sides agreed “it was necessary for both sides to sincerely implement the understandings reached between senior (military) commanders in their meetings till date”.At the WMCC meeting, India focused on the need for China to completely withdraw its forces from key friction points in East Ladakh in keeping with commitments made at the meetings of the corps commanders and the July 5 phone conversation between the two Special Representatives on the border issue, people aware of the developments had told Hindustan Times in New Delhi.It is still not clear whether Beijing is looking at the disengagement of troops in the same way.The Chinese statement on the same WMCC meeting, issued in Beijing in Mandarin, referred to “positive progress made by the frontline border defence forces of the two countries to disengage and ease the situation on the ground”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/disengagement-of-troops-at-most-locations-complete-says-china/story-tjZRoK5Z5QU1rpo5NhpcsI.html
28-07-2020||World||Malaysian ex-PM Najib Razak convicted of 7 graft charges over 1MDB investment fund||A Malaysian court pronounced former Prime Minister Najib Razak guilty Tuesday in his first corruption trial over the multibillion-dollar looting of the 1MDB investment fund.The ruling came five months after a new government took power with Najib’s Malay party the biggest bloc in the alliance. His party’s shocking election ouster in 2018 was driven by public anger over the 1MDB scandal.“I find the accused guilty and convict the accused of all seven charges,” Judge Mohamad Nazlan Ghazali said after spending two hours to read out his ruling.Analysts said the ruling would bolster the prosecution’s case in Najib’s other trials and would signal to the business community Malaysia’s legal system has strength in tackling international financial crimes.Najib, 67, has promised to appeal. He has said he was misled by rogue bankers and the case against him is political.“From day one, I have said this is the chance for me to clear my name,”″ he wrote on Facebook late Monday. “After this, we will go to the Court of Appeal. I am ready.” A scion of one of Malaysia’s most prominent political families, he faces 42 charges in five separate trials and could face years in prison.The current trial involved a charge of abuse of power, three charges of criminal breach of trust and three money laundering charges.The judge said Najib failed to raise reasonable doubt and that prosecutors had established beyond reasonable doubt that Najib misappropriated money for his own use.“The conviction would serve as a solid foundation for the prosecution in ensuing IMDB-related trials,” said Oh Ei Sun, a senior fellow with Singapore’s Institute of International Affairs.He said the ruling also would strengthen the credibility of current Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, who was fired as Najib’s deputy in 2016 for speaking out on the 1MDB scandal although he now relies on Najib’s party for support.Najib’s party is the biggest bloc in the current Malay nationalist alliance, which was formed in March after a political coup by Muhyiddin’s party toppled the former reformist government.Najib shortly after taking office in 2009 set up 1MDB to ostensibly accelerate Malaysia’s economic development.But the fund accumulated billions in debt, and US investigators allege that at least $4.5 billion was stolen from it and laundered by Najib’s associates to finance Hollywood films and buy hotels, a luxury yacht, artwork, jewelry and other extravagances. More than $700 million from the fund allegedly landed in Najib’s bank accounts.Najib’s wife and several officials from his party and previous government have also been charged with graft. Najib, whose father and uncles were Malaysia’s second and third prime ministers, denies any wrongdoing. He calls the prosecutions a political attack on him.Najib’s first trial began in April 2019 over seven charges related to the transfer of 42 million ringgit ($9.8 million) from SRC International, a former 1MDB unit, into his bank accounts through intermediary companies. Najib was accused of using his position to receive a bribe for approving a government guarantee for billions in loans to SRC, committing criminal breach of trust and accepting proceeds from unlawful activities.Evidence showed a complex trail of money through the accounts that paid for renovating Najib’s home, credit card purchases including a Chanel watch bought in Hawaii as a birthday gift for his wife and disbursements to political parties.In defence, Najib has said he was misled by rogue bankers led by Malaysian fugitive financier Low Taek Jho, identified by investigators as a mastermind in the 1MDB saga.Najib testified he assumed the money was part of an Arab donation arranged by Low. The judge debunked that argument in the guilty verdict, finding it an “elaborate but weak fabrication.” Najib’s lawyers said Low had used the donation as a guise to keep Najib from being suspicious of his plundering of the 1MDB fund. Prosecutors argued that Najib was the real power behind 1MDB and SRC, and called the Arab donation “manufactured evidence” to cover up his tracks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysian-ex-pm-najib-razak-convicted-of-7-graft-charges-over-1mdb-investment-fund/story-v0OhCPIG22SifaPQIVRrRO.html
28-07-2020||World||Australian police warn Chinese students, officials of ‘virtual kidnapping’ scam||Australian police have warned universities and Chinese officials about a spurt in “virtual kidnapping” scams that coerce foreign students to fake their own abductions and trick families overseas into paying ransoms.As tension has grown between Australia and China over trade, human rights and accusations of state-linked hacking, police said eight incidents of virtual kidnapping, involving a total payout of A$3.2 million ($2.3 million), were reported this year.“We have had a spate in the last few months where pretty much every weekend we have had a victim fall for one of these scams,” said Darren Benett, director of the crime command in the state of New South Wales, whose capital is Sydney.“If you get one of these phone calls, hang up, ring the police, ring your university, but just don’t pay any money,” he added in a televised news conference.Scam perpetrators call intended victims in the guise of a local Chinese official to warn they have been implicated in a crime in China and must pay a fee to avoid legal action, arrest or deportation, police said.Some scammers tell victims to sever contact with family and friends, rent a hotel room and take pictures or video recordings of themselves bound and blindfolded, and then send the images to their relatives overseas to exert pressure, the police added.“We need to take into account the cultural factors and the fact that the scams are very polished,” said state police official Peter Thurtell, explaining why victims are taken in.New South Wales has 212,000 foreign students enrolled, say police. Australian universities have warned they risk losing billions of dollars in annual fees because of border closures prompted by the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-police-warn-chinese-students-officials-of-virtual-kidnapping-scam/story-7CuVLALwDqQlldKHuDotxH.html
28-07-2020||World||Biden campaign bans staffers from using TikTok||Staffers of the presidential campaign of Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, have been instructed reportedly to delete TikTok, the Chinese app in the crosshairs of governments around the world after it was banned by India, from their personal and work phones.Citing security and privacy concerns, Biden campaign general counsel Dana Remus, wrote to staffers to “refrain from downloading and using TikTok on work and personal devices”, according to a report by Bloomberg News.The Biden campaign stricture came as US congress was on the verge passing a bill forbidding federal employees from using TikTok on their phones. The Trump administration is also weighing an outright ban on the app and other Chinese applications.Also read: Donald Trump bets on Covid-19 vaccine for political shot in arm“It’s something we’re looking at,” President Donald Trump has said of his administration’s plans for TikTok.In the days after India banned TikTok and 58 other Chinese apps amidst tensions with China over Galwan clashes late June, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not only welcomed it but indicated the US may have played an “assist” role in it, and signalled Trump administration’s intentions to follow suit.The Biden campaign’s ban on TikTok for its staffers was being seen by India watchers as an important signal of shared concern about China, in view of the absence thus far of explicit expression of support from the Biden campaign for India in the ongoing India-China dispute, in sharp contrast to the outpouring of backing from the Trump administrationDemocrats individually and as a body had expressed their support for India in this conflict, and most notably by passing a bill last week, as a part of the defence spending bill for 2021, expressing concern with China’s underlying motivation to “redraw long-standing settled boundaries”.But the Biden campaign hadn’t “uttered a word” yet on the India-China border conflict, an Indian American Democratic operative said requesting anonymity. The TikTok ban, the person added, coming ahead of Trump administration and congress’s actions showed an “uncoordinated similarity” of purpose.Democrats are looking at Indian American voters as a key component of their strategy to flip the three swing states — Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — that gave Trump the White House in an upset victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016.“The Indian American vote — the AAPI more broadly — can be an absolute difference maker,” Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said at a power-packed pitch to them at a virtual town-hall recently, of the swing states.“We know that there are important sectors of the Indian American community throughout our country, throughout our battleground states,” Julie Chavez Rodriguez, a senior adviser to the Biden campaign, had added in her pitch to the community. “And we want to make sure we were engaging and connecting directly with them, their key leaders in these battleground states. And the key radio stations, newspapers, whatever else outlet it is that are speaking to them.”There are an estimated 4 million people of Indian origin in the United States, but only about a third are eligible to vote — 1.3 million, according to a report by an organization of Democrats focussed on mobilization of Asian American voters to ensure the victory of Asian American candidates running for city-level public offices to those at the centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-campaign-bans-staffers-from-using-tiktok/story-N9CVvLZDxEcgCJ3zNGrtXJ.html
28-07-2020||World||Iran moves mock-up US carrier to mouth of Gulf: Satellite images||Iran has moved a mock-up US aircraft carrier to the strategic Strait of Hormuz, satellite images show, suggesting it will use the look-alike vessel for target practice in war games in a Gulf shipping channel vital to world oil exports.The use of dummy American warships has become an occasional feature of training by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards and its naval forces, including in 2015 when Iranian missiles hit a mock-up resembling a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier. Tehran, which opposes the presence of US and Western navies in the Gulf, frequently holds naval war games in the strategic Strait, the conduit for some 30% of all crude and other oil liquids traded by sea.One of the images taken on July 26 by US-based space technology firm Maxar Technologies showed an Iranian fast attack boat moving toward the model US carrier in the strategic waterway. Another image showed model planes lined up on the deck of the fake carrier.“We cannot speak to what Iran hopes to gain by building this mock-up, or what tactical value they would hope to gain by using such a mock-up in a training or offensive exercise scenario,” said Commander Rebecca Rebarich, the spokeswoman for the US Navy’s Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet.“We remain confident in our naval forces’ ability to defend themselves against any maritime threat.”Tensions have spiked between Iran and the United States since 2018, when US President Donald Trump withdrew from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with six powers and reimposed sanctions that has sharply dropped Tehran’s oil exports.Iran’s Guards in April said Tehran would destroy US warships if its security is threatened in the Gulf. Iranian officials have repeatedly threatened to block Hormuz if Iran is not able to export oil or if its nuclear sites are attacked.There have been periodic confrontations between the Iranian Guards and the US military in the Gulf in recent years. US officials have said closing the Strait would be crossing a “red line” and America would take action to reopen it.Iran cannot legally close the waterway unilaterally because part of it is in Omani territorial waters. However, ships that sail it pass through Iranian waters, which are under the responsibility of the Iran’s Guards naval force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-moves-mock-up-us-carrier-to-mouth-of-gulf-satellite-images/story-BXYC60AJecDajaivWSoo6N.html
28-07-2020||World||Case registered against Pak provincial minister for social media activist’s murder||A case has been registered against a provincial minister in Pakistan and his two guards for the alleged murder of a social media activist, according to media reports.The Levies Force on Sunday registered the case against Balochistan Minister for Food and Population Welfare Sardar Abdul Rehman Khan Khetiran and his two guards Adam Khan and Nadir Khan on the complaint of the deceased’s brother, the Dawn reported.Anwar was murdered on July 23 by some armed men in Naharkot, in Balochistan’s Barkhan district, when he was on his way home on a motorbike.Anwar’s brother Ghulam Sarwar alleged that the guards killed him at the behest of the minister.According to the complaint, Anwar had been writing on social media about problems in his area, atrocities and alleged corruption by the minister.According to a report in Pakistan Today, Sarwar alleged that the minister’s men had threatened his brother over the telephone for writing against the minister on social media.The minister has, however, denied his involvement in the murder and also said that the two other people mentioned in the FIR were not his gunmen, the report said.“I have nothing to do with the murder of Anwar Jan,” he was quoted as saying by the Dawn.“I have no enmity with Anwar Jan Khetiran’s family,” he added.However, some journalists in Barkhan said Anwar was not a member of the local press club but he posted comments on social media platforms.He was affiliated to the National Party, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/case-registered-against-pak-provincial-minister-for-social-media-activist-s-murder/story-TqPT8nxlAFixNMtgLtG8QO.html

It’s not shutting down the economy. Hopefully, it is American ingenuity that will allow for therapies and vaccines to ultimately conquer this,” White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told ABC News on Sunday.The virus has also repeatedly penetrated Trump’s inner circle, with O’Brien the latest and most senior White House aide to test positive.He “has been self-isolating and working from a secure location off site,” the White House said in a statement Monday, adding that there was “no risk of exposure to the president or the vice president.”Others who have been previously infected include Vice President Mike Pence’s spokeswoman Katie Miller, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, a top fundraiser for the Trump campaign and his elder son’s girlfriend.Results by November? The US has spent more than $6.3 billion since March to fund vaccine development efforts under Operation Warp Speed.The program is unabashed in its aims to procure vaccines for the American people first -- unlike European leaders who have called for Covid-19 drugs to be a “global public good.”Pharmaceutical newcomer Moderna, which, alongside AstraZeneca and two Chinese firms is among those furthest in its development timeline, began the final stage of its clinical trial Monday.The trial is being co-conducted by the National Institutes for Health (NIH) across the United States and is expected to enroll approximately 30,000 adult volunteers.Participants will get two doses of the vaccine given 28 days apart.The first volunteer, a Black woman identified as Robyn, participated in a video chat hosted by the NIH on Monday, telling viewers her friends and relatives had initially told her “it was a bad idea.”“And the reason for that was because in the African American community, we are all familiar with the Tuskegee experiments,” she added, referring to a 40-year-study the US conducted on Black men to see the effects of untreated syphilis.The men involved were kept in the dark about cures on purpose.But, added Robyn, she was encouraged by laws that are now in place to prevent a repetition, and motivated by the desire to help others against a disease that disproportionately impacts communities of color.An irony of the process is that, given the rampant nature of the US epidemic, results could come far sooner than the two years the trial is set to run.Daily new cases have plateaued around the 66,000 mark for the past few days, making it more likely that trial participants will be exposed to the virus sooner rather than later.“It’s a really optimistic scenario. It could be November,” Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel told CNBC on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-bets-on-covid-19-vaccine-for-political-shot-in-arm/story-hJfluc2EK0AsgNwnpZhxFI.html

28-07-2020||World||It’s official: US closes its consulate in Chengdu||The US consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu officially shut down on Monday morning, within 72 hours of Beijing ordering its closure as a tit-for-tat move against shutting of its Houston consulate.The US flag at the consulate was lowered at dawn. A large number of police personnel were deployed around the mission with the roads leading to it cordoned off. The Chinese foreign ministry said the Chengdu consulate closed at 10am local time. “China’s competent authorities then entered through the front entrance and took over the premises,” it said.The shutting of the US Chengdu consulate was in retaliation against Washington’s unexpected closure of China’s consulate in Houston, Texas, claiming the mission had been involved in espionage efforts.China had given the Americans the same time frame of 72 hours to shut down Chengdu mission, the same deadline US had given it on Houston.The US’s Chengdu consulate was the nearest to the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR). The shutting of it will now make it more difficult for the US to monitor the situation in TAR where the entry of diplomats and foreign journalists is banned.Opened in 1985, the US Chengdu consular district’s jurisdiction included provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, as well as the Tibet Autonomous Region and Chongqing City Municipality.”At midday on Monday, police removed a roadblock that had restricted access to the Chengdu facility, and dozens of passersby stopped to take photos and videos. One man stood across the street and played the Chinese national anthem from his phone.“We feel very sad about the breaking down of the relationship between China and U.,” said a bystander outside the facility who said his surname was Li. He said he was worried about the impact of deteriorating relations on Chinese citizens who want to travel or study in the US.The US embassy said in a video in Chinese on Twitter: “The US consulate in Chengdu has been proudly promoting the mutual understanding between Americans and the people in Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Yunnan and Tibet since 1985. We will forever miss you.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-s-official-us-closes-its-consulate-in-chengdu/story-lVoRp38fzKC9bOTVaYoQuL.html

Riots were declared in Portland, the centre of a new wave of protests, and in Seattle amid teargas, fires, hurled stones and bottles. In Austin, Texas, a man had been shot dead on Saturday when he approached a vehicle and a person inside opened fire.Thousands of demonstrators marched in groups around Portland, Oregon, some yelling “Feds go home!” in response to the Trump administration’s decision to send federal agents there in late June.The police said protesters used power tools to try to cut through the fence of the federal courthouse and pulled a section down. At one point, protesters lobbed fireworks and other projectiles toward federal agents there, who fired back with tear gas. A riot was declared, and the police reported an unspecified number of arrests.In Seattle, Washington, a riot was declared after thousands of protesters battled with police: throwing rocks, bottles, fireworks and other explosives. Police used pepper spray and flash bangs to disperse the crowds. In Austin, Texas, an unidentified man was killed by a person in a car he approached around 10pm during protests downtown. The police said the suspected shooter was arrested. Other protests flared in New York, Los Angeles, Oakland, Omaha, Nebraska, among other cities.In Aurora, Colorado, protesters set fire to a municipal court building.

28-07-2020||World||‘Evidence destroyed’: Chinese doctor alleges Covid-19 cover-up||A Chinese doctor, who diagnosed early coronavirus cases in China, has accused the local authorities of a cover-up of the initial scale of the outbreak at the epicentre Wuhan, saying the evidence was already destroyed when they went for investigation, according to a media report.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageSpeaking to the BBC, Professor Kwok-Yung Yuen, a microbiologist, physician and surgeon in Hong Kong, who helped to investigate the Covid-19 outbreak in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, said the physical evidence at the Huanan wildlife market was destroyed and the response to clinical findings was slow.“When we went to the Huanan supermarket, of course, there was nothing to see because the market was clean already. So, you may say that the crime scene is already disturbed because the supermarket was cleared. We cannot identify any host which is giving the virus to humans,” Yuen was quoted as saying.“I do suspect that they have been doing some cover-up locally at Wuhan. The local officials who are supposed to immediately relay the information have not allowed this to be done as readily as it should,” he said in the report.The coronavirus originated from the Huanan wildlife market in Wuhan in December last year and has globally infected over 16 million people and claimed the lives of more than 648,000 people and bringing the world economy to a standstill.According to the Johns Hopkins data, China has recorded 86,570 Covid-19 cases and 4,652 deaths.Several countries, including the US, have criticised China for not divulging information about the severity of the disease. However, China has denied the accusations of withholding information.It is also accused of reprimanding Dr Li Wenliang and other whistleblowers in Wuhan who tried to warn medics about the deadly virus.Li, who was the first to report about the virus in December last year, contracted the disease and died in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/evidence-destroyed-chinese-doctor-alleges-covid-19-cover-up/story-BBbftoQ8tacpmm6hvoVefJ.html

The work of the National Security Council continues uninterrupted.” O’Brien typically works from a West Wing office just a short distance from President Donald Trump’s.He had travelled to Paris in mid-July for a meeting with counterparts from the UK, France, Germany and Italy.Two White House staffers had tested positive earlier: Trump’s personal valet and the head of Vice-President Mike Pence’s communications team.Moderna vaccine study gets underwayThe world’s biggest Covid-19 vaccine study got underway on Monday with the first of 30,000 planned volunteers helping to test shots created by the U.S. government -- one of several candidates in the final stretch of the global vaccine race.There’s still no guarantee that the experimental vaccine, developed by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc, will really protect. The needed proof: Volunteers won’t know if they’re getting the real shot or a dummy version. After two doses, scientists will closely track which group experiences more infections as they go about their daily routines, especially in areas where the virus still is spreading unchecked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-nsa-test-ve-for-covid-19-biggest-vaccine-trial-begins/story-5zMKXJPmfMbih3c4NRVD4M.html
28-07-2020||World||Covid worst global health emergency: WHO||Covid-19 “continues to accelerate” with a doubling of cases over the last six weeks, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday, describing the pandemic as the worst health emergency faced by the UN agency.More than 16 million cases have now been reported , with more than 640,000 deaths. WHO’s emergency committee will convene on Thursday, a procedural requirement six months after the agency’s declaration of a public health emergency of international concern, made on January 30 for the coronavirus outbreak. The panel will advise Tedros on the way forward.Only with strict adherence to health measures, from wearing masks to avoiding crowds, would the world manage to beat the pandemic, Tedros said at a virtual news briefing in Geneva. “Where these measures are followed, cases go down. Where they are not, cases go up,” he said, praising Canada, China, Germany and South Korea for controlling outbreaks. Vietnam is evacuating 80,000 people, mostly local tourists, from the central tourism hot spot of Danang after three residents tested positive for the coronavirus over the weekend, the government said on Monday.The Southeast Asian country is back on high alert after authorities on Saturday confirmed the first community infections since April, and another three cases on Sunday, all in or around Danang.The UK has said it will pause reporting on coronavirus deaths while it reviews how they are counted. Last week, the government said deaths in England were attributed to coronavirus if the deceased had had the disease at any time. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would only record deaths as virus-related if the patient had a positive test within the preceding 28 days.Citing his own obesity, Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday launched a campaign to encourage Britons to exercise as new evidence showed that overweight people being infected by coronavirus are more likely to die or develop severe illness.The drive includes doctors prescribing cycling or running to patients, dedicated cycle lanes and pedestrianisation of more areas in cities across the UK, ban on junk food advertisements on television and online before 9pm, and cigarette pack-like calorie warnings on food items. “Since I recovered from coronavirus, I’ve been steadily building up my fitness. I am at least a stone down. But when I went into ICU, when I was really ill, I was way overweight,” Johnson said.In Singapore, scientists have developed a method to improve the speed of obtaining Covid-19 laboratory test results in 36 minutes or by up to four times.The new method, developed by scientists at the Nanyang Technological University’s (NTC) Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, has demonstrated a way to improve “the speed, handling time and cost of Covid-19 laboratory tests”, the university said. The test, which can be done with portable equipment, could also be deployed in the community as a screening tool, it said. Muslim pilgrims have started arriving in Mecca for a drastically scaled-down hajj, which begins on Wednesday. It normally draws around 2.5 million people. This year, Saudi Arabia’s hajj ministry has said between 1,000 and 10,000 people already residing in the kingdom will be allowed to perform the pilgrimage. Two-thirds of those pilgrims will be from among foreign residents in Saudi Arabia and one-third will be Saudi citizens. China reported the largest number of domestic infections in more than four months. Of the 61 infections reported on Monday, 57 were local cases.The coronavirus pandemic “continues to accelerate”, with a doubling of cases over the last six weeks, says WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-worst-global-health-emergency-who/story-HqsIOcOC8o5JZjkRCTufTN.html
28-07-2020||World||Hunger to kill 128k more children over Covid-19 pandemic’s first year||Coronavirus and its restrictions are pushing already hungry communities over the edge, killing an estimated 10,000 more young children a month as meager farms are cut off from markets and villages are isolated from food and medical aid, the United Nations warned Monday.In the call to action shared with The Associated Press ahead of publication, four UN agencies warned that growing malnutrition would have long-term consequences, transforming individual tragedies into a generational catastrophe.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Hunger is already stalking Haboue Solange Boue, an infant from Burkina Faso who lost half her former body weight of 5.5 pounds (2.5 kilograms) in just a month. Coronavirus restrictions closed the markets, and her family sold fewer vegetables. Her mother was too malnourished to nurse.“My child,” Danssanin Lanizou whispered, choking back tears as she unwrapped a blanket to reveal her baby’s protruding ribs.More than 550,000 additional children each month are being struck by what is called wasting, according to the U.N. — malnutrition that manifests in spindly limbs and distended bellies. Over a year, that’s up 6.7 million from last year’s total of 47 million. Wasting and stunting can permanently damage children physically and mentally.“The food security effects of the COVID crisis are going to reflect many years from now,” said Dr. Francesco Branca, the WHO head of nutrition. “There is going to be a societal effect.”Click here for complete coronavirus coverage From Latin America to South Asia to sub-Saharan Africa, more poor families than ever are staring down a future without enough food. In April, World Food Program head David Beasley warned that the coronavirus economy would cause global famines “of biblical proportions” this year. There are different stages of what is known as food insecurity; famine is officially declared when, along with other measures, 30% of the population suffers from wasting.The World Food Program estimated in February that one Venezuelan in three was already going hungry, as inflation rendered salaries nearly worthless and forced millions to flee abroad. Then the virus arrived.“Every day we receive a malnourished child,” said Dr. Francisco Nieto, who works in a hospital in the border state of Tachira.In May, Nieto recalled, after two months of quarantine, 18-month-old twins arrived with bodies bloated from malnutrition. The children’s mother was jobless and living with her own mother. She told the doctor she fed them only a simple drink made with boiled bananas.“Not even a cracker? Some chicken?” he asked.“Nothing,” the children’s grandmother responded. By the time the doctor saw them, it was too late: One boy died eight days later.The leaders of four international agencies — the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the World Food Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization — have called for at least $2.4 billion immediately to address global hunger. But even more than lack of money, restrictions on movement have prevented families from seeking treatment, said Victor Aguayo, the head of UNICEF’s nutrition program.“By having schools closed, by having primary health care services disrupted, by having nutritional programs dysfunctional, we are also creating harm,” Aguayo said. He cited as an example the near-global suspension of Vitamin A supplements, which are a crucial way to bolster developing immune systems.In Afghanistan, movement restrictions prevent families from bringing their malnourished children to hospitals for food and aid just when they need it most. The Indira Gandhi hospital in the capital, Kabul, has seen only three or four malnourished children, said specialist Nematullah Amiri. Last year, there were 10 times as many.Because the children don’t come in, there’s no way to know for certain the scale of the problem, but a recent study by Johns Hopkins University indicated an additional 13,000 Afghans younger than 5 could die.Afghanistan is now in a red zone of hunger, with severe childhood malnutrition spiking from 690,000 in January to 780,000 — a 13% increase, according to UNICEF.In Yemen, restrictions on movement have blocked aid distribution, along with the stalling of salaries and price hikes. The Arab world’s poorest country is suffering further from a fall in remittances and a drop in funding from humanitarian agencies.Yemen is now on the brink of famine, according to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, which uses surveys, satellite data and weather mapping to pinpoint places most in need.Some of the worst hunger still occurs in sub-Saharan Africa. In Sudan, 9.6 million people live from one meal to the next — a 65% increase from the same time last year.Lockdowns across Sudanese provinces, as around the world, have dried up work and incomes for millions. With inflation hitting 136%, prices for basic goods have more than tripled.“It has never been easy but now we are starving, eating grass, weeds, just plants from the earth,” said Ibrahim Youssef, director of the Kalma camp for internally displaced people in war-ravaged south Darfur.Adam Haroun, an official in the Krinding camp in west Darfur, recorded nine deaths linked with malnutrition, otherwise a rare occurrence, over the past two months — five newborns and four older adults, he said.Before the pandemic and lockdown, the Abdullah family ate three meals a day, sometimes with bread, or they’d add butter to porridge. Now they are down to just one meal of “millet porridge” — water mixed with grain. Zakaria Yehia Abdullah, a farmer now at Krinding, said the hunger is showing “in my children’s faces.”“I don’t have the basics I need to survive,” said the 67-year-old, who who hasn’t worked the fields since April. “That means the 10 people counting on me can’t survive either.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hunger-to-kill-128k-more-children-over-covid-19-pandemic-s-first-year/story-8rXyGjNOCdKHX8mSUA01uL.html

North Korea has long said that it sees its nuclear arsenal as the best way of protecting itself from a US invasion.“We will not stop for a moment in the process of forming the best national security power that no one can challenge,” Kim said.While Trump has left the door open for another summit with Kim, North Korea has said it sees no point in engaging with Washington, accusing it of breaking promises made at the first historic summit two years ago and turning dreams for peace into “a dark nightmare.”Kim and Trump have met three times since 2018 but have little to show for their unprecedented discussions. Trump has called for the “complete, verifiable and irreversible” of North Korea’s atomic arsenal before it can receive relief from sanctions choking its paltry economy. Pyongyang’s leaders see giving up the weapons as political suicide, and Kim has been busy adding to his stockpile of nuclear warheads and missiles as the talks with Trump have sputtered.The Kim regime also has an incentive to keep tensions from getting out of control and prompting more international sanctions. Kim’s decision to shut borders in January due to the coronavirus slammed the brakes on the little legal trade the state has, and could send the economy into its biggest contraction in more than two decades, according to Fitch Solutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-defies-donald-trump-s-call-to-give-up-nuclear-weapons/story-FtV7pW4klVk4arLaOOETKM.html

The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency launched a search for the group after one Rohingya migrant found Saturday on the islet off the northern resort island of Langkawi told investigators that at least 24 other Rohingya were missing.Following further interrogation, the agency found 26 Rohingya refugees hiding on the islet on Sunday, said senior agency official Zawawi Abdullah. The group included 12 men, 10 women and four children, officials said. Zawawi said the Rohingya were believed to have been transported by local fishermen from a main vessel further out at sea and let off near Langkawi so they could sneak in undetected. The Rohingya have been detained for further investigation and will be handed to the immigration department, he said in a statement. Two other Rohingya migrants were also arrested for suspected trafficking. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar due to a military crackdown, and many live in densely crowded refugee camps in Bangladesh. Muslim-dominated Malaysia has been a common destination of boats arranged by traffickers who promise the refugees a better life abroad.Last month, Malaysian authorities detained 269 Rohingya and found a body on board a suspected smuggling boat off Langkawi that they said had been intentionally damaged so it couldn’t be turned back to sea. The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency later said that the 269 were transferred from a larger vessel on which dozens of people were believed to have died and their bodies thrown into the sea. Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said Malaysia cannot accept any more Rohingya refugees as it struggles with an economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic. But he said those already in the country will not be sent back to sea. Malaysia is home to over 2 million illegal immigrants as well as some 180,000 refugees and asylum seekers — including 101,000 Rohingya — who are registered with the UN refugee agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/26-rohingya-feared-drowned-found-hiding-on-malaysian-islet/story-bi3esm9mjRsSHyDRFVJpkN.html
28-07-2020||World||WE charity deal: Justin Trudeau to appear before parliamentary panel for questioning||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will appear before a parliamentary panel on Thursday to face questions in a probe relating to the grant of a nearly billion dollar contract to a charity with links to him and his family. Trudeau has suffered a double-digit dive in his popularity in the country since the controversy erupted.Trudeau will face questioning from the finance committee of the House of Commons on Thursday for an hour. His Chief of Staff Katie Telford will be grilled after that. There is still no word from the Prime Minister’s Office whether he will also appear before the House of Commons ethics committee which is also investigating the matter of the CA $912 million contract to WE Charity to administer a summer youth volunteer programme. The contract was cancelled after the uproar over Trudeau’s personal connection to the organisation, with his mother, brother and wife being paid fees at various times. Canada’s Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner is also looking into the issue.Trudeau is already paying a political price for the contract even after he apologised for not recusing himself when the cabinet decided on the contract. According to a new survey from the non-profit Angus Reid Institute or ARI, Trudeau’s approval ratings have dropped from 55 per cent in May to 44 per cent now, with more citizens holding a negative view of him.“More troublingly, half of Canadians (53%) say that their opinion of the Prime Minister has worsened in the past month or so,” ARI noted in a release. Trudeau’s approval numbers had rebounded due to the perception of effective handling of the health crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. However, those gains have vanished courtesy the WE charity controversy.ARI pointed out that a plurality of 43 per cent said the Trudeau government “knowingly committed an unethical act”, while another 37 per cent felt its decisions “constitute a possibly criminal act that warrants investigation by police.” Just 12 per cent were willing to accept it as a error in judgement. The country’s finance minister Bill Morneau is also the subject of probes related to his own links to the charity. He has already appeared before the finance committee.However, this also does not mean that Canadians believe that the Liberal Party government will collapse as more revelations come. In fact, 56 per cent think the government will survive the scandal, though with Trudeau’s image badly battered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-charity-deal-justin-trudeau-to-appear-before-parliamentary-panel-for-questioning/story-jijjDMqbXnj5Q0SWjo2mGK.html
28-07-2020||World||New Zealand suspends extradition treaty with Hong Kong||New Zealand announced Tuesday it will follow the lead of its intelligence allies by suspending its extradition treaty with Hong Kong.The move comes in response to China passing a sweeping new security law for the semi-autonomous territory.New Zealand is the final member of the “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing alliance to take such action after the US, Australia, Canada and the UK previously announced similar measures.New Zealand relies on China as its largest trading partner and in the past has often tried to avoid direct political confrontation. China each year buys billions of dollars worth of New Zealand’s agricultural goods, including its lucrative milk powder which is used in infant formula.But Foreign Minister Winston Peters said the new law went against commitments China had made to the international community.“New Zealand can no longer trust that Hong Kong’s criminal justice system is sufficiently independent from China,” Peters said in a statement.He said there would be other changes to the relationship. New Zealand would now treat military and technology exports to Hong Kong in the same way as it treats such exports to China, he said, and had updated its travel advice to warn New Zealanders about the risks they faced under the new law.“New Zealand remains deeply concerned at the imposition of this legislation, and we will continue to monitor the situation in Hong Kong as the law is applied,” Peters said. “As a result, the review of our cooperation settings with Hong Kong will be ongoing.”China says the new security law is needed to combat terrorism and separatism and prevent Hong Kong from becoming a base for undermining Chinese state power. In general, cases would be tried in Hong Kong, but the law allows for mainland jurisdiction in some circumstances.China’s embassy in Wellington, led by ambassador Wu Xi, said Tuesday it was preparing a response to the announcement. Earlier this month, as New Zealand considered such a move, the embassy put out a statement urging the nation to “stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and China’s internal affairs, and refrain from going any further down the wrong path.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-suspends-extradition-treaty-with-hong-kong/story-fwyIhLHXNhFuIWYNi8Of0K.html
28-07-2020||World||Vietnam’s Covid-19 calm shattered by sudden surge in community infections||After almost 100 days without a new local patient, Vietnamese had all but claimed victory over the novel coronavirus. They were packing beaches in Danang, hitting Ho Chi Minh City’s nightclubs and shedding masks. Now the masks are back on as the government scrambles to contain a sudden and unexpected flare-up in community infections after officials reported 15 new cases in three days from the central coast region.The startling news, which began on Friday with a suspected case and carried over into the weekend with four new virus patients, underscored the unrelenting nature of the virus. Vietnam is joining a number of other regions, from South Korea to Germany, combating new clusters of unknown origins to head off raging outbreaks.The Southeast Asian country is throwing every weapon in its arsenal at its effort to contain the new spread in Danang. Authorities announced 11 more cases Monday night, all of them tied to a Danang hospital where other cases have been treated. Four of the 11 are medical staff, while the rest are patients who have been treated at the hospital.Vietnam’s first case since April 16 was perhaps the most unnerving: a 57-year-old grandfather who had been in Danang city for about a month and hadn’t travelled to other provinces. The latest wave triggered concerns among government officials that Vietnam, which has now reported 431 infections, may be vulnerable to imported virus cases from people crossing the border illegally into the country. Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc ordered tighter border and immigration controls and police have made a number of arrests of Vietnamese and Chinese charged with shepherding people into the country illegally.Still, Vietnamese health officials, like their counterparts in other countries, are puzzling over where the new infections came from. Hong Kong, for instance, had enjoyed three months of normal life before a surprise July resurgence that could be its worst wave ever. Infections of unknown origins have surged to half of all new local cases.So Vietnamese leaders are doing what has succeeded in the past: deploying swift and blunt lockdown-like actions to try to contain the virus.Danang’s authorities shut down two hospitals where two victims visited and ordered their patients, medical staff, caregivers and family members -- about 7,000 people in total -- to be quarantined for 14 days, local media reported. A third city hospital was also locked down, VnExpress reported.Phuc issued a stay-at-home order for parts of Danang, a city of 1.1 million people who are being urged to suspend “non-urgent activities” while public transportation is halted except for the transporting of materials for production, workers, experts, and people ordered into quarantine, the government said in a statement Monday.Furthermore, operations of private vehicles are being restricted and festivals, religious ceremonies and operations of beauty spas, bars, massage parlours and dancing halls are temporarily suspended. Meanwhile, some 80,000 travellers clamoured to get out of the city as domestic airlines increased flights to ferry them home.And in Hanoi, some 790 kilometers to the north of Danang, officials were re-issuing anti-virus mandates -- including the wearing of masks in public areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vietnam-s-covid-19-calm-shattered-by-sudden-surge-in-community-infections/story-bywehNnwivvx6JDiQt4pcK.html

Vietnam, widely seen as a success in dealing with the coronavirus, reimposed a social distancing order in Da Nang following the confirmation of the cases, the first known to be locally transmitted in the country in over three months.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  A 57-year-old man was confirmed to be infected by the coronavirus on Saturday, the country’s first local case since April. Three more cases were confirmed over the weekend, followed by 11 more on Monday, the Ministry of Health said. On Sunday, the government reimposed a social distancing order on the city.The new outbreak sparked fear among tourists in the city, with many cutting their trips short. The Civil Aviation Administration said the country’s four airlines have added extra flights and larger planes to transport the people, mostly domestic tourists, out of the city.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know today “It will probably take four days to evacuate the 80,000 passengers,” CAA director Dinh Viet Thang said in a statement.

Covid-19 has killed nearly 650,000 people worldwide and battered economies.Moderna could have tens of millions of doses ready when and if the vaccine is deemed safe and effective, Collins told reporters on a call.Pfizer said that if the trial was successful, it could seek regulatory approval as soon as October and supply vaccines for 50 million patients, at two doses each, by the end of the year. Pfizer aims for about 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021, and Moderna aims for 500 million-1 billion doses a year, beginning 2021, Moderna chief executive Stephane Bancel said on the call. The late-stage trials are designed to evaluate the safety of vaccines and determine if they can prevent symptomatic Covid-19. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease official, said a readout from the Moderna trial could come by November or even earlier. Fauci said he was “not particularly concerned” about the vaccine’s safety after seeing data from earlier, smaller trials. He also said he had briefed President Donald Trump about the trial the Oval Office on Monday.As other companies ready inoculations, the Covid-19 Prevention Network, a US government-funded program formed by the NIH, said it plans to roll out a large-scale clinical trial of a Covid-19 vaccine candidate with at least 30,000 participants each month through fall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-pfizer-start-decisive-covid-19-vaccine-trials-eye-year-end-launches/story-kbPj8xxwxLZQjoSvUWeTQI.html
28-07-2020||World||Iraq PM Mustafa Al-Kadhimi orders probe after 2 protesters killed in clashes||Iraq’s prime minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi said Monday he had ordered an investigation into the killing of two anti-government protesters, saying security forces were not authorised to fire “a single bullet” toward the demonstrators. Twenty-one protesters were also wounded in the overnight clashes. Separately, four katyusha rockets landed in Camp Taji, north of Baghdad, which houses US-led coalition troops, according to three Iraqi security officials. One official said the rockets targeted a runway used by Iraqi helicopters, close to where American forces are present. One helicopter was damaged. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.The violence comes after months of quiet in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, and were an embarrassment to prime minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, who has vowed to meet protester demands by holding early elections and investigating the death of hundreds of protesters at the hands of security forces in recent months. Tensions between the security forces and the demonstrators soared late Sunday when dozens of protesters cut the road connecting two main intersections — Tayaran Square and Tahrir Square — in the capital Baghdad. Some burned tires while others chanted slogans about power cuts in the scorching summer months. Iraq is facing electricity shortages amid searing summer temperatures that can top 50 degrees Celsius, or about 122 degrees Fahrenheit. A senior Electricity Ministry official said the power supply fell short by 10,000 megawatts this summer, down 1,000 megawatts compared to last year, due to lack of maintenance in several power plants because of lack of of funds in state coffers. This has also slowed investment projects to add more power to Iraq’s grid, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. “Every bullet directed our youth and our people while demanding their rights is a bullet directed at our dignity and principles,” al-Kadhimi said in a televised speech Monday evening. He said he had ordered a probe and requested to have the facts before him within 72 hours. Al-Kadhimi said there is no “magic solution” for Iraq’s electricity problem, which is a result of decades of corruption and mismanagement and “cannot be resolved overnight.” He said his government was working on a solution, and reiterated his intention to pave the way for early elections in line with protesters’ demands. In October, mass anti-government protests erupted in Baghdad and across Iraq’s predominately Shiite south as tens of thousands of angry Iraqi youth took to the streets to decry rampant government corruption, unemployment and poor services, including electricity. Pressure from protests lead to the resignation of Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi. Since October, over 600 demonstrators have been killed during protests due to live fire and tear gas used by security forces. But al-Kadhimi, who was sworn in as prime minister in May, also has to cope with an unprecedented economic crisis spurred by falling oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic. Iraq’s health ministry has reported 110,032 cases, including 4,362 deaths.The spread of the coronavirus had halted mass rallies and prompted most protesters to leave, with only a few remaining at the tent sit-in at Tahrir Square, once the epicentre of the protest movement. Ali al-Bayati, a spokesman for the semi-official Independent High Commission for Human Rights, also said two protesters had been killed. The commission said their reports indicate live fire and pellet rifles were used to disperse protesters. Earlier, Iraqi security officials said demonstrators had hurled firebombs and stones at the riot police, while rights monitors said security forces set fire to demonstrator tents at Tahrir Square. A statement from the military spokesman Yahya Rasool said security forces had been given strict instructions not to use violence against peaceful protesters “except in the event of extreme necessity.” He said the events in Baghdad squares were “unfortunate” and that a probe was underway into what happened. “We are aware of the difficulties that our people are going through,” Rasool said. “This government, with its short life, is trying to address (them) under exceptional economic and health conditions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraq-pm-mustafa-al-kadhimi-orders-probe-after-2-protesters-killed-in-clashes/story-SQoSPQzYvEPRPyZ2GStTzJ.html
28-07-2020||World||‘Americans need help’: GOP rolls out $1 tn stimulus to start talks with Democrats||Senate Republicans presented their $1 trillion plan to bolster the pandemic-ravaged US economy in a series of bills that would trim extra unemployment benefits, send $1,200 payments to most Americans and shield businesses, schools and other organizations from lawsuits stemming from coronavirus infections.The package was pulled together after days of negotiations between Senate Republicans and President Donald Trump’s emissaries that didn’t completely settle differences within the GOP over the size and scope of additional federal spending in response to the pandemic.“We have one foot in the pandemic and one foot in the recovery,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday on the Senate floor, noting the rising death toll and a fragile economic recovery. “The American people need more help, they need it to be comprehensive, and they need it to be carefully tailored to this crossroads.”The bill introductions were just the first step toward negotiating a compromise plan with Democrats, who’ve offered their own $3.5 trillion stimulus plan.Kicking off talks, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer met in her office for almost two hours with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows Monday evening.“We will be back tomorrow,” Meadows said as he left. “We had a good meeting. A very productive meeting.”Pelosi delivered a harsh assessment of the GOP plan, calling it a “pathetic” piecemeal approach and saying it wasn’t adequate to the country’s needs.“Having said that, we are going to see if we can find some common ground,” she said. “But we are not there yet.”Congress has little time to act: supplemental unemployment insurance is expiring and other elements of the last stimulus legislation are beginning to dry up. Lawmakers are set to leave for an August break in two weeks and will be facing a timetable compressed by the looming November election when they return in September.Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said Congress is “chasing a moving target” with stimulus bills.“I fear Covid will cast a long shadow on the economy and the aid Congress is offering up is too little too late,” Swonk said. “The bankruptcies and failures that will mount could leave us a much smaller and fractured base from which to rebuild.”Continuing dissent among Republicans makes McConnell’s negotiating position more difficult.“There is significant resistance to yet another trillion dollars,” Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas told reporters. “As it stands now I think it’s likely that you’ll see a number of Republicans in opposition to this bill and expressing serious concerns.”There also was a split between the White House and Senate Republicans. Meadows had suggested that Congress pass a much smaller package of school and unemployment benefits and continue negotiating a larger plan through August. McConnell’s statement that the bill had to be comprehensive was a rejection of that position.Schumer called the GOP effort to put together a package a “slow-motion train wreck” that has delayed getting legislation through Congress.“They can’t even put one bill together, they are so divided,” he said.There are some areas of common ground between Democrats and Republicans. Both agree on sending another round of stimulus payments to individuals, though Democrats want to increase the amount paid to dependents and expand eligibility. The Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses is another measure that both parties support and is all but assured will be in the final bill.Republicans have agreed to extend supplemental unemployment benefits, but they propose cutting supplemental unemployment benefits to $200 weekly from $600 until states are able to create a system that would provide 70% of a laid-off worker’s previous pay up to a state-set cap, according to two people familiar with the plan.Schumer said tying the payments to actual wages will be “unworkable” for most state unemployment systems, which had trouble distributing the flat $600 payment that was part of the March stimulus bill.The GOP plan also includes money for virus testing and to help with distribution of an eventual vaccine, as well as aid for schools.Two of the biggest fights ahead are likely to be over two issues that are key for both sides: Democratic demands for aid to states and a GOP measure that provides protection against lawsuits stemming from coronavirus infections when businesses and schools reopen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/american-people-need-help-gop-rolls-out-1-trillion-stimulus-to-start-talks-with-democrats/story-51vLlUzjS5H4QAFidz7MNJ.html

The Food and Drug Administration said Monday there have been increasing reports of injury due to people using-- sometimes ingesting—the unauthorised sanitisers, which can lead to blindness, heart problems and death. The active ingredient that kills germs in legitimate sanitisers is ethyl alcohol, which is consumable. But some Mexican companies have been replacing it with poisonous methanol, or wood alcohol, which is used in antifreeze. The FDA first issued a consumer warning about the products last month.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  Last week the agency issued a warning letter to Mexican manufacturer Eskbiochem SA de CV for marketing sanitiser containing more than 80% methanol and falsely claiming that it was “FDA approved”. The FDA has posted a “do-not-use” list of more than 80 sanitisers on its website and blocked their importation. The agency said it is working with retailers to recall products remaining on US store shelves.

28-07-2020||World||Trump lawyers renew legal assault on tax records subpoena||President Donald Trump’s lawyers filed fresh arguments Monday to try to block a criminal subpoena for his tax records, saying it was issued in bad faith, might have been politically motivated and calling it a harassment of the president.Lawyers filed a rewritten lawsuit in Manhattan federal court to challenge the subpoena by a state prosecutor on grounds they believe conform with how the U.S. Supreme Court said the subpoena can be contested.They asked a judge to declare it “invalid and unenforceable.”The high court ruled earlier this month that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. could subpoena tax records from Trump’s accountant over his objections.But the court said Trump could challenge the subpoena as improper just as anyone else can.Trump’s lawyers had argued that the president could not be criminally investigated while he was in office.In their new court papers, Trump’s lawyers said the subpoena of his tax records was “wildly overbroad” and “amounts to harassment of the President.”They said it was issued in bad faith, copying a Congressional subpoena.“Whether the District Attorney photocopied a congressional subpoena for political reasons, for efficiency reasons, or for both, he knowingly and intentionally issued a wildly overbroad subpoena for the President’s records,” the lawyers said.They said the subpoena seeks detailed information about all of Trump’s assets in the U.S. and abroad for a 10-year period.“Simply put, it asks for everything,” the lawyers wrote.Vance sought the tax records in part for a probe of how Trump’s then-personal lawyer arranged during the 2016 presidential race to keep the porn actress Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal from airing claims of extramarital affairs with Trump. Trump has denied the affairs.Vance, a Democrat, has requested eight years of the Republican president’s personal and corporate tax records.Danny Frost, a spokesperson for Vance, declined comment Monday.The Supreme Court had returned the case to a federal judge in Manhattan who has arranged for both sides to finish filing their legal arguments over challenges to the subpoena by mid-August.Last year, the same judge ruled against Trump in a written opinion that was upheld by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.In their new court filing, Trump’s lawyers said the tax subpoena “demands voluminous documents related to every facet of the business and financial affairs of the President and numerous associated entities — from the banal to the complex, from drafts and memoranda to formal records, from source documents to summaries.”They said it was wrong for Vance to seek records dating to 2011 when he was primarily investigating events that took place in 2016.The lawsuit said the subpoena concerns entities in California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. It said other affected entities are located outside the U.S., including in Canada, the Dominican Republic, Dubai, India, Indonesia, Ireland, the Philippines, Scotland, and Turkey.“Taken together, the subpoena demands an accounting and analysis of every single asset and liability of the President, including each one of the listed entities,” the lawyers wrote, calling the request “an overreaching demand designed to pick apart the President.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-lawyers-renew-legal-assault-on-tax-records-subpoena/story-EbvHG6YXkazoSpldCuQVUI.html

The first governor of the presidency of Fort William, Bengal, Clive died in London 1774. His statue was one of many recently identified across the UK for removal by Black Lives Matter campaigners.Steve Charmley, deputy leader of the council, said on Monday: “Today, as a society, we are finally facing up to painful and shameful periods in our history and having to address subjects that cause real distress to some members of our community, especially when they aren’t managed sensitively. The way we interpret the past is hugely important”.On July 16, in a meeting of the full council, 28 councillors voted in favour of the recommendation that no further action be taken on the demand to remove of the statue, while 17 voted against the proposal and one councillor abstained.Charmley added: “We believe we should not erase controversial history but, rather than celebrate and glorify such people and events, find appropriate ways to mark and learn from them…(We) are currently exploring the possibility of placing a plaque next to the statue to factually bring more of his story and background to life.”During the July 16 meeting, one of the reasons mentioned to support the recommendation that the statue should not be replaced was the existence of Clive’s statue in Kolkata (colonial Calcutta was the initial capital under the East India Company).Clive’s statue in Shropshire has been the subject of a petition and counter-petition. After thousands signed the petition calling for its removal, thousands more backed the counter-petition, insisting that “removing statues does not change history nor help us learn from it. Shropshire has been influenced by the actions of Robert Clive, whether we condone all of his actions or not”.The Black Lives Matter campaign witnessed protests across the UK after George Floyd’s death in the US, gathering momentum after the statue of slave trader Edward Colston was pulled down in Bristol in early June. The campaign has prompted a review of public spaces in London and elsewhere on symbols of racism, colonialism and slave trade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shameful-period-of-british-history-plaque-likely-beside-clive-statue/story-u6sZRQaiJTqcJHsGwGy5RN.html
28-07-2020||World||Vaccine alliance eyes range of prices for Covid shots, says $40 would be maximum||Coordinators of a global coronavirus vaccines funding scheme are looking at a wide range of potential prices for Covid-19 shots, with a reported $40 per dose price tag the “highest number” in that range, one of the co-leads of the project said on Monday.Seth Berkley, chief executive of the GAVI vaccine alliance, which is co-leading the COVAX facility designed to ensure fair global access to Covid-19 shots, said the facility had no specific target price and would also seek to negotiate tiered pricing for richer and poorer countries.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageBerkley rejected comments from European Union sources last week who said the COVAX facility was targeting a $40 price for Covid vaccines for wealthy countries. The EU sources had said the EU would be seeking to secure cheaper deals outside of the COVAX scheme.“There was a large range of numbers, and they (the EU sources) put the highest number out,” Berkley said in an interview. He said that in a presentation to EU officials, COVAX officials had given “a range of different prices”.“And that ($40) was the maximum price in the range for high income countries, rather than a set price,” he told Reuters.COVAX is co-led by GAVI, the World Health Organization and the CEPI Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and is designed to guarantee fast and equitable access globally to Covid-19 vaccines once they are developed. Its aim is to secure supplies of and deliver 2 billion doses across countries who sign up by the end of 2021. GAVI said earlier this month that more than 75 countries have expressed interest in joining COVAX.Berkley said most vaccines are so early in the testing process that it’s too soon to know what the final price will be. “The truth is nobody has an idea what the price is going to be, because we have no idea which (potential Covid) vaccine is going to work,” he said. He said questions about which technology might be most effective, whether vaccines would be single or a double dose, or what yields from manufacturing facilities might be were still unanswered and would all influence eventual vaccine pricing.Berkley said COVAX has started putting together estimates based on what is known, but there are no firm prices. “The challenge is trying to come up with a cost. Anybody who tells you they know isn’t being honest.” Berkley, who through the GAVI alliance negotiates with manufacturers to bulk-buy vaccines for use in poor countries, said drugmakers frequently use a tiered pricing approach, in which poorer countries pay one price, middle-income countries a higher price, and rich countries pay the highest price. He said it’s not clear what manufacturers of potential Covid-19 vaccines will propose, but they are trying to put forward cost estimates based on what they know so far. “You’re going to have a range of different prices, depending upon which ones (vaccine candidates) are going to succeed.“Frankly, it’s likely that we’ll have lower prices given the large volumes that we’re trying to access here.”Berkley said COVAX and several others are also including a “speed premium” into the cost of Covid-19 vaccines that encourages companies to make millions of doses at risk, even before they know if their vaccine candidate works. “We see that as being 15% or 20% of what the cost will be,” he said.

28-07-2020||World||IMF grants $4.3 billion to South Africa in biggest coronavirus loan||The International Monetary Fund approved $4.3 billion in emergency funding for South Africa, the largest emergency disbursement for any country yet to assist with fighting the coronavirus pandemic.The funds “support the authorities’ efforts in addressing the challenging health situation and severe economic impact of the Covid-19 shock,” the Washington-based lender said in a statement Monday. “Once the pandemic is behind, there is a pressing need to ensure debt sustainability and implement structural reforms to support the recovery and achieve sustainable and inclusive growth.”With more than 445,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases and almost 7,000 fatalities, South Africa is the worst-hit country on the continent. A lockdown aimed at curbing the spread is devastating the economy, with the government expecting it to contract 7.2% this year.Even before the pandemic hit, South Africa was stuck in its longest downward cycle since World War II and the gross domestic product probably contracted more than 30% in the second quarter, according to central bank forecasts. Government debt is now projected to peak at close to 90% of GDP in 2023-2024 and the budget deficit will swell to a record this year.“Going forward, our fiscal measures will build on our policy strengths and limit the existing economic vulnerabilities which have been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic,” Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said in a statement Monday.The lockdown that started on March 27 and has been eased gradually is weighing on output and will further reduce tax revenue that’s been falling short of targets for most of the past five years. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a 500 billion-rand ($29.9 billion) stimulus package in April and the National Treasury has said the government is seeking $7 billion of this from multilateral lenders.Other LoansThe New Development Bank has already granted a $1 billion loan, while the nation is borrowing about 5 billion rand ($300 million) from the African Development Bank. The country will seek up to $2 billion from the World Bank, according to Treasury Director-General Dondo Mogajane.The IMF money comes after some senior officials in the ruling African National Congress and its alliance partners initially rejected suggestions that the government seek help from multilateral lenders, saying the structural adjustments associated with such loans would undermine the nation’s sovereignty. However, the IMF emergency loans that are aimed at the virus and health interventions come without the normal conditions that have concerned past borrowers.The IMF in April doubled its emergency lending capacity to $100 billion, and Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said that the fund will mobilize more than $18 billion to respond to requests from more than 40 African countries. The lender has now approved more than $14 billion in emergency financing to help nations on the continent, including $3.4 billion for Nigeria and $2.8 billion for Egypt. On top of that. the IMF last month approved a 12-month $5.2 billion standby arrangement for Egypt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-grants-4-3-billion-to-south-africa-in-biggest-coronavirus-loan/story-sJmGVro6ZurkKLZtw4cSUK.html

Presiding over a virtual meeting with his counterparts from the three countries, China’s foreign minister Wang Yi said the four states should work together to extend CPEC to Afghanistan. The video conference, organised by Beijing ostensibly to discuss the Covid-19 pandemic, was held against the backdrop of the months-long India-China border standoff. Given India’s currently strained ties with Nepal, the meeting is unlikely to go down well with the foreign policy establishment in New Delhi. ALSO WATCH | AK-47 magazines, Chinese grenades seized from LeT hideout in ShopianWang, one of China’s senior-most diplomats with the rank of state councillor, said the four states should give “full play to geographic advantages, strengthen exchanges and connections between the four countries and Central Asian countries, and maintain regional peace and stability”, according to a statement in Mandarin issued on Monday night. Also read: India will resist China’s economic imperialism |OpinionThe four countries should also “actively promote the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and the trans-Himalayan three-dimensional interconnectivity network, support the extension of [CPEC] to Afghanistan, and further release the regional interconnection dividend”, he said. Even for China, it is rare to call for four-party cooperation in South Asia without involving India. But the move fits Beijing’s current narrative. The statement from China’s foreign ministry indicated Beijing is looking at a more permanent cooperation mechanism with the three South Asian countries than just working together to counter the pandemic. The meeting added to Beijing’s own narrative that it is ready to play a bigger role in war-torn Afghanistan’s peace process. For Nepal, it was an opportunity to send out a message about its increasingly snug ties with China amid the strained relations with India. Also read: In China’s troop movements in Ladakh’s depth areas, a hint about its real planAs for Pakistan, Wang himself cited the example of “iron brother” ties between Islamabad and Beijing. Emphasising that having good neighbours is “good fortune”, Wang called on Nepal and Afghanistan to follow the example of Sino-Pakistan cooperation to fight the pandemic. Wang said learning from the Sino-Pakistan cooperation, Afghanistan and Nepal should expand four-nation joint prevention and control of Covid-19 and make arrangements for epidemic prevention, resumption of economic activity and personnel exchanges. He said under the principle of anti-epidemic cooperation, the four countries should open up “fast channels” and “green channels” for personnel and logistics as soon as possible. They should also strengthen joint prevention and control in border areas, and frame jointly recognised standard operating procedures for epidemic notification, prevention, management and control, he said.

India’s June 29 ban on 59 mobile apps with Chinese background, including WeChat, “severely damaged the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies”, Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong said in a statement. “The Indian government has the responsibility to protect the legitimate rights and interests of international investors in India, including Chinese businesses, in accordance with market principles,” she added. “The Chinese side has lodged solemn representation to the Indian side and asked the Indian side to correct its wrongdoings,” Ji said, responding to a media query on whether WeChat was asked to stop providing services to its Indian users. The ban orders for the Chinese apps and their clones are among a string of economic measures unveiled by the Indian government in the wake of the months-old border standoff between the two countries. There was no immediate reaction by Indian officials to the Chinese spokesperson’s comments. Following the death of 20 Indian soldiers in a brutal clash with Chinese troops in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), there were demands from the public and political parties for restrictions on trade ties with China. Spokesperson Ji said the Chinese government “consistently asks Chinese enterprises to abide by international rules and local laws and regulations when conducting external cooperation”. She added, “Practical cooperation between China and India is mutually beneficial. Deliberate interference in such cooperation will not serve the interests of the Indian side. China will also take necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.” Despite the June 29 ban, Indian users of WeChat were able to use the communication app till the weekend. When users sought to use the app this week, they received a message saying services were not available due to local restrictions. On Monday, India’s information and technology ministry announced the fresh ban on 47 apps, most of them clones and variants of the apps banned in June. The total number of Chinese-origin mobile applications blocked is 106. The government is also examining other Chinese apps for violating user privacy and national security....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/firms-rights-will-be-safeguarded-china-on-fresh-ban/story-GmKQHzt3qDV2ZrgLZEuOdP.html

It should not happen.” Banerjee made the remark, without naming Dhankhar or the office he holds, while attending a virtual programme in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched high throughput Covid-19 testing facilities at the Indian Council for Medical Research’s (ICMR) national institutes in Mumbai, Kolkata and Noida in Uttar Pradesh. “I take strong exception to such uncharitable, unfounded and unmerited stance. These are unbecoming of the position you hold,” Dhankhar wrote in the two-page letter which was released to the media. “I am not a stakeholder in politics but have undoubted stakes in governance in the state in view of my constitutional obligation….,” wrote Dhankhar who has been accused by the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) on numerous occasions of acting like a spokesperson of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the main adversary of Banerjee in the coming 2021 assembly polls. The acrimonious relationship between Raj Bhawan and the government has been making headlines since September last year with the TMC accusing Dhankhar of overstepping his limits and interfering in day-to-day affairs of the government. Giving a long account of what he has done as governor, Dhankhar wrote, “Non responsive stance at your end is not in consonance with the Constitution. I am required to be aware of the state of affairs and affairs of the state.” Accusing the state police of “putting a finger in every pie,” Dhankhar wrote that “failed governance at ground level cannot be covered up by cosy position in the media.” Bengal’s minister of state for parliamentary affairs Tapas Roy took a swipe at the governor by saying if Dhankhar had no stake in politics then he would not have reacted to the chief minister’s statement that did not even mention him. “It was a virtual meeting between the chief minister and the prime minister and Dhankhar had no role there. He should rather play a sympathetic role to help people affected by the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-am-not-a-stakeholder-in-politics-governor-dhankhar-tells-mamata-banerjee/story-8rNPLb2ff22kqQRgEwRFzN.html

Thirtythree health workers were among the infected and the active cases stood at 10,091 while 679 people were discharged on Tuesday, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said. At the Kinfra Park in Menamkulam here around 300 people were tested and 88 of them found positive for the virus, he said. Dismissing allegations that several Covid-19 deaths were not being reported in the state, he said the state government has been declaring the fatalities as per the guidelines issued by the World Health Organisation. “As per the guidelines, it’s a COVID death when a person dies due to severe coronavirus infection fatally affecting his organs. If a COVID patient dies in an accident or commits suicide or is drowned, it’s not a COVID death,” he said. The expert panel of the health department will take the decision. Of the fresh cases, a total of 888 were infected through contacts while the source of infection of 55 people was not yet known, he told reporters here. While 122 people had come from abroad, as many as 96 returned to Kerala from other states. The four deaths were reported from Ernakulam, Kasaragod, Alappuzhaand Thiruvananthapuram districts, Vijayan said. Over 1.56 lakh people were under observation. Thiruvananthapuram, Kottayam, Malappuram and Thrissur districts recorded over 100 cases on Tuesday and there were 486 hotspots in the state. In the last 24 hours, 19,140 samples were tested, taking the cumulative to 3,62,210specimens. Results were awaited for 6,596 samples. Thiruvananthapuram with 227 cases on Tuesday topped the districts in the fresh infections, followed by Kottayam 118, Malappuram 112 and Thrissur 109.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-s-covid-19-tally-crosses-20-000-mark-death-toll-climbs-to-67/story-P2O3GUo0I1GTUp2v1vjecK.html

Earlier, there were reports that the senior IAS officer will be made an approver in the case but the official quoted above denied it. Though the government disowned the once powerful principal secretary and acted against him, many in the ruling CPI(M) fear that the probe will be used to embarrass the state government. The opposition parties, the Congress and the BJP, have sought CM’s resignation alleging he was aware of his secretary’s actions. BJP national president J P Nadda also took potshots at the government saying “gold is yellow everywhere but it is red in Kerala.” On Tuesday, Sivasankar was questioned for more than 10 hours at the NIA office in Kochi. Later, he was allowed to go to his Thiruvananthapuram home. He was grilled twice by the customs and the NIA in Thiruvananthapuram and was later summoned to Kochi.Once the face of the government, Sivasankar got embroiled in the controversy after the seizure of 30 kg gold from a consignment sent to an employee of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on July 5. It was reported that some officials at the CM’s office had allegedly pressurized the customs to release the consignment.Also Read: Kerala gold smuggling accused funded terror activities: NIABut Sivasankar reportedly told investigators that though he knew some of the accused including Swapna Suresh, he was not aware of their smuggling background.

28-07-2020||India||India’s involvement in ITER reflects capabilities for advanced design and manufacturing: PM Modi||As scientists started assembling the world’s largest fusion device at ITER in southern France on Tuesday, India said the project demonstrated the country’s capabilities for design and manufacturing at the most advanced levels. A special message from Prime Minister Narendra Modi was delivered by India’s envoy to France, Jawed Ashraf, during the virtual ceremony at ITER headquarters that marked the start of the assembly. French President Emmanuel Macron and leaders from China, Japan, South Korea, Russia, the US and Europe joined the event. “India is proud to be part of a global enterprise that is at the frontier of science and engineering,” Modi’s message said. “Indian scientists have made valuable contributions to the development and fabrication of the cryostat, the cooling system, the cryo-distribution system and several kilometres of cryo-lines. They remain involved in many other aspects of the project,” it added. India’s scientists also demonstrated the country’s “capabilities for design and manufacture at the most advanced levels”, the message said. “Equally, our institutions, scientists and engineers have benefited enormously from collaborating with their peers from around the world,” it added. The ITER machine, the world’s biggest science project, is being assembled to replicate the Sun’s fusion power. The assembly began after components arrived from around the world, reflecting the willingness of 35 partner countries to work together in the fight against climate change. Fusion provides clean and reliable energy without carbon emissions. It involves minute amounts of fuel found in seawater and lithium. A pineapple-sized amount of fuel is the equivalent of 10,000 tons of coal. The cost of a fusion plant is expected to be on the lines of the cost of a nuclear fission plant, but without problems associated with nuclear waste. Modi’s message described the beginning of ITER assembly activities as an “important milestone in the progress of project”. Scientists and engineers around the world developed a range of components that represent design, innovation and engineering of great complexity and precision, while adhering to schedules and timelines despite restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the message said. The prime minister wished the project, which reflects international collaboration at an unprecedented level, all success on behalf of 1.3 billion Indians. The country is represented in the international project by ITER-India, which is under the Institute for Plasma Research and governed by an empowered board chaired by the secretary of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE). India became the seventh full partner of ITER in December 2005. ITER-India designed and built the country’s contributions to ITER, including the cryostat, a massive vacuum containment vessel that is the single largest component of the ITER machine. According to the organisation’s website, the ITER machine will be the first fusion device to produce net energy and maintain fusion for long periods of time. It will also be the first fusion device to test integrated technologies, materials and physics regimes needed for the commercial production of fusion-based electricity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-involvement-in-iter-reflects-capabilities-for-advanced-design-and-manufacturing-pm-modi/story-rsi383AySAqpG3XEStXdRK.html

At present only 230 special passengers are plying while cargo and parcel trains have been allowed to operate since the lockdown began. “In the month of July the average speed of freight trains is 45.03 kmph which is around double as compared to last year for the same month (23.22 kmph). West Central Railway with the average speed of 54.23 kmph, Northeast Frontier Railway with the speed of 51 kmph, East Central Railway 50.24 kmph, East Coast Railway 41.78 kmph, South East Central Railway 42.83 kmph, South Eastern Railway 43.24 kmph and Western Railway with the speed of 44.4 kmph are the leading Railway Zones in the average speed of freight train in Indian Railways,” the ministry said.It also marginally inched higher in its freight loading on July 27 as compared with the same period last year at 3.13 million tonnes with an increase of 0.3%. However, the cumulative, overall loading of freight trains remains 18.18% less than last year.On July 27, the Railways loaded a total 1,039 rakes with freight including 76 rakes of foodgrain, 67 rakes of fertilizer, 49 rakes of steel, 113 rakes of cement, 113 rakes of iron ore and 363 rakes of coal. “Railways has achieved record loading of foodgrains this fiscal which is 80%more than last year, and has also introduced time tabled parcel services – 4,541 services and transported 2.41 lakh tonnes cargo generating a revenue of Rs 86.88 crore,” said railway board chairman VK Yadav said at a press conference on Tuesday.Food grain distributions during the lockdown had more than doubled with the Railways transporting 5.2 million tonnes of foodgrains in April after the country went under a lockdown on March 25 to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease, Hindustan Times had reported on April 27.Railways has set an ambitious target of achieving freight loading 50% more loading in the current financial year as compared with FY 2019-2020, Yadav said.“These improvements in freight movements will be institutionalized and incorporated in the upcoming zero based time table. These steps will lead to significantly higher freight traffic and earnings for Railways and cost competitive logistics for the entire country,¨ he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doubled-speed-of-cargo-trains-during-lockdown-increased-freight-loading-railways/story-yOBrdHaYzk4BCmSwf3RQMK.html

28-07-2020||India||Indian Navy’s clear message to Beijing following escalation of border tension ‘registered’ by China: Report||The Indian Navy’s clear message to Beijing through its aggressive deployment of almost all frontline warships and submarines in the Indian Ocean Region following escalation in the border row in eastern Ladakh has been “registered” by China, top defence sources said on Tuesday. The Indian Navy deployed a range of its frontline warships and submarines in the Indian Ocean Region(IOR) to send a clear message to China when the border tension escalated manifold in the wake of the Galwan Valley clashes on June 15. The sources told PTI that the government adopted a multi-pronged approach involving the Army, the Indian Air Force(IAF) and the Navy as well diplomacy and economic measures to send a clear signal to China that its misadventure in eastern Ladakh was not acceptable at all. They said the three service chiefs are engaged in deliberations on almost a daily basis to ensure a coordinated approach in dealing with the situation as well as to make China understand about India’s clear message. The sources said the three services are coordinating on the military response to the border row. The Navy has significantly expanded its deployment in the IOR deploying a plethora of warships and submarines to create pressure points on China as the maritime space around the Malacca Strait is very critical for its supply chain through sea routes. “Yes, our message has been registered by China,” said a source without elaborating. Asked whether China has responded to India’s deployment, the sources said there was no visible increase in forays by Chinese ships in the IOR. They said the reason could be the PLA Navy’s excessive deployment of resources in the South China Sea following the strong opposition by the US to Beijing’s expansive territorial claims in the region. The US sent a number of its warships to the South China Sea to demonstrate freedom of navigation and rallying support to countries who have territorial disputes with China over the region. The Indian Navy is also ramping up its operational cooperation with various friendly naval forces like the US Navy and Japan Maritime Self Defense Force in view of the fast evolving regional security landscape. Following the Galwan Valley clashes, the IAF deployed almost all its frontline fighter jets like Sukhoi 30 MKI, Jaguar and Mirage 2000 aircraft in the key frontier air bases in eastern Ladakh and elsewhere along the Line of Actual Control(LAC). The IAF has been carrying out night time combat air patrols over the eastern Ladakh region in an apparent message to China that it was ready to deal with any eventualities in the mountainous region. The Army significantly enhanced deployment after the clashes in Galwan Valley that left 20 Indian soldiers dead. The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details. According to an American intelligence report, the number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35. Following the Galwan Valley incident, the government has given the armed forces “full freedom” to give a “befitting” response to any Chinese misadventure along the LAC. After the last round of military talks, government sources said the Indian side conveyed a “very clear” message to the Chinese army that status quo ante must be restored in eastern Ladakh and it will have to follow all mutually agreed protocols for border management to bring back peace and tranquillity.

28-07-2020||India||Slouching towards BJP? Ex-ally HD Kumaraswamy goes all-out against Congress||In a withering attack against its former ally, Janata Dal (Secular) leader HD Kumaraswamy alleged that the Congress is synonymous with horse-trading. Till about a year ago, his party ran a coalition government with the Congress in Karnataka.The JDS leader ridiculed the national party’s ‘save democracy’ campaign being run by it currently in light of developments in Rajasthan.Pointing out that while the Congress is running a campaign against the BJP and accusing it of buying MLAs to topple democratically elected governments, Kumaraswamy said: “What has the Congress done? Haven’t they lured all BSP MLAs who supported the Congress to form government in Rajasthan? Is this not a buyout?”“Is this democratic behavior? If you are dividing the like-minded party MLAs supporting you, through deceit, who would support you? Are these mistakes not visible to you?” he questioned.The former CM accused the Congress of working to divide the JDS in the past.“Is it not a fact that for the sake of one Rajya Sabha seat, the Congress government in Karnataka purchased eight JDS MLAs? Is this democracy? Didn’t Congress conspire to form a government after the 2018 assembly polls by buying our MLAs? Does Congress have the moral courage to answer these questions?” Kumaraswamy said in a statement.The Kumaraswamy outburst comes at a time when he is increasingly seen by analysts as being soft on the BJP. Even as the Congress has repeatedly attacked the BJP government and alleged massive corruption in the purchase of Covid treatment-related equipment, the JDS has been rather quiet about it.Both Kumaraswamy and Deve Gowda have asserted that the priority right now is to fight the pandemic and bills about purchases could be examined later. This has been interpreted by analysts as being soft on the ruling party and leading to speculation about the relationship between the two parties.On July 23, addressing a press conference to respond to charges on corruption related to purchase of Covid related equipment, revenue minister R Ashoka had pointedly asked the Congress to “learn from JDS on how to work with the government during a pandemic rather than level baseless allegations”.The Congress, however, chose to react rather cautiously to Kumaraswamy’s latest outburst.Speaking to HT, Congress’s chief spokesperson BL Shankar said: “Our Save Democracy campaign is to ensure that the spirit of the constitution is upheld. We want everybody to examine how elected representatives should not be bought and sold as well as the role of the Governor, the speaker, and the whip. Kumaraswamy’s comments are unwarranted, ill-timed, and inappropriate as it is the duty of opposition parties to join hands to prevent the constitution from being subverted.”Asked whether JDS was cosying up to the ruling party in the state, Shankar said: “It is for each party to take decisions on the road ahead.”BJP spokesperson S Prakash though welcomed Kumaraswamy’s comments, saying: “It is borne out of the experience he must have had while dealing with the Congress.”Prakash though said that there was no question of the BJP having any truck with the JDS. “We have a majority of our own. Why would we (need their) help?”Political analyst Manjunath though said that recent remarks by JDS showed the party’s growing closeness to the BJP.“Though Deve Gowda today made some comments against the state government asking it to withdraw some of the recently issued ordinances, JDS realises that as long as Shivakumar and Siddaramiah are at the helm of the Congress in Karnataka, they have a challenge on hands. There is no love lost between Siddaramiah and the Gowdas. Also, the JDS fears Shivakumar might emerge as the leader of Vokkaligas, who traditionally have been its most solid supporters. Which is why JDS is increasingly soft on the BJP,” said Manjunath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/slouching-towards-bjp-ex-ally-hd-kumaraswamy-goes-all-out-against-congress/story-CUiMRF9goNfZmvBZG4bFKK.html

28-07-2020||India||NIA arrests DU professor Hany Babu in Bhima Koregaon case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) said Tuesday it has arrested an associate professor of English of Delhi University in connection with the Bhima Koregaon Elgar Parishad case.Hany Babu Musaliyarveettil Tharayil, 54, is a resident of Gautam Buddha Nagar in Uttar Pradesh. The case relates to inciting people and giving provocative speeches during an Elgar Parishad event organised by the Kabir Kala Manch at Shaniwarwada in Pune on December 31, 2017, which promoted enmity between various caste groups and led to violence resulting in loss of life and property and statewide agitation in Maharashtra, an NIA spokesperson said.On September 11, 2019, the Pune police had searched his house in connection with the Elgar Parishad case. The Pune Police filed a charge sheet and a supplementary charge sheet in this case on November 15, 2018 and February 2, 2019 respectively.The spokesperson said that during investigation, the NIA found that senior leaders of CPI (Maoist), an organisation banned under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, were in contact with the organizers of Elgar Parishad as well as Hany Babu to spread the ideology of Maoism/Naxalism and encourage unlawful activities. The NIA took up the investigation of the case on January 24 this year and arrested two other accused - Anand Teltumbde and Gautam Navlakha - on April 14.“During further investigation, it was revealed that accused Hany Babu Musaliyarveettil Tharayil was propagating Naxal activities and Maoist ideology and was a co-conspirator with other arrested accused,” the NIA spokesperson said.Hany Babu will be produced before NIA Special Court in Mumbai on Wednesday, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-arrests-du-professor-hany-babu-in-bhima-koregaon-case/story-SAafTMG22XjKxeoSKSp30H.html

The bomb squad soon reached the spot with sniffer dogs followed by a criminal investigation department (CID) team. Police have started an investigation. The parcel was booked through EMS Speed Post by a man named Anirudh Bhardawaj who deals in air guns in Amritsar, police said. The parcel, which was shipped on July 10, was meant for Anuj Tamang, a local resident. Tamang is being questioned. Kunwar Bhusan Singh, deputy commissioner of police, Siliguri (Zone 2), said, “The investigation has so far revealed that the parcel contained inflammatory substance used as cartridge in air guns.” Also Read: 2 killed as heavy rains lash north Bengal, thunderstorm forecast for KolkataArchana Dey, the postmaster of Pradhan Nagar post office said, “The parcel reached the post office in the morning.” A senior police officer told HT that inflammatory substances cannot be shipped through post offices and it is being probed how the parcel was sent from Amritsar.

28-07-2020||India||‘Will verify it’: Centre to top court on J&K L-G’s 4G restoration remark||The Central government told the Supreme Court, on Tuesday, that it will verify media reports claiming that Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) Lieutenant Governor GC Murmu advocated restoration of 4G internet services in J&K.The centre, through its top law officer Attorney General KK Venugopal, was responding to an argument by NGO Foundation for Media Professionals which claimed that Murmu had made a statement to the media that 4G should be restored, a stance contrary to the central government’s, which in its affidavit had said that such restrictions will have to continue for two more months before they are reviewed again.“In our affidavit, we have attached a news report showing L-G has made a statement that 4G should be restored. It is also in line with the statements by J&K interlocutor Ram Madhav. I have submitted those media reports,” senior counsel Huzefa Ahmadi, who was appearing for the petitioner NGO told the court.“We will verify it”, Venugopal told the court.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who was representing J&K, sought more time to file a response.The three-judge bench headed by justice NV Ramana posted the case for hearing on August 7.The Central government had told the court on July 21 that a special committee, constituted as per the Supreme Court’s May 11 order to review internet restrictions in J&K, has decided against affording any relaxation to such restrictions for the time being. In its affidavit, the MHA stated that the special committee held a meeting on June 10 where it comprehensively considered all aspects of the matter - including terrorist related incidents in J&K before deciding to continue with the restrictions on 4G mobile internet.The Centre’s response was to a petition moved by the NGO in June seeking initiation of contempt of court proceedings against the Central government and the union territory of J&K on the ground that no action was taken to comply with the top court’s judgment of May 11 to review restrictions on internet speed.The May 11 order was passed by the apex court on a plea filed by the NGO in April challenging the order issued by the J&K administration on March 26 restricting internet speed in mobile data to 2G and praying that 4G internet services be restored in J&K.The petitioner had claimed that patients, doctors, and the general public of J&K were unable to access the latest information, guidelines, advisories and restrictions about Covid-19 because of restrictions on mobile internet speed to 2G.It was also pointed out that slow internet speed also renders telemedicine (diagnosis and treatment of patients by means of telecommunication) or online video consultation impossible.The Supreme Court, in its May 11 judgment, refrained from passing directions to restore 4G mobile internet services in J&K instead constituting the special committee comprising high level government officers to take a call on the same and examine the necessity to allow faster internet in certain geographical areas of the newly formed union territory. The committee was to comprise the secretary of ministry of home affairs, secretary of ministry of communications and the chief secretary of J&K.The NGO then approached the court in June filing the present contempt petition claiming there is no information available in the public domain about whether the constitution of the special committee has been notified and whether it has conducted any meetings or passed any orders.The Central government has maintained that there is no contempt made out since the special committee was functional as per the Supreme Court judgment and it has reviewed the restrictions as directed by the court before deciding to continue with the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-verify-it-centre-to-top-court-on-j-k-l-g-s-4g-restoration-remark/story-wDC6vhjizyOGzhk3Ssb9QO.html
28-07-2020||India||Kerala Covid-19 tally crosses 20,000 with record single day spike of 1,167 cases||With the highest single-day spike of 1,167 cases, the total number of Covid-19 cases in Kerala crossed 20,000 mark on Tuesday, said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Out of 20,896 total cases, active cases are 10,091 and recovered 10,733, he said.With more four casualties death toll went up to 68 in the state. Situation in capital city Thiruvananthapuram remained grim with 227 fresh cases. The CM said in the state capital while checking 18 persons, one person was turning positive and it was a worrying point. Statistics show a steady rise in cases in the state from January 30, when the first case was reported in the state, it took almost five and a half months to reach 10,000-mark on July 16. But it took just 12 days to cross 20,000 mark. The CM said going by the present tally next month is really crucial for the state.Local transmission continues unabated. Earlier imported cases formed a large chunk of new cases but now local infections cause 70 percent of cases. Out of 1167 cases, 888 people contracted the virus through local contacts. Among fresh cases, 33 are health workers.“In India for every 12 people, one is tested positive but in Kerala, in 36 people one is getting positive. But in Thiruvananthapuram, it is 18: 1. This is really disturbing,” he said. He rejected the opposition charge the state lags behind in tests. “Opposition repeats it every day without checking facts. Our daily testing rate reached 20,000 a day. Let them say whatever they want,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-covid-19-tally-crosses-20-000-with-record-single-day-spike-of-1-167-cases/story-TmPYgamDELgwPR0UuaYeyH.html
28-07-2020||India||Ravi’s poetic tryst with number games!||Actor-anchor-producer Ravi Dubey added another feather in his cap. The young actor penned a hard-hitting poem on people’s obsession with staying on the top of the game. “I’m an actor and I believe everything else is an extension of it. One inspiring afternoon I was deliberating on various things that of late we all have gone through and I realised that currently we are in perpetual deadlock. It’s our obsession to stay top in number games in any job field for that matter, I felt the numbers are of prime relevance and creativity has taken a back seat,” said Ravi over the phone He says that this number game is applicable for the entertainment industry too. “This was actually distressing because we compromise with quality to keep up the number game. Sadly, we are made to engage into numbers from our childhood be it school, college, career or bank account — all that matters is numbers. So, I connected with all these thoughts and came up with this piece,” he said.Ravi has not only written but has narrated the poem too. He adds, “When I asked my wife (Sargun Mehta) for her opinion, she approved it and that made me a bit more confident. Then I narrated it to my friend Varun (Prabhudayal Gupta). He turned it around for me and put all his efforts to make it a happening project. And, that’s how the poem ‘Aankde’ came alive. If it was not for him, I wouldn’t have done the narration. Then of course the music by Shishir Samant made this video poetry complete.” The actor feels one should know how to differentiate between work and quality of work. “I don’t understand that why an actor needs to take up same kind of work to stay in limelight! Why I can’t opt for something that I am enjoying doing at the moment? After giving more than a decade to the industry I want to take up only quality work. With Sargun I shot for a video, then this video poetry and soon other projects will be on roll too.”Ravi’s last TV stint was as a host of a reality show. “When I started in 2006 then TV was very different in terms of stories, writing and characters. My last daily soap was ‘Jamai Raja’ and I really enjoyed playing numerous characters during the 5-year-old run. Then I tried my hand in reality TV and also hosted a couple of shows.” As a producer Ravi is planning to come up with multiple projects. “Not just as a producer but as an actor too there are multiple projects in pipeline across mediums. But, at present the creative side of me is highly active so in soon I’m launching my own music label under which ‘Aankde’ was our first venture. I am keeping my fingers crossed and hope after the ongoing crisis is over the industry will be back with a bang.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ravi-s-poetic-tryst-with-number-games/story-LsE0W8KyisIg8uRPyuxdzN.html
28-07-2020||India||With more rain forecast, Bihar’s flood situation set to worsen||With rain forecast in Nepal and in the catchment areas, the flood situation in North Bihar region is likely to deteriorate, officials said Tuesday. Bihar has received 706.4 mm rain against normal rain of 484.6 mm between June 1 and July 28 which is 46% above the normal. Darbhanga has received 127 % surplus rain followed by East Champaran with 103% during the same period, the Patna Met office said.. In Darbhanga district, the swollen Adhwara river set a new highest flood level (HFL) of 48.5 metres at Bishunpur after 35 years, officials said. The district has already been facing the devastation unleashed by Khiroi and Bagmati rivers for the past one week in the wake of rains in the foothills of the Himalayas in Nepal. The water resources department (WRD) has alerted the officials of Kishanganj, Purnia and Katihar districts after the Mahananda river rose by almost two metres at Taiyabpur in Kishangan on Tuesday forenoon. “The rise in water level of Mahananda was attributed to heavy rains in Nepal,” said WRD secretary Sanjiv Hans. The Burhi Gandak river which has flooded the parts of Muzaffapur, Khagaria and Samastipur, set a few HFL at Sakara in Muzaffapur and thereby exerting tremendous pressure on the safety embankment in the area. The Kosi is also flowing above the danger mark and is hovering near the HFL at Baltara in Khagaria. Left to fend for themselves, thousands of families have shifted on to embankments or on road with bare minimum belongings to save their life and wait for the water to recede to return home. “Hundreds of families have settled down in makeshift polythene tents on NH 28 near Dewapur and are somehow managing to live in the absence of any government relief,” said Manoj Yadav, a resident of Barauli in Gopalganj. Meanwhile, floodwaters from the Gandak, which had breached its embankment at three places in East Champaran and Gopalganj, have entered fresh areas. “Gopalganj is facing unprecedented floods, as pucca houses in Bhawanipur have got submerged with water for the first time in the past many decades,” said Somesh Datt, a local resident. Rail and road traffic have been disrupted in many districts for the past one week as approach roads to bridges have been washed away and floodwaters are overflowing the roads. The disaster management department (DMD) claimed that about 29.62 lakh people have so far been hit due to the floods in 837 panchayats of 101 blocks of 12 districts across the state. As many as 808 community kitchens are being run to provide food to those in the government-run shelters. A couple staying in a makeshift shelter on a roadside along Darbhanga- Jayinagar (NH-527B) at Koyla Asthan was crushed to death in their sleep by a speeding van early Tuesday morning. The deceased were identified as Surendra Yadav (40) and his wife Paramshila Devi (35), a native of Koyla Asthan village. Infuriated over the incident, local people staged a protest and blocked roads for nearly four hours in protest while seeking compensation for the bereaved family. The deceased had four children. The block development officer (BDO) Mahtab Ansari said an ex-gratia amount of ₹4 lakh each, besides ₹30,000 under National Family Benefit Scheme and ₹3,000 under Kabir Antyeshti Yojana were granted to the victims’ family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-more-rain-forecast-bihar-s-flood-situation-set-to-worsen/story-OEDAAbWVTqbbT4sLE5gZTL.html
28-07-2020||India||India, Mauritius PMs to inaugurate new Supreme Court building on Thursday||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Mauritius counterpart Pravind Jugnauth will on Thursday jointly inaugurate the new Supreme Court built in Port Louis with Indian grant assistance, reflecting New Delhi’s sharpened focus on its “neighbourhood first” policy. The Supreme Court building is one of five projects implemented under a $353-million special economic package extended by India in 2016. The structure is the first India-assisted infrastructure project in the capital of Mauritius. India also announced the implementation of nine “high impact community development projects” (HICDP) in the Maldives on Tuesday. Indian envoy Sunjay Sudhir handed over a symbolic cheque to mark the implementation of projects worth $5.6 million during a ceremony at the foreign ministry in Male, which was attended by foreign minister Abdulla Shahid and members of Parliament. New Delhi has taken several steps in recent days to revive economic activity amid the Covid-19 crisis and to shore up relations with key neighbours amid the border standoff with China. On Monday, India handed over 10 railway locomotives to Bangladesh. Over the weekend, India announced a $400-million currency swap facility under the Saarc framework for Sri Lanka. Another $400 million was provided through an extended currency swap arrangement to the Maldives and India will soon “announce another substantial financial assistance package” to help post-Covid-19 economic recovery. The inauguration of the new Supreme Court building in Port Louis will be done via video conference in the presence of senior members of the judiciary of Mauritius and other dignitaries. The building was completed within schedule and below the expected cost, the external affairs ministry said in a statement. The building, spread over more than 4700 sq m with 10 floors and a built-up area of 25,000 sq m, has green features and high energy efficiency. It will house all divisions and offices of the Supreme Court. In October 2019, Modi and Jugnauth inaugurated the first phase of the Metro Express project and a new 100-bed ENT hospital in Mauritius, also built under the special economic package. Construction of 12 km of the metro line was completed till last September, and work on a 14-km line in the second phase is underway. “The successful and timely completion of India-assisted high quality infrastructure projects in Mauritius shall also create greater opportunities for Indian companies in Mauritius and in the region,” the statement said. India and the Maldives signed a MoU on HICDPs during the visit of late former external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj in March 2019. A grant of $5.6 million was announced for these projects and there was another cash grant of $7 million for small projects. These projects, chosen by the Maldives, are meant to have a high level of community impact and participation in areas such as income generation, healthcare, education and sustainable development. The HICDPs include three fish processing plants in Addu city, the Addu Tourism Zone and a bottled water plant in Hoarafushi, which are being steered by local authorities. Contracts for building the fish processing plants were awarded on July 22 and contracts for five eco-tourism projects are expected to be awarded soon. Sudhir said India’s strategy for development cooperation with the Maldives includes big projects under a $800-million line of credit and a large number of smaller grant projects. He noted these projects are transparent and demand-driven, with full ownership for the Maldives government. Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said the standoff with China had clearly triggered a policy reappraisal by South Block. “India remains committed to its ‘neighbourhood first’ policy, which has led to many successes. South Asia is of immense importance to India’s national interests and it has to keep pursuing these goals,” he said. “Recent developments pertaining to Iran and Nepal underline the need to pursue the ‘neighbourhood first’ policy with greater commitment and perhaps greater generosity. We can expect more such initiatives, perhaps even for Myanmar,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-mauritius-pms-to-inaugurate-new-supreme-court-building-on-thursday/story-HMxmeZjRsK0SyqVuSQfdDL.html

The Rakhis made by the women of the PM’s parliamentary constituency have been sent through his parliamentary office in the city.Craftswomen including Shalini, Vandana, Rita, Pushpa, Sita along with craftsmen Virendra, Rajkumar and Rameshwar Singh reached the parliamentary office and submitted the Rakhi packets to parliamentary office in-charge Shiv Sharan Pathak. The office in-charge accepted the Rakhis and assured them that it would be sent today (Tuesday) only. Geographical indication (GI) expert Padma Shri Rajnikant, who helped the women make the wooden Rakhis, said that they started making them around a week back.Besides the Rakhis, the women also sent an accompanying letter to the Prime Minister requesting him to tie one wooden Rakhi on his wrist and to ensure that others being sent for the jawans in Galwan Valley reach them.The letter also acknowledges that the wooden Rakhis are a product of a GI initiative to promote wooden craft in Kashi.“With your blessings and taking inspiration from Atma Nirbhar Bharat, we decided to make Rakhis for the first time under Kashi’s GI registered craft ‘Wooden Lacquerware and Toys’ in which Rameshwar Singh (state awarded craftsman) provided much support. On the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, we are sending these Rakhis to the brave soldiers in the Galwan Valley,” says the letter.The craftswomen claim that around 50,000 pieces of handmade wooden Rakhis of Varanasi’s GI craft have been prepared and supplied giving employment to many women craftsmen during these times of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/varanasi-craftswomen-send-wooden-rakhis-to-pm-modi-and-jawans-in-galwan-valley/story-Pun3aOP5PtyBnIbnNi5TlJ.html

According to a bulletin by Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), the number of districts affected by floods, which was 28 two weeks ago, came down gradually to 21 on Tuesday. At present nearly 20 lakh people are still affected by floods—a significant drop since last 1o days when the figure has reached around 40 lakhs. One more death due to drowning was reported during the day, taking this season’s tally to 104. “Rainfall has eased in the past few days and flood waters are drying in most places. The situation is likely to improve further in the next few days as there is no prediction of heavy rainfall,” said Pankaj Chakraborty, state project coordinator, ASDMA.Over 42,000 people uprooted by flood waters are still taking shelter in 236 relief camps in 16 of the affected districts. Nearly 1 lakh hectare crop area continues to be inundated, said the ASDMA bulletin.

Villagers of Mungiakami, Tulasikhar, Twimadhu and other areas of the district resisted the medical teams on Monday, the first day of the survey, by blocking entry and exit points to their villages. They didn’t even agree to take part in the survey even after being told that samples would be collected only from those having symptoms of Covid-19. According to the police officials, the situation in all these places are peaceful but they are yet to give their consent to be covered under the survey.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.Director of health and family welfare department Dr. Radha Debbarma too visited the places and tried to convince the people. “We don’t know why they protested.

Bharadwaj had approached the Bombay high court against the rejection of her interim bail plea by the special NIA court in May. Though she has been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act (UAPA), Bharadwaj sought interim bail on medical grounds in light of the directions issued by the Supreme Court to decongest jails due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Bhardawaj’s lawyer Ragini Ahuja told a a division bench of justice R D Dhanuka and justice V G Bisht that though the application in HC had been filed on June 11, it was not heard earlier. Ahuja further submitted that Bhardwaj suffered from some chronic ailments and due to her co-morbid condition and the fact that the Covid infection had spread in some jails, she was seeking temporary bail. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh who appeared for the NIA opposed the application and submitted that Bharadwaj was being provided proper health facilities and her condition was being monitored regularly. In light of this and the fact that the UAPA did not have provision for bail she should not be granted it.Singh further submitted that the jail authorities were complying with directions of the court that were issued in other applications and said that he wished to place the judgments on record, which the court accepted. Singh said that he would submit the compilation by Thursday after which the court posted the matter for hearing on July 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-opposes-sudha-bhardwaj-s-bail-plea-says-she-is-getting-best-treatment-in-jail/story-whXn0NLOisZgqxmsTcH6AL.html

The development has brought into sharp relief the differences between LG’s office and the Delhi government on this issue. While the Delhi government has objected to the names alleging they were suggested by the Centre while highlighting the need for a “fair trial” citing the existence of serious questions over Delhi Police’s handling of the riots, the LG’s office has dismissed those concerns while stressing on the need for a dedicated team to handle the February riots cases with consistency across courts.Also Read: Kejriwal launches job portal to help boost Delhi’s economy, allows street vendors to operateDelhi Police had proposed to appoint six senior advocates for arguing on its behalf in 85 cases related to riots and also proposed that 24 cases related to anti-CAA protests could be assigned to public prosecutors. 53 people had died in north east riots.LG Baijal had written to Kejriwal earlier this month citing his deputy and acting Delhi home minister Manish Sisodia’s objections to the names and requested that the matter be reconsidered. It was also reported that differences between Baijal and Sisodia on the issue could not be resolved in a meeting held through video conference.“In view of urgency and sensitivity of matter, it is requested that the decision of Cabinet be communicated expeditiously, preferably within a week,” Baijal was quoted as having said in his letter.Also Read: Delhi govt launches portal for job-seekers, employersThe first round of confrontation between the AAP government and the L-G’s office took place in June this year over the appointment of 11 special public prosecutors for the communal riots cases.

The bridge is located on NH-31 C. The truck was carrying banana from Assam. The deceased were residents of Goalpara, Assam. Santanu Bala, sub-divisional officer of Malbazar, said “Raju Sheikh (40) and Debraj Saha (35) died when their truck met with the accident near Odlabari.” Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts are receiving heavy rainfall since Monday. Landslides have been reported at several places. Roads between Siliguri and Darjeeling have suffered damage due to landslides while the NH-10, which connects Sikkim to the rest of the country, is in bad condition in Kalimpong district. About a kilometre away from the where the truck fell through the bridge, the overflowing Leesh river has damaged another railway over-bridge, disrupting connectivity between Siliguri and the Dooars region. “There have been landslides at Mirik, Pankhabari and other places in Darjeeling district but there is still connectivity between Siliguri and Darjeeling,” said S Poonambalam, the district magistrate. In the plains of Darjeeling district, several bridges and culverts have been damaged. Some people were injured in Tindharia and Mirik when their houses were damaged. “In Kalimpong district, landslides have been reported in some places such as Yolbong and Mahakal Dara. There was a big landslide at a location along NH-10 on Monday night but the route to Sikkim has been cleared,” said R Vimala, Kalimpong district magistrate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-die-as-heavy-rainfall-damages-railway-over-bridge-in-north-bengal-triggers-landslides/story-3SuDZ0RkXJLVkMOIuaV5mL.html
28-07-2020||India||HC rejects pre-arrest bail pleas of two PMC Bank directors||The Bombay high court (HC) last Thursday dismissed anticipatory bail applications filed by two directors of scam-hit Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank. After perusing investigation papers Justice Sadhana Jadhav pronounced the operative order of rejecting anticipatory bail applications filed by the PMC Bank directors, Gurnam Singh Hothi and Daljit Singh Bal. The judge said neither of the PMC Bank directors deserved discretionary relief of pre-arrest bail. Hothi and Bal had moved the HC after the sessions court had rejected their anticipatory bail pleas. However, the sessions court had granted them interim protection from arrest till June 15, and the interim protection was extended by HC from time to time. While rejecting the applications, Justice Jadhav also withdrew the interim protection, and as a result, paved the way for the arrest of the two accused in the PMC Bank scam, estimated to be 7,457.49 crore. Detailed reasoning for dismissal of the pleas is awaited. The Mumbai Police’s economic offences wing (EOW) had on September 30, 2019, registered a case in connection with the fraud perpetrated by the bank officials and accused many of its directors of illegally extending huge loans to realty firm, Housing Development and Infrastructure Limited (HDIL) and its group companies to the tune of Rs 4,355 crore. According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), PMC Bank had masked 44 dodgy loan accounts involving advances to the tune of Rs 7,457.49 crore to some entities, including HDIL, by tampering with its core banking system, and the accounts were accessible only to select staff members. The bank had created 21,049 fictitious accounts in a bid to ensure its master data tallies to the loan disbursals of Rs. 7,457.49 crore, RBI has stated in an affidavit filed in response to other PMC Bank-related petitions before the HC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-rejects-pre-arrest-bail-pleas-of-two-pmc-bank-directors/story-z69YjrLhkDvVQ6pK733F7N.html
28-07-2020||India||Corbett has India’s largest tiger population among 50 reserves: report||Uttarakhand’s Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) has reported the highest tiger density among India’s 50 reserves with 14 tigers per 100 sq km, followed by Kaziranga, Nagarhole and Orang tiger reserves, according to the 656-page report ‘Status of Tigers Co-predators and Prey in India’, released by Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar on Tuesday on the eve of Global Tiger Day. According to the report, CTR has the highest tiger numbers with 231 inside the reserve and 266 using the reserve. CTR is followed by Nagarhole tiger reserve in Karnataka with 127 tigers, Bandipur Tiger Reserve (Karnataka) with 126 tigers and Bandhavgarh and Kaziranga tiger reserves with 104 tigers each. On Corbett Tiger Reserve, the report states, “A total of 5,004 tiger images were obtained from which 231 tigers were identified with tiger density estimated at 14 tigers per 100 km. Tiger population using the tiger reserve was 266, while the number of tigers present only in the tiger reserve were 231.” Dhananjai Mohan, Director Wildlife Institute of India (WII) said Corbett Tiger Reserve has maintained its top spot when it comes to tiger population among all the 50 tiger reserves in the country. “Last time in 2014 also, Corbett had recorded the highest tiger population for any tiger reserve in the country,” he said. According to the 2014 tiger census, Uttarakhand had 340 tigers including 215 in Corbett and 16 in Rajaji Tiger Reserves. On reasons for Corbett recording such a high number of tigers, senior scientist at WII Qamar Qureshi said that for a good tiger population you need a good prey base. “In the survey of the prey base in Corbett, we not only found it was good and one of the best in the country, it was also evenly distributed across the Corbett landscape. This has sustained a good population of tigers in Corbett”, he said According to the latest report, Corbett has a total of 32 species of ungulates, carnivores, omnivores, with chital, sambar and barking deer the most common species The tiger population inside the Rajaji tiger reserve is 38 while the number of tigers using the reserve is 52, says the report. Rajaji Tiger Reserve is spread over three districts including Haridwar, Dehradun and Pauri Garhwal over an area of nearly 1,150 sq km There are 442 tigers in Uttarakhand according to All India Tiger Estimation Report 2018 released by PM Narendra Modi in July last year in July. The tiger population in the Himalayan state has risen from 178 in 2006, 227 in 2010, 340 in 2014 and 442 in 2018. Parag Madhukar Dhakate, chief conservator of forests (CCF) Uttarakhand said a small Himalayan state recording such good tiger numbers, especially in Corbett is primarily due to good forest cover that harbours good prey base and focus on better conservation and protection strategies. “The combination of these factors has led to the thriving of tigers and their highest density tiger in the country”, he said. NTCA in collaboration with state forest departments, NGOs and coordinated by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), conducts national assessment for the ‘Status of Tigers, Co-predators, Prey and their Habitat’ every four years since 2006. The latest report assesses the status of tigers in terms of spatial occupancy and the density of individual populations across India. The report compares information obtained from the earlier three tiger censuses (2006, 2010, and 2014) with data obtained from the 2018 tiger census to estimate population trends at the country and landscape level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/corbett-has-india-s-largest-tiger-population-among-50-reserves-report/story-iwcEKO7UbDeGqbj88ypRWN.html

28-07-2020||India||Terming it anti-northeast, Assam groups and parties up ante against draft EIA 2020||The draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) notification, 2020, threatens to be the next flashpoint in Assam after the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, with several prominent groups and parties opposing it by terming it anti-north-east. Issued on March 12 by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), if implemented, EIA, 2020, will be applicable across the country and subsume EIA, 2006, with regards to setting up projects or expansion/modernisation of existing projects entailing capacity addition. The guidelines of EIA are used to study and predict the effect of a proposed activity/project on the environment. It is used as a tool to compare various alternatives for a project and tries to identify the one that represents the best combination of economic and environmental costs and benefits. The draft EIA notification, 2020, states that it aims to make the process of prior environment clearance “more transparent and expedient through the implementation of an online system, further delegations, rationalisation, standardisation of the process, etc”. But since the new draft reduces the period set aside for public consultation and allows post-facto clearance of projects, many groups, and parties are sceptical that it is aimed at hurting interests of Assam and the north-east and would harm the region’s fragile ecosystem.“This proposed law is objectionable primarily because it paves the way for post-facto clearance of projects in eco-sensitive zones and sidesteps inputs by communities likely to be adversely affected by such projects,” said Congress legislator and leader of opposition in Assam assembly Debabrata Saikia in a letter to Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar on July 23. “Private companies concerned can even prepare their own EIA reports by engaging private consultants. This is a travesty of natural justice and a body blow to the rights of indigenous people over their land,” he added seeking scrapping of the draft EIA notification, 2020, in its present form. Saikia cited EIA, 2020 as “extremely dangerous” for Assam and the north-east in view of the damage, which has already been caused by mining/drilling operations underway or sanctioned in national parks and wildlife sanctuaries in the region. “The EIA draft, 2020, legitimises the systemic repression perpetrated by the Central government. It is violative, exploitative, suppresses public involvement, and cripples biodiversity. Its inclusions are unjust, anti-democratic and anti-environment for Assam and the north-east at large,” Samujjal Bhattacharjya, chief adviser of All Assam Students Union (AASU), had tweeted on July 25. The opposition to EIA, 2020, has some recent context in Assam. On April 17, the National Board of Wild Life (NBWL) under the MoEFCC had allowed opencast coal mining at Dehing Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary, a move that caused an uproar in Assam. In May, the MoEFCC gave environmental clearance for extension drilling and testing of hydrocarbons at seven locations by Oil India Limited (OIL) under Dibru-Saikhowa National Park (DSNP) area in Upper Assam’s Tinsukia district. On May 27, a natural gas well of OIL located at Baghjan, adjacent to DSNP, had a blowout and then caught fire on June 9 killing two firefighters and displacing around 2,000 families besides causing ecological damage to the surrounding area. The gas well blaze is yet to be extinguished. “The Central government’s intention is to loot the land and resources of Assam and the rest of the north-east. Hence they brought out this draft EIA notification, 2020, which is detrimental to our interests,” Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti leader Manas Konwar had alleged at a press meet in Guwahati on July 25. “The draft EIA notification, 2020, allows the Centre to set up industry within a 100-kilometre (km) aerial distance from any international boundary without a public hearing. Since almost all states of the north-east, including Assam, are connected to international borders, this draft is directly against the interests of the people from the north-east,” said Partha Protim Bezbaruah, general secretary, Liberal Democratic Party, a regional outfit. The MoEFCC had published the draft EIA notification, 2020, on March 12 seeking feedback from the public within 60 days. Later, the Delhi high court had extended the deadline to August 11 owing to the prevailing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terming-it-anti-northeast-assam-groups-and-parties-up-ante-against-draft-eia-2020/story-973anIqcppVby9lDtcN6WP.html
28-07-2020||India||Companies are stressed, have little appetite for loans: Industry||Business have pointed to encouraging signs of growth recovery on the back of the resurgent rural economy, but expressed fears about stressed sectors such as aviation, hotels and commercial vehicles, two apex associations said in separate statements on Tuesday. They also said companies have little appetite for loans due to their inability to service debt amid the Covid-19 crisis. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said economic uncertainties are hampering industry’s ability to plan for the future, while the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) said companies are hesitant to take credit risk in these circumstances. Assocham secretary general Deepak Sood said the main issue today is capability to service debt rather than availability of loans. “With a large number of industries still operating at less than half the capacity, leveraging their balance sheets further would be counter-productive,” he said. Reeling under debt-ridden balance sheets and economic uncertainties in the face of the Covid-19 crisis, Indian industry is left with little appetite for any more loans, with the result that most bank deposits are either parked with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) or used by the central bank to fund ever-increasing government borrowings, Assocham said in a statement. Barring a few sectors, most others witnessed de-growth in credit deployment. Construction witnessed 3.7% contraction, while other sectors such as gems and jewellery (-3.7%) and leather and leather products (-4.4%) too were hit, it added. “Even after meeting the increased requirements of the government borrowings, the system is flush with liquidity with virtually no takers,” Sood said. The RBI Monetary Policy Committee should brainstorm on this difficult situation when it meets for the credit policy review, scheduled next month, he said, adding he expected a one-time loan restructuring. In a virtual conference between RBI governor Shaltikanta Das and CII members on Monday, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh and Kotak Mahindra Bank vice chairman Uday Kotak had proposed a one-time loan restructuring scheme to ease stress on businesses and lenders because of disruptions due to the pandemic. Das said the suggestion was noted. A one-time restructuring permits lenders to extend loan tenures or change payment terms to save the account from becoming a non-performing asset (NPA). The central bank is, however, opposed to the idea because in the past, loan restructuring led to ever-greening of loans rather than recognising them as bad loans. CII director general Chandrajit Banerjee said there are early signs of recovery, but it is critical to build on these by “deploying all the policy levers”. He said there are “promising signs”, pointing to a “V-shaped recovery” in the immediate aftermath of the lockdown. “In order to nurture the nascent signs of recovery, it is important to mitigate the uncertainties that are currently prevailing regarding the restrictions. Corporates are unable to plan beyond a horizon of a few weeks, affecting all operations,” he added. Banerjee said business activities “must be allowed to function, by removing the uncertainties associated with imposing ‘mini lockdowns’”. Although it is not possible to predict the course of the pandemic, a dashboard approach, triggering predictable responses based on the progression of infections, can reduce uncertainty and boost consumer and industry confidence, he added. “It is pertinent to note that the recession staring at us in the current year is different from the previous recorded episodes of recession which were all triggered by a monsoon failure,” he said. This year, the agricultural sector has emerged as the beacon of hope for India’s economy, he added. “Apart from normal monsoon and healthy sowing, a slew of government schemes in the form of livelihood interventions, such as expanding the MNREGA [Mahatama Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act] programme and the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan, have supported the rural economy considerably. This has raised hopes of a rebooting of the economy by the rural sector,” Banerjee said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/companies-are-stressed-have-little-appetite-for-loans-industry/story-tRiKwU0XWTtJ5KB1diIO4N.html
28-07-2020||India||Congress asks why Chinese company allowed into power sector in J&K||The Congress on Tuesday asked the government why a Chinese company with links to the PLA has been allowed into the strategic power sector in Jammu and Srinagar.Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said at a briefing that the company named Dongfang was even banned by the World Bank.“This company named Dongfang is active in many countries. It has a special relationship with Pakistan. It is not only under the direct control of Chinese government and army, but the World Bank also imposed a ban on it last year due to allegations of corruption,” Khera said.“We want to know from the Prime Minister why a controversial Chinese company is being allowed to come up in the border states that too in a strategically important area like energy?”Khera claimed that Dongfang has been given a contract for two lakh smart meters and warned that because it involves radio technology there is a danger of the two cities facing blackout or even data theft.“The company which got this contract subcontracted to Dongfang the remote communication technology component. In any smart meter the radio frequency system is a very critical component. If a company has the RF technology of a smart meter, that company can access the data of the consumer… that company can ensure a blackout in that area within minutes,” he said. Khera said while the government was right in banning Chinese mobile phone apps, it made no sense to allow a Chinese company to allow a foothold into a vital sector in strategic locations like Jammu and Srinagar.“On the one hand, apps related to China are being banned, on the other hand, why is important data of the citizens of Jammu and Kashmir being given to a Chinese company?” He said although trade is important, it should not compromise strategic interests.“Along with diplomacy, trade is also an important factor for the relationship between two countries. But no country does trade while risking its strategic interests,” Khera said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-asks-why-chinese-company-allowed-into-power-sector-in-j-k/story-Et4JHWsHrBiuvEuZgWwFEK.html

28-07-2020||India||Rajasthan cabinet sticks to July 31 as assembly session date, reply sent to governor||The Rajasthan cabinet chaired by chief minister Ashok Gehlot has decided to stick to its demand to convene the assembly session from July 31, instead after 21-days as recommended by the governor. The queries raised by Kalraj Mishra as a precondition for convening the assembly session were also discussed.A senior Rajasthan minister said that the party hopes that governor Kalraj Mishra “respects the constitution” and approved the cabinet’s proposal, failing which further course of action will be decided.“If still, he does not approve then it is clear that there is no constitution. They are doing politics by keeping aside the constitution. The governor should understand that this fight is for the pride and honour of Rajasthan,” state transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said after the cabinet meeting.Citing an example, he asked if the country would afford a similar hypothetical situation of the President turning down PM Narendra Modi’s cabinet proposal for convening a Lok Sabha session. “Then how will the country run,” he asked and added that “The BJP is doing politics to weaken Lok Sabha and state assembly”. He reiterated his party’s stated position that the governor had no right to reject the cabinet’s proposal.“We do not want any confrontation with the governor and neither have any resentment against him. The governor is the head of our family. Under article 163 of the India Constitution, it is clearly written that no governor of the country can deny the proposal by the cabinet,” he added.Governor Kalraj Mishra had returned Gehlot government’s earlier proposal for convening the assembly session from July 31 and suggested that he give 21 days notice for the same and made arrangements for social distancing and ensured live streaming of the floor test. Also Read: BSP to file plea in Rajasthan High Court tomorrow against merger of its MLAs with CongressCongress minister said the governor had no legal right to make the queries.“The governor’s query is simple and the replies were discussed. However, he has no right to query under the law,” Khachariyawas said.He said the business advisory committee of the assembly will decide the agenda of the session and the speaker will decide the seating arrangements as per social distancing norms in the assembly. On the issue of a 21-day notice for calling the session, the minister said it was just a delaying tactic.“The entire BJP is working as slaves of the Congress dissidents. If today, the BJP people are told by Congress rebels that don’t let the session begin then it will not happen. How much time should be given so that they can horse trade the MLAs but not one will break as people are awake,” he alleged.Also Read: Rajasthan cabinet meets to discuss points raised by governor for calling assembly sessionThe current threat to the state government has been precipitated by the rebellion of 19 Congress MLAs including former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot. The Gehlot government has blamed the BJP of plotting his government’s downfall in connivance with Pilot. It has also alleged that the governor is also acting unconstitutionally at the behest of the BJP leadership.Revenue minister Harish Choudhary said, “We don’t want the governor to follow us but the constitution, the law and the rules; this is what we are requesting. The Governor should leave the speaker’s issues to him, government’s issues with the cabinet, and he should also follow the Supreme Court judgments.”The governor has returned cabinet recommendations for calling the assembly session twice while raising technical issues.

28-07-2020||India||BJP MLA files petitions seeking disqualification of 6 BSP MLAs in Rajasthan||Madan Dilawar, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator, on Tuesday, filed two petitions in Rajasthan high court (HC), requesting disqualification of six Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) lawmakers, who had merged with the ruling Congress government in the state last year.  The six BSP members of Rajasthan legislative assembly (MLAs) who had merged with the Ashok Gehlot–led government are Sandeep Yadav, Tijara MLA, Wajib Ali (Nagar), Deepchand Kheria (Kishangarh Bas), LakhanMeena (Karauli), and Rajendra Gudha (Udaipurwati).  “Assembly Speaker CP Joshi had dismissed our plea without hearing our line of argument. This prompted us to move the HC against the Speaker’s decision. We have prayed before the court to disqualify the membership of the six BSP MLAs and pass an order that upholds justice and equality,” said Ashish Sharma, Dilawar’s counsel.  Also read: BSP to file plea in Rajasthan High Court tomorrow against merger of its MLAs with CongressWhen Dilawar was asked why they had to file two petitions in the court, he said, “initially a communication was conveyed to me from the assembly secretariat in which they had given me a two-line answer that your petition in front of the speaker has been rejected. Later in the day, the assembly secretariat sent us a detailed two-page reply on the disqualification petition filed by me hence we amended the petition and filed a revised petition,” added Dilawar.When Dilawar was asked on what grounds he had filed the petition of disqualification of six MLAs, he told that there has been no merger of the BSP into the Indian Nation Congress. Because even at present, the BSP is continuing as a recognized political party, both at the state as well as the national level.  “The BSP never merged with the Congress, therefore its legislatures have no right to merge with Congress or with any other political party. The six MLAs have voluntarily given up the membership of the BSP on whose ticket they were elected and have joined the Congress in violation of the provisions of law. Hence, they are liable to be disqualified under the 10th Schedule of the Constitution of India,” told Dilawar.He further said that as per 10th Schedule of the Constitution, the condition of two-third MLAs accepting the merger is a second condition, not the first. The first is that the original political party of the legislature who are claiming merger should have merged with another political party. The six MLAs have no right to merge their original party with another political party.“Also, the BSP remains as a separate political party at the national level as well as state level. Therefore, these MLAs cannot drive any benefit of the provisions of the 10th Schedule, even if all of them decided to merge with any political party,” Dilawar said.Legal expert Akhil Chaudhary said, according to the law, the BSP legislature party “is independent and is not subordinate to its national presence or leadership”. The law also says “two-thirds of the members of the legislature party” are eligible to join another political party or form a separate party.“Therefore, there is no question over the merger of the political party at a regional or national level. In our Constitution scheme, Vidhan Sabha is not subordinate to Parliament or any other house. The federal structure makes it independent, irrespective of multiple party systems. The merger is totally legal,” said Chaudhary.The BSP will also file a petition on Wednesday that will challenge the merger of the six MLAs who had won Rajasthan assembly polls in 2018 on the party’s symbol.“The merger of these six MLAs with Congress was unconstitutional. We are preparing a petition and will file a petition soon,” said Bhagwan Singh Baba, BSP’s Rajasthan president.  On Monday, the Rajasthan HC had disposed of the petition by Dilawar, who had questioned Speaker Joshi’s alleged inaction over the merger of six BSP MLAs with the Gehlot government last September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-mla-files-petitions-seeking-disqualification-of-6-bsp-mlas-in-rajasthan/story-P4AVYCW3XNEYzLAAtsCZaM.html
28-07-2020||India||PM Modi to meet banks, NBFCs tomorrow to discuss financial sector||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be joining banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) tomorrow evening to deliberate on the vision and roadmap for the future, tweeted his office on Tuesday.“The topics on agenda include credit products & efficient models for delivery, financial empowerment through technology, prudential practices for stability and sustainability of the financial sector,” said the Prime Minister’s Office in another tweet.The meeting assumes significance as the credit growth has slumped amid the economic slowdown that is caused by the coronavirus-induced lockdown. With businesses shut for so long, the bad loans are expected to pile up. In its latest Financial Stability Report, the RBI has projected that gross non-performing assets may rise from 8.5 percent to 12.5-14.7 percent by March 2021 depending on the severity of stress in the economy.The country’s bad loan ratio was already one of the highest among major global economies at 8.5% at the end of March 2020. If the macro-economic environment takes a turn for the worse later this year, the ratio may escalate to 14.7% under the severely stressed economic scenario, the RBI said in its report.At present, a moratorium provided on loan repayments for businesses and individuals is providing some relief for struggling businesses, but lenders may find a wave of loans turning into bad debt after that relief ends in August, the RBI cautioned.The top priority right now for all banks and financial firms should be to hike capital levels and improve resilience, the RBI governor said.As liquidity becomes limited in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, small and mid-sized non-bank financiers are going extremely slow on new loans, to a point when it is almost down to a trickle.For instance, the likes of IIFL Finance and Edelweiss Financial Services want to completely exit the wholesale loan business in the next couple of years by down-selling these assets. Nirmal Jain, chairman and chief executive, IIFL Finance told Mint in an interview that the NBFC industry is reorganising itself. “Things are not very easy,” said Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-join-banks-nbfcs-tomorrow-to-discuss-financial-sector/story-NTxHzRVsV6cjmc9BeFoUaP.html

BJP veterans L K Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi had recorded their statements last week. The mosque in Ayodhya was demolished on December 6, 1992 by ‘kar sevaks’ who claimed that an ancient Ram temple stood at the same site. The court is conducting day-to-day hearing in the case to complete its trial by August 31 as directed by the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/babri-mosque-case-special-cbi-court-completes-recording-of-statements/story-7yR7cgQ8O3cIW3INvCYEKO.html

These five jets include 3 single-seater and 2 twin-seater aircraft.WATCH | Rafale jets refuelled mid-air on their way from France to IndiaThe two-leg flight involves the Rafales covering a distance of nearly 7,000 km. The five fighters landed safely at Al Dhafra after a seven-hour flight from France on Monday evening.The French air force refuelled the Indian fighters using its Airbus A330 multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) aircraft on their way to Al Dhafra. Aerial refuelling support will be provided by the IAF’s Russian Ilyushin-78 refuellers for the second leg of the journey from Al Dhafra to Ambala.The jets are being flown by pilots who have undergone comprehensive training on the aircraft, the IAF said. The Rafales will be a part of the IAF’s No. 17 Squadron, which is also known as the ‘Golden Arrows.’India has taken a significant step in “strengthening its air power and defence preparedness” with the first five Rafale fighter jets, built by French aircraft maker Dassault Aviation, flying out from the Merignac airbase in Bordeaux, the Indian embassy in France said in a statement.“Real beauty and beast!” Indian ambassador to France Jawed Ashraf said while the planes were being flagged off in Bordeaux. “First five Rafale to India – swift, nimble, versatile, advanced and lethal,” he added.“This also marks a new milestone in the strong and growing India-France defence cooperation,” the Indian Embassy said in a statement.The new fighters — the first imported jets to be inducted into the IAF in 23 years after the Russian Sukhoi-30 jets entered service in June 1997 — will significantly enhance the offensive capabilities of IAF, which has for long planned to update its fighter jet force.Acting on a special request by the IAF, France has accelerated the deliveries of Rafale fighters to India. The first Rafale’s RB-001 tail number denotes the initials of the IAF chief: Rakesh Bhadauria. He led the complex negotiations for the Rafale deal.France handed over to India its first Rafale fighter during a ceremony attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh and his French counterpart, Florence Parly, in Merignac on October 8 last year. Air and ground crews of the IAF have been in France for almost three years for the management of the Rafale programme.India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016 as an emergency purchase to plug gaps in the IAF’s capabilities. The delivery of 36 fighters will be completed by the end of next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shots-from-30-000-feet-pics-show-rafales-re-fuelling-mid-air-on-way-home/story-iyFwCywE5ZXkXPjl5GVRyM.html

The murder was committed on Sunday night and the accused was arrested on Monday, said police. Surakhi police station in charge Anand Raj said the body of 16-year-old Lekhan Ahirwar from Gosra village was found on a cot in his house on Sunday night with deep injury marks on his neck. “The police team which reached there found that the deceased’s elder brother Madan Ahirwar was not present in the house and villagers told the team that the two brothers often used to have quarrels between them. A neighbour said he heard noise from the house on Sunday night but thought it was a usual quarrel between the two brothers,” he said. The police officer said the deceased’s parents were away in their agriculture field when the incident took place. The deceased’s younger sister who is mentally retarded was home. On getting information from some villagers that they had seen the elder brother near a hillock with an axe and some clothes in his hand the police team later detained him. “During interrogation Madan Ahirwar who is a school dropout confessed to have committed the crime. He told us that two to three days back his younger brother had stolen the memory card from his mobile phone and sold it to someone and despite repeated queries he didn’t admit that he had stolen the memory card. On Sunday night too, he again questioned his younger brother and wanted to know whom he had sold the memory card. His younger brother’s consistent denial of his alleged crime infuriated him and he hit him with the axe lying nearby that caused his death on the spot,” Rai said. The police officer said the accused was arrested under section 302 of Indian Penal Code. He was produced before a court from where he was sent to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/youth-kills-brother-on-suspicion-of-mobile-phone-memory-card-theft-in-mp/story-qiZTMs7rC33JDRaKVdcPSL.html

This decision was taken looking at the increasing cases of Covid-19 in the state. In the past week, over 1,000 cases have been reported from the state. After a meeting of the Gangotri Dham Temple Committee, Purohit and Sadhu Samaj, priests from Gangotri shrine unanimously decided that the shrine will remain closed till August 15 with immediate effect and the entry of pilgrims and devotees will be prohibited. The priest community has further decided to set up two-kilometre long barriers before the shrine and paste a poster with the details about the shrine being closed. Also read: India’s Covid-19 fatality rate falls to 2.25%, recovery rate crosses 64%Suresh Semwal, chairman of Gangotri Dham Temple Committee, said he has also informed the district magistrate of Uttarkashi in this regard through a memorandum. “Earlier, the temple was closed for darshan, now, we will block the entrance of the shrine by setting up barriers two kilometres ahead and prohibit the entry of anyone towards the shrine. We have decided this to prevent the community-spread of Covid-19 in this area,” said Semwal. The Uttarakhand government on Friday decided to allow pilgrims from other states to visit the Char Dham shrines with some conditions. According to the new guidelines, the pilgrims will need to have a latest RT PCR negative report (conducted within 72 hours of entering the state). Those who don’t have the negative report will be required to complete the mandatory quarantine period after entering the state before proceeding with their pilgrimage to Char Dham shrines.

The BSP on Sunday issued a whip to six MLAs, who had left the party to join the Congress last year, to vote against the ruling party in the state in case of a trust motion in the Assembly.“Undeclared spokespersons of the BJP have issued a whip in support of the BJP. But, this is not a whip but a clean chit to those who murder democracy and the Constitution,” she said in a tweet in Hindi.While the BSP MLAs have claimed that they have joined the Congress of their own will, the BSP has been claiming that since theirs is a national party, the local unit cannot merge on its own. The Congress government in Rajasthan led by Ashok Gehlot is facing a crisis after 19 of its rebel MLAs including Sachin Pilot revolted against it. Gehlot is now keen to prove his majority on the floor of the House and is now demanding a session of the Vidhan Sabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clean-chit-to-those-who-murdered-democracy-priyanka-gandhi-on-bsp-s-whip-to-mlas/story-7G1G3Q726GjBwyOmtbr80K.html

Earlier a National Congress Party (NCP) leader’s objections to Shiv Sena leader and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s possible participation in the event, made on similar grounds, was rejected both by Shiv Sena and the NCP. Apart from Thackeray, veteran BJP leaders LK Advani, MM Joshi, Uma Bharti, Vinay Katiyar and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat are also invited to the ceremony.Ram Temple construction at Ayodhya was cleared by a 5-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court, which handed over the disputed land to Hindu parties, finding legal merit in their claim to the site, considered to be the birthplace of Lord Ram.

To check the repeat of such an abhorrent incident, the state government should order a high level inquiry and take strict action against the culprits,” she said. The matter relates to village Kakarpura where Pooja (25) had died on July 19th. Her husband complained that they were not allowed to cremate the body by upper caste members. “My wife Pooja died after prolonged illness on July 19 and was taken for cremation on July 20. There was no objection by those in the village, but half a dozen members of the upper caste community came and objected to cremation by us as we are Gujrati ‘Nat’,” said Rahul Bajania, the husband of the deceased. “We had the pyre prepared but were forced to take the dead body away to village Nagla Lal Dass, about four kilometers away, where the cremation was undertaken finally,” said Rahul, who claimed that police had reached the village but were helpless in front of upper caste members. Superintendent of Police (West) Ravi Kumar said that no complaint was lodged in this regard. Later, the incident was highlighted by the local people on social media“We have not received any complaint but the Circle Officer for Achhnera circle has been assigned the task to find out more about the matter.

The increase in deaths has become a cause of concern for the administration.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had directed officials to form a task force for clinically ill patients in every district. The first such task force was created in Mumbai in April.On Monday, the chief minister directed health officials to form an integrated Covid-19 treatment procedure by discussing Allopathy, Homeopathy, Ayurveda and Unani medicine streams.“Two sets of instructions can be formed for the state task force, which will issue them for public usage. Prevention and treatment will be the two categories in which inputs from various treatment methods will be included,” Thackeray said.Maharashtra sits on top of the national Covid-19 tally with over 3.8 lakh cases of which nearly 1.5 lakh are active.

28-07-2020||India||Indian startup develops Covid 19 detecting mobile app, takes 5 minutes||A government supported IT company in Bengaluru has developed an application capable of capturing an individual’s vital health statistics through mobile phone to determine one’s propensity to Covid 19 infection and can potentially play a big role in early detection of disease and risk assessment of infected population, according to a ministry of science and technology. The new technology based on medical screening has the potential to detect possible infection in an asymptomatic individual, helping in prioritising the conventional testing queue as well as in risk assessment of an asymptomatic individual to establish if he/she can become symptomatic apart from assistance in risk assessment of an asymptomatic individual for recovery.The application, being developed by Bangalore based startup Acculi Labs, creates an individual’s Covid risk assessment profile called Lyfas Covid score. While AarogyaSetu works on the principle of contact tracing and requires an individual to feed symptoms, Lyfas is a “proper medical screening test” which purely depends upon test results.Generation of Lyfas Covid score has been achieved through repurposing Lyfas-- a clinical-grade, non-invasive, digital functional biomarker smartphone tool for screening, early detection, root cause analysis, acute event risk assessment, prognosis, and home monitoring of chronic diseases.“Lyfas is an Android application in which, when one keeps the index finger on the rear camera of a mobile phone for 5 minutes, captures the capillary pulse and blood volume change and derives 95 biomarkers with proprietary algorithms and signal processing techniques. It uses the power of smartphone processors and smartphone sensors to capture a bunch of body signals,” says the statement from the science and technology department of the government of India.Also Read: Covid-19 pandemic: Can you get the coronavirus twice?The signals hence captured are then processed on the principle of Photoplethysmography(PPG), Photo Chromatography(PCG), Arterial Photoplethysmography(APPG), mobile spirometry, and Pulse Rate Variability(PRV).“Lyfas then provides cardio-respiratory, cardio-vascular, hematology, hemorheology, neurology based parameters that are capable of tracking minute pathophysiological changes in the body. These changes are further profiled into organ system-wide response,” the statement adds.The technology has been proved to detect asymptomatic individuals with an accuracy of 92%, specificity of 90%, and a sensitivity of 92% in a study conducted with Medanta Medicity hospital, according to the government release. The tool can be handy for population screening, monitoring of quarantined individuals, and surveillance at the community spreading phase. “Witnessing the success of the study, the Medanta ethics committee has approved it for a larger population study. This study is currently registered in Clinical Trials Registry- India (CTRI) and is acknowledged by the World Health Organisation (WHO),” the statement adds.Also Read: Scientists identify immune system variation linked to severe casesLyfas has been developed by Acculi Labs in association with the Union government’s CAWACH (Centre for Augmenting WAR with Covid-19 Health Crisis) initiative.CAWACH is supporting market-ready innovations for control of Covid-19 and startup ideas to address associated challenges. Acculi Labs was selected after several rounds of screening for a solution towards mass screening. Its product Lyfas has received a grant of Rs 30 Lakh from DST and is now virtually supported by IIT Madras, Healthcare Technology Innovation Centre (HTIC), MedTech Incubator.“Inexpensive, accessible, point-of-care smartphone based diagnostics is a powerful tool that would tremendously help in screening the high risk cases, sustained monitoring of quarantined cases and general surveillance. Lyfas is an interesting example of the rising power of technology startups in innovating relevant and creative solutions for the emergent challenges with speed and efficacy,” said Prof Ashutosh Sharma, secretary, department of science and technology.The clinical trials and regulatory proceedings for Lyfas Coved Score are expected to be completed by the end of September, after which the testing facility will be made available for the general public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-startup-develops-covid-19-detecting-mobile-app-takes-5-minutes/story-pB69DtRslPDJkx3tF1gOdN.html

This achievement is a result of effective implementation of containment strategy combined with house-to-house surveys, aggressive testing and standardized clinical management protocols based on holistic Standard of Care approach which ensured that hospitals were left unburdened with supervised home isolation for the asymptomatic patients,” the union health ministry said in a statement.It said under the guidance of the Central government, states and union territories have focused on reducing the fatalities by effectively managing the severe cases and prioritising care of the high-risk population using field health care workers leading to decrease in the CFR across the country. “The CFR has reduced from around 3.33% in mid-June to 2.25% today,” the statement said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.The ramped up three-tier hospital infrastructure along with prompt and seamless patient management has helped consistent increase in the recoveries. “For the fifth day in a row, India has seen more than 30,000 recoveries per day. The focused efforts of Centre and State/UT governments on early detection and isolation along with handholding of States/UTs by the expert teams of AIIMS, New Delhi for efficient clinical management of hospitalized cases and periodic visits of central teams, have borne results with continuously improving the recovery rate,” the statement said.The recovery rate has seen a sharp increase from around 53% in mid-June to more than 64% as on Tuesday. With 35,176 patients discharged in the last 24 hours, the total recoveries stand at 9,52,743, it said.India’s Covid-19 tally stands at over 14.83 lakh.The health ministry also said that with improving daily recovery numbers, the gap between the recovered cases and active cases is also persistently increasing. Presently, it is 4,55,755. “This means the actual active case load is presently 4,96,988 and all are under medical supervision,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-fatality-rate-falls-to-2-25-recovery-rate-crosses-64/story-CgwQZZFQ7HLA80dBtWVj0M.html

They said the searches were primarily conducted in Mumbai and Hyderabad offices of GVK as well as the office of Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) - the Joint venture which runs the Mumbai airport. The probe agency had registered a case under prevention of money laundering act (PMLA) in the first week of July on the basis of a CBI FIR lodged on June 27. The FIR named 13 people - including the Chairman of GVK Group, GVK Reddy - the Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL), and several companies that were given contracts at the airport. The GVK Group didn’t respond to an email query on the ED raids. However, after the FIR on June 27, it had issued a statement saying: “MIAL would have provided every assistance had the agency sought explanation or any document even if a preliminary enquiry had been initiated. MIAL is a transparent and responsible corporate entity which is committed to cooperate with the agency in its investigation to arrive at the truth.”MIAL is a joint public-private partnership venture between the Airports Authority of India (AAI), GVK Group, and a few other entities. The GVK Group has a 50.5% stake in MIAL, and AAI 26%.According to the FIR, the AAI entered into operation, management, and development agreement (OMDA) in April 2006 for the airport’s modernisation, upgradation, operation and maintenance as part of the joint venture. MIAL was to share 38.7% of its revenue as an annual fee with the AAI as per the agreement.“The essence of the agreement was to create a world class facility and at the same time protect the interests of the government of India, promoters and passengers,” said the FIR. “Despite there being a clear cut understanding in the OMDA, the promoters of GVK group in MIAL, in connivance with their executives and the unknown officials of AAI resorted to siphoning of funds fraudulently adopting various modus operandi.”The CBI has alleged that MIAL got into fake work contracts during 2017-18 with at least nine companies on the pretext of real estate development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-raids-gvk-group-offices-in-connection-with-mumbai-airport-scam/story-shwbGEvqZGQLrUgpdal0XN.html

However, one tiger was photo captured and evidence of tiger signs were subsequently recorded from the tiger reserve between January and August 2019.The poor tiger status in Indravati, Udanti-Sitanadi and Achanakmar was related to the poor law and order situation in these areas, the report indicated.Some reserves such as Similipal, Amrabad, Nagarjunsagar Sri Sailam, Palamau, Sanjay-Dubri, Manas, Buxa, Dampa, Anshi Dandeli, Pakke, Nameri and Kawal are below their potential and require resources for better management.“For reintroduction of tigers into Palamau, prey augmentation needs to be coupled with restoration of law and order. For tiger reintroduction or supplementation in Palamau and Similipal, tigers need to be sourced from the closest source in the same genetic cluster,” the report said. “Buxa and Dampa can be repopulated through reintroductions from Kaziranga, after prey restoration in Buxa and strengthening protection in Dampa, which has a good prey base,” it added.Currently, tiger population within reserves is 1,923 (65% of the total tiger population of India), which means 35% of the tiger population still lives outside the reserves.The largest contiguous tiger population in the world of about 724 tigers was found in the Western Ghats (Nagarhole-Bandipur-Wayanad-MudumalaiSatyamangalam-BRT block), while the second largest population of about 604 tigers was found across Uttrakhand and western Uttar Pradesh (Rajaji-Corbett-Ramnagar-Pilibhit-Dudhwa block).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mizoram-s-dampa-and-west-bengal-s-buxa-have-no-tigers-left-report/story-pHwXgHyiHe3ZHbuT760EuI.html

The relative expressed his inability to arrange for funds but said he could help her earn some money if she delivers a small packet to a house.The small packet contained smack. Shabnam delivered the packet, got her cut, and that’s how the 34-year old homemaker entered the world of drug peddling. From delivering small packets of drugs in Shahjahanpur district of west Uttar Pradesh, she developed an intricate system of women drug mules and established a racket that spread across more than five districts in the terai region, giving a tough challenge to the authorities.Also read: UP govt urges I-T department, ED to probe Vikas Dubey’s close aide Jay VajpayeeShe was eventually arrested along with four other gang members on Sunday in Shahjahanpur. “Shabnam was caught red-handed with smack worth Rs 15 lakh. We were observing the activities of her gang for quite some time before we could arrest her,” Superintendent of Police, Shahjahanpur (rural), Aparna Gautam said.Police officials said Shabnam targeted women living in small families like her with some basic education and got them to become drug mules for her. These women used to pick up drugs of a certain value from handlers and carried them to other suppliers, or in some cases, directly to the customer. Also read: Process for human trial of Covid-19 vaccine begins in Kanpur hospitalSome of these women also travelled to nearby districts with packets of smack hidden discreetly in their bags or clothing. “Shabnam paid these women well which helped them support their families. Because the families were small, the members rarely suspected anything,” said a police officer who investigated her. The police teams are also identifying other women who carried drugs for her.Shabnam, like other smugglers in the region, used to smuggle smack from the nearby India-Nepal border when she started. Last year, Shabnam set up a system to get high-quality smack from Punjab. “Shabnam also used woman mules to carry the drugs back to UP. Due to the superior quality of her smack, the demand kept rising,” a police officer said. Shabnam invested the drug money in buying farmlands. Police officials estimated that she purchased a farmland worth over 6 crore rupees last year in her name and in the names of her relatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-woman-held-by-police-for-peddling-drugs-setting-up-racket/story-1rRgqsUxoC4plC6iIemGaP.html

Three policemen, including a sub-inspector, were booked on Tuesday evening after being suspended earlier by the district police administration, said an officer.Confirming the incident, senior superintendent of police, Daleep Singh Kunwar said, “One sub inspector and two constables involved in the incident have been booked in the incident for causing hurt, intentional insult and criminal intimidation under relevant sections of the IPC and under Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. An inquiry into the incident has also been initiated by circle officer, Bazpur.”On Tuesday afternoon, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat took cognisance of the incident and directed the director general (law & order) to take strict action against the cops involved. The victim, Deepak, 20, is a resident of Rampura village in the area and had gone to a fuel station with a friend on his motorbike, said police.“While on their way, the police’s City Patrolling Unit cops, including the now suspended officers, asked them to stop as they were overspeeding. The two tried to flee from the scene, it is then that one of the policemen boxed the key of his own motorbike into Deepak’s forehead,” said the official who did not wish to be named.Ashok Kumar, director general (Law and Order) said, “The incident is a very serious one in which a man was severely injured. The cops on their part had said that while they were on duty, they saw him over speeding and tried to stop him. However, instead of stopping the motorbike he sped away which led to the incident.”The man, in pain and with keys dangling from his forehead, headed towards his village and narrated the incident to his family and other villagers which angered them.“The agitated locals then made their way to the local police station demanding strict action against the cops. They also tried to gherao the police station at which point they were lathicharged. They resorted to stone pelting. Soon, senior police officers reached the spot to control the situation,” the official said.Meanwhile, local legislator Raj Kumar Thukral also reached the police station and complained to the authorities about the incident. He also tried to pacify the crowd by assuring action against the cops behind the incident.“Meanwhile, a case has been lodged against about 150 unidentified persons for gathering near the police station and pelting stones at policemen. An investigation is on in that case too and the accused would soon be arrested,” said Ashok Kumar. Injured Deepak is undergoing treatment in a nearby hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cop-slams-bike-keys-into-20-year-old-s-forehead-for-not-wearing-helmet/story-GauHSk5qhWvoLVBnp3kNyO.html

Tuesday’s statement came after GC Murmu again spoke on the election timing in an interview. This time, he said the elections to the J&K assembly would be held after the delimitation exercise.Lt Governor Murmu last month told Hindustan Times that he did not see a problem in holding elections except the Covid-19 pandemic. “Election Commission takes exception to such statements and would like to state that in the Constitutional scheme of things, the timings etc. of elections is the sole remit of Election Commission of India,” the commission said in a statement.“It would be proper for authorities other than the Election Commission to refrain from making such statements which virtually tantamount to interfering with the Constitutional mandate of the Election Commission,” the statement said.The poll panel statement appeared to suggest that the decision on the election dates was a lot more complex than it was made out to be.The EC, before coming out with the election dates, takes relevant factors into consideration, the statement said. These, it said, include the topography, weather, sensitivities arising out of regional and local festivities in the area(s) where the election is to take place. “For example, in the current times, Covid 19 has introduced a new dynamic, which has to be and shall be taken into consideration at the due time. In the instant case, the outcome of Delimitation is also germane to the decision. Similarly, availability of central forces and railway coaches, etc. for the transportation of CPFs are important factors,” the commission said.All this is done after meticulous homework by the senior officials of the commission and a detailed assessment in due consultation with the authorities concerned. The commission also schedules a visit to the state concerned wherever required and holds extensive consultations with all the stakeholders., it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sole-remit-of-ec-poll-panel-reprimands-j-k-lt-guv-for-remarks-on-election-timing/story-KACYgp6yFE3U3TIyIpVLpI.html

The remarks were made by Rajasthan Transport Minister Pratap Singh after a cabinet meeting where governor Kalraj Mishra’s three conditions for calling an assembly session were discussed.“We do not want any clashes with the governor, he is the head of the family. Constitution says governor cannot deny the cabinet’s proposal. We hope that respecting the constitution the governor will approve the proposal of starting the session from July 31,” said Singh.The minister also added that the state government has replied to all the queries raised by governor Kalraj Mishra.The cabinet meeting was held at chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s residence in Jaipur.The Congress government in Rajasthan is in turmoil after simmering differences between Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot came out in the open.The Congress has accused the BJP of indulging in horse-trading to bring down the Gehlot government. It has also accused the BJP of pressuring the governor to delay the assembly session. The BJP and Mishra have rejected all the allegations.Gehlot wants an assembly session to be convened so that he can prove his majority. He has approached the governor with a proposal to convene the session of the state assembly.Mishra agreed to calling the session, but put forward three conditions on Monday - a 21-day notice for the sitting of the House; live-streaming of floor test; and ensuring social distancing in view of the Covid-19 outbreak.“If the government wants to win a vote of confidence, then it can become a reasonable ground for calling the assembly session on short notice. But it has to be said,” a Raj Bhavan statement said on Monday.Congress leaders said a 21-day notice isn’t necessary and pointed out that in 2014, the third session of the 14th Rajasthan assembly was summoned on September 7 and the proceedings of the House began on September 15. “There have been umpteen instances when the assembly was called with a much shorter notice,” said Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi.The governor had earlier questioned the need for calling the session when the government already had the majority and the disqualification matter was pending in the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-want-clashes-hope-governor-holds-session-from-july-31-rajasthan-govt/story-jgQMEK5zr2qWesEhgAC2UI.html

Timely treatment will make you healthy,” he tweeted.He lauded health professionals for selflessly taking care of patients amid the pandemic crisis. “The dedication of #CoronaWarriors is commendable. I salute all the Corona warriors of the state serving the #COVID19 victims by risking their lives selflessly,” he tweeted.“We should fight it with full confidence,” he said, emphasising the importance of social distancing and other preventive measures like washing hands and wearing masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/washing-clothes-myself-after-testing-covid-19-positive-it-helped-in-healing-my-hand-shivraj-singh-chouhan/story-lDr1G47PUFq1XofruheuSN.html
28-07-2020||India||‘Bastar cashew’: New source of income for forest dwellers in Maoist-hit region||Chhattisgarh’s forest department has launched a ‘Bastar cashew’ programme and increased the support price of the cash crop to provide employment to forest dwellers in the Maoist-hit region.The state government has increased the support price of cashew to Rs 100 per kg, which has provided employment to forest dwellers during the coronavirus pandemic and has also increased the collection of cashew to 5,500 quintals.Successful plantation of cashew is available in Bastar on nearly 15,000 hectares of land with the production capacity of 10,000 quintals. The forest department claimed nearly 6,000 forest dwelling families have collected cashew this year and each family has earned the average income of Rs 10,000 in Bastar.Forest department officials claimed that the government has created a mechanism through which tribals are getting benefits and there has been an increase in the production of the cash crop as well. “In the 70s, the climatic condition of Bastar was found suitable for cashew farming and hence, cashew saplings were sown in its forest areas. But after the plantation, no proper mechanism was developed for its nourishment and conservation. No attention was paid towards its processing,” Rakesh Chaturvedi, Chhattisgarh’s principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF), said. “This is the reason why most of the cashew produced in the forests is sold in Odisha through middlemen and as a result, forest dwellers do not get a fair price for the cashew they produce,” Chaturvedi added.Chaturvedi also said that the present government took the issue seriously and tried to developed this sector to generate employment for tribals and forest dwellers. “The state government has increased the support price of cashew to Rs 100 per kg from Rs 50-Rs 60, which has provided employment to forest dwellers in this time of corona crisis and has also increased the collection of cashew to 5,500 quintals,” he said.The department said the cashew processing work in Bastar is being conducted under the technical guidance of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research’s (ICAR’s) directorate of cashew research in Karnataka’s Puttur.Officials said cashew seeds yield about 22% cashew after processing. This year about 1,200 quintals of cashew will be produced from the 5,500 quintals of cashew collected. This ‘cashew business’ set up by women self-help groups (SHG) is expected to generate a profit of nearly Rs 30-50 lakh this year. The incentive amount will be distributed to the families involved in the collection and processing of cashew nut, as it is done for tendu leaves. The forest dwellers will benefit at three levels. First, they will get a fair price for cashew seeds, 300 families will get jobs through processing and thirdly, the distribution of 100% of the profit received from trade, officials said.“I work in the processing unit of cashew and earning about Rs 3,000 per month, which is enough for me. Many of tribal women like me have benefitted due to the Bastar cashew production,” Belabali, a resident of Bakwand village of Jagdalpur district, said while speaking to HT over the phone. Around 6% of the country’s minor forest produce comes from Chhattisgarh. The scheme for purchase of minor forest produce under the minimum support price (MSP) scheme is applicable throughout the country. A government press release said that 76% of the minor forest produce procurement in the entire country has been done in Chhattisgarh in the last four months under the scheme.“In the last four months, small forest produce of about Rs 148 crore was purchased in the entire country, out of which small forest produce worth Rs 112 crore was procured by the state of Chhattisgarh. This work was conducted through 3,500 women self-help groups in the state. About 40,000 women went from house to house to procure forest produce,” the release added.“Earlier, only seven minor forest produce were being purchased under the minimum support price scheme in the state, which has now been increased to 31 minor forest produce,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bastar-cashew-new-source-of-income-for-forest-dwellers-in-maoist-hit-region/story-GaE0nQGyjOiBISeB9AJV2K.html

28-07-2020||India||After India’s fresh ban on apps, China says will take measures to safeguard interests of its companies||Against the backdrop of New Delhi’s fresh ban on 47 clones of prohibited Chinese apps, Beijing said on Tuesday that it will take “necessary measures” to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies. India’s June 29 ban on 59 mobile apps with Chinese background, including WeChat, “severely damaged the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies”, Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong said in a statement. “The Indian government has the responsibility to protect the legitimate rights and interests of international investors in India, including Chinese businesses, in accordance with market principles,” she added. “The Chinese side has lodged solemn representation to the Indian side and asked the Indian side to correct its wrongdoings,” Ji said, responding to a media query on whether WeChat was asked to stop providing services to its Indian users. The ban orders for the Chinese apps and their clones are among a string of economic measures unveiled by the Indian government in the wake of the months-old border standoff between the two countries. There was no immediate reaction by Indian officials to the Chinese spokesperson’s comments. Following the death of 20 Indian soldiers in a brutal clash with Chinese troops in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), there were demands from the public and political parties for restrictions on trade ties with China. Spokesperson Ji said the Chinese government “consistently asks Chinese enterprises to abide by international rules and local laws and regulations when conducting external cooperation”. She added, “Practical cooperation between China and India is mutually beneficial. Deliberate interference in such cooperation will not serve the interests of the Indian side. China will also take necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.” Despite the June 29 ban, Indian users of WeChat were able to use the communication app till the weekend. When users sought to use the app this week, they received a message saying services were not available due to local restrictions.On Monday, India’s information and technology ministry announced the fresh ban on 47 apps, most of them clones and variants of the apps banned in June. The total number of Chinese-origin mobile applications blocked is 106. The government is also examining other Chinese apps for violating user privacy and national security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-india-s-fresh-ban-on-apps-china-says-will-take-measures-to-safeguard-interests-of-its-companies/story-NhgXFDnMoxNyLAGaZUDRYI.html
28-07-2020||India||India hands over 10 broad gauge locomotives to Bangladesh||India provided 10 railway locomotives to Bangladesh on Monday as grant assistance, with the leadership of the two sides committing themselves to more connectivity and infrastructure initiatives to boost trade and create new supply chains. The broad gauge locomotives, modified to suit height restrictions in Bangladesh, were flagged off by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and railways minister Piyush Goyal during a virtual ceremony that also featured their Bangladeshi counterparts AK Abdul Momen and Mohammed Nurul Islam Sujan. The move was part of a sharpened focus on India’s “neighbourhood first” policy, with New Delhi unveiling several moves in recent days to boost economic activity and help countries in the region cope with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. It also followed close on the heels of the launch of parcel and container train services by India and Bangladesh and the trans-shipment of goods from Kolata to Agartala via Chattogram port. Despite hiccups in bilateral ties caused by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Jaishankar and Momen spoke of the two sides scripting a ‘shonali adhyay’ (golden chapter) in relations and the role connectivity could play in growing trade and creating supply chains that aren’t vulnerable to disruptions such as the pandemic. Goyal and Jaishankar noted that the supply of essential goods to Bangladesh, especially during Ramzan, continued without disruptions due to freight trains. “Our partnership today stands out as a role model in the region for good neighbourly relations,” Jaishankar said, adding the implementation of the “neighbourhood first” policy was most evident in Bangladesh. Noting that India’s concessional lines of credit of nearly $10 billion for Bangladesh are the largest provided to any country, and Dhaka’s exports increased by 43% to cross the $1-billion mark in 2019, Jaishankar invited Bangladesh’s business community to enhance their engagement with India. Goyal said the leadership of both countries is committed to reviving railway links that existed before 1965, when the war with Pakistan led to their closure. Of the seven rail links that existed at the time, four are functional, two more – Chilahati-Haldibari and Shahbazpur-Mahisasan – are being revived and a new link between Agartala and Akhaura is being built with grant assistance from India. Momen thanked India for the locomotives, saying the “India-Bangladesh relationship is rock solid and is based on shared values”. He said the two old links currently being revived will establish rail connectivity with Bhutan and provide the shortest route to connect with Nepal. However, he added connectivity is more than seamless mobility of people, goods and capital, and the two countries will have to work on harmonisation of standards, customs and immigration procedures and environmental concerns. The handing over of the 10 locomotives fulfilled a commitment made by India during Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s visit to New Delhi last October. Officials said bilateral rail cooperation played a key role in mitigating the impact of the pandemic after trade via land border posts was disrupted. Both countries saw the highest ever exchange of freight trains during June, when 103 trains transported essential goods and raw materials. The railways of the two countries began cooperating in 1996 with the export of 10 locomotives from India. Since then, 40 more locomotives and 120 coaches were exported till 2016-17. The 10 locomotives provided by India have a residual life of almost three decades. Experts believe it is crucial for India to boost trade and strategic ties with Bangladesh. Former ambassador Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty, who served as India’s envoy in Dhaka, wrote in a recent commentary: “Bangladesh is India’s largest trading partner in South Asia and connectivity via Bangladesh is important for the development of India’s northeastern states. Bangladesh is also a crucial partner for India’s Act East policy and sub-regional cooperation under the rubric of BBIN [Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal].”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-hands-over-10-broad-gauge-locomotives-to-bangladesh/story-NJuG8WzyPmAFRzKCqOTzNI.html
28-07-2020||India||BJP legislator files plea seeking disqualification of 6 BSP MLAs who merged with Cong||Madan Dilawar, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator, on Tuesday, filed an application in Rajasthan high court (HC), requesting disqualification of six Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) lawmakers, who had merged with the ruling Congress government in the state last September. The six BSP members of Rajasthan legislative assembly (MLAs), who had merged with the Ashok Gehlot–led government on September 18, 2019, are Sandeep Yadav, Tijara MLA, Wajib Ali (Nagar), Deepchand Kheria (Kishangarh Bas), LakhanMeena (Karauli), and Rajendra Gudha (Udaipurwati). “Assembly Speaker CP Joshi had dismissed our plea without hearing our line of argument. This prompted us to move the HC against the Speaker’s decision. We have prayed before the court to disqualify the membership of the six BSP MLAs and pass an order that upholds justice and equality,” said Ashish Sharma, Dilawar’s counsel. The BSP is also expected to file a petition later on Tuesday that will also challenge the merger of six MLAs, who had won Rajasthan assembly polls in 2018 on the party’s symbol.“The merger of these six MLAs with Congress was unconstitutional. We are preparing a petition and will file it soon,” said Bhagwan Singh Baba, state president, BSP. On Monday, the Rajasthan HC had disposed of the petition by Dilawar, who had questioned Speaker Joshi’s alleged inaction over the merger of six BSP MLAs with the Gehlot government last September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-legislator-files-petition-in-court-seeking-disqualification-of-six-bsp-mlas-who-had-merged-with-congress/story-p3Y1NYmEYv50aInoxlYE3O.html
28-07-2020||India||‘Malicious intent’: Mayawati lashes out at Gehlot for merger of BSP MLAs in Cong||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati lashed out at Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, saying he merged her party’s MLAs with Congress due to malicious intent.“In Rajasthan, after elections results BSP gave unconditional support of all its six MLAs to Congress. Unfortunately, chief minister Ashok Gehlot, out of his malicious intent and to damage the BSP, merged them with Congress unconsititutionally. He did the same even in his last tenure,” Mayawati said on Tuesday.“We have asked the six MLAs, who are elected to Rajasthan assembly on the symbol of BSP, to vote against Congress in any proceedings to be held during assembly Session. If they don’t do so, their party membership will be cancelled,” she added.Mayawati also said that the party is ready to go to court. “The BSP could have gone to the court earlier too but we were looking for a time to teach Congress party and CM Ashok Gehlot a lesson. Now we have decided to go to the court. We will not let this matter alone. We will go even to the Supreme Court,” the BSP chief said.Her remarks came a day after the Rajasthan high court disposed of a petition by a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator who questioned speaker CP Joshi’s alleged inaction over the merger of all six BSP MLAs in the state with the Congress last year.The decision came hours after the speaker upheld the merger while responding to the complaint by BJP leader Madan Dilawar filed in March.The move is a boost for the Ashok Gehlot led government which retains its tenuous majority in the house even as it fights a legal battle concerning the disqualification of a rebel group of 19 Congress lawmakers led by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot.In his petition, Dilawar said that the speaker declared the six BSP MLAs - Sandeep Yadav (Tijara), Wajib Ali (Nagar), Deepchand Kheria (Kisangarh Bas), LakhanMeena (Karauli) and Rajendra Gudha (Udaipurwati) - as having merged with the Congress on September 18, 2019. The move increased the Congress’s strength in the House.He had petitioned the speaker on March 16, seeking disqualification of the BSP MLAs under the 10th schedule of the Constitution (anti-defection laws).In 2008, too, six BSP lawmakers merged their party with the Congress in the assembly. Gehlot was the chief minister then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/malicious-intent-mayawati-lashes-out-at-ashok-gehlot-for-merger-of-bsp-mlas-in-congress/story-B53lEeYzI4yHkSM01dbguO.html
28-07-2020||India||Supreme Court asks Centre to verify Jammu and Kashmir’s response on 4G curb||The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Centre to verify if Jammu and Kashmir’s administration has sent any communication to the ministry of home affairs for restoring 4G mobile internet services in the Union territory. This fact was brought to the top court’s attention by the petitioner, NGO Foundation for Media Professionals, in an affidavit filed in response to the Centre’s reply on the petition. The three-judge bench, headed by Justice NV Ramana, asked the Centre to verify this fact and posted the case for August 7. Attorney General KK Venugopal appeared for Centre. Meanwhile, the J-K administration has also sought time to file a response to petitioner’s affidavit. The petitioner has alleged contempt of the top court’s May 11 order claiming that the Centre has not reviewed the 4G restrictions as no order has been placed in the public domain. The Centre had filed an affidavit last week claiming that it was not possible to restore 4G services for the present but left it to the UT administration to decide. A communications blackout and a lockdown were imposed in J-K in August last year as part of measures to prevent protests against the Centre’s move to divest the region of its special status. Most of the restrictions have since been eased even as the mobile internet remains restricted.The Centre has throughout claimed that 4G restoration is not feasible as terrorist activities are on the rise. Currently, J-K only has 2G internet service.The May 11 order was passed after the NGO in April challenged restriction on mobile internet speed to 2G. The NGO sought restoration of high-speed 4G internet services saying patients, doctors, and the general public were unable to access the latest information, guidelines, advisories and restrictions about Covid-19 pandemic because of the restrictions. It pointed out slow internet speed makes telemedicine, or online consultation, impossible.The Supreme Court on May 11 refrained from passing directions to restore 4G services and instead constituted the committee comprising high-level government officers, including the Union home secretary, to take a call on the matter. The committee was asked to examine the necessity to allow faster internet in certain geographical areas.The Centre told the court the committee was constituted by virtue of the May 11 order and no separate notification was required. The committee met on May 15 and sought further inputs before taking any decision. It again met on June 10 and decided not to relax the restrictions, the Centre said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-asks-centre-to-verify-jammu-and-kashmir-s-response-on-4g-curb/story-mgPyaoINTgxB3XEl20wblN.html

28-07-2020||India||India and UK join forces on new £8 mn research on antibiotic-resistant bacteria||India and Britain will deepen scientific research collaboration with five new projects to tackle anti-microbial resistance (AMR) that could lead to advances in the global fight against antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes. The five projects are planned to start in September once they receive the appropriate clearances. Britain is contributing £4 million from the UK Research and Innovation Fund for International Collaboration, and India will match this with an equal amount. The Indian side will be represented by the department of biotechnology. The funding awards by the UK were announced by Tariq Ahmad, minister of state for South Asia and the Commonwealth, ahead of a virtual visit to India on Tuesday. India is a key producer of antimicrobial for the global pharmaceutical supply chain, and the research projects aim to develop a better understanding of how waste from antimicrobial manufacturing could be inadvertently fuelling AMR. A statement from the British high commission quoted Ahmad as saying: “The UK has already partnered with India’s Serum Institute to manufacture the vaccine for Covid-19, if clinical trials are successful, with plans to distribute to a billion people across the developing world. “But there is more we can do together to tackle urgent global health issues in the world. Our thriving research and innovation partnerships will benefit people in the UK and India, and beyond.” British high commissioner Philip Barton said the UK is India’s second biggest research partner, with joint projects expected to be worth £400 million by 2021. “This huge investment enables us to work closely together on global health challenges such as the search for a Covid-19 vaccine,” he said. During the virtual visit to India, Ahmad will chair a roundtable via video conference with Indian and UK-based stakeholders on cold chain technologies that are critical for the transport of vaccines. He will also have a virtual meeting with minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan to discuss a range of issues, including multilateral cooperation, and a virtual meeting with Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani. There will also be discussions with regional governments and others on opportunities in wind power. Among the five projects to tackle AMR is SELECTAR, which involves representatives from the University of Birmingham, Aligarh Muslim University, Panjab University, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Indian Institute of Technology and Jamia Millia Islamia University investigating the impact of waste release on microbial ecosystems. The Advanced Metagenomics, Sensors and Photocatalysis for Antimicrobial Resistance Elimination (AMSPARE) proposal brings together experts on sensor technologies, water treatment and remediation from India with experts on policy and industrial regulatory processes from the UK to research AMR proliferation in the environment. Another project involving experts from Puducherry and Chennai and the Imperial College London relates to advancement of knowledge for addressing antimicrobial resistance in the environment. Experiments, mathematical modelling and risk analysis by representatives from Birmingham University, Indian Institute of Technology-Hyderabad and Indian Institute Technology-Gandhinagar will contribute to risk assessment and setting evidence-based environmental standards. Representatives from the University of Warwick, PGIMER, CSIR-NEERI, Aligarh Muslim University, Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi and Banaras Hindu University will come together to inform policymakers and industry experts and managers on the impact of inappropriate waste disposal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-and-uk-join-forces-on-new-8-mn-research-on-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria/story-zgm5sidyURVPLgO1Z7SfCI.html
28-07-2020||India||In Imran Khan’s 18-point Kashmir plan for Aug 5, outreach to Turkey, Malaysia and China||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan who counts the campaign against India over Jammu and Kashmir as his government’s key achievement has roped in the Inter Services Intelligence, or ISI, in its 18-point plan to commemorate the Aug 5 anniversary of India scrapping Article 370 that extended special status to the valley, people familiar with the development said. The ISI is Pakistan’s notorious spy agency accused of nurturing terror groups, mostly directed at India and Afghanistan.The 18-point programme includes a visit by Imran Khan to occupied Kashmir where he is tentatively scheduled to address the assembly, a speech that is going to be beamed live. Before he reaches Muzaffarabad, Khan’s government intends a field trip for foreign journalists to the occupied territory. Like in the past, the terror training camps funded by the ISI would be off-limits for the journalists.India had tabled the law in Rajya Sabha to strip the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir of its special status under the constitution and turn the state into two union territories - Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh - on August 5. It was passed by the Rajya Sabha the same day, the Lok Sabha the next and received the presidential assent on 9 August. Also Watch | Pakistan, China plan dam in PoK; India slams ‘attempts at material change’Also Read: Article 370: Going back 72 years in historyThe introduction of the law was preceded by a security and communication lockdown in Jammu and Kashmir and detention of its top political leaders. Most of them have since then been released; PDP’s Mehbooba Mufti is among the exceptions.Pakistan, which like much of the country, was taken by surprise by New Delhi’s move had soon launched an international campaign against the nullification of Article 370. Imran Khan was the face of this pitch on and off Twitter. Khan even focused his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, or UNGA, last September on Kashmir, warned a “blood bath” in Kashmir when the curfew is lifted, prophesied a genocide on the streets of the valley and frequently referred to Pak’s nuke weapons to blackmail the world to intervene.Only two other countries spoke of Kashmir at the UNGA: Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Turkey and Malaysia, then led by Mahathir Mohamad.China also did issue two statements on the scrapping of Article 370. One asked India and Pakistan to work together on the Kashmir issue. But its primary concern was over the change of Ladakh’s status to a federally-administered territory. “China is always opposed to India’s inclusion of the Chinese territory in the western sector of the China-India boundary into its administrative jurisdiction,” China’s foreign ministry had said.India had then ticked off Beijing, underlining that changing the status of an Indian territory was an “internal matter”.For Imran Khan’s elaborate plan for August 5, Islamabad has reached out to Kuala Lumpur, Ankara and Beijing to issue statements to commemorate the first anniversary of Jammu and Kashmir’s new status. Or at least tweet.Turkey’s Erdoğan is expected to oblige but New Delhi is watching how Malaysia plays. Kuala Lumpur has a new prime minister in Muhyiddin Yassin who took over as prime minister on 1 March. A statement from China, a government official said, didn’t matter given how it had attempted to expand its territory that led to the standoff and the bloody Galwan clash in east Ladakh, and the first casualties on both sides along the Line of Actual Control in 40 years.The foreign ministry has been told to work closely with spy agency ISI on its diplomatic outreach to Organisation of Islamic Cooperation member countries and international human rights groups, organising commemorative events - even rallies - at missions abroad and drafting a fresh memorandum to be handed over to the UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan headquartered in Islamabad.Also Read: Pak military retains ‘dominant influence’ during Imran Khan’s tenure, says US reportCounter terror officials in New Delhi told Hindustan Times that the campaign had been drawn up by the military for Imran Khan, right from documentaries, pamphlets and newspaper supplements that would be put out to the tweets that would be put out. But Imran Khan will front the campaign.Quite like the ISI had created the The Resistance Front after August 5, a terror group without the religious label that could be used by Pakistan’s propaganda machine to claim that terror was homebred in Kashmir due to Article 370.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-pakistan-s-18-point-kashmir-plan-for-aug-5-outreach-to-turkey-malaysia-and-china/story-jABoLZL2telkjr1C9JfAzL.html

This money was earned by Dr. Singh from the state government’s home department for performing post-mortem examinations, but Dr. Lalwani asked the complainant to give the amount to him, claiming that he had performed them (the examinations) on his behalf,” stated the release. “Dr Lalwani threatened the complainant that if he didn’t give the amount to him he would fail him in his examination. Dr. Lalwani had made a similar demand to two more PG students, Dr. Ashok Yadav and Dr. Sanjay Jain,” it added. “A team from the Lokayukta organisation, led by superintendent of police (SP), arrested the head of the forensic medicine department, Dr. Murali Lalwani, while he was accepting Rs 40,000 from the complainant in his office at Gandhi Medical College, Bhopal, on Monday,” the release further stated.

28-07-2020||India||3 arrested for killing elephant five years back in Chhattisgarh’s Dhamtari||Three persons were arrested on Monday by a joint team of Chhattisgarh Police and state forest department personnel on charges of killing a tusker five years ago and recently trying to sell its tusk. Police have exhumed the body of the tusker from a field, where the accused had buried it, and the tusk has been seized. The trio has been booked under the relevant sections of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and an investigation has started. “The elephant was electrocuted at Sikatta village in Dhamtari district five years ago. One of the accused, Chen Singh Markam, a farmer, had fenced his field, with live electric wires to prevent pachyderms from entering it,” said Arun Pandey, additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF) (wildlife). Pandey said the accused have confessed to the police that they had buried the elephant that had died of electrocution five years ago because they were afraid of the repercussions of its death and did not inform the authorities concerned. “Markam and two of his friends had chopped the elephant’s body and buried it on the farm,” Pandey added. The police got a tip-off about a month ago, when Markam’s son Ranjeet tried to dig out the tusk and was on the lookout for a buyer. “The accused tried to mislead us. But Markam’s wife revealed the truth and the tusker’s remains were exhumed,” said a police official. The state forest department data showed that the pachyderm population in Chhattisgarh increased from 225 to 290 over the past 10 years. Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has recently issued guidelines for the monitoring of wild animals in the state’s forests and improving measures for their conservation. North Chhattisgarh is home to around 240 wild elephants that have been involved in the loss of several human lives and property over the past few years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-three-arrested-for-killing-elephant-five-years-back-in-dhamtari/story-vwlGFMSY4X3UWpbvpvyVON.html
28-07-2020||India||Rajasthan cabinet meets to discuss points raised by governor for calling assembly session||The Rajasthan government is holding a cabinet meeting to discuss the points raised by governor Kalraj Mishra for convening a session of the state assembly.The Congress government has been constantly demanding that a session of the house should be called. Confident of its numbers in the assembly, the party is pushing for a floor test in the assembly in the wake of a power tussle between Gehlot and former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot.The governor on Monday agreed to call a session, but asked the state government for a fresh proposal addressing his three conditions - a 21-day notice for the sitting of the House; live-streaming of floor test; and ensuring social distancing in view of the Covid-19 outbreak.“If the government wants to win a vote of confidence, then it can become a reasonable ground for calling the assembly session on short notice. But it has to be said,” a Raj Bhavan statement said on Monday.Congress leaders said a 21-day notice isn’t necessary and pointed out that in 2014, the third session of the 14th Rajasthan assembly was summoned on September 7 and the proceedings of the House began on September 15. “There have been umpteen instances when the assembly was called with a much shorter notice,” said Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi.The governor had earlier questioned the need for calling the session when the government already had the majority and the disqualification matter was pending in the Supreme Court.The Congress accuses the governor of delaying the session due to pressure from the BJP-led central government - a charge that Mishra denies.Meanwhile, the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) on Monday sent a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind, seeking his intervention to facilitate an assembly session in the state. The CLP members claimed that horse-trading of MLAs was on in Rajasthan to topple an elected government.Chief minister Ashok Gehlot said yesterday that he spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to apprise him of the political situation in the state and he has promised him to “get the matter seen”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cabinet-meets-to-discuss-points-raised-by-governor-for-calling-assembly-session/story-Pcju9eOgeQs8e7w85DeARK.html
28-07-2020||India||Only statutory dues can be deducted from accident claims: Bombay HC||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) last week observed that no other amount, except for statutory dues, are allowed to be deducted while computing amount of compensation to be paid in motor accident claims. “It is well settled that except for the statutory deduction to be made towards income tax, professional tax, no other deduction is permissible under law,” said justice VL Achliya. “The deduction from the salary of the deceased towards insurance, pension benefits, gratuity or grant of employment to the kin of the deceased is not permissible.” The court was hearing an appeal filed by a resident of Maharashtra’s Ahmednagar district challenging an order passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ahmednagar, in December 2011, granting compensation of Rs. 9 lakh to her and her ageing in-laws against a claim of Rs 15.5 lakh following the death of her husband in a road accident in 2007. The appellant claimed that the accident took place on June 2, 2007, barely three months after her marriage. She and her husband were going from Pune towards Ahmednagar on a two-wheeler. Her husband, a sepoy in the Indian Army, was driving the bike and she was riding pillion. She had complained that when they reached near Kamar Gaon, a Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC)-run bus hit the two-wheeler and the vehicle was thrown off the road. Her husband died due to severe head injury and the appellant survived even though she, too, was critically injured. Later, she filed a motor accident claim, claiming compensation of Rs. 15.5 lakh from MSRTC. In 2012, she moved HC seeking enhancement in compensation after the tribunal awarded her Rs 9 lakh. Justice Achliya accepted the argument put forth by the appellant’s counsel and found the assessment of compensation made by the tribunal was against the settled position in law.The court held that she was entitled to Rs. 23.52 lakh as compensation.It also ordered that 23.52 lakh is equitably paid to the appellant and her in-laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-statutory-dues-can-be-deducted-from-accident-claims-hc/story-f4NMYYOA6jpEGb3y0bGLuJ.html

It has led to over six lakh deaths too and pharmacists across the world are racing to find a vaccine to cure Covid-19, the disease it causes.Covid-19 affectes different people in different ways Among the common symptoms that a patient of Covid-19 exhibits are fever, dry cough and tiredness. Some others may experience aches and pains, sore throat, headache and loss of taste or smell.But some experts have said that the coronavirus disease can spread through the eyes too, just as it does through the mouth or nose. According to American Academy of Ophthalmogists, the Sars-CoV-2 virus can cause pink eye infection (conjunctivitis).A study in this regard was done in June and published in the Canadian Journal of Ophthalmology. Academic studies at the outset of the pandemic identified conjunctivitis as a secondary symptoms in about 10 to 15 per cent of Covid-19 cases.How to protect your eyes during Covid-19• Guarding your eyes - as well as your hands, nose, and mouth. According to Rajesh Sinha, Professor of Ophthalmology at AIIMS, New Delhi, when a person touches an affected surface and then touches the eyes or the face, the virus can enter the body. With spectacles, one can prevent virus droplets from coming in contact with the eyes.• Those wearing contact lenses should consider switching to glasses for a while. “They should also be careful before rubbing their eyes,” said Ikeda Lal, Ophthalmologist at Delhi Eye Centre and Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in New Delhi. This can allow the virus to get into the eyes.• Sunglasses or prescription glasses can be worn while going out to protect the eyes.• Use eye drops or lubricating agents. Since a lot of people are working from home, the screen time has increased considerably. And then there are webinars, web series, movies or video chats. All this can lead to dryness in eyer and increase the blinking rate. The eyer drops and lubricating agents will help in this, said experts.• Social distancing and hygiene is of course important. The ophthalmologists say that there is no substitute to washing your hands. And this should be done frequently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-and-conjunctivitis-how-to-take-care-of-pink-eyes/story-fik1wQlW1ACIO6uZdZumpL.html

28-07-2020||India||Indian climate activist Archana Soreng named by UN chief to new advisory group||A climate activist from India has been named by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to his new advisory group comprising young leaders who will provide perspectives and solutions to tackle the worsening climate crisis, as the global body mobilizes action as part of the Covid-19 recovery efforts. Archana Soreng joins six other young climate leaders from around the world who have been named by Guterres to his new Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change. Soreng is “experienced in advocacy and research, and she is working to document, preserve, and promote traditional knowledge and cultural practices of indigenous communities,” the UN said in a statement on Monday. “Our ancestors have been protecting the forest and nature over the ages through their traditional knowledge and practices. Now it is on us to be the front runners in combating the climate crisis,” said Soreng, who has studied regulatory governance from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) Mumbai and is the former TISS Students Union President. The young activists, aged between 18 and 28 years, will advise the UN chief regularly on accelerating global action and ambition to tackle the worsening climate crisis. The announcement marks a new effort by the United Nations to bring more young leaders into decision-making and planning processes, as the UN works to mobilize climate action as part of the Covid-19 recovery efforts. “We are in a climate emergency. We do not have the luxury of time,” Guterres said in a video announcing the establishment of the advisory group. “We need urgent action now – to recover better from COVID-19, to confront injustice and inequality and address climate disruption,” he said. Guterres said young people are on the front lines of climate action, showing nations and leaders what bold leadership looks like. “That is why I am launching my Youth Advisory Group on climate change today – to provide perspectives, ideas and solutions that will help us scale up climate action,” the UN chief said. The members of the Secretary-General’s Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change represent the diverse voices of young people from all regions as well as small island states. They will offer perspectives and solutions on climate change, from science to community mobilization, from entrepreneurship to politics, and from industry to conservation, the UN said. The initial seven members of the group have been chosen to give frank and fearless advice to the Secretary-General, at a time of growing urgency to hold government and corporate leaders to account on climate action. The other selected members of the group are climate activist Nisreen Elsaim of Sudan, Fiji’s Ernest Gibson, the co-coordinator for 350 Fiji, a regional youth-led climate change network, young economist Vladislav Kaim of Moldova who is committed to ensuring green and decent jobs for youth. Sophia Kianni of the United States who has helped organise nationwide strikes and is the founder of international nonprofit Climate Cardinals, founder and coordinator of Generation Climate Europe and spokesperson for Youth and Environment Europe, Nathan Metenier of France and lawyer and human rights defender Paloma Costa of Brazil. The establishment of the group builds on last year’s successful Youth Climate Summit – the first time a Secretary-General has convened a summit for young people entirely devoted to climate action. The summit brought over 1,000 young climate champions together from more than 140 countries to share their solutions on the global stage and deliver a clear message to world leaders: we must act now to confront the climate crisis. The initiative is also aligned with the Secretary-General’s vision for the UN Youth Strategy, launched in September 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-climate-activist-archana-soreng-named-by-un-chief-to-new-advisory-group/story-ozs4WjBM6YsMGyuTKFGhpN.html

In the retail markets of Siliguri town, ginger price ranged between Rs 145 and Rs 160 a kg on Monday. “The price I got from wholesalers in Siliguri regulated market in the last one week ranged between Rs 68 to Rs 70 a kg,” Jabardan Rai, a ginger farmer from Peshok, said.“The wholesale price in Siliguri would have crossed Rs 100 a kg had there been no restriction on movement of people. The big buyers from Delhi and Mumbai are not coming,” Rai said. Raju Saha, a retail vegetable seller at Siliguri’s Champasari market, said his sales have more than doubled in recent weeks.“The demand has been on the rise and will rise further along with the price. At least 60,000 kg is sold every day,” Haridwar Singh, a commission agent at the regulated market, said. Sunita Agarwal, a homemaker, said she used to buy 400 grams of ginger a month but now she gets 2.5kg of the spice. “All members of my family are having ginger, lemon and turmeric water twice a day to boost immunity,” Agarwal said. West Bengal was the third-largest producer of ginger in 2018. Most of the state’s ginger is produced in the hills of Darjeeling and Kalimpong which come under the jurisdiction of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA). The horticulture department of GTA said the annual production in 2019 was 29,400 metric tonnes grown over an area of about 2,000 hectares. “Darjeeling and Kalimpong hills produce a better quality of ginger and more than 60% are sent to other states,” Mahadev Chhetri, senior scientific officer with the Research and Development Centre for Horticulture, said.“It is good news that farmers are getting high price at a time when everything has come to a standstill because of the pandemic,” SP Singh, the district horticulture officer, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-s-ginger-farmers-reap-profit-as-sales-shoot-during-covid-19-pandemic/story-2YziHAERXUnoZz7Y1oHjyN.html

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu had reached out to his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi with a special request for the supplies.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  A special flight carrying researchers, defence experts and advanced medical equipment from Israel landed India on Monday. The Israeli team will join hands with researchers in India to develop a rapid testing solution for Covid-19.Reacting to it, deputy director general for Asia and the Pacific at the ministry of foreign affairs, Gilad Cohen, wrote in a blog for Times of Israel that the unprecedented global pandemic has provided an opportunity for both countries to “assist each and further enhance their relations”. “Israel’s exceptional gesture today was a welcome ‘thank you’ to India, which, just a few months ago, sent medicines and other essential diagnostic equipment,” Cohen wrote, adding that his country “went out of its way” to approve the export and transfer of sophisticated ventilators to India. “In this way, Israel and India successfully transformed this unprecedented global pandemic into an opportunity to assist one another and further enhance their relations,” he asserted. Pointing out the improvement in the Indo-Israel relations over the past several years, the diplomat said it’s hard to believe that just three decades ago, Indian passports were valid “for every country except Israel”. Cohen in his blog also highlighted the growth in the bilateral trade, which was just US dollar 200 million in 1992, when the diplomatic relations were established between both countries. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Cohen also hailed the leadership of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying the country is emerging as a regional and global power under him. “Under the leadership of Narendra Modi, India is assuming its role as a regional and world power and our diplomacy has succeeded in showing India the many advantages that can come from strengthening its ties with Israel”, Cohen said. “The Foreign Ministry is determined to continue cultivating its ties with the second largest country in the world to ensure that our relations with India continue to thrive into the future”, he concluded. The Israeli team, comprising 20 experts from various fields, will help development diagnostic technologies. It is being led by Israel’s ambassador to India Ron Malka and defence attaché Col Assaf Meller.The team also includes Prof Nati Keller, an infectious diseases specialist from Sheba Medical Center; and Itai Gordon, head of the innovation department at the Israel’s ministry of health. The delegation includes engineers and other professionals from the companies involved in the development of various diagnostic solutions. “What they all have in common is the ability to detect the presence of the virus in the body quickly--usually within minutes,” a statement from the Israeli defence ministry said on Thursday. “Developing diagnostic capabilities is a goal for the State of Israel and of many additional countries around the world. It is the most effective way to cut off chains of infection, prevent prolonged quarantine and enable the reopening of the global economy,” it said.On Friday, Israel’s Alternate prime minister and minister of defence, Benny Gantz, had talked to Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, expressing hope that the strong bilateral ties between the two countries will contribute significantly to the global efforts in combating the Covid-19 pandemic. “I was glad to speak this morning (Friday) with Indian defence minister Rajnath Singh about the excellent defence cooperation enjoyed by our two countries and our shared aspirations for stability and calm in our regions”, Gantz told PTI. “I told him that I welcome the promotion of bilateral partnership, even in the midst of the coronavirus crisis, and that I am sure that the Israeli delegation arriving in India next week will contribute significantly to global efforts to combat it,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supply-of-medical-equipment-to-india-reciprocation-of-earlier-help-israel/story-OsLeCTepJ7BFtfP5MCIsRJ.html

The first set of participants, who have cleared the screening process, will be vaccinated on Thursday or Friday under medical supervision.Prakhar Hospital, one of the two facilities chosen for testing the coronavirus vaccine in Uttar Pradesh, has 36 volunteers between the age group of 18 and 55 years. Five of the volunteers are women and two are 20-year-olds.Coming from diverse backgrounds, the volunteers also include sportspersons. “They are mostly from middle class background and all of them registered on their own volition as they want to contribute to the experiment that can help mankind in these trying hours,” said Dr JS Kushwaha, chairman of the hospital. All 36 volunteers on Monday underwent a comprehensive process of determining their health status, which needs to fit in the parametres the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) has defined. Their blood samples and swabs were taken and sent to the ICMR certified laboratory for RT-PCR and anti-body test.“On the basis of these reports, the vaccine will be given to them at the hospital positively by Thursday or Friday,” said Kushwaha. The hospital will conduct the human trials in two phases on 100 volunteers. “People are regularly calling us and seek details of the process they will have to follow. Even today we got four calls from people, two of them women, and they wanted to be part of this trial,” he said. Before the vaccine is given, the hospital will insure the volunteers meet all the specified conditions. A team of specialists, led by a doctor from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), will administer the vaccine and monitor the health parametres for a period of two hours at the hospital before the volunteers are allowed to leave. The team will collect the blood samples on the 14th day and then on 28th day, these samples would be sent to the ICMR certified laboratory for the test.Kushwaha said the hospital is well-equipped for such trials and has conducted similar trials for Rotavirus and Pentavalent vaccines in the past. The hospital has received the go-ahead from the Data and Safety Monitoring Board and Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation to commence the trial. Kushwaha appealed to the people that they should come forward and get involved in the trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/process-for-human-trial-of-covid-19-vaccine-begins-in-kanpur-hospital/story-xRNqNgiac3vQFBOT8sxfCK.html
28-07-2020||India||Worrying Covid-19 situation in MP as July witnesses more patients than March to June||Madhya Pradesh has registered as many as 14,207 new patients of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in July till Sunday, which is more than the cumulative figure of 13,593 reported between March 20 and June 30. The death toll in the state is equally worrying as more than nine patients of the coronavirus disease died every day in July on average, a figure that was more than five till June 30, according to the health department’s bulletins. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe situation has gone from bad to worse in the state from lockdown to Unlock period with 132 new Covid-19 patients being identified every day on average till June 30 from March 20 when the first four patients were identified in Jabalpur.This number shot up to more than 546 patients every day in July on average or an increase of 313.63% patients daily. Till June 30, the number of Covid-19 patients who died was more than five per day on an average, 5.55 to be precise. It rose to more than nine patients in July every day or an increase of 65.58% daily. The week-wise toll in July also suggests an aggravating situation with an average of seven deaths per day in the first week. In the second week, the average was almost the same but in the third week, the figure shot up to 12 deaths per day and in the past eight days, it was 13 deaths daily on average. Based on data from March 20 to July 26, the death rate has come down to 3.19% as of Sunday night against 4.20% as on June 30 but this is primarily because the number of Covid-19 patients has been increasing alarmingly. At the same time, the recovery rate has come down to 68.82% as of Sunday night from 76.47% as was registered on June 30. Similarly, the active cases which stood at 2,626 on June 30 night alarmingly rose to 7,857 on Sunday night. The grim situation drove the state government to announce a 10-day long lockdown in the state capital of Bhopal, where it has gone from bad to worse, while authorities in Gwalior and Morena clamped curfew in the cities. “What is worrisome is the fact that the number of deaths has alarmingly gone up in July despite more and more awareness in public about the disease as compared to the first couple of months when the state government cited late arrival of patients in hospitals for the death rate being on a higher side,” Amulya Nidhi, a public health expert, said.“This is when the states like West Bengal, Gujarat and not to say of Kerala have shown marked improvement in their situation,” he added. He also pointed out that the government claims to have ramped up its testing facilities in the past four months or so and upgraded its health facilities and even launched a Kill Corona campaign in July for a door to door survey across the state. “This situation demands the immediate intervention of the central government to look into the problem areas in the entire state from the state government to the grassroots level.” SR Azad, another public health expert, said lockdown or curfew will be of no help unless the state government chalks down a comprehensive plan and implements it “strictly and honestly from the state level to the ward and village level”. “At the same time, the community participation in the government’s plan is a must which is lacking so far. It is all bureaucratic approach with which the government is working,” Azad said. Dr Prabhuram Chaudhary, the state’s health minister, said the government’s priority is to control the spread of coronavirus disease in every district. “We have increased the number of Covid tests significantly. Coupled with this the fever clinics have also helped. Now, more and more people are being identified and treated,” Chaudhary said. “We are reviewing the situation of each and every district under the leadership of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. My appeal to all the people is to follow social distancing norms and other safety norms,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/worrying-covid-19-situation-in-mp-as-july-witnesses-more-patients-than-march-and-june/story-1XLyyk0RU29G5aBML5ICML.html
28-07-2020||India||Congress’ Jammu unit stages protest against BJP’s ‘arm-twisting’ tactics in Rajasthan||The president of Congress’ Jammu unit Ghulam Ahmed Mir on Monday staged a vociferous protest against what he claimed was the “BJP’s arm-twisting tactics in Rajasthan” during the coronavirus pandemic. “We are protesting to save democracy in this country. The BJP has been constantly been resorting to undemocratic and unconstitutional means. First Goa, then Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and now Rajasthan, the BJP has been resorting to unconstitutional and undemocratic means to topple democratically elected governments,” said Mir. He said when people have the right to choose the government of their choice, then one with a full majority should be given full five-year tenure. “But the BJP is resorting to unfair means and is using governor’s rule to their advantage. The BJP getting its unfair practices implemented via Raj Bhavans. For instance in Rajasthan, the governor there has raised illogical queries on assembly session proposed by the Rajasthan CM via his cabinet,” he added. “The governor is asking Rajasthan CM unnecessary queries of why and what’s the agenda, which is undemocratic and unconstitutional on the part of the governor,” he added.Meanwhile, three Congress leaders wrote to Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra on Monday, asking him to convene an assembly session as per the advice of the state cabinet which, they claimed, would be the correct course of action as per the legal principles laid down by the Supreme Court. Salman Khurshid, Ashwani Kumar, and Kapil Sibal, who are also senior advocates at the SC, said that the apex court judgments in Shamsher Singh v. Union of India (1974) and Nabam Rebia v. Deputy Speaker (2016) limits the powers of Governor, who is obliged to defer to the wisdom of an elected government. “Any deviation from the established constitutional position would be an avoidable negation of your oath of office and create a constitutional crisis,” the former Union law ministers, said.The Congress party, which is confident of its numbers in the Rajasthan assembly, is pushing for a floor test in the House in the wake of a power tussle between chiffons minister Ashok Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot.The Congress accuses the governor of delaying the session due to pressure from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government. Mishra has denied the charge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-jammu-unit-stages-protest-against-bjp-s-arm-twisting-tactics-in-rajasthan/story-nuf0Z6xnesfMQjKWTVvVUP.html

The UK is contributing four million pounds from the UK Research and Innovation Fund for International Collaboration, and India is matching this with its own resources. In total, eight million pounds will be used to fund the research, said the statement.Ahmad said, “The UK has already partnered with India’s Serum Institute to manufacture the vaccine for COVID-19, if clinical trials are successful, with plans to distribute to a billion people across the developing world. But there is more we can do together to tackle urgent global health issues in the world. Our thriving research and innovation partnerships will benefit people in the UK and India, and beyond.”Sir Philip Barton, High Commissioner to India, said, “The UK is India’s second-biggest research partner, with joint research expected to be worth 400 million pounds by next year. This huge investment enables us to work closely together on global health challenges such as the search for a COVID-19 vaccine.”“Today’s announcement is another demonstration of our excellent research relationship and will strengthen the important fight against anti-microbial resistance,” he added.Ahmad will chair a virtual roundtable with senior Indian and UK-based stakeholders on cold-chain technologies that are critical for the effective transport of vaccines, ensuring they successfully reach their final destination, according to the statement.Other elements of the minister’s visit include meeting with Minister of State for External Affairs and Parliamentary Affairs, V Muraleedharan, to discuss a number of subjects including multilateral cooperation, a meeting with Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, discussions with regional governments and others on opportunities in wind power and a virtual tour of a UK funded solar plant in Rajasthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-india-to-collaborate-in-anti-microbial-resistance-research-worth-8-million-pounds/story-0TH5DdCz41exySXUAKmYUN.html
28-07-2020||India||Central govt employees retiring during Covid-19 to get provisional pension||Central government employees retiring during the Covid-19 pandemic will get provisional pension till their regular Pension Payment Order (PPO) is issued and other formalities completed, Union Minister Jitendra Singh said on Monday. This decision was taken because with the pandemic and the lockdown, a government servant may find difficulty in submitting pension forms to the Head of Office or may not be able to forward the claim form in hard copy along with service book to the concerned Pay & Accounts Office in time, particularly if both the offices are located in different cities, he said. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“This is very pertinent to the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) who are constantly on the move and whose Heads of Offices are located in cities different from where the Pay & Accounts Office is located,” said Singh, Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions.He said that after the Modi government took over, the Department of Pensions and Pensioners’ Welfare had upgraded and equipped itself to deliver the PPO to the employee concerned without delay on the day of his or her superannuation.Besides this, in the last few years, taking cue from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s emphasis on digitalisation, the department has also created a portal, which can be accessed by any government employee approaching superannuation to find out the status of his or her pension papers, the minister said. However, because of the disruption in the official work due to the pandemic and the lockdown, Singh said, some employees who retired during this period may not have been provided with PPO.  But, as an evidence of the present government’s sensitivity towards pensioners and senior citizens, a decision was taken that in order to avoid a delay in the start of regular pension covered under CCS (Pension Rules) 1972, rules may be relaxed to enable seamless payment of ‘Provisional Pension’ and ‘Provisional Gratuity’ till regular PPO is issued, the minister said. “Government employees retiring during Covid-19 pandemic will be receiving ‘provisional’ pension till their regular Pension Payment Order (PPO) is issued and other official formalities completed,” Singh said in a statement issued by the Personnel Ministry. According to an office memorandum issued by the department, the payment of “Provisional Pension” will initially continue for a period of six months from the date of retirement and the period of “Provisional Pension” may be further extended up to one year in exceptional cases.  “These instructions shall also be applicable in cases where a government servant retires otherwise than on superannuation i.e. voluntary retirement, retirement under FR 56, etc.,” it said.In another circular, the Department of Pensions & Pensioners’ Welfare has directed all offices maintaining GPF (General Provident Fund) accounts to complete all credit entries including accruing interest to the employees two years before retirement and then one year before retirement so that provident fund is also paid accurately in time, Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-govt-employees-retiring-during-covid-19-to-get-provisional-pension/story-ZNdITLTndBSxdYw2Z5xz9K.html
28-07-2020||India||‘Lost in translation’ Priyanka’s clarification after Omar’s objection||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday said that her comments against the Bharatiya Janata Party allegedly trying to topple democratically-elected governments, during a pandemic, were “lost in translation”.Participating in her party’s ‘#SpeakUpForDemocracy’ campaign on social media on Sunday, Priyanka Gandhi had said, “Leadership is recognised in times of crisis. During coronavirus pandemic, the country needs a leadership that works in the public interest. But the BJP-led central government has made its intention clear by trying to topple the governments elected by the people. The public will answer.” However, National Conference leader and former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Sunday, took to Twitter to counter her remarks. He even shared a news report – ‘BJP Trying To Topple Governments Amid Pandemic’. “I don’t get the whole “during pandemic” argument. As though somehow toppling an elected government would be less reprehensible if we weren’t battling a health crisis. IMHO it’s wrong regardless of COVID,” he tweeted. Clarifying her tweet, Priyanka Gandhi said, “You’re absolutely right @omarabdullah. What I actually said was that leadership becomes evident during a crisis, and while the pandemic is on, the nation needs a leadership that works in the interest of its people.” “However, the BJP government has been busy trying to topple democratically elected governments, revealing its true mindset and character. It seems my point got lost in translation,” Priyanka Gandhi said in another tweet. The Congress has launched a nationwide campaign in protest against the alleged attempts by the BJP to topple the Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan. Congress leaders and workers are also holding demonstrations in front of Raj Bhawans across the country except in Jaipur to protest against Rajasthan governor Kalraj Mishra’s allegedly “delaying tactics” in convening the assembly session to enable Gehlot to prove his majority in the House after his former deputy Sachin Pilot and 18 other legislators rebelled against the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lost-in-translation-priyanka-s-clarification-after-omar-s-objection/story-O4TbaOvWDdInjgLtCZYTNN.html
28-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||It’s definitely not business as usual — and it is unlikely that it will not be for a few more months.Every Monday, for many weeks now, the Indian arm of Nomura Securities has been publishing a Business Resumption Index (called the Nomura India Business Resumption Index, or Nibri). The index has plateaued around 70 for the past month. By mid-June, it had come out of the slump it saw in April — it hit the mid-forties then — and reached the late-sixties, but it has pretty much stayed at that level since. The index value of 100 corresponds to pre-pandemic level business activity and as the firm points out “the pace at which economic activity normalises [has] remained broadly unchanged for the week ended July 26”. It was 70 on July 19, 68.7 on July 12, 69.2 on July 5, and 70.5 on June 28.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIndia was locked down for 68 days between March 25 and May 31, although the second half of this period saw some activities being allowed in a restricted manner.The index’s plateauing over the past month is an indication that India’s return to economic recovery in 2020-21 will be slow, bumpy, and fraught with risks. Consensus estimates for the level by which the economy will decline this year are hovering around 5%, and some economists believe that the decline could be higher. It’s hard to make predictions when there is still no certainty on when a cure will become available (although recent data from Phase 1 clinical trials of several vaccine candidates are promising).“Overall, the Nibri suggests activity remains stuck at around 30 percentage points below pre-pandemic levels,” the Nomura research report said.The data merely reflects the situation on the ground. A report in HT last week said that around half the country’s population is under some form of lockdown — full, partial, or weekend — as local administrations deal with a sudden surge in cases.On Sunday, India saw in excess of 50,000 new coronavirus disease cases -- the first time it is crossing that mark, with 65% of the cases coming from states and Union Territories other than Delhi, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu, which, together, used to account for 65% of the cases in the country not so long ago. Delhi’s numbers have fallen sharply, but Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu’s have risen just as sharply — which means that the contribution of the big three to India’s Covid-19 tally is coming down because cases are rising in other parts of the country. Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal are all seeing a spike in new cases. Three of India’s four most populous states are in this list; the one that isn’t is Maharashtra, which saw 9,431 cases on Sunday — almost 19% of all new cases recorded in the country. Bihar, Karnataka, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh “face the immediate risk of becoming the new hot spots of the coronavirus disease in India”, HT’s Jamie Mullick wrote on July 27, pointing to factors that individually or together suggest this: “rapid rise in new cases, rising positivity rates, and low testing”.Many of these states have been resorting to localised lockdowns to slow the spread of the disease. For instance, Uttar Pradesh announced a hard lockdown on weekends and also in some parts of the state where there are clusters of infections; West Bengal announced one for two days every week; Bihar is locked down till July 31, as are parts of Andhra Pradesh.It is only natural that lockdowns in India’s most populous states affect activities, business or otherwise. And it is only natural that the Indian economy’s return to normalcy is affected by the ongoing health crisis in its most industrialised state (Maharashtra), whose capital also happens to be the country’s most important commercial hub.It will be a while before it is business as usual.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-S2hlpJVXl3xtHswl9FPZpM.html

28-07-2020||India||5 Rafales head to India in boost to its air power||Five Rafale fighter jets of the 36 ordered by the Indian Air Force (IAF) took off from Mérignac in France and will reach their home base in Ambala on July 29 after a stopover at the Al Dhafra airbase near Abu Dhabi — a move that will boost rapid deployment of the jets to upgrade India’s ageing air power amid tensions with neighbouring China and Pakistan.The two-leg flight will involve the Rafales covering a distance of nearly 7,000km. The five fighters landed safely at Al Dhafra after a seven-hour flight from France on Monday evening. “Real beauty and beast!” Indian ambassador to France Jawed Ashraf said while the planes were being flagged off in Bordeaux. “First five Rafale to India – swift, nimble, versatile, advanced and lethal,” he added. “This also marks a new milestone in the strong and growing India-France defence cooperation,” the Indian Embassy said in a statement.The new fighters — the first imported jets to be inducted into the IAF in 23 years after the Russian Sukhoi-30 jets entered service in June 1997 — will significantly enhance the offensive capabilities of IAF, which has for long planned to update its fighter jet force.The jets -- the first of the 36 Rafale jets purchased from French firm Dassault in a government-to-governent deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016 -- have been specially tailored for IAF. India-specific enhancements on the Rafales include a helmet-mounted sight, radar warning receivers, flight data recorders with storage for 10 hours of data, infrared search and track systems, jammers, cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases, and towed decoys to ward off incoming missiles. The twin-engine jet is capable of carrying out a variety of missions – ground and sea attack, air defence and air superiority, reconnaissance and nuclear strike deterrence. It can carry almost 10 tonnes of weapons on as many as 14 hard points.The delivery of the remaining 31 fourth-generation-plus fighters will be completed by the end of next year.The French air force refuelled the fighters — three single-seater and two twin-seater aircraft — using its Airbus A330 multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) aircraft on their way to Al Dhafra. Aerial refuelling support will be provided by the IAF’s Russian Ilyushin-78 refuellers for the second leg of the journey from Al Dhafra to Ambala.The jets are being flown by Indian pilots who have undergone comprehensive training on the aircraft, the IAF said. The Rafales will be a part of the IAF’s No. 17 Squadron, which is also known as the “Golden Arrows”. The aircrew bringing the Rafales to India is headed by Group Captain Harkirat Singh, a decorated fighter pilot, who is the commanding officer of the No. 17 Squadron. The first Rafale’s RB-001 tail number denotes the initials of the IAF chief: Rakesh Bhadauria. He led the complex negotiations for the Rafale deal. The Indian fighters will be equipped with Meteor missiles built by European defence major MBDA Missile Systems. The Meteor’s no-escape zone is touted to be three times greater than that of current medium range air-to-air missiles.It’s a magnificent achievement to get a fighter of this class decades after the IAF inducted the Mirage-2000s from France in the mid-1980s, said Air Chief Marshal Fali H Major (retd), a former IAF chief.“The Rafales bring tremendous capabilities to the table. We should now wait and watch how the fighter evolves in the Indian environment. I am sure it will meet each and every qualitative requirement of the IAF,” Major added.France handed over to India its first Rafale fighter during a ceremony attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh and his French counterpart, Florence Parly, in Merignac on October 8 last year. Air and ground crews of the IAF have been in France for almost three years for the management of the Rafale programme.The deal for the warplanes became controversial over allegations of corruption levelled by the Congress in the run up to the 2019 general elections, though the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government rejected the charge. The NDA government’s decision to buy 36 Rafales was announced in April 2015, with the deal signed a little more than a year later. This replaced the previous United Progressive Alliance’s decision to buy 126 Rafale aircraft, 108 of which were to be made in India by state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited using parts imported from France. A Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) audit tabled in February last year concluded that the new deal was 2.86% cheaper than the price negotiated by the UPA government. It did not disclose pricing details.“I am strongly impressed by the amazing efficiency and determination of the IAF and Indian Ministry of Defense, despite this unprecedented world health crisis, to master rapidly all aspects of the Rafale for Indian sovereignty and contributing to the protection and security of Indian people,” said Dassault Aviation chairman Eric Trappier.The IAF could deploy its new Rafale fighters in the Ladakh sector as part of India’s overarching plan to strengthen its military posture in the region, where Indian and Chinese forces are locked in a tense border confrontation and disengagement has turned out to be a challenging process, according to people aware of the developments.A brutal clash at the Line of Actual Control in the Galwan Valley in Ladakh last month left 20 Indian and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers dead. Tensions are also high with neighbouring Pakistan since India revoked the special status to Jammu & Kashmir in August last year.IAF’s air and ground crews have undergone comprehensive training on the aircraft, including its highly advanced weapons systems and are fully operational. Efforts will now focus on swift operationalisation of the aircraft, a person familiar with the matter said. Acting on a special request by IAF, France has accelerated the deliveries of Rafale fighters to India — five jets are coming instead of four that were originally planned to be delivered in the first batch. According to the original delivery schedule, the first 18 jets (including the four in the first batch) were to be delivered to the IAF by February 2021, with the rest expected by April-May 2022. However, all deliveries will be completed by the end of 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-rafales-head-to-india-in-boost-to-its-air-power/story-eIL5mv9pnXQ1I1t5CfXfoI.html
28-07-2020||India||Giant fish caught off Digha coast in Bengal; sold for ₹50k||A large fish belonging to the Ray family, most likely a giant Manta Ray given the location, was caught by a group of fishermen off the Digha coast near the Odisha-West Bengal border on Monday morning.Director of West Bengal United Fishermen Association, Pinaki Ranjan Kar said the fish weighed in around 800 kg and was caught by a group of fishermen 8 km off the Udaypur beach in Odisha near Digha . “The fishermen were shocked when they saw the fish in the net. The fishermen in Digha call it Shankar fish and resembles the ear of an elephant,” said Kar. The fish was 8 feet long and 5 feet wide. “Though the fishermen in Digha have earlier caught such fish, this was the heaviest,” he added. Sankar or Shankar fish is a generic name for all Rays in parts of East India. HT couldn’t independently verify the weight of the Manta Ray, though the species is known to reach much larger sixes (wingspans up to 7-8 metres in some cases; and weights in excess of 2000 kg)Kar said that soon after the news of the catch spread, a huge crowd to catch a glimpse of the fish at Digha. Later, a fish trading firm from West Bengal’s Ranighat locality of West Bengal bought it at a price of Rs 50,000. Parts of the Manta Ray (the gills for instance) are used in Chinese medicine, although the fish themselves are not rized for their meat. Giant Manta Rays are listed as vulnerable under the IUCN. Additional director of fisheries(marine) in Bhadrak, Chitta Ranjan Sahu said he is still verifying the authenticity of the video. “ Our people are trying to speak to the fishermen who caught the fish,” said Sahu.In March another large Manta Ray, weighing around 300 kg was caught by fishermen off the Digha coast. In January, a 200 kg one was caught in waters off Balaramgadi beach in Odisha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/giant-fish-caught-off-digha-coast-in-bengal-sold-for-50k/story-PY2IMWX4Yw3KnLW9koepsJ.html
28-07-2020||India||MoS Home praises CRPF, recalls ‘big damage’ it caused to China in 1959||Union minister of state for home Nityanand Rai on Monday paid tribute to the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) for its valour and sacrifice while recalling the “big damage” it caused to the Chinese Liberation Army (PLA) when it attacked a patrol of the Indian paramilitary force in Ladakh in October 1959. He drew parallels between the 1959 incident and the June 15 clash in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a face-off with the Chinese troops in Ladakh.Rai said China faced similar consequences on June 15 as it did in 1959 during a clash with CRPF men in Ladakh’s Hot Springs even as the paramilitary force was outnumbered. “What a coincidence. Whenever China attacks, its strength is huge and ours is less... but China has always suffered the consequences,” said Rai at a function to mark CRPF’s 82nd foundation day without elaborating. Union home minister Amit Shah was scheduled to attend the event but he could not because of some other meeting.China has not confirmed its casualties following the June 15 clash but has said they were on both sides. The clash marked the biggest loss of life in combat between India and China since 1967.Rai said on October 21, 1959, PLA troops attacked the CRPF patrol and killed 10 Indian troops besides taking seven as prisoners. He added the force showed great valour and caused “big damage” to the Chinese. The day (October 21) is also celebrated as the police memorial day, he added.“The CRPF has a rich history of valour and sacrifice...and on October 21, 1959, it showed that in Hot Springs in Ladakh when the Chinese attacked,” Rai said.He said the CRPF defended the country in Gujarat’s Sardar Post when a small team repulsed an attack by a 3,000-strong Pakistani army contingent in 1965. “Pakistan would shake with fear whenever it would recall this incident.”Rai said India has wiped out terrorism and naxalism (left-wing insurgency) under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Shah’s leadership. He added 150 terrorists have been killed in Kashmir over the last six months. Rai said terrorists should know they will have to either change their ideology or will be wiped out.Rai cited the 2019 Pulwama attack on a CRPF convoy in which 40 personnel were killed, and added Modi then declared this sacrifice will not go in vain.“The [air] force went into Pakistan and killed terrorists and Pakistan just kept watching. India did what it wanted to do,” Rai said, referring to the retaliatory air strikes in Pakistan’s Balakot in response to the attack.Rai said the country’s first home minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel gave the President’s colours to CRPF on July 27, 1950, in recognition of its good work in aligning princely states with India post-independence. But an official later said Patel gave the colours on March 19, 1950. The first CRPF battalion was raised on July 27, 1939, the official added. The force was raised as the Crown Representatives Police under the British. It was renamed CRPF in 1949.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mos-home-praises-crpf-recalls-big-damage-it-caused-to-china-in-1959/story-hjFLSe0BSofJEuLYXDYO9J.html
28-07-2020||India||UP leads in setting up biogas plants||The government has issued 515 letters of intent so far for setting up compressed biogas (CBG) plants across the country with a bulk of them--126--in Uttar Pradesh, according to official data. The plants are being set up as part of efforts to reduce dependence on imported fuel and to check pollution from crop residue burning that exacerbates air quality crisis in the National Capital Region (NCR) every winter, officials said.According to the data cited above, 75 of these plants are being set up in Maharashtra, 59 in Haryana, 35 in Andhra Pradesh, 24 in Punjab, and seven in Delhi. Gujarat has got the go-ahead for setting up 32 plants, Karnataka 25, Madhya Pradesh 24, Assam two, Bihar 11, Odisha nine, Chhattisgarh 22, Rajasthan five, Goa two, Tamil Nadu 16, Telangana nine, Jammu & Kashmir two, Uttarakhand nine, Jharkhand seven and West Bengal (13). The estimated cost for the 515 plants is about Rs 18,000 crore.A petroleum ministry spokesperson said under the Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation scheme, 5,000 plants are expected to be set up by 2023. The plants have the potential of producing 15 million metric tonne CBG and to proportionately reduce India’s dependence on energy imports, the spokesperson added.Bio-mass sources such as agricultural residue, cattle dung, sugarcane press mud, municipal solid waste, and sewage treatment plant waste produce biogas through the process of anaerobic decomposition. The biogas is purified to remove hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and water vapour to produce and compress CBG, which has more than 90% methane content, the (spokesperson?) said.“CBG has calorific value and other properties similar to compressed natural gas (CNG). Hence, it can be utilised as a green renewable automotive fuel. It can replace CNG in automotive, industrial, and commercial areas.”He said the move will also check pollution due to stubble burning. “Bio-mass surplus in India is about 150 million tonnes. From late September through October of each year, farmers mainly from Punjab and Haryana burn an estimated 35 million tonnes of crop waste as a low-cost straw-disposal practice. CBG plants can curb this practice by giving additional income options to the farmers,” he said.The smoke from stubble burning to make way for winter crop sowing combines with vehicular and industrial pollution and triggers air quality crisis in New Delhi and surrounding areas.India imports nearly 83% of crude oil its processes. About 50% of its natural gas requirement is also imported. The government has set a target to reduce this import dependence by 10% over the next two years.Commercial sale of CBG from seven Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) outlets have started for the first time an alternative to natural gas. Two of these outlets are in Maharashtra (Pune and Kohlapur) while five others are in Tamil Nadu (two in Salem and one each in Namakkal, Rasipuram, and Puduchatram), the (spokesperson?) said.Petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan inaugurated one such plant at Namakkal last month. Speaking on the occasion, he said the government has been promoting biofuels including CBG to increase the green-energy mix, reduce import dependence, create employment, especially in semi-urban and rural areas, and reduce pollution. “Usage of CBG shall assist in achieving climate change goals of India as per the Paris Agreement 2015,” he said. He added the CBG project is aligned with flagship schemes like Swachh Bharat (clean India)’, Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) and Make in India.The business is lucrative for entrepreneurs as state-run oil majors such as IOC and GAIL India take offtake guarantee to such plants. The government is also considering giving it a priority sector lending tag for easy and cheaper finance. It subsidies setting up of CBG projects, which could be availed up to 2020-21, the spokesperson said.According to Pradhan, the government is in the process of including bio-manure in the Fertilizer Control Order, 1985, to make the project more lucrative. Bio-manure is a key by-product of CBG plants. The move will make it easier for such plants to market bio-manure and provide an opportunity for organic farming.According to the oil ministry, 5,000 CBG plants are expected to produce 50 million metric tonnes of bio-manure.The spokesperson said countries like Germany, Italy, UK, France and Switzerland are promoting biogas usage. “The number of biogas plants in Germany has doubled to nearly 9,000 plants from 4,136 plants in 2010. The total biogas production capacity of the plants is 8.98 billion cubic meter, which is equivalent to 6.6 million metric tonnes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-leads-in-setting-up-biogas-plants/story-NHs5rpcWXWB3yvIPCkK7oL.html

R Meenakshi Sundaram, secretary for animal husbandry on Monday said the second phase of the nationwide artificial insemination scheme will be conducted from August 1 to May 31 next year. “Under this, a target has been set to successfully breed 50,000 animals in each district. Sex graded semen of native cow and buffalo will be made available to the cattle rearers for Rs. 100,” the secretary told reporters. Sundaram added that the objective of the scheme is to improve the breed of the livestock and increase the number of animals of high genetic quality, which in turn will help in improving the livelihood of locals. The second phase of the nationwide artificial insemination scheme will be available free of cost in all the villages, dairies and private artificial insemination centres. “If the animal is not able to conceive in one time, then free artificial insemination facility will be provided for the second and third time also. For this process, semen of all types of native and exotic species of cows and buffaloes will be available. Each animal will be given an identification card like an Aadhaar which will have a marking of their identification tag and the details will be shared on a national level portal,” said Sundaram. As part of the process, each artificial insemination worker will be paid Rs 50 for each conception and Rs 100 rupees on the birth of an offspring. This year the state government aims to impregnate three lakh animals from sex classified semen of indigenous cow and buffaloes for which cattle rearers will have to pay Rs 100.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/artificial-insemination-of-50-000-animals-across-himalayan-state-by-may-2021-says-state-govt/story-kfplZmRxJ1a7z7JDDBeutI.html
28-07-2020||India||Kulbhushan Jadhav case: New ordinance in Pakistan Parliament||The Pakistani government on Monday presented in Parliament an ordinance for approval to allow former Indian Navy commander Kulbhushan Jadhav, who is facing a death penalty for alleged espionage, to file a review petition against his sentence.The opposition opposed the International Court of Justice (Review and Reconsideration) Ordinance when Prime Minister Imran Khan’s adviser Babar Awan presented it. The government defended it insisting that they were bound by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling in July 2019 that ordered Pakistan to provide consular access to Jadhav and review his death sentence.The Opposition likened the proposed legislation to the National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO). Former military ruler Pervez Musharraf issued NRO in 2007 to granted amnesty to politicians, and bureaucrats facing cases. The country’s Supreme Court declared NRO unconstitutional in 2009.India on Thursday accused Pakistan of blocking all avenues for an effective review of the case and said it reserved its rights to avail of further remedies.The Pakistan government a day earlier petitioned the Islamabad high court to appoint a lawyer to represent Jadhav for filing the review petition against his death sentence. According to the petition, Jadhav has refused to file the petition. Jadhav cannot appoint a lawyer in Pakistan without India’s assistance, while New Delhi is also reluctant to avail the facility under the ordinance, the petition said.The government, in the petition, has asked the court to appoint a legal representative for Jadhav so that Pakistan can fulfil its responsibility to see to the implementation of the ICJ’s decision.India has said Pakistan has not provided documents related to the case and violated ICJ’s order.The Pakistani government promulgated the ordinance on May 20 to give foreign citizens convicted in the country the right to file review petitions in courts. The ordinance was aimed at complying with ICJ’s order for effective review and reconsideration of Jadhav’s conviction and sentencing by a Pakistani military court.In the absence of unhindered consular access to Jadhav and the documents, the Indian side tried, as a last resort, to file a review petition in Islamabad high court on July 18.Indian officials had walked out of a meeting with Jadhav on July 16 after Pakistan breached assurances about providing unimpeded consular access.Jadhav, 50, was arrested by Pakistani security agencies in Balochistan in March 2016 and charged with involvement in spying. In April 2017, Pakistan announced he had been sentenced to death by a military court.The ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan had violated Jadhav’s rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and stayed his execution while calling for an “effective review and reconsideration” of his sentence.India has rejected the allegations against Jadhav and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jadhav-case-new-ordinance-in-pak-parliament/story-3IijIZlgPvYPzGjdIt1bsJ.html
28-07-2020||India||End delay in calling session, urges Congress||The Congress on Monday expressed hope that President Ram Nath Kovind would intervene and instruct Rajasthan governor Kalraj Mishra to immediately convene a session of the state assembly to enable chief minister Ashok Gehlot to prove his majority on the floor of the House. Addressing a virtual news conference, former Union finance minister P Chidambaram alleged that BJP-appointed governors have “violated the letter and spirit” of the Constitution and have in the process “gravely impaired” parliamentary democracy, its conventions and traditions. Three former Union law ministers, all from the Congress, Kapil Sibal, Salman Khurshid and Ashwani Kumar , wrote to Mishra, asserting that the delay in calling an assembly session would create a “constitutional crisis”. The Congress also staged nationwide protests outside Raj Bhawans, except in Rajasthan where party legislators held a prayer meeting demanding that the House be convened immediately. The comments and the letters came after Mishra sent back with queries, for the second time, a Cabinet note seeking an assembly session (this time from July 31). “I sincerely hope that the President will take note of what is happening — the erosion of parliamentary democracy, the erosion of the Constitution, the violation of the Constitution — and do what is right in the circumstances,” Chidambaram told reporters. He said if the chief minister, who is accused of not enjoying a majority, wants to prove it he is entitled to call a session at the earliest to do so. “No one can stand in his way. Placing any obstacle to calling the assembly session would undermine the fundamental basis of a parliamentary democracy,” the senior Congress leader said, alleging that the Rajasthan issue has assumed “dangerous and monstrous proportions”. In an interview with HT last week, Mishra said no was demanding that Gehlot prove his majority. However, given the ongoing court case concerning 19 Congress rebels led by Sachin Pilot, and the thin majority enjoyed by the government (101 in a house of 200, excluding the speaker and an indisposed lawmaker), the thinking within the Congress is that it is best if it proves its majority immediately -- a move that would also mean another vote of confidence cannot be asked for in the next six months. Chidambaram added that a majority government cannot be pulled down and the Congress will continue to resist any such attempt. He said the governor is bound by the Constitution to act on the aid and advice of the council of ministers in calling the assembly session. “It is settled law that the governor shall act on the aid and advice of the council of ministers. The governor has no discretion — let me repeat, no discretion at all — in the matter. The questions that the governor had raised to stall the request were irrelevant and beyond his authority. His current stand that the law gives him a discretion to summon the assembly or not is a complete distortion of the law declared by the courts,” Chidambaram added. Congress leaders have accused Mishra of acting at the behest of the BJP-led central government. Asked if the Congress has lost all hope of bringing back Pilot and his supporters to the party fold, Chidambaram said: “I spoke to him many, many days ago. I have not spoken to him in the last 10 days or so, he has not called me either. It seems to me that he is embracing the BJP. In fact, he should be the first to stand up and say, please call the assembly session and then we will know which party he belongs to and what he will do”. Pilot has earlier denied speculations of joining the BJP. In their joint letter to the Rajasthan governor, the three senior Congress leaders and former law ministers said the governor’s office, as envisaged under the country’s constitutional scheme, is above and beyond the constraints and compulsions of partisan politics, “so that its holder can act freely and fairly to uphold the Constitution”. “Having served as Union Ministers of Law and Justice in different periods of time and as students of Constitutional law, we are of the clear view that established legal position obliges the Governor to call the assembly session in accordance with the advice of the state cabinet,” they added. “Any deviation from established constitutional position in the present circumstances would be an avoidable negation of your oath of office and will create a constitutional crisis,” the letter read. The BJP, however, said the Congress is targeting the governor to deflect attention from its internal fight. “The internal fight within the Congress party is the reason behind the political crisis in Rajasthan. Congress is known for misusing democracy and power. If Ashok Gehlot cannot handle power, he should resign,” BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said, pointing to the number of state governments dismissed by Indira Gandhi when she was Prime Minister and head of the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/end-delay-in-calling-session-urges-cong/story-VH9phSHxQrJrBgkQfrFJ3N.html
28-07-2020||India||Rajasthan assembly speaker withdraws Supreme Court plea over rebels’ disqualification||Rajasthan assembly speaker CP Joshi on Monday withdrew his plea before the Supreme Court that challenged a July 21 order by the state high court directing him to defer action on disqualification notices sent to 19 dissident Congress lawmakers, including former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot. On July 24, the Rajasthan HC passed a detailed order staying action by the speaker against the rebel Congress legislators while admitting the writ petition filed by the Pilot camp against the disqualification notices, senior counsel Kapil Sibal, who appeared for Joshi, told a three-judge bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra.The speaker’s plea before the apex court against the July 21 order has, therefore, become infructuous (ineffective) due to the July 24 order, Sibal pointed out. “So kindly permit us to withdraw this plea,” he requested. The court allowed the same while granting the speaker the liberty to avail appropriate legal remedy against the HC order of July 24. This means Joshi can file a fresh petition challenging that ruling. “Kapil Sibal has submitted that the high court has passed a detailed order [on July 24] and the ad interim order passed [on July 21] has merged into the final interim order that has been passed by the high court [on July 24]. Thus, he wants to withdraw this petition with liberty to avail appropriate remedy as against the subsequent order. Accordingly, the special leave petition [SLP] is dismissed as withdrawn,” the bench, which also comprised Justice BR Gavai and Justice Krishna Murari, recorded. Pilot and 18 Congress MLAs moved the Rajasthan HC on July 15, challenging the disqualification notices issued to them by Joshi. Subsequently, the high court on July 24 ordered status quo on the matter, admitted the writ petition by the Pilot camp and deferred its final verdict. Before that, on July 22, the speaker filed the SLP in the top court, challenging the HC’s July 21 order to defer disqualification proceedings. On July 23, the Supreme Court turned down the speaker’s request for a stay on that order and said it will hear the larger question of whether or not courts can interfere with disqualification proceedings initiated by an assembly speaker against lawmakers even before a decision has been taken. The top court’s refusal to grant stay paved the way for the high court to pronounce its order on July 24. The HC will now examine in detail the legal issues involved and the petition is unlikely to come up for hearing anytime soon. The legal battle began after the Congress chief whip, Mahesh Joshi, filed a complaint before the speaker on July 14, seeking action against Pilot and the other dissidents under paragraph 2 (1) (a) of the 10th Schedule of the Constitution. The provision disqualifies MLAs if they “voluntarily” give up the membership of the party which they represent in the House. Joshi, in his complaint, cited the absence of the MLAs from two Congress Legislature Party meetings, held on July 13 and 14, despite specific instructions. The rebels said Pilot never indicated any intention to leave the Congress party. In their petition filed in the HC, Pilot and the other MLAs submitted that were merely exercising their right to criticise party leadership and the functioning of the chief minister. The Pilot camp also challenged the validity of paragraph 2(1) (a) of the 10th Schedule, contending that the provision was very wide since even expression of opinion or views against party leadership are construed as defection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/speaker-withdraws-sc-plea-over-rebels-disqualification/story-VrzloR0AF9fMFWAjXtezOP.html
28-07-2020||India||No respite for Assam, Bihar as floods worsen||Assam and Bihar continued to face a grim flood situation as rivers continued to remain in spate and floodwater entered new areas across the two states, bulletins from the state disaster management authorities said on Monday. The death toll in Assam has risen to 103 after another person died from drowning on Monday. In its bulletin, the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) said the flood has hit over two million people in 22 of the state’s 33 districts. Goalpara continued to be the state’s worst-hit district with close to 462,000 people being affected by the flood, the bulletin said. It added that over 45,000 people, a majority of them from Goalpara, have been displaced and taking shelter in relief camps across 17 districts. According to a Central Water Commission (CWC) bulletin, a number of rivers continued to overflow in the state. The Brahmaputra was flowing above the danger mark at Nematighat, Tezpur, Goalpara and Dhubri districts while the Dhansiri, Jia Bharali, Kopili and Beki rivers were also flowing above red mark, it said. The flood situation at the Kaziranga National Park has improved, with 80% of its area now being inundated as compared to 90% till last week, park authorities said. Of the 223 forest camps in the park, 62 are inundated. Over 130 animals, including 14 rhinos, have died in the flood, officials familiar with the matter said. In Bihar, floodwaters spread to new areas in the 11 affected districts, affecting one million more population, the state disaster management department said. The department in its bulletin said said a total of 2.4 million people have been hit by flood across 11 of 38 districts in Bihar, with Darbhanga being the worst-affected. The Patna Meteorological Centre has warned of more rain in the coming days. “Monsoon trough has reached close to the foothills of the Himalayas. Another north-south trough from Bihar to north Odisha is lying 1.5km above mean sea level. Under these mechanisms, northern districts of Bihar including Supaul, Araria, Kishanganj and Madhepura are very likely to receive heavy rain in the following days,” SK Patel, duty officer at the centre said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-respite-for-assam-bihar-as-floods-worsen/story-3IOzjiUfvf7m8EfP7qEaaL.html
28-07-2020||India||Governor clears assembly session, but sets 3 conditions for government||Governor Kalraj Mishra asked the Rajasthan government on Monday to initiate proceedings to convene an assembly session, even as he asked it for a fresh proposal addressing his three recommendations — a 21-day notice for the sitting of the House; live-streaming of floor test, if it happens; and ensuring social distancing in view of the Covid-19 outbreak. “If the government wants to win a vote of confidence, then it can become a reasonable ground for calling the assembly session on short notice. But it has to be said,” a Raj Bhavan statement said on Monday. The statement came in the backdrop of persistent demand by the ruling Congress to convene the House. Confident of its numbers in the assembly, the party is pushing for a floor test in the assembly in the wake of a power tussle between Gehlot and former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot. The Congress accuses the governor of delaying the session due to pressure from the BJP-led central government — a charge that Mishra denies. Till late on Monday, the government did not officially respond to the governor’s concerns. Senior Congress leaders in Rajasthan, who held a discussion on the latest developments, said the three conditions could give more time to the state’s opposition BJP to try and get more MLAs on its side. On July 23, the Congress sent its first proposal to the governor for convening the session. A day later, Mishra asked the government to reply to his six-point questionnaire that raised issues such as why the session be should called at such a short notice and what preparations will be done in the wake of Covid-19. The Congress government sent a revised proposal the same day, reminding Mishra that he has to follow the aid and advice of the council of minister, but did not mention a trust vote. Monday’s Raj Bhavan statement said in such an extraordinary situation, it was not right to convene an urgent session and put the lives of 1,200 people— 1,000 assembly employees and 200 MLAs — in danger, a reference to the coronavirus pandemic. The governor said he had no problem if the session was called after a notice of 21 days, according to the statement. He also said discussions on important social and political issues could be done through online platforms. For conducting the trust vote in case one is moved, Mishra suggested that the proceedings be video-recorded and that the voting held though “yes” and “no” buttons. Congress leaders said a 21-day notice isn’t necessary and pointed out that in 2014, the third session of the 14th Rajasthan assembly was summoned on September 7 and the proceedings of the House began on September 15. “There have been umpteen instances when the assembly was called with a much shorter notice,” said Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi. A senior Congress functionary, who did not want to be named, ruled out the party going to court against the governor’s directions. “The governor would love to see us going to the court because then the issue of calling a session would get delayed…,” he said. BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said the governor had taken the right constitutional position. “In this Congress versus Congress fight, the governor and the BJP are being dragged unnecessarily,” he said.

28-07-2020||India||NIA quizzes CM’s former secy in Kerala gold smuggling case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday let off M Sivasankar, former secretary to the Kerala chief minister, after a nine-hour grilling session in connection with the Kerala gold smuggling case. He was directed to appear before the agency again on Tuesday.This is the third round of questioning, after the customs department and a session by the NIA. A senior IAS officer considered close to the CM, he was suspended from service after his alleged association with one of the accused in the case, Swapna Suresh, was revealed.Sivasankar’s counsel S Rajeev said an intense media trail was on and many reports emerging these days were far from the truth. He said Sivasankar was cooperating fully with the probe team. The principal secretary was embroiled in controversy after the seizure of 30 kilograms of gold from a consignment that was addressed to an employee of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on July 5.Following the seizure, there were reports that the CM’s office allegedly pressurised the customs to release the consignment. Sivasankar reportedly told investigators that although he knew some of them, he was not aware of their smuggling background. There are also reports that he was instrumental in appointing Suresh as the business development manager with the Kerala Information Technology Infrastructure Limited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-quizzes-cm-s-former-secy-in-kerala-gold-smuggling-case/story-4D8iAtIrL2kAeRKmw4rooK.html
28-07-2020||India||PM Cares a public fund, not intended to circumvent NDRF, govt tells Supreme Court||The central government on Monday dismissed concerns that PM Cares Fund is intended to circumvent National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), a statutory fund created under section 46 of the Disaster Management Act of 2005 (DM Act) for dealing with disasters.A three-judge bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan reserved its verdict.In a plea before the Supreme Court by NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL) seeking transfer of contributions made to PM Cares Fund till date to NDRF, the centre’s second senior-most law officer, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said that PM Cares Fund is a public charitable trust to which anyone can contribute.“Whatever amount that has to go to NDRF under the law will go (to NDRF). PM Cares is a public charitable trust. If private individuals want to donate, they can do so. There are several public charitable trusts getting donations”, Mehta maintained. NDRF is funded through budgetary allocations, the law officer pointed out. He was responding to the arguments of senior counsel Dushyant Dave, who claimed that PM Cares was a fraud on the Constitution and was intended to skirt the NDRF. The PM Cares Fund was set up by the central government on March 28 as a public charitable trust with the primary objective of dealing with any kind of emergency or distress situation such as that posed by Covid-19 pandemic.“See the objective of PM Cares. It is to be a dedicated national fund for distress situations such as Covid. This is a fraud upon Constitution. It’s a trust created to circumvent NDRF. It should be subjected to public scrutiny”, Dave, who was representing CPIL, said.He pointed out that PM Cares is not subject to audit by Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) but by private auditors.“This government believes in transparency. Why should private auditors audit it (PM Cares)? NDRF under the DM (disaster management) Act is audited by CAG”, he argued.The petitioner claimed PM Cares was set up in violation of the legal mandate under the DM Act according to which any grant made by any person or institution for the purpose of disaster management should be compulsorily credited to NDRF.“Even though there is a provision for NDRF under Section 46 of the Disaster Management Act, the central government has come up with a PM-CARES Fund. All the contribution being made by individuals and institutions in relation to Covid-19 crisis are being credited into the PM CARES Fund and not to the NDRF, in clear violation of Section 46 of the DM Act”, the petition added.Senior counsel Kapil Sibal, who was appearing for an intervenor, pointed out that contributions made towards PM Cares come within the purview of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporates would, therefore, prefer making donations to PM Cares. The Companies Act of 2013 mandates that companies having net worth of at least Rs. 500 crore, or turnover of Rs. 1000 crore or more or a net profit of at least Rs. 5 crore during immediately preceding financial year have to spend at least 2 percent of their profits towards activities listed as CSR activities under schedule VII of the Act.“There are CSR benefits attached to this fund. Why will any person contribute to NDRF when they get so much relief under PM Cares?” Sibal askedIn its affidavit filed before the top court on July 8, the centre submitted that PM Cares is a fund established to carry out relief work and there are several such funds established on similar lines in the past.“Mere existence of a statutory fund (NDRF) would not prohibit creation of a different fund like PM Cares Fund which provides for voluntary donations”, the affidavit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-cares-a-public-fund-not-intended-to-circumvent-ndrf-govt-tells-top-court/story-tXoXFyCQ7uC01dzc9LIh8J.html

It is very clear that the jail authorities have regular updates about Mr. Rao’s health.”It has been alleged that when Rao’s daughter tried to contact the authorities at Nanavati hospital, she was told that the jail administration has been informed, but the jail authorities asked her to check with the hospital. “It is a mystery why this information is not passed on to the family by the jail authorities?,” the letter read.“Rao is an under-trial prisoner in your custody and the jail authorities have the responsibility to give us regular updates or instruct the Nanavati hospital to release regular health bulletins,” the letter read.They have requested the home minister to intervene and direct Taloja jail authorities or Nanavati Hospital to provide regular updates on Rao’s health, diagnosis of his health problems and line of treatment.The family had approached National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) over the issue on Friday.In a letter written to NHRC, Rao’s wife P Hemalatha and his daughters P Sahaja, P Anala and P Pavana, asked the commission to direct the state government and prison authorities to give periodic update on Rao’s health and share details of the treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/varavara-s-family-writes-to-maha-minister-seeking-updates-on-health/story-yAaX9SnRBTzggJPjCDT9GM.html
28-07-2020||India||As Baghjan fire rages on, OIL sets July 30 deadline||The repair of an Oil India Limited (OIL)-operated well in Baghjan in Assam’s Tinsukia district which has been on fire since June 9, is down to a matter of replacing nuts and bolt-like studs and injecting a kill-fluid into the well, which is expected to be completed by July 30, a company spokesperson said Monday. New studs, fabricated at OIL’s Duliajan workshop, have been transferred to the site to replace those that were damaged and deformed in the blaze, a statement released by the company on Monday said. The blowout -- - an uncontrolled release of gas and oil condensate -- which occurred on May 27 has killed two firefighters, and caused a fire that has destroyed adjoining homes, injured three foreign experts examining the wellhead, and displaced at least 9000 people in the district, who have moved to relief camps.“While all other logistical requirements have been completed, two jobs, namely, capping the well and killing it, remain. To cap the well, we need to install the blow out preventer (BOP) on top of the wellhead,” said Tridiv Hazarika, OIL spokesperson. The wellhead has a mechanical device called a spool, which carries the weight of the blow out preventer (BOP).It was while removing one such damaged spool on July 22 that the foreign experts sustained injuries. “While inspecting the second spool which was not damaged, it was found that some studs, similar to nuts and bolts, were damaged. Without preparing the spool, removing the damaged studs and installing new studs, the BOP, which weighs around three tonnes, cannot be installed,” said Hazarika. A considerable amount of time was spent in removing the damaged studs, he added. “It is a precise operation and it needs to be done correctly as the spool will carry the weight of the BOP. If there is even the slightest fault, it will lead to severe problems. Hence, these tasks were done with extreme caution and they delayed our operation further,” Hazarika said. Once the BOP is installed, the process of killing the well would start. This would involve injecting a kill fluid, which is a sludge-like specially prepared mud, into the well slowly to push the gas from the well back to the reservoir. “The length of the well is 3.5 km. So, it could take around 36-40 hours to fill the well with sludge and kill the well. Once the BOP is in place within the next two days, the killing operation would begin and the entire exercise should be over by July 30,” Hazarika said. There are 17 oil and five gas wells in the Baghjan oil field. The blowout took place in gas well no.5.Since the well is located close to Dibru Saikhowa National Park and the ecologically-sensitive Maguri Motapung Wetland, there were fears of environmental damage to the area due to the blowout and fire. Various assessment and impact studies of the blowout as well as the blaze in villages and nearby forest areas by multiple agencies such as ERM India, TERI, CSIR-NEIST and IIT-Guwahati are underway.Last month, National Green Tribunal ordered the formation of an expert committee to probe the blowout and subsequent fire and assess the damage caused to human life, wildlife, and the environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-baghjan-fire-rages-on-oil-sets-july-30-deadline/story-dlFo7j251wmYrcdmTilJkO.html
28-07-2020||India||Review CAPF recruitment rules: Delhi HC to govt||The Delhi high court on Monday directed the ministry of home affairs (MHA) to review the recruitment rules of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF). The CAPF consists of seven forces -- Assam Rifles (AR), Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), National Security Guard (NSG), Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB)— that come under the authority of the MHA. The CAPF cadre officers have sought an amendment to the rules of recruitment and appealed that the vacancies of Senior Administrative Grade (SAG) should be filled by promotion and not by deputation of IPS officers. In several writ petitions filed since 2009, the officers have contested that that the salaries and perks of CAPFs’ cadre officers, who are directly recruited, should be at par with IPS officers. A bench of Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Justice Asha Menon directed the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to immediately review the existing recruitment rules of each CAPF and place its decision in this regard before the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT). “We find merit in the contention of the senior counsel/counsel for the petitioners, that during the Cadre Review, the Cadre Officers of CAPFs are also required to be compulsorily given an opportunity of hearing and be heard. Even if IPS Officers are occupying any posts in CAPFs, grant of opportunity of hearing to them is not the same as grant of opportunity to the Cadre Officers of CAPFs. It is only the Cadre Officers of CAPFs who have grievances qua stagnation, residency etc. and the IPS Officers, even if manning some posts in CAPFs, are not aggrieved therefrom,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/review-capf-recruitment-rules-hc-to-govt/story-vm9Kx1fSoDumi5GmIuFiNL.html
28-07-2020||India||RBI faced ‘intense pressure’ on liquidity: Former deputy governor||The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was under “intense pressure” to open up “liquidity and credit taps” to prop up the economy, and its crackdown against non-performing borrowers was being “stayed”, the former deputy governor of India’s central bank Viral V Acharya has said in his book, giving new details on why he unexpectedly decided to quit his job while six months were still left in his tenure. In his book, “Quest for Restoring Financial Stability in India”, published by SAGE Publications, Acharya argues that several policies “regressed” the economic environment while he was deputy governor between early January 2017 and mid-July 2019. “Capital was injected in weaker rather than healthier public sector banks; not much market capital was raised by any of these banks as originally envisaged; capital standards and PCA [prompt corrective action] framework were diluted; forbearance in loss recognition crept in again for some asset classes; and the resolution of several non-performing borrowers under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was stayed,” according to the book.At another point in the book, Acharya writes that RBI resisted and reasoned against such moves, and in the end, after some compromises, its earlier steps to restore financial stability prevailed. “There was no doubt a marked attrition in outcomes relative to our original objectives, but a complete degeneration into excessive monetary and credit stimulus that had caused the Indian financial sector to lose its stability in just the previous decade had been rendered difficult,” he wrote.This friction, he indicates in the book, led to the departure of then RBI governor Urjit Patel. “Nevertheless, attempts to alter the governance structure of the RBI to institutionalise such outcomes in future would have meant crossing the Rubicon and had to be foiled. As a result, the RBI lost its governor on the altar of financial stability,” Acharya wrote. The reference, while not naming Patel, ostensibly was to the resignation of Patel in December 2018.The finance ministry did not respond to an email query on this matter.His thoughts when he was coming to Mumbai in January 2017, he writes, were that “the Indian banking sector was sitting on one of the highest non-performing loans to assets ratio among the G20 countries and even among the group of emerging markets — a marked departure since its standing in 2009”.He writes that the banking sector stress in India tends to play out somewhat silently, just as in China where state-owned banks hold the majority of deposits and loans. “This is because government ownership rules out that depositors en masse ‘run’ on public sector banks even if bank borrowers default en masse, which some consider a positive backdrop for financial stability, unless and until the sovereign balance sheet solvency is itself considered to be on the brink.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rbi-faced-intense-pressure-on-liquidity-former-deputy-guv/story-5FgZzTbtjSHcT1uDu5XBdP.html
28-07-2020||India||RBI chief pinpoints fiveshifts to shape economy||New Delhi: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das on Monday said five dynamic shifts -- fortunes shifting in favour of the farm sector, changing the energy mix in favour of renewable, leveraging information and communication technology (ICT) and startups, strengthening supply and value chains, and focusing on infrastructure as a growth multiplier -- have the potential to shape the future of the Indian economy.“They (the five factors) may escape our attention in this all-consuming engrossment with the [Covid-19] pandemic, but they could be nursing the potential to repair, to rebuild and to renew our tryst with developmental aspirations. These dynamic shifts have been taking place incipiently for some time,” Das told the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) via video conference.Commenting on the infrastructure as a growth driver, he said the infrastructure gap still remains large and there is a need for diversifying financing options. “Promotion of the corporate bond market, securitisation to enhance market-based solutions to the problem of stressed assets, and appropriate pricing and collection of user charges should continue to receive priority in policy attention,” he said.Das suggested that a big push to some targeted mega infrastructure projects could reignite the economy. “This could begin in the form of a north-south and east-west expressway together with high speed rail corridors, both of which would generate large forward and backward linkages,” he said.On agricultural transformation, Das suggested a change in policy focus from minimum support price (MSP). “Hitherto, the main instrument has been minimum support prices, but the experience has been that price incentives have been costly, inefficient and even distortive,” he said.He hoped that an efficient domestic supply chain will facilitate “domestic free trade” in agriculture that is triggered by three key policy changes -- the amendment of the Essential Commodities Act (ECA); the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance; and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance.With this enabling legislative framework, the focus must turn to crop diversification, food processing, agricultural exports, and public and private capital formation in the farm sector, he said. A similar opportunity now exists in the energy sector, especially renewable, Das said, adding that India is now a power surplus country, exporting electricity to neighbouring countries.The shift to greener energy would reduce the coal import bill, create employment opportunities, ensure sustained inflow of new investments and promote ecologically sustainable growth, he said, but added that reforming retail distribution of electricity while reducing commercial, technical and transmission losses remained a key challenge.Das described ICT and startups as key growth drivers. “The ICT revolution has placed India on the global map as a competent, reliable, and low-cost supplier of knowledge-based solutions,” he said. He said Covid-19 has impacted the outlook for startups, particularly the availability of funding due to the atmosphere of risk aversion. Regulatory uncertainty relating to work permits and immigration policies could also amplify challenges. The sector has to also deal with concerns relating to data privacy and data security, he added.“Promoting young firms and startups will be critical for greater employment generation and higher productivity-led economic growth in India,” he said.Das said this is the time to strengthen domestic and global supply chain. “Investment in sectors with strong forward and backward linkages in the supply chain can generate higher production, income and employment. Consequently, identification of such sectors becomes critical for strategic policy interventions,” he said.Global shifts in value chains in response to Covid-19 and other developments will create opportunities for India, he said. “Besides focusing on diversifying sources of imports, it may also be necessary to focus on greater strategic trade integration, including in the form of early completion of bilateral free trade agreements with the US, EU and UK.”DK Srivastava, chief policy advisor at consultancy firm EY India said the RBI governor has invited India’s corporate sector to invest heavily in these five sectors that define an ongoing economic shift in the Indian economy.“First, in agriculture, the government’s new regulatory initiatives, including the creation of a genuine all-India market in agricultural products, will make returns to investment in agriculture more remunerative. Second, in the case of renewables, there is a clear scope for taking advantage of progressive cost reductions and substituting imports of solar panels from China by creating domestic capacity. Third, in the case ICT, the government’s initiatives for curbing Chinese technologies and applications opens up competitive space for Indian initiatives. Fourth, global supply chains are bound to be realigned in favour of India, and the private sector should invest extensively and take advantage of the space that is being opened up,” he said.Srivastava proposed another round of financial stimulus. “To finance public investment in infrastructure, government may consider another round of fiscal stimulus focused mainly on increasing government’s capital expenditure on infrastructure,” he said. The state governments may also be persuaded to borrow up to the enhanced limit of 5% of their respective gross state domestic product (GSDP) and the prerequite conditions for availing of this increased limit may also be relaxed”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rbi-chief-pinpoints-fiveshifts-to-shape-economy/story-JP1LBwOZdNGbRzb52GDNUK.html
28-07-2020||India||France to donate 120 ventilators, 50k kits||France on Monday announced it will provide India with 120 ventilators and 50,000 test kits to counter the Covid-19 pandemic. The move coincided with the first five of 36 Rafale combat jets, ordered by New Delhi, flying out from a French airbase for the country. A team of French personnel, who are experts in inter-hospital transfers by military means, is also being sent to India. A French Air Force aircraft will fly in the equipment and personnel on Tuesday. The Airbus A330 MRTT aircraft is equipped with a “Morpheus” kit that enables the transport of critically-ill patients. The donation of the medical equipment and provision of technical expertise is in line with a recent announcement by President Emmanuel Macron, the French embassy said in a statement. The medical assistance package includes 50 Osiris-3 ventilators, which are portable and easy to use, and 70 Yuwell 830 ventilators with “bilevel positive airway pressure” (BiPAP mode), which are non-invasive hospital ventilators for mild Covid-19 patients. The Osiris ventilators are useful for emergency transport, intra-hospital transfer and recovery, and have different modes, including non-invasive ventilation. The Yuwell 830 ventilators use BiPAP to supply oxygen to lungs without intubation. France will also donate 50,000 high-quality serological IgG/IgM test kits and 50,000 nose and throat swabs and modes of medical transport. “As longstanding strategic partners, France and India are working together closely on the international response to the Covid-19 pandemic as well as providing reciprocal assistance according to the needs of the two countries,” the statement said. In a letter dated July 24, Macron thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for India’s support to France with medical supplies earlier this year. Macron wrote: “When France was going through a critical phase of this public health crisis earlier this spring, India was by our side. It played a very important role with regard to medicines. I wish to thank you once again for having authorised the export of medicines essential for the treatment of critically ill patients. This gesture reflected the exceptional nature of the partnership between our two countries.” He added, “India, in turn, is going through a difficult phase of the crisis. In these painful times for your nation, I desired France to stand fully by your side. To this end, I directed that we be able to respond to the needs identified by your administration by extending aid that is exceptional in its scope and modalities. “I believe that it is during tough times that historic ties are forged and strengthened between nations.” The announcement of the medical assistance coincided with the five Rafale jets leaving a French airbase for the 7,000-km journey to India with air-to-air refuelling and a stop en route in the United Arab Emirates. They are scheduled to reach India on July 29. France has completed the delivery of 10 jets on schedule, and five will stay back for a training mission. The delivery of all 36 jets will be completed by the end of 2021. French ambassador Emmanuel Lenain will hand over the medical equipment to RK Jain, secretary general of the Indian Red Cross Society, on Tuesday. France had earlier extended financial support of 200 million euros to India through the French Development Agency (AFD) to boost social welfare systems and protect vulnerable people. The credit financing agreement was signed on June 22, with the programme designed by the World Bank already being rolled out. French companies have contributed more than six million euros (₹48 crore) to India’s national relief funds as part of their Covid-19 crisis response. Several companies have also supplied essential medical equipment and others are providing help to vulnerable sections of society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/france-to-donate-120-ventilators-50k-kits/story-ioUyqqV1stYBGnd1ClTO6I.html
28-07-2020||India||China calls on Afghanistan, Nepal and Pakistan to fortify ties||China on Monday urged Afghanistan, Nepal and Pakistan to forge “four-party cooperation” to overcome the Covid-19 crisis and continue work on projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), including the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Presiding over a virtual meeting with his counterparts from the three countries, China’s foreign minister Wang Yi said the four states should work together to extend CPEC to Afghanistan. The video conference, organised by Beijing ostensibly to discuss the Covid-19 pandemic, was held against the backdrop of the months-long India-China border stand-off. Given India’s currently strained ties with Nepal, the meeting is unlikely to go down well with the foreign policy establishment in New Delhi.The online meeting was joined by Pakistan’s foreign and economic ministers, Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Khushro Bakhtiar, Nepal’s foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali and Afghanistan’s acting foreign minister Hanif Atmar. Wang, one of China’s senior-most diplomats with the rank of state councillor, said the four states should give “full play to geographic advantages, strengthen exchanges and connections between the four countries and Central Asian countries, and maintain regional peace and stability”, according to a statement in Mandarin issued on Monday night. The four countries should also “actively promote the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and the trans-Himalayan three-dimensional interconnectivity network, support the extension of [CPEC] to Afghanistan, and further release the regional interconnection dividend,” he said. Even for China, it is rare to call for four-party cooperation in South Asia without involving India. But the move fits Beijing’s current narrative. The statement from China’s foreign ministry indicated Beijing is looking at a more permanent cooperation mechanism with the three South Asian countries than just working together to counter the pandemic. The meeting added to Beijing’s own narrative that it is ready to play a bigger role in war-torn Afghanistan’s peace process. For Nepal, it was an opportunity to send out a message about its increasingly snug ties with China amid the strained relations with India. As for Pakistan, Wang himself cited the example of “iron brother” ties between Islamabad and Beijing. Emphasising that having good neighbours is “good fortune”, Wang called on Nepal and Afghanistan to follow the example of Sino-Pakistan cooperation to fight the pandemic. Wang said learning from the Sino-Pakistan cooperation, Afghanistan and Nepal should expand four-nation joint prevention and control of Covid-19 and make arrangements for epidemic prevention, resumption of economic activity and personnel exchanges. He said under the principle of anti-epidemic cooperation, the four countries should open up “fast channels” and “green channels” for personnel and logistics as soon as possible. They should also strengthen joint prevention and control in border areas, and frame jointly recognised standard operating procedures for epidemic notification, prevention, management and control, he said. As part of post-pandemic recovery and economic development, Wang said, the other countries should firmly promote the joint construction of BRI, promote the resumption of key cooperation projects, maintain the stability of industrial and supply chains, and create new economic growth points in the digital field.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-calls-on-afghanistan-nepal-and-pak-to-fortify-ties/story-Ge0pgNu0N2AYl9eS7uEovO.html
28-07-2020||India||PM launches three ICMR labs to boost testing capacity by 30k||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday launched three state-of-the-art high throughput Indian Council of Medical Research labs in Mumbai, Kolkata, and Noida to further ramp up the country’s daily Covid-19 testing capacity by 10,000. Speaking on the occasion, he said over 500,000 tests were being conducted in the country daily, and efforts were underway to increase the capacity to a million in the coming weeks.The tests are being conducted using both real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and antigen-based testing. According to government data, at least 25% of the daily testing is antigen-based. It is quicker, cheaper, and easier to perform than the RT-PCR testing, which remains the gold standard for diagnosing Covid-19, experts say.Modi said more tests will assist early detection and treatment, and thereby help fight the virus spread. “These labs will not be limited to testing for Covid-19, but in future, will also be able to test for other diseases such as hepatitis B and C, HIV, dengue, tuberculosis among others,” said Modi while launching the labs. “Opening of these facilities will provide us the necessary strength required to scale up testing in states such as Maharashtra, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi. These are also cities with maximum economic activity so there is a larger movement of people. With the help of these facilities, our teams will be able to process a larger number of samples in one go.”Modi cited the government’s pre-emptive and proactive efforts and added it was due to these timely decisions that India is better placed as compared to other countries in terms of the Covid-related deaths.India’s recovery rate is also higher than in other countries and is improving on a daily basis. The total number of people who have recovered from the virus is about to reach a million.Modi said the Centre announced Rs 15,000 crore package at the beginning of this battle and that the country now has over 11,000 Covid-19 facilities and more than 1.1 million isolation beds. “While the country had only one Covid-19 testing centre in January, there are almost 1,300 such labs now.”Modi said from not having even a single personal protection equipment kit manufacturer as recently as six months ago, India now has over 1,200 manufacturers now, who are producing more than 500,000 such kits daily. “From being dependent on imports, now more than 3 lakh [300,000] N-95 masks are being produced in the country daily. The annual production capacity of ventilators has become 3 lakh [300,000] and there has also been a significant increase in the production of medical oxygen cylinders. This has not only helped save lives but has also converted India from an importer to an exporter.”Modi asked people to be careful during the coming festive season as chances of the virus spread are higher. “…till the time a vaccine is not developed, do gaz doori [distancing], wearing masks and hand sanitization are the tools at the disposal of the people to keep them safe.”Dr T Jacob John, a former virology department head at Vellore’s Christian College, said as the number of cases is rising, more samples need to be tested quickly. “High throughput facilities can test a large number of samples as compared to a normal testing machine that can run a limited number of samples in one go. It is important to get early results for appropriate diagnosis, tracing, and treating those who are infected so that the disease spread is controlled effectively.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-launches-three-icmr-labs-to-boost-testing-capacity-by-30k/story-m8nHacKmaqDjAg9RWYEhrJ.html
28-07-2020||India||Weekend lockdowns will not bring us results: Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar spoke to Ramesh Vinayak and Hitender Rao about reviving the economy after the pandemic, the virus trajectory in Gurugram, and running a coalition government, among other issues. Edited excerpts: How is the economy shaping up post the lockdown? How good are revenue receipts and how much is your dependence on the market borrowings? April was bad for us. In fact, the revenue shortfall for April, May and June was about Rs 9,000 crore. We have tried to make up for it by borrowing from the market. Revenue started trickling in after the lockdown was relaxed and the collections were about 60% in June. By July 20, we have recovered well and are at par with our projections. We are now able to meet our routine expenses on our own. What budgetary cut are you contemplating in the revised estimates? It is quite understandable considering the deficit. The Rs 9,000 crore revenue shortfall would force us to recalibrate our outlay. How will the downturn in fiscal health impact the state’s development projects and welfare schemes? There will be no impact on welfare schemes, though our development projects have been delayed by three months. During the pandemic, we have spend an additional Rs 1,500 crore to give relief to people including Rs 600-650 crore cash distribution. This money was spent on the medical services, ration distribution, arranging return of migrant labour, and relief camps. In your role as finance minister, how do you plan to boost the economy during the pandemic?The central government package of Rs 20 lakh crore is a big relief. In the changing scenario due to the Covid-19 situation, I feel that the service sector will suffer but the manufacturing and agriculture sectors will do well.The central government has sought the views of the state and parents of students about reopening of schools. We will not open primary schools and will take a call for higher classes in August. Colleges and professional institutions would be the first to start. Projections show a rising coronavirus infection trajectory in the coming months. How do you plan to augment the health infrastructure including ventilator beds to meet any eventuality?See, what essentially matters is the number of active cases and not the cumulative numbers. How many patients have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic is important since such patients qualify for home isolation and takes pressure off our systems. As per our current projections and rate of recovery, we are doing well in terms of health infrastructure. But we keep reviewing it. The NCR districts of Gurugram, Faridabad and Sonepat have a majority of Covid-19 cases. Health minister Anil Vij hinted at the possibility of stricter curbs. Is a curfew or a selective lockdown on the cards?The weekend lockdowns will not bring us results. Things are slowly coming back on track and the imposition of a fresh lockdown would mean putting pressure on people. Our strategy instead is to go for aggressive containment in the NCR districts. We are screening more people and conducting more tests. Prime Minister Narendra Modi recommended that NCR districts should follow Delhi’s model for combating the spread of the coronavirus. Do you see a need to work with Delhi since the increase in the number of cases in Gurugram has been attributed to the movement of people between the two cities? We, along with Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, are implementing a common strategy for combating the infection. Infection travelled to Haryana from Delhi initially, but now both states are at par in terms of contagion spread. Since there is so much back-and-forth movement from Delhi to Haryana, it is hard to conclude now on the origin of the contagion. Gurugram was kept in the orange zone despite a sharp rise in the number of cases to facilitate the reopening of the industry. What impact did the closure of businesses in the Millennium City have on the state’s revenue? How is the government planning to boost the local economy? We cannot overlook the adverse economic impact of three months. But if you look at the power consumption for the industry, it is at par with 2019. This means that the industry is operating at the same capacity as it was last year. Of course, there could be workforce engagement related issues because of the need to maintain social distancing. You recently spoke in Mewat about enacting a Freedom of Religion law to prohibit religious conversions by force, allurement or marriage. Why do you feel the need for such a law?There were complaints regarding forced conversions and marriages from many districts. People are free to adopt any religion in an informed manner but using coercion, allurement to force religious conversions is a matter of concern. Such incidents vitiate the atmosphere of society. We are studying similar laws enacted by other states and accordingly take a call. How has been your experience of running a coalition government so far? The BJP and Jannayak Janta Party have not been able decide on the common minimum programme. Any deadline? We are not new to coalition politics in the state. The BJP and the JJP both are like-minded entities, and both oppose the Congress. Common minimum programme is not a major issue because we do not have any conflict with our ally. We are well synchronized. The proposed 75 % private sector quota law is an example that we are on similar page.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/weekend-lockdowns-will-not-bring-us-results-haryana-cm/story-RxaEMOYAR4Kjad4MhsHnKN.html
28-07-2020||India||How the cold will alter the India-China power equation next month in Ladakh||On June 15 evening when the Indian Army troops clashed with People’s Liberation Army (PLA) at Galwan, the temperature of the river was close to zero (and below it in some places) and a large number of troops on both sides fatally succumbed to hypoxia (low oxygen levels because of the altitude) and hypothermia (excessive cold), people familiar with the matter said. According to Indian military commanders, this information is relevant because starting September, the weather will start taking a hand in Eastern Ladakh, where Indian and Chinese troops are still locked in a stand-off as an uneasy truce between the two countries plays out. According to accounts given by the survivors of the clash, a large number of Chinese PLA troops came in an armoured personnel carrier and soon started dropping down due to lack of oxygen at 16000 feet when the fisticuffs began between the two armies. If lack of oxygen did not get them, then the frozen Galwan river did the job.While the Chinese PLA has not revealed the number of troops from III mechanized infantry of Xinjiang Military District that lost their lives in the clash, these are more, and not less than that suffered by the Indian side which loses 20 soldiers, the military commanders added, asking not to be named. Throughout the intervening night of June 15 and 16, two Chinese PLA helicopters carted the dead and injured to nearby hospitals or to hyperbaric chambers in depth areas.Although both sides decided to disengage after the Special Representative level dialogue on July 5, the exercise is long drawn out with winter ready to move into the theatre next month and firmly set in September in all the friction points. “ It is not the temperature that will kill but the wind which increases the chill factor. Add to this the rarefied atmosphere at Galwan, Gogra-Hot Springs and the weather takes a turn for the worse,” said a senior military commander.The military commanders said adverse weather conditions, including up to seven feet of snow, could put the Chinese at a disadvantage because its army in Akasi Chin is largely made of conscripts, who were drafted for a three month annual summer exercise in Tibet and Xinjiang in return for the state taking care of their future education. The PLA conscripts are used to moving on armoured carriers in contrast to their Indian counterparts who not only patrol on foot but live in the worst of weather conditions whether in Siachen or in Sikkim or in Thag La ridge in Tawang, the commanders added. The Indian Army has been fighting since 1984 in Siachen, Kashmir and North-east mountain theatre, the commanders pointed out. Even today, the Indian Army mans Indira Col west, the farthest point on Siachen Glacier, Sikkim finger area, Doklam, and posts in the mountain ridges in Arunachal Pradesh.The Indian Army has specialized in high altitude warfare and has the capacity to take on the enemy from the front as it proved during the 1999 Kargil war, where it fought from heights of Muskoh to Chorbat La in the Gilgit Baltistan area, the commanders said . As both India and China are fully deployed in Aksai Chin area and de-escalation is still some time away, the PLA will soon have to take a call on whether to end its aggression and restore status quo ante or be prepared to spend nights on Tibetan plateau where temperatures of 25 degrees below zero is normal, analysts said. Winter does not take toll on the troops alone but also on equipment with artillery barrels and engines freezing.The other issue that the PLA will also have to keep in mind is that the Indian Army is deployed all along the 3488 km long Line of Actual Control between the two countries, while the PLA is only deployed in selected places, the analysts added. This includes Sikkim, where the Indian Army surrounds the Chumbi Valley from three sides||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cold-will-add-new-twist-to-stand-off-from-september/story-Xs8fiZcdjpXnqFzZLRtRWK.html
28-07-2020||India||Rafale jets reaching Ambala airbase tomorrow to be game changer for IAF||India’s new Rafale fighters will significantly enhance the offensive capabilities of the air force and prove to be a game changer with their advanced weaponry, high-tech sensors, superior radar for detection and tracking of targets and ability to carry an impressive payload, people familiar with the aircraft’s capability said. The IAF’s Rafale jets will be armed with Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, Mica multi-mission air-to-air missiles and Scalp deep-strike cruise missiles — weapons that will allow fighter pilots to attack air and ground targets from standoff ranges and fill a significant capability gap, said one of the officials cited above.The Meteor’s no-escape zone is touted to be three times greater than that of current medium range air-to-air missiles.The twin-engine fighter jet’s ‘payload fraction’ — its maximum take-off weight vis-a-vis its overall empty weight — is unmatched in aircraft of the same class, said a second official, who was associated with the Rafale project. “The Rafale’s empty weight is 10 tonnes and its maximum take-off weight is around 25 tonnes. Even transport aircraft don’t have that kind of payload fraction. The Rafale can carry a lot of weapons,” he said.The jet is capable of carrying out a variety of missions — ground and sea attack, air defence and air superiority, reconnaissance and nuclear strike deterrence. It can carry almost 10 tonnes of weapons and five tonnes of fuel. The fighter can easily switch from one role to another without compromising performance, said a third official.“The Rafale, by itself, is a very potent weapon platform but one must remember that modern wars are fought between systems. The jet has to be integrated into the IAF’s war fighting architecture — a task that the air force will certainly expedite but will require a finite time,” said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.When fully integrated, the Rafale would be an important part of the IAF’s offensive plans, Bahadur added. The active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar on the Rafale and its weapons package make it a formidable platform, said Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha (retd), a former IAF chief. “The Rafale will be a battle winner for the IAF and a huge morale booster at a time of military tensions with China. However, I feel the numbers are not adequate,” Raha said.He said the IAF should go in for more Rafale fighter jets as the order for 36 jets was not enough. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s decision to enter into a government-to-government deal with France to buy 36 Rafale warplanes was announced in April 2015 with the deal signed a little over a year later. This replaced the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime’s decision to buy 126 Rafale aircraft, 108 of which were to be made in India by HAL using parts imported from France.The outcome of the dogfight with Pakistan Air Force on February 27, 2019, would have been vastly different if the IAF was equipped with Rafale jets then, said a fourth official who was involved in assessing that aerial combat.The dogfight took place a day after the IAF’s Mirage-2000s struck targets in Pakistan’s Balakot in response to the Pulwama suicide attack in Kashmir in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) men were killed. India is looking at arming the Rafale fighter jets with an all-weather smart weapon of French origin that will allow combat pilots to engage ground targets from a standoff range of up to 60km. The IAF is likely to initiate the purchase of Hammer (Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range) using the emergency financial powers granted to the military by the government at a time of border tensions with China. The Rafale jets have been specially tailored for the IAF.India-specific enhancements on the jets include cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases including Leh, radar warning receivers, flight data recorders with storage for 10 hours of data, infrared search and track systems, jammers, helmet-mounted sight and towed decoys to ward off incoming missiles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rafale-jets-to-be-a-game-changer-for-iaf/story-9JFbDz9rTmU8k9SK3k9RCP.html
28-07-2020||Editorials||India needs a robust EIA process | HT Editorial||On Monday, former environment minister and senior Congress leader, Jairam Ramesh, reiterated that the draft Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), 2020 notification was not based on research, reduced public participation, and represented an attitude which viewed environmental regulation as an “unnecessary...burden”, not as a means to ensure the welfare of people and sustainable development. Union minister of environment, forest and climate change, Prakash Javadekar, termed Mr Ramesh’s comments “unfounded”. But Mr Ramesh is not the only one with concerns. On July 10, 100 environmental researchers, activists, ecologists, conservationists, and former members of government bodies sent a letter to Mr Javadekar, critiquing the notification.The critics claim that the draft EIA legitimises post-facto environment clearance; excludes major industries from the EIA process; subverts the public hearing process; reduces the scope of citizens to report violations, and fails to address a project’s impact on wildlife, and habitats. This is mostly true. They also claim the draft fails to address the conflict of interest that arises from the fact that a project proponent can choose a consultant to do impact assessment; and the quality of composition of the expert appraisal committee, which is often staffed by those with no technical expertise. These, too, are valid objections. Mr Javadekar has a critical role in protecting the environment and vulnerable communities. It is imperative that he patiently listens to the objections on the draft EIA, even if they are coming from Opposition party members. India deserves a robust EIA. This will be possible only if the consultative process is intense, rigorous and takes into account legitimate concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/india-needs-a-robust-eia-process/story-lpnpfhkIWnWOH1KATrteGK.html
28-07-2020||Editorials||Why the new climate centre for cities matters | HT Editorial||The Union ministry of housing and urban affairs recently set up the Climate Centre for Cities to strengthen responses of cities to the climate crisis. This focus on cities is prudent. India is urbanising fast; by 2030, the urban population is expected to be around 600 million, and cities will account for 70% of India’s GDP. With haphazard and unplanned growth though, cities have already become victims of the climate crisis. In the last few years, they have battled heat waves, floods, and droughts. These climate shocks have had a negative impact on the quality of life of the inhabitants and affected the revenue potential of cities. India’s cities fail to battle these old and new challenges because of several reasons. The decision-making power is still not decentralised; funds are inadequate; many decisions are politically motivated and do not take into account the negative environmental fallout; there isn’t a mechanism to learn from each other’s best practices; and, often, officials do not have the requisite expertise needed to tackle climate-related challenges.The climate centre, which will be housed at the National Institute of Urban Affairs, will hopefully bridge some of these gaps; create a synergy across climate actions undertaken by the 500 Class-I cities; help authorities apply a climate lens to policymaking; provide expertise to officials; enable access to funds; and take advantage of several innovative solutions available in the market. And in the process, the centre and cities will hopefully come up with replicable models, which can then act as “lighthouses” to other aspiring cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/why-the-new-climate-centre-for-cities-matters/story-HOQR0f2nxdhjRycSjEnCIO.html
28-07-2020||Editorials||Omar Abdullah opens the door | HT Editorial||For the first time since the momentous constitutional changes in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) on August 5 last year, former chief minister of the erstwhile state, and National Conference (NC) leader, Omar Abdullah, who was detained for eight months, has spoken out. Writing in The Indian Express, he expressed his opposition to the effective nullification of Article 370, and the revocation of J&K’s special status.But the key takeaway from Mr Abdullah’s piece is not his opposition to the change in the special status of J&K — that is to be expected, and that point of view can be debated. The key takeaway is his more fierce opposition to the decision to convert the state into a Union Territory (UT) and a categorical declaration that “while J&K remains a UT”, he — and by extension, the NC — would not contest assembly elections. While this may sound extreme, Mr Abdullah has actually opened the door for a political understanding which can revive the political process in J&K. It is instructive that Mr Abdullah neither made the restoration of Article 370 or the re-merger of J&K and Ladakh his precondition. Both these would have been far more difficult to achieve. Article 370 is history and no government in New Delhi will bring back the constitutional provision effectively. A separate administrative unit of Ladakh is also, now, firmly etched on the map and the stand-off at the Line of Actual Control with China has only cemented New Delhi’s determination to have direct control over the region.By asking for the restoration of statehood, while opposing the other changes, Mr Abdullah has effectively given room to Delhi to begin a process of reconciliation. Do remember that both Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the nation, and home minister Amit Shah, on the floor of the House, said that the revocation of statehood is temporary, and when circumstances become conducive, it could be reversed. It is time for Delhi to begin a dialogue with Mr Abdullah, release Mehbooba Mufti and start a conversation with her too, and initiate a time-bound process for the restoration of statehood. Promising a more empowered assembly and chief minister, in line with other states of the Union, can possibly result in popular and legitimate elections, help win over the Kashmiri street, empower pro-India mainstream forces, deepen democracy in J&K, weaken Pakistan’s propaganda, and neutralise international concerns. Mr Abdullah has opened the door; the onus now lies on Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/omar-abdullah-opens-the-door/story-lhY8YJqcfwFlV2prlZg10N.html
