26-07-2020||News||The anti-defection law has failed. It is time to scrap it | Opinion||Law cannot change the nature of politics. Political parties will always find a way of bypassing the intent of the best of laws. So, in 1985, when the anti-defection law was made to end the malaise of defections, it was destined for failure. The law punishes Members of Parliament (MPs)/Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs) for defecting from their party by taking away their membership of the legislature. It gives the Speaker of the legislature the power to decide the outcome of defection proceedings. Under the law, defection can take place in two ways. First, when a party’s legislator “voluntarily gives up” membership of their political party. The law does not define this phrase, which is essentially a euphemism for anti-party activities. Courts have held that the actions of MLAs can be used to determine whether they have given up their party’s membership. But this case-by-case interpretation gives political parties a wide ambit in initiating action against both errant and dissenting members of their organisations. It also means that many of these cases get caught up in legal proceedings. To bypass this provision now, MLAs resign from the legislature, as it happened in Madhya Pradesh earlier this year. The second mechanism for dissuading MPs/MLAs from shifting their loyalties is by punishing them for voting, contrary to the party’s direction in the legislature. On the face of it, this is a more objective criterion for determining defection. But political parties don’t like it. Because, in this case, the punishment comes after defecting MLAs have already caused damage by either toppling or saving a government against the party’s wishes. Political parties want certainty in numbers before a vote deciding the fate of a government takes place on the floor of the legislature. Therefore, at the first hint of defections, parties start cloistering members loyal to them in hotels and resorts. Over the last 35 years, the anti-defection law has had zero success. But it has been successful in severely damaging the legislative framework of the country. It has had a negative effect on the deliberations in the legislature. Our legislators are now afraid of expressing their viewpoints on laws and policy issues for fear of reprisal by their political parties. And since the office of the Speaker is the decision-making authority in anti-defection proceedings, the non-partisan constitutional office has been dragged into party politics. Last year, while hearing a case related to defections in the Karnataka legislature, the apex court observed: “There is a growing trend of Speakers acting against the constitutional duty of being neutral”.Take, for example, the cases of defection in Tamil Nadu. The chair of the Speaker of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly has an interesting history. Lord Willingdon, the then Governor of Madras (who went on to become the Governor-General of India) presented it to the Madras Legislative Council in 1922. His grandfather was Henry Brand, who presided over the House of Commons for over a decade. During the presentation ceremony, Lord Willingdon hoped that those who sit in the Speakers Chair conduct the affairs of the legislature with “good judgement and tact”. It is the good judgment and tact of Tamil Nadu (and other states) that speakers have been questioned on multiple occasions. More recently, the Tamil Nadu Speaker’s three-year delay in deciding the defection petitions of 11 ruling party MLAs has been challenged before the Supreme Court (SC). The last Andhra Pradesh Speaker sat on the defection petitions of opposition MLAs, some of who went on to become ministers in the government. Their defection petitions remained undecided till the end of the term of the assembly in 2019. Long delays in deciding defection petitions allow two things. One, it ensures the loyalty of the defecting MLAs to the party they defected to, as the sword of losing their seat in the assembly keeps hanging over their head. Second, until recently, this tactic prevented the judiciary from interfering in defection cases. Vice-President V Naidu has called for timely disposal of defection cases, a stand that the Supreme Court also took earlier this year by stripping a Manipur minister of his office as the Speaker did not decide the defection proceedings against the minister in the last three years. After the Manipur ruling, the Goa Speaker has also been taken to court for delaying the decision on defection proceedings.But the blame does not always lie at the Speaker’s doorstep. The nature of defection proceedings is such that their ruling will impact the continuity of a government in power. Irrespective of their conduct, the neutrality of their office will be questioned and their decisions challenged in court. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla along with Speakers of state legislative assemblies have been discussing measures to uphold the prestige and dignity of the office of the Speaker.In the political drama of defections, two fundamental questions are missed out. Can a law find solutions to issues of debate, dissent and ambition within a political party? And if not, shouldn’t the anti-defection law be scrapped before it does more damage to the legislative institutions and democracy?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-anti-defection-law-has-failed-it-is-time-to-scrap-it/story-BCTMzgsgLiqHzrOxqSucCM.html
26-07-2020||News||From the UNSC, a tale of India, Nepal and jeeps | Analysis||January 15, 2011, was a Saturday. It was snowing in New York, but I perked up when I was told that the United Nations’ (UN) undersecretary-general for political affairs wanted to speak to me. Being new on the UN Security Council (UNSC), I braced myself to deal with a matter of grave importance for international peace and security. The call was about jeeps.India served on the UNSC from 2011 to 2012, a time which saw much happening on the world stage including the Arab Spring and the start of the conflict in Syria. India’s first major act as a part of the UNSC was to end the UN Mission in Nepal (UNMIN). I was India’s deputy permanent representative to the UN at the time.In November 2006, the Government of Nepal and the Maoists signed a Comprehensive Peace Agreement to end a civil war that had wracked the country for over a decade. To disarm the rebel army, on Nepal’s request, the UNSC established UNMIN.This was a political — not peacekeeping — mission to monitor the disarming of the rebels and help with elections for a new constituent assembly. As a goodwill gesture, India provided many jeeps (Tata vehicles, Mahindra Scorpios etc) to help UNMIN with its transport needs along with containers for arms storage.UNMIN’s mandate was extended several times — UN officials with peacekeeping and political mandates have a tendency to find new reasons to stretch their mission, often believing that they are responsible for “running” the country. In Nepal, this “mission creep” was restrained, as all sides agreed that UNMIN succeeded in its mission. And so, in 2010, the Government of Nepal made a strong case to the international community to end UNMIN. The UNSC adopted a resolution ordering the winding up of UNMIN by May 15, 2010 (the operations ended only on January 15, 2011).The surrendered weapons were to be handed over to the Nepal Army, which irked UNMIN for it was seen as a force supposedly representing the status quo. Indeed, I recall at least two visits by UNMIN’s head of mission to see me in New York and repeatedly emphasise the unsuitability of the Nepal Army as a monitor for the arms and the need for its size to be cut.The idea of closure did not go down well with the UNMIN with the head of the mission in her report noting possibilities of renewed civil war, presidential rule and even a military coup in Nepal once UNMIN left. This doomsday conjecture was roundly criticised by all parties in Nepal. Through 2009 and 2010, India had also been active with important governments on the Nepali interest to wind up UNMIN. We were happy to see its winding up as one of the first acts of the UNSC during our term. The Hindustan Times reported this as a major victory for India. Back to the jeeps. As UNMIN wrapped up, the UN was keen to ship the Indian jeeps to another UN mission in Africa. We were clear: These should be handed over to the Nepal Army as they would continue to deal with the rebels and carry on the arms monitoring work of UNMIN. The undersecretary-general’s call to me that Saturday in January 2011 was a last-ditch effort to retain the vehicles with the UN, even choosing to give me a small lesson in the ways of the world: Gifts are not returned.Years later, I was posted to Nepal as India’s ambassador. Imagine my surprise when I found a few UNMIN jeeps in the embassy compound. Apparently UNMIN returned these to the embassy in 2008 — after the elections; years before the mission wound up, finding them surplus to their need. So much for the ways of the world!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/from-the-unsc-a-tale-of-india-nepal-and-jeeps/story-NfvZ3CIMLlmOIvoXddyyxO.html
26-07-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM dares Opposition to topple his government, takes dig at BJP over Rajasthan||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray dared the Opposition to pull down his government and said that he was at the helm of the three-party Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state. In the last of the Shiv Sena chief’s two-part interview, which appeared in the party mouthpiece Saamana on Sunday, Thackeray said the fate of his government was not in the hands of the Opposition. “Some people get pleasure in constructive work, while some are happy with destructive work. They should go ahead and topple the government, I do not care,” he said. Thackeray also called for an e-bhoomipujan of the Ram Mandir at Ayodhya on August 5 to avoid crowding at the actual site. “Instead of putting so many lives in danger [owing to Covid-19], the laying of the foundation stone could be done online,” Thackeray said. Speaking about the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project, which has been a bone of contention between the state and Central government, the chief minister said that he would prefer to have the train running between Mumbai and Nagpur as it would be a “more beneficial route, but the decision would be made on the basis of people’s mandate”. “My individual opinion or that of my party [on bullet train] could be different, but as a state, the government will take its decision at an appropriate time. The government decision will be based on the people’s mandate about the project and after discussing it with all stakeholders. If the people are against it, I will scrap the project,” he said. About the Opposition’s criticism that his government is a “three-wheeled vehicle”, Thackeray said his government represents poor people. “If the choice is between bullet train and a three-wheeler, I will choose the latter, as it is the travelling mode of the poor people. It is a strong government and I am at the steering wheel with two other partners. The ones who have been raising questions about our ‘three-wheeler’ should look at the government at the Centre,” he said. “How many parties are there as coalition partners? When I attended the NDA meeting last time, there were 30-35 leaders representing ruling parties. It should be called a ‘train’ government then,” said Thackeray. He said there were no differences between the three parties although there was a lack of continuous dialogue owing to the Covid-19 outbreak. “Congress had some issues related to matters on public policies. After our meeting, they have been resolved. We have better co-ordination between us. I take guidance regularly from NCP chief Sharad Pawarsaheb and occasionally speak to Soniaji Gandhi,” said the chief minister. Thackeray said it was not correct to say that the decision making is driven by bureaucracy. “Our handling of Covid-19 pandemic, especially in Dharavi, has been applauded at the international level. I was chosen among popular chief ministers. If the bureaucracy was in the driving seat, why was the government praised and was it done by the bureaucracy without any control from the government? The government policies are after all implemented by officers and bureaucracy, and it is the government’s duty to stand firmly by efficient officers. I will support such officers,” he said. Thackeray also took a dig at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for their alleged attempt to topple the Rajasthan government. He said Operation Lotus would not reap any success in Maharashtra. “It is strange that the use of money for political gain is not a crime and opponents are targeted using the central agencies. But this would not last for too long. They should also keep in mind that days keep passing by. They tried to topple the Rajasthan government, perhaps because there is no pandemic spread in that state or in Madhya Pradesh. The leader of Opposition [Devendra Fadnavis] criticised the Maharashtra government over the handling of Covid-19 during his Delhi visit, perhaps because the pandemic exists only in our state and not in Rajasthan or Madhya Pradesh,” he said. Thackeray said he has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take a uniform decision over the policy related to China. “Our policies related to China should not be deviating like they differ in case of Pakistan. During troubled times, we boycott these countries and later after a few days extend an olive branch. During one of our interactions, I have requested Modiji to take a firm stand on China. Decide finally on trade with Chinese companies. We have put our memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with them [Chinese companies] on hold,” the CM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cm-dares-opposition-to-topple-his-government-takes-dig-at-bjp-over-rajasthan/story-Jr4kaNkpFYkMF8BcTk9SjO.html
26-07-2020||Mumbai||200K Covid cases in July; count for state tops 375,000||Maharashtra on Sunday reported 9,431 new Covid-19 infections and 267 deaths, taking the tally to 375,799 and toll to 13,656. The state reported 201,038 infections (53.50% of the state’s tally) in July itself. The state has 148,601 active cases, with 213,238 patients reported to have recovered till Sunday, translating into a recovery rate of 56.74%. Mumbai maintained stability in terms of daily new cases with 1,101 infections taking the tally to 109,161, of which 22,536 are active ones. The recovery rate was 73%. With 57 more deaths, the city’s toll touched 6,093. Pune saw 1,921 new infections — most in the state — which took its tally to 51,291. Of the 267 new deaths, 57 were in Mumbai, 28 in Pune, 17 in rural Pune and 10 in Pimpri-Chichwad. Thane district reported 23 deaths, while Jalgaon saw 10 more fatalities in the last 24 hours. State’s case fatality rate (CFR) was 3.63%, more than the national rate of 2.35% reported on Saturday. In a welcome sign, the state’s positivity rate dropped, despite a significant rise in number of tests. Over the past week, 65,344 tested positive from 322,167 tests, at a positivity rate of 20.28%. It was 22.75% the previous week (between July 13 and 19), which saw 246,234 tests and 56,028 infections. A total of 46,023 daily tests were conducted on an average this week, up from 35,176 last week. Even as the state government plans to open up activities after the sixth phase of the lockdown ends on July 31, the rise in cases in a few districts and cities in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) has become a cause of concern. “There will be extension of the ongoing lockdown at least by a month, although we are planning to open up activities in a phased manner. The first week of August will see a few more activities allowed, with stricter curbs in containment areas. The districts and civic bodies with a high number of cases have already been told to ramp up health infrastructure and continue aggressive tracing and testing,” said a state official. Rajendra Shingne, food and drug administration minister and senior NCP leader, said, “We have been asked to take a decision about the imposition of a stricter lockdown or relaxation from it at the local level on the basis of the current scenario of cases. Collectors and guardian ministers of respective districts will take a call. State-level policy is being finalised at the CM’s level.” Some districts such as Ahmednagar have reported a doubling rate as low as 6.6 days, against the state’s doubling rate of more than 24 days and some cities like Mumbai and Malegaon have improved their doubling rate substantially. Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad and Pimpri-Chichwad have doubled the number of patients in 7.5 and 9.3 days respectively. Mumbai and Malegaon, the cities which were virus hotspots in the initial stages of the outbreak, topped the chart with an improved doubling rate of 43.31 and 67.38 days respectively.The reproduction rate — the rate at which the infection is spread to others — in some districts indicate a very risky level of exponential spread. “In Kolhapur district and Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad, it’s 1.92, while in Ahmednagar it’s 1.87. Mumbai tops the chart with an impressive number of reproduction rate at 1.08. Pune remains a cause of concern owing to high daily number of cases, relatively high reproduction rate and fast doubling period,” read the report prepared by a group headed by Neeraj Hatekar, economist, Mumbai University. The reproduction rate of more than 1 indicates a spreading of the virus at a high rate.Sanjay Kumar, chief secretary, said, “We have asked civic bodies and district collectors to strictly implement the strategy of strengthening health infrastructure and improving the quality of the services. We expect the death rate and number of cases to reduce in the next few days. The discussion on the relaxations to be offered from the first week of August is underway and we are planning to issue the notification by July 31,” he said. Another officer said that the state’s strategy over the unlocking of the activities will be finalised after meetings between Centre and states in the next couple of days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/200k-covid-cases-in-july-count-for-state-tops-375-000/story-bK9vTc0YbWnvKlf0aUGgXN.html

26-07-2020||Mumbai||After plaints of miscalculation of scores, Tata Institute of Social Sciences to add more seats for 3 masters courses||The Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) has decided to add some seats to three of its masters courses to accommodate candidates whose scores in the evaluation process were miscalculated. The exact number of additional seats is unknown as the verification of marks was still underway, said PK Shajahan, dean of academics. Amid complaints from prospective students over discrepancies in the marking scheme, the administration on Saturday announced on its website that the selection list for the three courses – MA in Applied Psychology (with Specialisation in Clinical and Counselling Practice), Media and Cultural Studies and Library and Information Science – will be revised and additional candidates will be selected based on their fresh scores. “We are informing the UGC [University Grants Commission] about this. We will not be on a position to say the number [of seats] now as several verifications, including their [candidates’] selection in other preferences, is underway,” said Shajahan. He clarified that the step to add seats was taken to accommodate all those who were selected in the earlier list and the ones who made it to the list due after revision of marks. However, the addition is restricted to these three programmes alone. Meanwhile, there are also complaints of discrepancies in marking of TISS National Entrance Test (NET) and Personal Interview (PI) rounds pouring in from across the country. Candidates alleged that their final marks were not adherent to the weightage allotted to their TISS NET and PI scores in the 60:40 ratio. They said the marks obtained by candidates who appeared for in-person interviews in March were lower than those obtained by candidates who appeared for online interviews. While candidates have urged the administration to look further into the marks, Shajahan said there was no issue with markings in any programme other than those mentioned in the fresh notification issued on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-plaints-of-miscalculation-of-scores-tata-institute-of-social-sciences-to-add-more-seats-for-3-masters-courses/story-blkRGb2g8OpJnUbKY7Vq7M.html

26-07-2020||Gurugram||Three open fire outside property dealer’s office, leave note; case registered||Three unidentified men allegedly opened fire at the office of a property dealer and made away after throwing a note inside the man’s office in Taj Nagar in Farrukh Nagar on Sunday morning. Police said the note warned the victim against supporting one Kalu or he would be shot dead. Police have registered a case against unidentified persons.Police said prima facie, gang rivalry seemed to be the reason behind the Sunday shooting. Investigators also are probing if the shooting was in any way in which one Yashpal was murdered in Taj Nagar on May 18. Birender alias Kalu, who has links with gangs, is the prime suspect in the case. According to the police, the incident took place on Sunday around 10am, when Yogesh Singh, a property dealer, and his two associates, Harish and Rakesh, were at the office. Police said three masked men arrived on a motorcycle and fired thrice, of which two bullets hit the outside wall, while one bullet went through the main gate and hit a piece of furniture.A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “No one was injured.

Kalu had earlier been arrested in a murder case of a sarpanch in 2011.A case was registered against the unidentified suspects under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of Indian Penal Code and relevant section of The Arms Act at Farrukh Nagar police station on Sunday, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/three-open-fire-outside-property-dealer-s-office-leave-note-case-registered/story-TwYgWUJdSsJDsKt9egWnzH.html
26-07-2020||City||Second girder for Hancock Bridge in Mumbai launched||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Sunday launched a girder across the railway tracks for Hancock Bridge near Sandhurst Road station. The first part of the girder launch was completed last month, while the final launch was done on Sunday. The civic body had earlier planned to open the bridge by August-end. However, following the delay in the completion of the work, the civic body now aims to open the reconstructed bridge for the public by the end of this year. The British-era bridge, located between Sandhurst Road and Byculla stations, was demolished in January 2016 to pave way for a new bridge. However, several administrative issues and encroachments on the site led to the delay in the construction of the new bridge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/second-girder-for-hancock-bridge-in-mumbai-launched/story-dm71l1Z6Y23B3w248Z0gpK.html
26-07-2020||Gurugram||SCERT rolls out training sessions to help teachers cope with digital education||The State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT), Haryana, has started online training sessions to help government school teachers adapt to the challenges of tutoring students virtually.Aimed at capacity building, the sessions, which were rolled out last week, focus on digital transmission of lessons and ensure that the educators are familiarised with newer ways of teaching and assessment as classes take place remotely, said SCERT officials.Manoj Kaushik, nodal coordinator, Diksha (SCERT Haryana) said that a team of subject experts had selected 13 teaching modules from the national Diksha portal and prepared subject-wise training sessions for state teachers. Diksha is a national initiative that offers a framework for equipping teachers with advanced digital technology.Each module will be available for a week and teachers will be required to spare around three hours per week to complete each module. The second session will start from today (Monday). “Teachers only need to spare around 20 minutes a day to complete the training within a week. The sessions will focus on questioning skills and critical pedagogy. Various topics pertaining to teaching online or remotely will also be covered,” said Kaushik.He said that unlike physical training sessions—where only some teachers could participate—the online training sessions will be attended by all teachers. The shift to online learning necessitated by the coronavirus disease pandemic required that all teachers are covered and were trained to cope up with the new challenges. “In view of the pandemic, teacher training, mentoring, and monitoring will all take place virtually. We are targeting all teachers, across all grades, in various subjects, through these training sessions now. Online capacity building of teachers is important since classes might continue to take place online in the coming days as well,” said Kaushik. Besides teachers, district-level officers will also have to undergo the training.Government schools in the state have been holding online classes since the first week of April due to the pandemic.SCERT director Kiranmayee said that besides training, the state would soon be extending support to teachers through mentors. “Keeping in view the circumstances created by Covid-19, we want to build the capacity of teachers for online classes. Through mentors, we will provide support to teachers and find out if they are facing any challenges in technological know-how or equipment availability. We are preparing mentors to address concerns of teachers that they might face throughout the year,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/scert-rolls-out-training-sessions-to-help-teachers-cope-with-digital-education/story-3iYgi0DfX0OhzbtsmseWZK.html

26-07-2020||City||Four held for killing 50-year-old, his mother||Khadakpada police on Saturday arrested three persons add detained a minor in Kalyan for the murder of a 50-year-old man and his 76-year-old mother on Friday. According to the police, a self-proclaimed godman allegedly told the 50-year-old’s minor son, niece, and nephew that the victims were possessed by an evil spirit. The four assaulted then the victims to ward off the spirit. The victims have been identified as Pandharinath Tare and his mother Chandubai Tare.The accused have been identified as the deceased man’s 17-year-old son, niece Kavita Tare, 27, nephew Vinayak Tare, 22, and the godman Surendra Patil, 32. All are residents of Atali village in Kalyan. According to police, Tare knew Patil through a friend. After his 27-year-old niece started action erratically over the last few months, Tare decided to visit the godman to find some solution for her problem.Ashok Pawar, senior inspector of Khadakpada police station, said, “The victim and his wife used to take their niece Kavita to Patil’s house once a week. He used to chant mantras to treat her, but they did not work. On Friday evening, Patil visited the deceased’s house to find out the reason behind Kavita’s behaviour. He told the family that Tare and his mother were possessed by an evil spirit. Patil claimed that Kavita would recover only if he killed the spirit. He instructed the three other accused to beat the victims while he chanted mantras.”Kavita, Vinayak, and the 17-year-old started assaulting the two with sticks and throwing turmeric on them while Patil chanted. “They assaulted the victims for over four hours until both were left unconscious. They thought that ‘treatment’ had worked but after two hours, when the victims did not wake up, Tare’s wife called another nephew Devendra Bhoir, 34, for help. They then took the 50-year-old and 76-year-old to a nearby hospital where they were declared dead on arrival,” said an officer from Khadakpada police station.Bhoir also informed the police of the incident, following which the accused were charged under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act, 2013.

26-07-2020||Chandigarh||Court allows CBI to take voice sample of suspended SHO Jaswinder Kaur||Stating that suspended SHO Jaswinder Kaur, an accused in Rs 5 lakh graft case, was ‘not co-operating in the investigation’, the Central Bureau Investigation (CBI) moved an application seeking permission to take her voice sample, which was allowed by the special CBI court on Sunday.On June 29, the CBI had registered an FIR against Kaur, former SHO of Manimajra police post, and middleman Bhagwan Singh on the complaint of Manimajra resident Gurdeep Singh. It was alleged that Bhagwan Singh had asked for Rs 5 lakh bribe from Gurdeep, on behalf of Kaur, for not lodging an FIR.Kaur had surrendered herself in the CBI court on July 25, which sent her to four-day police custody at CBI.Inspector SS Rathore mentioned in the application that Bhagwan Singh had called accused Jaswinder Kaur to intimate about acceptance of bribe money from the complainant. That call was recorded and was “an important evidence” in the case, the inspector said.Public prosecutor for CBI, KP Singh, stated that further investigation “very much depends upon the specimen voice sample of accused Jaswinder Kaur”. Kaur was asked but she refused to give consent without consulting her advocate Terminder Singh, who said that she will only give a sample if the court passed an order.The court directed Kaur to give her voice sample in the presence of an independent witness. Jaswinder Kaur gave in writing that “she has no objection to giving specimen voice samples to the CBI. However, I deny the transcript.” Following this, Sushil Kumar Garg, special CBI judge, allowed the application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/court-allows-cbi-to-take-voice-sample-of-suspended-sho-jaswinder-kaur/story-tYu6wncRCvxxgusOFJ47bK.html

Similarly, residents said, despite repeated complaints about poor quality of construction, developers were not ready to pay heed to their problems. Residents of new Gurugram complained about the lack of connecting roads, no access to supply of power and water, and the lack of adequate patrolling by the police. They also demanded setting up of more police check posts. Rakesh Daultabad, MLA, Badshahpur, who had called the meeting said that they have decided to form three special committees for specific projects that have been much delayed and need a multipronged approach for resolution. “This is a start and hopefully we will work to resolve the problems of the home buyers” he said. RS Bhath, district town planner, Gurugram who was present at the meeting said that it has been decided that police cases would be registered against developers who do not resolve problems being faced by home buyers, particularly in much-delayed projects. “The matter of 24-metre sector roads has been raised repeatedly in this meeting and we working on this issue. The recommendations for the same would be sent to government.

26-07-2020||City||After five deaths, Bhiwandi hospital loses DCHC status||The Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC) cancelled the recognition of a private hospital as a dedicated Covid health centre (DCHC) as it did not have adequate doctors, did not follow treatment protocol and registered high fatality rate. The hospital can now treat only non-Covid patients. In a review meeting called by BNCMC commissioner Pankaj Ashiya with the Covid-19 task force, Ashiya cancelled the permission to treat Covid patients at Shree Varhaldevi Multispeciality Hospital. The 22-bed hospital, which was recognised as a DCHC on June 1 to treat moderate patients, has recorded five deaths in July itself. “A hospital which is a dedicated Covid health centre that treats moderate patients should not record deaths as it is supposed to shift critical patients to a dedicated Covid hospital. The hospital has failed to follow the protocol. The hospital management has also accepted the fact that it does not have a physician or proper staff to treat patients,” said Ashiya.The task force set up by the civic body is tasked with checking on Covid patients admitted at private hospital-turned-Covid hospitals or care centres and studying the cause of death of patients. As per the task force, Varhaldevi hospital recorded a high fatality rate in July with five deaths while no other DCHC private hospitals recorded a single death till date. “Initially the hospital had claimed they have a physician, but during the meeting it was revealed that there is no physician in the hospital. The hospital will not admit any new Covid patients and the existing four-five patients will be shifted to Indira Gandhi Memorial Covid hospital,” added Ashiya. “There have been several complaints from patients about lack of proper treatment at the hospital. As of now, the civic body has cancelled its permission to treat Covid patients. They can treat other patients. We have also issued a show-cause notice for closing it permanently, but the process will take a month. Depending on their reply, we might also register an offence against the hospital,” said Nitin Mokashi, medical officer of health, BNCMC. Mrunal Suryavanshi, owner of the hospital, said, “The civic body never asked us to have a physician while it asked us to treat Covid patients. We have an intensivist who can look after ICU.” He futher added, “We have treated 120 Covid patients till now, some of whom were severe. We cannot avoid admitting patient when there is lot of pressure from local leaders and people.”On Saturday, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) cancelled the registration of Horizon Prime Hospital for a month and its recognition as a Covid hospital for allegedly charging 56 Covid patients an additional of over ₹6 lakh.Bhiwandi currently has 13 hospitals which have been converted into DCHCs with a total of 560 beds. Bhiwandi city recorded 38 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, taking the total number of cases to 3,678 and deaths to 249.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-five-deaths-bhiwandi-hospital-loses-dchc-status/story-1l2kLLu4AP2y1E00kw8emL.html
26-07-2020||Gurugram||Recovery rate remains neck and neck with growth of new positives; situation under control, says health department||Over the past week, Gurugram has witnessed a discernible rise in the number of active cases -- for the first time since flattening early this month. From 1,029 cases on July 19, Gurugram’s tally of active patients grew by 10 percent, touching 1133 cases on July 25. With Sunday’s 170 recoveries outweighing the day’s 121 new positives, however, Gurugram’s recovery rate has ensured that the district has just 1,084 active cases.District health department data going back three weeks show that Gurugram’s daily recovery and growth rates have been neck and neck, a trend which officials cited as favourable. While active cases grew by 10 percent over the past week, the total tally of patients who recovered from Covid-19 grew by 12 percent, from 6,603 patients discharged on July 19 to 7,408 on July 26.Health department officials also pointed out that the share of active cases to Gurugram’s total caseload has remained stable. “In early July, active cases were about a quarter of total infections. This came down to about 13 percent in mid-July, and is still around 13 percent only,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, Integrated Disease Surveillance Program’s district surveillance officer in Gurugram.Officials also said that the uptick in active cases, until Saturday, was comprised largely of asymptomatic patients who have been put under home isolation. “While growth of active cases can put more pressure on the healthcare system, we are getting mostly mild cases who are capable of recovering at home. Enforcing home isolation strictly has been central to our response and its success,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram.Yadav added that the district’s recovery rate on May 31 was just 36.7 percent. “When we began focusing on home isolation as a strategic intervention, the recovery rate rose to 64 percent at the end of June, and is now close to 85 percent,” he said. However, challenges in enforcement still persist. A doctor with the district health department, on the condition of anonymity, revealed that complaints about patients violating home isolation rules are frequently received. “In at least four cases, where the violations were very blatant, FIRs have also been filed and the persons booked under the Epidemic Diseases Act,” the official said.District health department data, meanwhile also showed a slight increase in the number of hospitalised patients over the past week. From 98 who were hospitalised on July 19, there were 128 patients hospitalised across Gurugram till Saturday. It then fell to 116 cases the next day. “Not only is the recovery rate climbing, the percentage of positive cases that end up requiring tertiary care has remained stable, at between 9 and 10 percent, throughout July. We are in control of the situation,” Sharma said.When asked whether it would be possible to slow the district’s current daily average growth rate — about 1.7 percent at present — even further, deputy commissioner Amit Khatri said, “That will depend on community participation as much as our interventions. In theory, yes, we could perform even better at containing the virus, reducing active cases, increasing the doubling rate and so on. But there are challenges to on ground interventions which mathematical models don’t capture. Our approach is to respond to the situation as it arises, and if cases surge we will take necessary steps.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/recovery-rate-remains-neck-and-neck-with-growth-of-new-positives-situation-under-control-says-health-department/story-3I7CpvsC7alP8w08ASuHvJ.html

The step was taken to provide the residents with a space other than government isolation wards, said Pramod Tambe, chairman of the society.Tambe said, “We have also waived three months’ maintenance fee from the members due to the national lockdown since March.”Independent MLA of Mira-Bhayandar Geeta Jain inaugurated the centre last week. “This is a good project by the residents and we should appreciate the society for taking such a step,” said Jain.“Covid-19 cases are increasing daily and the civic body is struggling to increase the beds for patients of the twin cities. There is also a shortage of ambulance. Hence, housing societies which have enough space should take a lesson from this society,” said Jain.The isolation room is equipped with oximeters, thermal guns, sanitiser, oxygen cylinder, de-humidifier and also has an attached toilet.Sambhaji Waghmare, deputy commissioner of Mira-Bhayander Municipal Corporation, has appreciated the effort saying, “Such a facility for asymptomatic patients and those with mild symptoms are allowed provided the conditions and protocols laid out by the state health department including safety of other residents are maintained.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhayander-housing-society-converts-office-into-quarantine-centre/story-dbJ5jarWSmQETqCGIrPV5N.html
26-07-2020||Mumbai||Army men to help Covid staff and frontliners commute safely||In a unique initiative that looks at supporting frontline workers, a Bengaluru-based company run by ex-servicemen has initiated a mobility service called ‘Sainik for Doctors’ exclusively for Covid hospitals.Through this initiative, MotherPod Innovations Private Limited, is looking at providing a safe, secure and comfortable transit service for frontline workers. While the initiative has already been launched in Bengaluru, the company is in talks with several players in Mumbai to launch the service.Captain Sanjay Kumar Singh, head of partnerships, MotherPod, said, “In the current scenario, heightened security measures and standards have become critical for safer commutes — whether you consider healthcare workers, or people travelling for business or leisure. Ex-defence personnel are ideal for this challenge since they are disciplined and trained to follow the highest standards of safety protocols. Over time, MotherPod will expand its community of sainiks and provide many more veterans a supportive ecosystem to move ahead in their careers.”The company aims to re-skill and resettle 100,000 veterans in civil society in the next three years and has partnered with defence organisations across the country for the same.In terms of commute, ‘Sainik for Doctors initiative will follow a stringent protocol, said Singh. “The maximum number of passengers per ride is fixed at two. A secure acrylic partition of the highest quality will be installed in every vehicle. In addition, a single-use PPE kit with gloves, a sanitiser and mask will be given to every passenger before the ride commences. The interiors will be completely sanitised after each journey,” he added.The fleet will be managed by sainik control rooms across India that will also monitor the standard operating procedures. The dashboard on the availability and schedule of the fleet will also be shared with the hospitals that partner with the company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/army-men-to-help-covid-staff-and-frontliners-commute-safely/story-5v8BtjpLRQKxdljI5SrCPM.html
26-07-2020||Gurugram||MCG serves notices to 326 RWAs for not setting up composting plants||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has served notices to 326 residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) of various condominiums and residential societies across the city for failing to set up composting plants, officials said on Sunday. The move is primarily aimed at reducing load at the Bandhwari waste plant, they said. The notices have been issued to the RWAs of only those societies that produce a minimum of 50 kilograms of municipal waste every day.The officials said that the RWAs have to inform MCG the reason for not establishing such a facility, and based on their replies the civic body will decide whether to issue fines to them.“As per the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016, each residential area needs to have a composting plant of its own. We observed that 326 such RWAs have not obliged with this rule and have given them two weeks to respond to our notice. If their replies are found to be unsatisfactory, we will be levying ₹25,000 fine on each of them,” said Inderjit Kulharia, joint commissioner, MCG.Kulharia said that it is an “ongoing process” and MCG officials have been tasked with finding more such RWAs that have not established composting plants in their respective areas.A senior MCG official privy to the matter said that most RWAs are likely to end up paying the penalty to the civic body. “As per our observation, an individual produces 400 grams of waste per day. Hence, it is unlikely that any RWA can take refuge in the fact that their residential area does not produce 50 kilograms of waste per day,” said the official.The residents’ bodies have said that the civic body should have given more time to set up a composting unit. “We have received the notice from MCG and have passed on the information to our builder which is looking after the maintenance of the society presently. Regardless, two weeks’ time is too short for any society to establish a composting unit. The MCG should make this as a mandatory provision in building plans as some societies like ours simply do not have the space for setting up a composting plant,” said Puneet Goyal, president, Tulip Violet RWA.Goyal said that a more feasible option is that MCG can lease their own land in every residential sector where a large-scale composting plant can be set up, and waste from all residential areas can be dumped and accordingly processed, with each RWA bearing the operational costs for it.As per official records, there are more than 6,000 registered RWAs in the city. The MCG’s move holds importance as the civic body has been struggling to find an alternate site for dumping and treating waste generated by the city, which produces around 1,000 tonnes of daily waste.Last year, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had directed MCG to stop dumping waste at the Bandhwari landfill and temporarily find an alternate site to dump and treat Gurugram’s waste until 26 lakh tonnes of legacy waste is cleared at Bandhwari, which was leading to environmental hazards.Just a week before it was scheduled to dump and start treating Gurugram’s waste at a 25-acre site at Farrukhnagar in June, protests by nearby villages and some political groups led to MCG terminating its decision. After this, the civic body has identified a nine-acre site in Nuh to do the same, but this too is facing opposition from locals.Amid the uncertainty, officials said that MCG wants to ensure reduction in the daily waste load at Bandhwari plant by establishing more composting plants in residential areas.MCG officials also said that compost plants will also help residents know the method of segregating waste. They said that this will help in ensuring that bio-medical waste does not get mixed with dry and wet waste, a problem the corporation is facing at many locations.“Until we find an alternate site for dumping and treating city’s daily waste, we are exploring various ways to reduce the daily load of waste that ends up at the Bandhwari landfill, one of which is to increase the total number of composting plants in the city. In addition, composting plants are also useful in getting people into the habit of segregating waste. In several areas, we have found bio-medical waste being mixed with dry and wet waste. We are also working towards ending this issue,” said another MCG official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-serves-notices-to-326-rwas-for-not-setting-up-composting-plants/story-bMexgIlZLacisNtuw9DlwM.html
26-07-2020||Mumbai||30 Covid-positive specially-abled residents of Mankhurd facility admitted to Sion hospital, BKC Covid centre||Thirty specially-abled residents, including four children at the Mankhurd Mentally Deficient Children’s Home (MDCH), who tested positive for Covid-19, were shifted to Sion hospital and Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) Covid centre on Sunday.Prerna Deshbhratar, commissioner for persons with disabilities, Maharashtra, confirmed the development to HT.On Saturday, 29 residents of the Mankhurd MDCH tested positive for Covid. On Sunday, one more child’s report came positive.“Three high-risk patients who have comorbidities have been shifted to Sion hospital. The remaining patients who have mild symptoms were taken to the BKC Covid care centre on Sunday,” said Vikrant Gondane, in-charge designated at the facility by the commissionerate for persons with disabilities.Mankhurd MDCH, which is run by the NGO Children Aid Society with funding from the state, houses 268 individuals with mental disabilities up to 70 years of age. Since 2012, only specially-abled children below 18 years are allowed admission.Doctors at the facility say it is difficult for them to ensure that the inmates follow social distancing norms and hygiene. Facility authorities have requested Mumbai Police to provide personnel to chaperone patients, to ensure that they follow social safety norms and are taken care of sensitively, Gondane said.“We have also decided to send all our staff, including doctors, nurses, and guards at the children’s home for rapid antigen testing,” he added.Authorities suspect that the residents may have been infected by some of the staff. Those working at the children’s home live in the same quarters as staff from another child care institute at Mankhurd, which recently reported three cases of Covid-19.Shiv Sena member of Parliament Rahul Shewale on Sunday said that two weeks ago, the administration of the Mankhurd children’s home had complained to the assistant municipal commissioner about some of the children suffering from cough. A fever camp was organised at the facility during which 268 children were screened, and 84 were found with Covid symptoms. After testing the residents, 30 of them were found positive for the coronavirus.Two of the infected children have tuberculosis (TB) and are undergoing treatment at Sion Hospital. The rest have been admitted to BKC’s Covid centre, Shewale said.“Spread of the coronavirus at the children’s home is a serious incident. I have asked the administration to carry out an inquiry on how the kids got infected and who is responsible for the serious lapse,” he added.The campus has been sanitised and sealed to prevent the spread of the virus to other children, the MP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/30-covid-positive-specially-abled-residents-of-mankhurd-facility-admitted-to-sion-hospital-bkc-covid-centre/story-DTQ9lApkBKtgtBlGTWfaGM.html

The incident took place last week, but the management of Vijay Vallabh Hospital approached Arnala coastal police to file a complaint on Saturday night citing that the patient used foul language when the hospital authorities called him to clear the bill. He allegedly also threatened the hospital saying he would spread the infection in the neighbourhood.The patient, a Virar resident, was admitted to the hospital on July 12. “He was set to be discharged on July 19. We handed him a bill of nearly ₹1.5 lakh. He said he would talk to the HR department of the hospital. Believing him, the staff got busy in other administration work, and the patient took this chance to flee,” said Dr Shailesh Pathak, owner of the hospital adding, “As we could not find him, We called on his mobile but it was switched off.”“A few days later, we managed to contact him and asked him to clear the bill, but he refused to pay and started to use foul language over the inflated bill. He also threatened to spread the infection in the neighbourbood,” added Dr Pathak.Following this, the hospital approached the police. A hospital administrator said, “We will recover the money as per law, but we are worried about the patient spreading the infection.”Arnala police in Virar said they have received the complaint and are studying the documents submitted by the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hospital-files-plaint-against-man-for-not-paying-1-5-lakh-bill/story-joEWU6kF8C5U1YR9pkgCBP.html
26-07-2020||Mumbai||Jumbo rapid antigen testing drive: 76 of 7,962 frontliners test positive in 2 days||Since Saturday, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has tested 7,962 frontliners – police and civic employees – using the rapid antigen testing kits, of whom 76 (0.98%) have tested positive, data shows. The overall positivity rate of rapid antigen tests in the city stands at 8.4%, with 1,460 of the 17,331 tests positive. So far, more than 3,600 police and 2,000 civic officials have contracted the infection in the line of duty. For months, BMC has been widely criticised for not running universal tests on them for early diagnosis. After receiving promising responses in the antigen tests done in different wards, BMC started the jumbo antigen testing. Of the 17,331 people tested, 6,437 are workers from the solid waste management department, of whom 45 (0.69%) came positive. Of the 1,525 policemen who were tested, 31 (2%) have come positive. “We were concerned that the positivity rate would be high among frontliners. But thankfully, the infection rate is low. From the beginning of the infection, we gave proper protective kits to them, which helped stop the spread,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. Like RT-PCR, rapid antigen kits detect the presence of molecular pathogens of the coronavirus. But RT-PCR takes almost eight hours to give results, while reports of the antigen-based test that uses nasal swab samples are out within 30 minutes. According to BMC officials, as the solid waste management employees have to go to containment zones and work in close proximity with infected people, they are more susceptible to the virus. “These employees can’t stop collecting garbage from contaminated buildings. Similarly, police officers have to work in containment zones to keep an eye on people. They are breathing in areas filled with pathogens of the virus. This makes them the most vulnerable group,” said Kakani. “All positive BMC staff were asymptomatic, so there was no need to run an RT-PCR test for a second diagnosis. They are stable and most of them have been kept under home observation,” said a senior official from BMC. Antigen testing has given a huge boost to the per-day testing capacity in the city. Till the end of June, BMC was testing around 4,500 people daily. The average testing rate has now increased to 6,000. On July 24, the city made a record by testing the highest number of people — 7,609 people in a single day for the first time since March. “The testing number will rise over 10,000 now. But, as data shows, the positivity rate is still constant and hasn’t shown any sudden spike,” said Kakani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/jumbo-rapid-antigen-testing-drive-76-of-7-962-frontliners-test-positive-in-2-days/story-1seCAy2MBEa67TbjPgN9sO.html
26-07-2020||Delhi||Agencies yet to do third party audits of plantations held in previous years to check survival rate||At least 18 of the 20 afforestation agencies that carry out plantation drives every monsoon are yet to submit third-party audits of the drives held from 2016 to 2018 to the forest department, which is the nodal agency for all plantation activities in the national capital, officials said. Third-party audits of plantation is needed to assess the survival rate of saplings and the exercise was made mandatory for all greening agencies last year by then Delhi environment minister Imran Hussain, who had asked agencies to submit audit reports to the state forest department for the years from 2016 to 2018.Among the 20 agencies that carry out large-scale plantations are the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), the three municipal corporations, the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and the public works department (PWD). The other agencies include the Delhi Jal Board (DJB), the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), Northern Railways and the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), among others. “We have written to all agencies to submit a status report of their third-party audit. We haven’t received a single report so far. We have written to the Forest Research Institute (FRI), Dehradun, to carry out an audit for the plantation done by our different divisions for the same period. They are expected to send a team for the audit post-monsoon,” a senior official from the forest department said. The NDMC and the DDA are the only two agencies which have got the audits conducted so far. “We have been getting a third-party audit done since 2015. We are yet to approach an agency for the audit of the year 2018-19. The survival rate of our plantation was 65.83% in 2017-18; 73.5% in 2016-17; and 61.88% in 2015-16,” S Chellaiah, director, horticulture, NDMC, said. DDA officials said they got the audit done for the year 2018-19 by FRI, Dehradun. “The survival rate of the plantation for the year stands at 80%-95%. The institute also suggested some measures to address sapling growth issues, which we will implement in this year’s plantation drive. The 86-page report was submitted to lieutenant-governor (who also heads the DDA). We have written to the FRI to carry out the audit for 2019-20 as well,” DDA’s director (horticulture) Ashok Kumar said. A senior PWD official said they have sent a request for the audit to the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), Pusa. “We have written to them and the IARI has agreed in-principle. The audit will be done this year,” the official, who did not wish to be named, said. Officials at the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) also said they have approached an agency to get the audit done. “We have approached an agency, but the corporation is already under financial duress. The government must fix an agency for the audit,” a senior SDMC official, who did not wish to be named, said. The East Corporation too said that it has approached IARI, Pusa, for the audit and the modalities are being discussed. A senior North corporation official said they have approached the FRI, Dehradun, for the audit. “There are some financial problems because of Covid-19, but we are trying to collaborate FRI in this matter,” the official said.This year, the Delhi government has set a target of planting 3.1 million saplings. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai had said that they have roped in FRI, Dehradun, to conduct third-party audit for the year 2019-20. According to experts, third-party evaluation is important to ascertain the survival rate as well as fix accountability. C R Babu, professor emeritus at the Centre for Environment Management of Degraded Ecosystems, Delhi University, said, “Third-party evaluation is useful to assess the survival rate, know the drawbacks where growth is not up to the mark and implement strategies to improve the efforts in the following years. Massive plantation drives are undertaken every year and hence it’s important to know how many of the saplings survived and fix accountability of various agencies. It is crucial for the sustained growth of saplings, which is ultimately needed for increasing the city’s green cover.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/agencies-yet-to-do-third-party-audits-of-plantations-held-in-previous-years-to-check-survival-rate/story-vktfzjbV2JKj1opPuK1EiL.html

He was a Class 11 student in a private school in Brij Vihar in Ghaziabad. The family does not suspect foul play, and no case has been registered in connection with his death.A police officer privy to the incident said the police control room had received information that a boy had fallen off a four-storey building at F Block in Dilshad Colony. The injured boy was rushed to Swami Dayanand hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. The police spoke to the boy’s family members, who told them that he was flying a kite on the terrace of the building when he accidentally fell down.The boy’s father, who works in a private company in Okhla, said his son was alone on the terrace at the time. “We do not suspect any foul play, as nobody else was on the terrace at that time,” the father said.The boy is survived by his parents and grandfather, and was a single child. According to the police, the terrace from where the boy fell down has a railing but its height is not more than two feet. “Prime facie, it appears that the boy lost balance after his body hit the railing while flying the kite.

26-07-2020||City||Won’t allow SDMC to levy new taxes: Gopal Rai||New Delhi: Delhi labour minister Gopal Rai on Sunday said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will not allow the BJP-ruled South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to levy “anti-people” new taxes and accused the civic body of “indulging in corruption”. The Delhi BJP, however, said that it has urged the civic body to “rollback” the proposal and not levy the proposed taxes. Speaking at a press conference, Rai said at a time when the common man is going through a financial crisis and facing loss of job and business because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the BJP-ruled corporation wants to add to their misery. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta tweeted on Sunday that he has urged the SDMC mayor and other civic body officials to rollback the proposal of new taxes. “I have spoken to the South Corporation mayor and urged civic officials to rollback the proposal of introducing new taxes. The mayor has agreed. I request Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to release funds due to the civic bodies under the 4th Delhi Finance Commission so that they can overcome their financial crisis,” Gupta tweeted in Hindi. South corporation mayor Anamika Mithilesh said that they have agreed to not levy the proposed professional tax, electricity tax, unauthorised colonies house tax and property transfer tax for the “time-being”. “We will postpone levying of the professional and electricity taxes for the time being, till the situation improves. About other taxes, we will present a detailed report in the House on Monday,” the mayor said. The new tax proposals have already been cleared by the SDMC standing committee and would to be tabled in the House on Monday for approval. Rai said, “People are struggling to come to terms with the economic slowdown. Levying new taxes will add to their financial liabilities. The corporation does not provide any facilities in the unauthorised colonies, but is eager to levy new tax on the residents. Similarly the property transfer tax, professional and electricity taxes will be an additional burden on middle-income groups. We will not let this happen. Our councillors in opposition will sit on protest but will not let these be approved in the SDMC House,” said Rai. The professional tax is proposed to be levied on self-employed professionals such as doctors, lawyers, chartered accountants and architects, among others. However, those earning less than ₹ 20,000 a month will be kept out of its ambit. The Corporation had planned to hike the electrify tax from existing 5% on thr billing amount to 6%. The tax is collected by distribution companies on behalf of the corporation. The SDMC generates electricity through solar power panels in many buildings, which it further sells to power companies. The South civic body has proposed that if those living in unauthorised colonies pay up the house tax for the financial years 2019-20 and 2020-21, their previous years house tax will be waived off. The civic body has been collecting house tax from unauthorised colonies falling in G-category since 2004, but officials said that people have not paid the dues. The property transfer tax is an additional fee that will go to the corporation on the sale and purchase of a property. Rai said that the corporations have been getting funds to the tune of Rs 4667 crore, which is much more than what they used to get during the previous Sheila Dikshit-led Congress government’s tenure of around Rs 3343 crore. Besides, the Delhi government has given them a loan of Rs 3,815 crore. “Where has all this money gone? The corporation must put in public the expenditure done by them so far and why do they need to introduce such taxes. It is only because the BJP leaders want to indulge in corruption,” said Rai. To this the South civic body mayor said, “What else can we do without funds, if not find new means to generate revenue. We have been trying to generate our own revenue so that we don’t have to depend on Delhi government to release our dues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/won-t-allow-sdmc-to-levy-new-taxes-gopal-rai/story-3U1mE0NaUvx6AFPApWeBtJ.html
26-07-2020||Mumbai||Liberal policy gives slight push to testing numbers: BMC data||Two weeks after testing was liberalised in the city, allowing citizens to get tested without a medical prescription from July 7, the daily testing numbers have increased marginally in Mumbai. From July 1 to July 7, the average number of daily tests was 4,978. The number went up to 5,673 tests daily between July 8 and July 14, and further to 5,976 between July 15 and July 21. Mumbai’s highest single-day number was 7,609 tests, conducted on July 24. Between July 1 and July 24, Mumbai has conducted 1.31 lakh tests, taking the average to 5,482 tests. The city is conducting 36,000 tests per million people, lower than Delhi’s 44,000 tests per million people. In the past one week, Pune has also increased its testing, bringing the number on a par with Mumbai. Meanwhile, citizens complained of at least two-day waiting period to book tests and another 48 hours to get the results. Sneha Sedani, a Kandivli resident, said, “We lost our grandmother last week. Her results were negative. However, we wanted to get tested, considering my grandmother had pneumonia. The lab had two-day waiting period and allowed home testing only for senior citizens.” Another Lower Parel resident, Chaitanya Dhargalkar, said, “My sister had fever for four days, and we thought of getting tested for Covid-19. On calling private labs, we came to know there was two-day waiting period, and it took two days more to get results.” Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, said, “We have 17-18 private labs and additional government labs. We have been focusing on increasing our testing for a few days now, using rapid antigen kits. The number of daily testing is also crossing the 7,000 mark. We plan to test carry out sero-surveillance to cover maximum population…There is a possibility that citizens are wary about getting tested. Earlier, those not having symptoms also wanted to get tested, but now there is awareness.” Experts said stigma deters people from getting tested. Siddarth Paliwal, a private health consultant from Mumbai, said, “There is still stigma or fear in the minds of citizens to get tested. Also, liberalised testing policy does not mean BMC should leave it on citizens to get tested. The number of private labs should also be increased.” On Sunday, Mumbai recorded 1,101 fresh cases and 57 new deaths, taking the city’s case tally to 109,161 and toll to 6,093. The number of discharged patients in Mumbai was 80,238 with a recovery rate of 73.5%, and active cases stood at 22,536. The fatality rate was 5.58%, and doubling rate 66 days. One hot spot that has shown signs of drastic improvement – Dharavi – recorded only two new cases on Sunday, bringing the area’s case count to 2,531, of which 2,168 have been discharged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/liberal-policy-gives-slight-push-to-testing-numbers-bmc-data/story-bz8YyKOdENnYyyDdE3oUSM.html

He has a diploma in elementary teacher education—an essential qualification for being a primary teacher-- and has also cleared the Central Teacher Eligibility Test (CTET). He used to earn around Rs 40,000 a month through teaching.However, due to the delay in the renewal of contracts, as schools remain closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many like Qadir have been forced to look for alternative modes of livelihood after being rendered out of work.“I had to return to my village in Bihar’s Siwan district after I was relieved from work. It was difficult to survive without work in Delhi with my wife and two children. I had to find some work to feed my family of five. I can’t do physical labour either because of my leg, so I decided to sell pakoras and jalebis in my village,” he said.He now earns ₹200 to 300 a day. “We are not getting any positive response from the SDMC. I have written to many officials in the last few days but nothing has happened. I do not know till when we can survive like this,” he said.A spokesperson for the SDMC said: “Regular teachers have been appointed by the Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board in all our schools and they have joined as well. There are no vacancies available right now. Contractual teachers will be called whenever it is required.”Neelu Devi, president of the Contractual Teachers’ Welfare Association of the three municipal agencies of Delhi, said, “Contractual teachers working in MCDs are struggling to make ends meet. Many of them have not received salaries since April and now the delay in the renewal of the contacts further creates uncertainty.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/out-of-work-sdmc-contractual-teacher-sells-pakoras-jalebis-to-make-ends-meet/story-jIoubEpWK7Hglj9Hwhkc6N.html

The case has turned cold despite Tyagi’s car covered in blood stains being recovered from Muzffarnagar a day after the man went missing.On the night of June 26, Tyagi went missing closing to his home while returning home from his office in Patel Nagar in his car. His last known location was near a highrise society in Raj Nagar Extension. “We will continue our protest till he is traced. Although the police have taken up an investigation, there was laxity initially which has complicated the case. His car was found in Muzffarnagar on June 27 with a large quantity of blood on it. The blood was later tested and found to be of Tyagi. How did the car go all the way up to Muzffarnagar at a time when night curfew is in place,” said, Sanjay Tyagi, Vikram’s uncle.the family said that on the fateful night, Tyagi’s phone was switched off around 7.45pm. “Later, at a check point in Khatauli (Muzaffarngar district), a policeman on duty had spotted the car and saw two men inside, who told that they were from the police. The police saw blood inside the car and they tried to stop it, but the two men fled. Thecar was driven for about 50 more kilometres before being abandoned. Ever since then, we have not received any ransom or any calls from anyone about him. Every one at home is shattered and I cannot describe their condition,” he added. The family said that Tyagi did not have much cash or any valuables on him on the night of June 26. “There have been cases of carjacking and robberies near Raj Nagar Extension and we suspect that he could be a victim of such an incident. However, we are still hopeful of his return. Senior police officials of Meerut zone are helping and actively working to solve the case. But we will continue with our protest till he returns. After the car was found, there was also delay in picking up finger prints. The reports are yet to be received,” his uncle added. Kalanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police, did not take calls for a comment on the issue. The police officials from Meerut range said that investigators from three districts – Ghaziabad, Meerut and Muzaffarnagar – are working on the case besides teams from Noida. Units of the special task force too have been roped in to help in the search. “We have done a lot of work in the case and it would not be appropriate to reveal exact details till we crack the case. We are working on two possible theories as of now. The STF was roped in on request of the family. The case is also being monitored by additional director general (Meerut zone),” said Praveen Kumar, inspector general (Meerut range). Officials of Ghaziabad police said that five teams from the district are involved in the ongoing investigation in the case. The cops have already registered an FIR under IPC section 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder) at Sihani Gate police station. On Friday, the SHO of Sihani Gate police station was also sent to police lines after several incidents of crime, including the kidnapping case, took place in areas under his jurisdiction in past one and half months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/realty-firm-director-missing-for-30-days-family-launches-indefinite-protest/story-jOHuOXQDSA2ynabWNmOBmL.html

26-07-2020||City||Noida: Metals, coliform in groundwater in areas of Hindon river basin, finds report||Noida: It’s not just the Hindon River which is highly polluted but also the groundwater in its basin which is consumed by thousands, as a report has found the presence of metals, high salinity and even the coliforms in water samples from these areas.According to the report, released the by Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research that collected water samples from hundreds of villages across the nine districts falling along the Hindon basin, the water has conductivity, high amount of calcium, iron, manganese and nitrates, as well as faecal coliform, which is basically human or animal waste. The samples were collected from June to July last year through hand pumps and bore wells in the villages, while the detailed report was compiled only recently.The report includes Razapur, Dankaur, Dadri and Bisrakh blocks of Gautam Budh Nagar district that falls under the river basin. High quantities of calcium, iron, conductivity, and coliform were found there, which experts say is not fit for consumption.The report shows that conductivity or presence of ions in the groundwater varies from 1,135 to 295 microsiemens per centimeter (uS/cm), while the standards require the same to be zero. The coliform or bacteria generated from human and animal waste was present at most of points in the district and elsewhere, ranging from 10 to 50 CFU/ml or colony forming units per ml. As per standards, there must not be any coliform in groundwater and its presence indicates that untreated and unregulated sewers are seeping into the Hindon river basin and contaminating the groundwater.“Conductivity directly indicates salinity and makes water completely unfit for consumption. More saline the water is, the more unfit it is for consumption, as it affects the nervous system, causes muscular disorders, heart issues, etc. At the same time, there must not be any coliform present in groundwater, as these are disease-causing bacteria and cause water-borne diseases,” says Rashmi Verma, Policy Fellow (Water), Department of Science and Technology (DST), Ministry of Science and Technology.Calcium levels throughout the district in the groundwater, ranged from 99 to 653 milligram per litre (mg/l), against the standard limit of 75mg/l, while Iron was high as well at several villages along the basin, roughly ranging 1.0 to 4.5 mg/l. At Thairah village in Bisrakh block, for instance, the iron content was 3.6 mg/l, against the permissible range of 0.3 mg/l.“The high content of iron should be a cause of worry and local authorities must locate its source. Calcium levels are high as well and lead to hardness in water,” says Dr DP Gupta, water pollution expert and former environment officer, Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB).The Hindon originates from Saharanpur and reaches Greater Noida (in the Gautam Budh Nagar district) after passing through Meerut, Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, and Ghaziabad. It merges with the Yamuna at Momnathal in Tilwara village of Greater Noida. Throughout its 50 kilometres journey through the district, the river is fed untreated effluent and non-degradable waste from industries and unauthorised settlements nearby, which worsens the situation. As a result, the river has no Dissolved Oxygen (DO), making it a virtually dead river. According to the UPPCB’s assessments, the level of DO in Hindon, at its entry point into the district at Chijarsi, was consistently zero throughout 2019, against a basic standard of 5 mg/l.“The report is an eye-opener as it shows that while earlier it was just the river which is polluted, now it is also the groundwater in its basin, which is consumed by thousands across hundreds of villages along the river, which is polluted. There is an urgent need to check industrial and domestic pollutants flowing into the river and serious efforts are required for its overall rejuvenation,” said city-based environmentalist Vikrant Tongad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-metals-coliform-high-salinity-in-groundwater-in-areas-of-hindon-river-basin/story-Df4kMWBmR9uwcuFaS9EvtM.html
26-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Admin forms dedicated team to trace symptomatic patients||Ghaziabad The district administration has formed a dedicated team to trace people affected by influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) who have potential risk of being Covid-19 positive. The move is primarily aimed at early detection of positive cases that will help reduce the fatalities, officials said.The three-member team, stationed at the Covid-19 control room set up on the district headquarters premises, will fetch information of ILI and SARI cases from different sources that include non-Covid hospitals, chemist shops, surveillance teams and surveys conducted by booth level officers (BLOs). “It (formation of a dedicated team) has been done for early detection and faster referral of positive cases to Covid hospitals so that such cases don’t move to aggravated state and result in fatalities. The team will ensure that all the ILI/SARI patients are tested for Covid-19,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. To aid the dedicated team, the administration has asked all the chemists in the district to note down the details of those who come to their shops to buy medicines related to fever, cough, cold, etc, the officials said. The chemists have been told to maintain register with details of purchasers and pass on the information to the dedicated team through the social media group. Till Sunday, 64 patients have died of Covid-19 in Ghaziabad. Official records state that 16 (25%) of them were affected by ILI and SARI symptoms. So far, the district has reported a total of 4,619 positive cases of coronavirus. According to district health department officials, patients affected by ILI constitute about 20-25% of total Covid-19 cases while those affected by symptoms of SARI account for about 2% of the total positive cases. “Although the share of ILI cases is about 20-25%, their positivity rate is about 6%. On the other hand, the positivity rate of SARI cases is nearly 40%. So, we are taking extra precautions with such cases and ensuring that they get detected early before their symptoms aggravate and lead to complications,” said an officer from the health department who wished not to be named. The Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) has directed for further reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of only symptomatic patients who turn negative through rapid antigen kits. But the health department is taking no chances with the ILI and SARI cases. “We are getting all ILI and SARI cases tested through RT-PCR testing even if they are found negative with rapid antigen kits,” the health officer said. The chief medical officer has been directed to send mobile van teams to registered non-Covid hospitals and also make available rapid antigen kits to them for testing of ILI/SARI affected patients. The Ghaziabad district at present has three mobile vans which visit different areas for testing, the officials said. “Our surveillance teams who are taking up surveys in containment zones and teams comprising booth level officers have been roped in to detect ILI and SARI cases. About 250 households each have been assigned to BLOs from where they will trace such cases.The required information will be passed on to the dedicated team who will ensure that such cases are tested and referred to L2 or L3 Covid facilities if they are found positive,” Pandey added. The administration has also said that regular health status of asymptomatic patients in Covid facilities will be checked for ILI or SARI symptoms, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-admin-forms-dedicated-team-to-trace-symptomatic-patients/story-vXgv5ozNc6lUMQfCqsQfhN.html

26-07-2020||Mumbai||HC refuses to let families stay in dilapidated building||Observing that three dilapidated buildings have collapsed in the last week in Mumbai, resulting in the loss of 12 lives, the Bombay high court on Tuesday refused to grant any relief to two families who wanted to continue occupying a crumbling building in Juhu.The division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Riyaz Chagla dismissed the petition filed by the two families challenging the action of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to disconnect the water and electricity supply to the dilapidated building.The families had filed the petition through their society, Nav Chetana Co-operative Housing Society. According to the petition, in August 2019, after noticing that the structure had become weak the civic body had issued a notice calling upon the society to undertake a structural audit of the building and submit a report of a qualified structural engineer certifying that the building was structurally sound and fit for human habitation.As the society failed to submit a structural audit report, BMC on September 7, 2019, issued another notice informing the society that the building was in a ruinous condition and was likely to fall. The society was also called upon to take steps to secure the structure building undertaking necessary repairs and put up adequate support, and also put up boards to warn passersby that the building was dangerous.In response to the notices issued by BMC, the society on January 8, 2020, submitted a statement of a consulting engineer stating that necessary propping work in the stilt and balcony area was done under his guidance and that the building was fit for human habitation for next six months.The bench, however, noticed that the period of six months, as mentioned in the engineer’s report was over. Besides, the judges also noted that six of the total eight families residing in the building had vacated their respective premises, and only the two families before the court had not vacated their premises despite several requests and warnings as regards the ruinous and dilapidated condition of the building.In this backdrop, the bench said that the BMC was left with no other alternative but to disconnect water and electricity supply to the building. The two families had challenged the civic action on the ground that it was arbitrary, the court, however, found that it was “not only not arbitrary but was in the interest of the petitioners and the members of the general public.”HC said about a week back during the heavy downpour three dilapidated buildings collapsed in the city, resulting in 12 casualties and injuries to several persons. “We cannot allow the same to be repeated in the present case, only because two of the eight members are adamant and are not wanting to vacate their flats to enable the building to be repaired or reconstructed.”Meanwhile, in a similar petition, the same bench on Friday refused to grant any relief to the occupants of a dilapidated building at Dahisar and directed the 80 families residing there to vacate their respective flats in four weeks. HC granted two additional weeks to a family, whose five members are infected by Covid-19.Members of the Dahisar society had moved HC in June 2020 after BMC threatened to disconnect their water and electricity supply, as the building was dilapidated and was likely to collapse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-refuses-to-let-families-stay-in-dilapidated-building/story-1SdgQmbNo1toAfwRpICmdJ.html
26-07-2020||Dehradun||In a first, India to count snow leopards; process to start in September in Uttarakhand||Delayed due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, Uttarakhand forest department is expected to start snow leopard estimation process with the help of camera traps from September this year. The move has been labelled as the first ever in the country by experts awaiting the exercise. Ranjan Mishra, additional principal chief conservator of forest for wildlife confirmed the development that the forest department will start the estimation of snow leopard in order to understand the ecological factors pertaining to the large cat. “The snow leopard estimation process as part of the national protocol was supposed to start a few months ago but due to nationwide lockdown, the process got delayed. We will now start the project in September and try to understand whether snow leopards are thriving in good numbers or not and how the ecology is where they are found,” said Mishra. He added that the project is not restricted to the estimation but focuses on a holistic approach of understanding the ecosystem of the particular area where the elusive big cat is found. Also read: Third snow leopard death reported from Uttarakhand’s Gangotri National Park in past five years“Snow leopard is at the apex position of the ecological pyramid. Along with estimation, we are also trying to look at the prey population and interference in the habitat by humans. Snow leopards are found in about 23% of the geographical area of the state which is about 13,000 sq km and for preliminary investigation, this area will be divided into 80 grids of 15 sq km each,” added Mishra. He said that as part of the project, camera traps will be set up in grids where the movement of leopard is abundant, like a sample estimation survey, with the help of paramilitary staff and locals from the higher reaches and other information will be gathered from indirect signs like scat. Mishra said that after the sample survey, a range of number of snow leopards found in the state will be released. Last year in October, the first national protocol for snow leopard population assessment in five Himalayan states including Uttarakhand was released by the union environment ministry. The protocol is titled ‘Snow leopard Population Assessment in India (SPAI). S Sathyakumar, senior scientist at Wildlife Institute of India had then said this is the first-ever attempt to count snow leopards in the country. Also read: Snow leopard ‘catwalks’ in Himachal Pradesh’s Spiti, netizens amazed. WatchElaborating about the project, Sathyakumar said the project will be undertaken in two phases. “The first phase would be an occupancy survey while the second phase would be related to camera trapping of the elusive leopards in higher reaches and DNA analysis of scats”. The project will be on the lines of the global project named ‘Population Assessment of World’s Snow leopards (PAWS)’ carried out by 12 countries where the highly rare animal is found. The senior scientist had also pointed out that based on habitat quality and snow leopard density and estimates from different study areas in India, an estimate based on extrapolations has already been made. According to this extrapolation, he said, “India may have about 516 snow leopards.” The current estimated distribution of snow leopards across Himalayan states is, 86 in Uttarakhand, 90 in Himachal Pradesh, 285 in Jammu and Kashmir, 13 for Sikkim and 42 in Arunachal Pradesh. Snow leopard (Panthera uncia) is facing many threats to its existence due to poaching and habitat destruction. It inhabits the Himalayas at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 4,500 metres||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/in-a-first-india-to-count-snow-leopards-process-to-start-in-september-in-uttarakhand/story-Xhbxye5SRpe7m7sOyM8MeJ.html

26-07-2020||City||Panchkula health dept turns to police to trace source of infection||Unable to establish the source of infection in 20 Covid-19 cases in the district, the Panchkula health department had decided to approach the police for assistance.“Police will check their mobile phone records to ascertain the locations they visited, as it’s important to track down the source,” said Dr Jasjeet Kaur, civil surgeon, Panchkula.Of the total 432 cases so far, a significant number of the patients (176) have contracted the infection from positive patients, who are their contacts.“We have tested 1,460 close contacts of positive patients and results of 101 returned positive. These include 75 ITBP and CRPF personnel,” Dr Kaur said.Patients with travel history are another major group. “After the lockdown was lifted in June, 11,221 people returned from various places. We took samples of 3,185 and 87 tested positive,” the civil surgeon said.MORE CLUSTERS POPPING UPWith Covid-19 cases surfacing steadily in multiple locations, the number of clusters is also increasing in Panchkula. The health authorities have determined at least 11 clusters with seven or more active cases.“Normally, a cluster means an area with 15 or more cases. But in view of the high risk of infection, we are considering even seven cases to term an area a cluster,” Dr Kaur said.She added, “Ashiyana in Sector 19 was declared a cluster after seven close contacts of a positive child were tested positive. Besides, the ITBP complex reported 43 cases and CRPF 32. Another 16 cases surfaced in Sector 9 alone.”Apart from these, 21 cases have been reported in Barwala, 15 each in Kalka and Sector 19, 10 in Pinjore and eight in Sector 25. Sectors 7, 15 and 21 have confirmed seven cases each.ACTION PLANTo contain the spread of infection in these clusters, the authorities claim to be sealing the areas, and conducting extensive testing and sero surveys.“We are doing extensive testing by collecting samples of a large number of contacts. Sero survey is being conducted in government offices due to multiple instances of their employees testing positive,” Dr Kaur said.The sero survey was started last week in government institutes and three slums – Abheypur, Rajeev Colony and Indira Colony. The survey helps map the spread of infection to devise an appropriate action plan.“Out of the 600 samples taken in the past week, 25 tested positive,” Dr Kaur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panchkula-health-dept-turns-to-police-to-trace-source-of-infection/story-BEq3NXvSzoigRCDQjFLRhM.html

The accused told the police he was peeved by his brother’s alcoholism and misbehaviour with women members of their joint family, which led him to the crime, according to officials. The body of Bhisham Singh, a resident of Bisrakh village in Greater Noida, was found near bushes in an isolated area around a week ago. The body bore stab marks and an FIR was lodged at the Bisrakh police station and investigation taken up, a police spokesperson said. “During the probe, evidence led the police to the deceased’s brother Deepak and he was questioned. When quizzed, Deepak confessed to stabbing his brother to death. He told the police that Bhisham would frequently consume alcohol, create ruckus at home and misbehave with women family members because of which he decided to kill his brother,” the spokesperson said. The accused has been arrested and booked under IPC 302 (murder) and related charges, the police said. Further proceedings were being carried out in the case, the police added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/man-arrested-for-killing-alcoholic-brother-in-greater-noida/story-jhR4uQathzjRk0Hk9RUwjL.html

26-07-2020||City||Badals should explain how dera chiefescaped 2007 blasphemy case: Pargat||Jalandhar Congress MLA from Jalandhar cantonment Pargat Singh has claimed that it was cancellation report filed by the Bathinda police against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim in the 2007 blasphemy case that led him to commit further heinous crimes like sacrilege. His statement comes amid ongoing heated allegations and counter-allegations between the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Congress party over action against Rahim. “Had the Akali-BJP government acted sternly against the dera chief for dressing like Guru Gobind Singh in 2007, then there would be no sacrilege of 2015,” the former hockey Olympian said, adding that the Akali patriarch and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and his son, president of the SAD, Sukhbir Singh Badal, should answer truthfully, the people of Punjab, especially the Sikh community, on how Ram Rahim escaped from the blasphemy case. “If the Badals had acted against the dera chief in the 2007 case then he would not have dared to commit the sacrilege of the Guru Granth Sahib. The Sikh community should connect the dots of sacrilege incidents and 2007 case, how the Badals saved the dera chief and how he committed the heinous act of sacrilege in the 2015,” Pargat, who has also been an Akali MLA, said. He added that was surprising that the matter of the origin of the dress that Ram Rahim wore was not investigated properly in 2007. “The matter would have been cleared, if the case was investigated in 2007, when Parkash Singh Badal was the chief minister; the police department was working under him till 2009 and not even a charge-sheet was filed in the case,” he said. He also accused the Badals of hobnobbing with the Dera Sacha Sauda for the sake of votes during 2009 Lok Sabha polls, 2012 assembly polls and 2014 Lok Sabha polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/badals-should-explain-how-dera-chiefescaped-2007-blasphemy-case-pargat/story-l2p1JwpD2NVqfNJP3AWmKN.html

26-07-2020||City||Farmers to protest against central policies today||Chandigarh/Amritsar The Punjab State Committee of All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), along with 10 constituent organisations, will hold a protest rally of farmers across the state on Monday. AIKSCC is the largest confederation of farmers and farm-worker organisations of India, with more than 250 constituent members.  AIKSCC Punjab chapter convener Darshan Pal said, “Farmers shall march towards the offices of the elected representatives and prominent leaders of the BJP and the Akali Dal, who are partners in the NDA government at the Centre, in protest against their general anti-farmer policies, and also against the three recent ordinances.” He added 10,000 tractors would be out on the state’s roads in protest. On Monday, ten local organisations like Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan), Bhartiya Kisan Union (Krantikari) and Bhartiya Kisan Union (Sidhuwal) will participate. Meanwhile, in Amritsar, the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC), Punjab, on Sunday said it would launch a ‘Jail Bharo’ stir in the state from September 7 against three agriculture-related ordinances. Representatives of 13 districts of the KMSC met at Amritsar’s Chaba village. “The ordinances are neither in the interest of farmers nor of arhtiyas and labourers of Punjab and Haryana and must be revoked. The Centre says these ordinances have been introduced to increase income of farmers, but in reality they benefit the corporate sector,” the farm leaders said. KMSC general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher said, “The preparation for ‘Jail Bharo’ will start from July 31 by holding district-level awareness meetings.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-to-protest-against-central-policies-today/story-1wgEPZgLRexGNqqscSTDbO.html
26-07-2020||City||Punjab plans big promotional boost for ‘king fruit’ kinnow in country||As kinnow growers are anticipating a sluggish market ahead of harvesting season in October, Punjab Agri Export Corporation (PAEC) has planned a campaign to promote the ‘king fruit’ of Punjab across the country.PAEC general manager Ranbir Singh said on Sunday the states of southern India will be targeted under the ‘Punjab Kinnow’ campaign from September onwards.“Unlock 2.0 is being seen as a business opportunity to boost the mandarin hybrid with focus on its high nutritious value. It is for the first time that the state government is making an organised effort for kinnow promotion,” he said.The top official also informed that chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had taken interest in PAEC’s initiative as kinnow growers were concerned about marketing their produce amid the pandemic.“Punjab Agricultural University’s state-supported research had proved that kinnows have anti-oxidant properties that not only reduce chances of cancer, but also lowered the risk of contracting diseases that affect immunity, like HIV. Kinnow seeds contain a high level of limonin, a natural content with medicinal value. The fruit will be marketed while highlighting these facts through social media and conventional strategies,” he added.Besides ensuring freight subsidies for transportation, PAEC is also working to ensure logistic support to transport kinnows to the key states, including Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Gujarat.Earlier, Union food processing industries minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal had announced that the central government would provide 50% subsidy on storage and transportation of kinnows to the consumption centres.With about 33,000 hectare land under kinnow cultivation, Abohar belt in Fazilka district is the hub of of the citrus variety production. Abohar produces 60% of the state’s fruit. In 2019, it had produced 7 lakh metric tonnes of kinnow. Farmers are expecting a higher yield this year, but they are worried due to low rates being offered for pre-harvest contracts.A leading kinnow orchardist from Bhangar Khera village Raghav Sharda said a contractor has agreed to pay ₹12/kg for harvest from the farm.“In 2019, farmers sold kinnow between ₹15-18/kg in wholesale. This year, we expect up to 50% jump in yield but not many contractors are coming forward to finalise deals,” said Sharda.A second generation kinnow grower, Geet Setia said that till last year, informal trade commitments began from April onwards, after traders assessed kinnow production on the basis of fruit flowering.“Though traders have started approaching, the rates are not encouraging. Kinnow growers are hopeful after PAEC has assured to help farmers in marketing the fruit,” he said.According to kinnow trader Shivam Setia, presently the pre-harvest wholesale rate is between ₹9-12/kg even though a bumper yield is expected this season.“Smooth transportation amid Covid-19 pandemic may be the determining factor for a stable kinnow market this year. Suppliers are not confident of investing at this juncture. The picture may be cleared by October,” said Setia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-plans-big-promotional-boost-for-king-fruit-kinnow-in-country/story-lH9dTvSI0eaqQ7x5jRhHNP.html

26-07-2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan Congress calls off its Monday protest in front of Raj Bhawan||The Rajasthan Congress called off its Monday protest in front of the Raj Bhawan, hours after the party gave a nationwide call for agitation to protect the Constitution and democracy. State Congress chief Govind Singh Dotasara said in a tweet, “Tomorrow, Congress workers will protest in front of Raj Bhawans as part of ‘Save Democracy-Save Constitution’ agitation call. But, in Rajasthan we will not do anything like that.” Earlier in the day, Congress leader Ajay Maken said in a show of solidarity with the Rajasthan government, led by Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, and for the protection of the Constitution and democracy, Congress workers will stage protests in a “Gandhian way” in front of Raj Bhawans across the country on Monday. The Congress government in Rajasthan is facing a political crisis after a rebellion by the now sacked deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and 18 other MLAs. Dotasara said, “We have sent a revised note of the state cabinet to the Governor and hope that he will soon give approval to call a session of the Assembly.” The Congress government says it wants to hold the session so its majority can be proved. On Friday, Governor Kalraj Mishra had sought clarifications on six points from the state government, after Congress MLAs held a five-hour dharna on the lawns of the Raj Bhawan pressing for an Assembly session. The dharna was called off, according to the Congress, after Mishra said he would abide by the Constitution and not act under any pressure. The Governor asked Gehlot to submit again, with the clarifications, his recommendation for calling a session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-congress-calls-off-its-monday-protest-in-front-of-raj-bhawan/story-zjUVd1aBdG1J8sGDOJWG8L.html
26-07-2020||City||Now 17, conjoined twins Sohna-Mohna want to train as electricians||Conjoined twins Sohna and Mohna, who recently passed their matriculation examination, are ready to take on the next phase of their lives. The 17-year-olds want to become electricians.Abandoned by their parents in 2003, the twins were just two months old when Pingalwara, a home for the destitute situated on the outskirts of Amritsar, took them in.On Sunday, the boys were seen working on a problem in the generator installed at the premises. Helping each other out while using the electricity tools, the brothers seemed to enjoy the work. “Work is worship. It should not be downsized. Instead of getting hooked to drugs, the youth should do engage in productive work of their own liking,” the twins said.“Both have turned 17 and are self-dependent now as they don’t need much help from anyone. The hobby of doing electric repairs has driven their passion and now they are being trained under one of our electricians here. We are trying to get them enrolled in an electrician diploma course as per their wishes. By attaining expertise in this field, both will be able to earn their livelihood,” said Bibi Inderjit Kaur, chairperson of All India Pingalwara Charitable Society which runs the home.The electrician who is guiding them said, “Both have been learning and doing electric repairs for the past year. Earlier, they used to observe my work after school hours, but now they are devoting more time and learning fast. They are able to fix all minor problems related to electricity and electronic appliances.”Notably, after their birth, the doctors at AIIMS had contacted Pingalwara and the babies got a home here on Independence Day in 2003. They were named Sohna and Mogna by Bibi Inderjeet Kaur after the famous piece of historical fiction by Bhai Vir Singh.The twins have two hearts, two pairs of arms, kidneys, and spinal cords, but a single liver, gall bladder, spleen, and one pair of legs. They were born at Sucheta Kriplani Hospital in Delhi on June 14, 2003, and shifted to AIIMS soon after. The doctors at AIIMS said separation would entail the loss of one twin and vascular and neurological loss in the lower limbs of the survivor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/now-17-conjoined-twins-sohna-mohna-want-to-train-as-electricians/story-x1vgF51FeGvGZOGWqNikTL.html
26-07-2020||Pune||Man loses Rs 13 lakh in SIM swap fraud||A 47-year-old man was duped of Rs 13 lakh by a caller who offered to help him update his sim card but swapped the SIM card instead.A complaint in the matter was lodged by Deepak Suryavanshi (47), a resident of Chikhali Pradhikaran, according to Pimpri-Chinchwad police. The transactions started at 11:50am on May 6 when the complainant received a call from an unknown number. The caller spoke in Hindi and told the complainant that his SIM card was 3G and needed to be updated to 4G or the SIM would stop working, according to the complaint. After he had the complainant believe that his SIM would stop working, he offered to help him update his SIM. In order to update the SIM, he sent a 19 digit number to his phone and asked him to send it to 12345 through SMS. Through the process, the man did what the caller asked him to after which he got a text saying his SIM card will be deactivated starting that day, according to the complainant. However, the caller told him that the number will start functioning again the next day. However, as it did not start, he got suspicious and called up the bank to block his account. That is when he learned that a personal loan worth Rs 10 lakh was approved on his account. The loan amount as well as over Rs 3 lakh that was in his account was also transferred to multiple accounts. A total of Rs 13, 42,499 was siphoned from the account of the complainant. The man lodged a complaint only in the month of July, according to the police.

26-07-2020||Pune||Virtual labs to assist Science and Engineering students in lockdown||Most of the colleges and universities in the state have started online lectures for their various courses from June. One of the major hurdles faced primarily by Science and Engineering students is of practical classes which need laboratory and physical equipment. In an attempt to find a solution to this issue, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Mumbai has now come forward and developed a ‘virtual lab’ for Engineering and Science students. Through these virtual labs around 60 to 70 per cent lab practicals can be undertaken and students will be essentially benefited from it. The Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) will be using this technology of virtual labs for their Science stream students. Most of the Engineering and Science colleges are finding new ways to continue their academic year on the background on Covid-19 pandemic. In the Science stream it is a bit difficult as along with online lectures, lab practical sessions are also equally important. “For all the Science stream courses in the SPPU, there is a need for the virtual lab this academic year, as students cannot come physically to the university premises. And we are working on this issue with several options for it. Through virtual labs, a student can explore many new things during the practical sessions and each student can independently do the experiment by sitting at home,” said Dr Manohar Chaskar, SPPU dean of science and technology department. “Mumbai IIT has appointed PVG Engineering college as the divisional nodal centre for Pune. This centre will help all the Science colleges under SPPU and Engineering colleges regarding the use of virtual labs, its operations and train the faculties on using the virtual lab on a laptop, desktop computer and even on mobile phones. So when the students will actually work and study through this virtual labs it will be an amazing experience for them,” said Dattatray Bormane, principal of AISSMS College of Engineering Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/virtual-labs-to-assist-science-and-engineering-students-in-lockdown/story-JtZKDu7H4Hp7LlceZt7IjK.html
26-07-2020||Pune||Syllabus reduction gets mixed response from teachers, parents and experts||On July 25, the state education department announced a reduction of 25 per cent syllabus from Class 1 to Class 12 in the Maharashtra state board for the current academic year. The decision was made on the background of the Covid-19 pandemic leading to lesser number of online teaching hours to students. This decision has now garnered a mixed response from educations experts and organisations, some of who back the reduction while some question the merit in the reduction. Welcoming this decision, Kiran Sutar, state primary teachers association secretary said, “We welcome this decision taken by the state education department, as already our teachers are overburden by various Covid-19 duties. They need to complete this year’s syllabus for their students. As the schools and colleges are shut, the classroom hours are also reduced as we cannot take long teaching hours on online mode. Through reduced syllabus teachers can now teach only the important part of that subject and complete this year’s syllabus.” On the other hand, Vasant Kalpande, education expert and former chairperson of the Maharashtra state board, called this syllabus reduction unnecessary. “Doing this kind of reduction in the syllabus was absolutely unnecessary and teachers are the ones who are given the most freedom in our country at least for teaching. It was their autonomy and by reducing the syllabus students may suffer. In each standard syllabus, there are some important chapters to be covered like in mathematics, science and even in languages,” Kalpande said. According to Kalpande, teachers while teaching, even online, could have decided for themselves what to teach and what not to teach. The process of reduction of the syllabus was unnecessary and was not at all needed. Whereas parents are a bit relaxed by this decision, Archana Pali, a mother of two children said, “My son is in class 9 and daughter in class 5. We need to plan for their online school lectures and then for their home studies. Due to Covid-19 schools are closed but now there is more burden on children and also on us to manage their studies at home. It is good to know that for this academic year syllabus has been reduced, so we hope that there will be less pressure on our children.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/syllabus-reduction-gets-mixed-response-from-teachers-parents-and-experts/story-bgSU5N9gZQntMVbvSqzpSP.html

26-07-2020||Chandigarh||No taker for road repairs, Chandigarh MC stares at further delay||The much-needed recarpeting of dilapidated roads across Chandigarh is set to get further delayed.The municipal corporation (MC) had set the “end of rainy season” as the deadline for starting the work. But, with no firm coming forward, a delayed start looks inevitable. During the current financial year, the MC has only carried out pending road repairs. For the new works for the financial year 2020-2021, not even allotment has taken place.MC officials are blaming imposition of more stringent contract conditions for poor response to 13 tenders worth ₹40 crore floated last month.“We didn’t get even one positive response. As per recommendations of the National Institute of Technical Teachers Training (NITTTR), Chandigarh, which were approved by the MC General House, we introduced the clause of five-year mandatory maintenance. It binds the firm that gets the contract to also maintain the stretch for five years. This is discouraging them from coming forward to recarpet roads,” said a senior MC official, requesting anonymity.After the MC had faced severe criticism for poor state of roads, which necessitated frequent repairs, it had sought help from NITTTR and signed a memorandum of understanding in December last year for assistance in quality control during execution of works.BIDS INVITED AGAINMeanwhile, the MC has again invited bids for road recarpeting work. “We have not changed the terms and conditions in the fresh tenders. These remain same as in the tenders floated in June,” said an official.As many as 105 major and minor roads are to be covered. These include V3 (between sectors for fast moving vehicular traffic), V4 (shopping streets cutting through sectors), V5 (for circulation within sectors) and V6 (providing access to houses) roads spread across the city.On 61 roads, major recarpeting will be undertaken, while on 44, repair and maintenance work will be done. Widening of some of the existing roads will also be carried out.NH-5 REPAIRS TO BEGIN SOONThe UT engineering department by mid-August will start recarpeting work on the 15-km stretch of National Highway 5. “The recarpeting work is being done after a gap of five years. A tender was floated for it recently. Financial bids have been opened and the final approval for the allotment of the work will be given within a week,” said a senior official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-taker-for-road-repairs-chandigarh-mc-stares-at-further-delay/story-pwUah6Ocvv9yuYDhMjIg4M.html

A nation cannot become self-reliant without empowered women, feels Smriti Irani, Union cabinet minister for textiles and women and child development.Speaking at a webinar at Panjab University (PU) on Sunday on the Resolve of self-reliant India: Decisive role of women’s empowerment in its attainment, Irani stressed on the need for Indian society to revert to the ancient way of thinking. This was when a woman was not a mere object or a person in servitude but an equal partner who participated in debates and wrote treaties. They fed the starved and also fought bravely, even carrying their children in their backs. Another webinar participant and folk singer, Padma Shri awardee Malini Awasthi, said it was important to change the thrust of the cultural narrative which had always been against women.PU vice chancellor, professor Raj Kumar, expounded on the increasing but eternal importance of women’s empowerment in any society. “Women have always been able to seamlessly manage multiple responsibilities and challenges and worked effectively to keep their homes, families, communities and society well-integrated and well-organised,” he said.The webinar was organised by PU’s department of history and centre for Swami Vivekananda studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/empowered-women-make-nation-self-reliant-smriti-irani/story-hDS2Ign8i720kqSUA3FKKL.html

According to the police, the accused Anchit Chawla posed as a businessman and duped the women of several lakh rupees.

In the absence of a solid waste management plant, the city’s garbage was being dumped at this site on Sanaur road for the last 50 years, turning the lives of nearby residents into a nightmare. Many have been complaining of foul smell and health issues due to the dump. Patiala mayor Sanjeev Sharma Bittu said the Karnal-based firm will segregate and manage 175 lakh metric tonne of waste spread over eight acres. “The company would use conveyer belts to segregate and filter plastics and dry waste. While the plastic waste will be sold to companies for recycling or fuel purposes, the dry waste would be turned into organic compost which will be provided to farmers. The leftover garbage will be used for landfill,” the mayor said.The project is set to start after the culmination of monsoon and the firm has been given 16 months to complete it. It is set to cost the civic body Rs 6.8 crore, of which Rs 3.3 crore will be used to purchase machinery for the project while the remaining will be used on execution. The city generates 120 tonne of waste, including 50% wet waste, 30% recyclable, 15% non-recyclable and 5% domestic hazardous waste, on a daily basis.MC commissioner Poonamdeep Kaur said the project envisages to completely clear the dumping ground. She added that the daily garbage of 120 tonne of garbage will be managed at material recovery facility (MRF) centres in Patiala.“The corporation has already set up seven MRF centres in Patiala to manage waste generated in the city. These centres will treat recyclable and non-recyclable waste and the treated bulk will be sold to industrial units,” she said. The mayor added that the dumping ground will only be used as a garbage collection point for the solid waste management project which is expected to be come up at SAS Nagar.NEW PROPOSAL FOR SOLID WASTE MGMT After the Punjab local bodies department scrapped the solid waste management project (SWMP) in 2017, the state has mooted the project with the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA)-Patiala cluster. The project cost is pegged at ₹305 crore.As per the detail project report (DPR), the SWMP has been divided into two parts — compost and refuse-derived fuel (RDF), and Sanitary Landfill Facility (SLF).The main plant, however, will be set up at Samgauli village in Mohali, while the RDF and SLF plants are designed to be set-up in Patiala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patiala-s-55-year-old-garbage-dump-to-finally-go/story-jWpDh59zBaHyuZ4IPkkjXM.html

26-07-2020||Chandigarh||Rs 170 cr collected from builders, but Zirakpur infra not upgraded||Despite collecting ₹170 crore as development charges from builders, the Zirakpur municipal council (MC) has failed to upgrade the city’s infrastructure. As choked drains, missing streetlights and damaged roads remain a problem, the MC has yet to come out with a workable plan to utilise the money it has collected from builders as external (EDC) and internal development charges (IDC).Sandeep Tewari, MC executive officer, said around ₹170 crore had been collected, “of which we have ₹100 crore as fixed deposit and ₹70 crore in bank account.”On upgrading infrastructure, he said there were problems with the designs of drainage and stormwater pipes, which resulted in waterlogging. “The roads have not been levelled property. I don’t want to spend money on laying tiles or paver blocks and will make sure that the drainage problem is sorted out,” Tewari added.He also said the MC would ensure there were no such design flaws. Zirakpur has around 100 group housing societies and 40 commercial establishments. MC collects ₹1crore as EDC and IDC charges from residential group housing societies and ₹1.35 crore from commercial societies.It’s the MC’s duty to ensure that money is spent on building and repair of roads, streetlights, sewerage and drainage system and beautification of the area. DETAILED REPORT TO BE SUBMITTEDCommenting on the matter, Brahm Mohindra, minister of Punjab local bodies, said, “We plan to provide the best possible infrastructure to Zirakpur as it is a gateway to our state. I have already asked the officer concerned to submit a detailed report about all the shortcomings in infrastructure and we will do what is required.” Zirakpur is an island of chaos surrounded by the planned cities of Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali. Growth in the town has been haphazard from the word go, with villages giving way to colonies, mostly illegal, and property dealers and realtors tapping into the need for modest housing for those less privileged. After more than a decade of unplanned development, the city finally got a master plan in 2009. But before it could be implemented, the town’s population exploded by 282% between 2001 and 2011. With a population expected to shoot up to 3 lakh by 2021, and 8 lakh by 2030, this urban sprawl stands little chance of orderly development. Harish Gupta, president of Zirakpur Builders Association, said they had met Mohindra and apprised him of their problems. “Even the proposed road-7 (PR-7 or Airport road) aligned with several housing and commercial projects has been approved by local government (MC Zirakpur) but no sewage line or rain water management has been planned. Despite charging an extra ₹5 lakh per acre as PR cess from the builders, the department is providing no facility.” 59 ILLEGAL COLONIES IN ZIRAKPUR According to officials in Punjab’s local government department, there are 59 illegal colonies within MC limits even though unofficial sources say the numbers are higher.Ironically, most of these were developed after the master plan was notified. Additionally, Dera Bassi tehsil, of which Zirakpur is a part, has 57 illegal colonies in an area that falls under the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) jurisdiction. The boundaries of these illegal colonies are not clearly marked, often leading to confusion when it comes to implementing the master plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rs-170-cr-collected-from-builders-but-zirakpur-infra-not-upgraded/story-FfpLc9NFhUJIo8lBAfyUvK.html

The campus life is abuzz , albeit virtually, amid anxiety for future and hopes for the new session to begin soon. Courtesy corona, the day one of new session on campus might get delayed, but that isn’t able to hold back the youngsters from their fav activity, i.e. shopping for that stylish campus avatar! Following social distancing yet scuffling for discounts while wearing face masks, college students are being spotted street shopping at the popular markets of Lajpat, Sarojini, and Janpath. Some are queuing up at the now reopened malls and are gung ho about the seasonal sale. All of this is to put together that coveted campus look that’s a guaranteed head-turner! Accesso-rise the game “Online class ho ya offline, I want to make a good first impression! And what plays a major role in that is how we dress,” says Aatika Choudhary, a DU aspirant from Ghaziabad. She adds that dressing well gives her the confidence to approach new people. “I’ve been shopping from some of my favourite brands at the malls in south Delhi, and have bought some comfortable yet stylish wear to be able to run around the college trying to figure out where the next lecture will take place! I have got mono coloured tops and those staple kurtis in solid black and white, which I plan to play up with accessories like statement earrings or chunky necklaces. Style mantra: Less is more,” she says.Turn up the right type of shade!“A true fashion statement is nothing but the right pair of sunnies! And these are a must, no matter which weather it is. After all, it’s all about style,” says Bhavya Bhatia, a student of Hindu College, DU, adding, “In the bare minimum pocket money that we get, buying multiple branded shades can be a costly affair. So, the trick is to choose stores that have affordable prices and variety. I’ve bought aviators, wayfarers, cat eye glasses and even face shields. In colours I’ve chosen hot pink, black, tinted blue and sea green... Since I bought quite a few of these, I got some great bargain as shopkeepers are keen to make sales right now.” Campus’s next Shoe stopper“Shoes are my fetish. I don’t want to wear a perfect outfit and pair it with chappals,” says Sneha Choudhury, from Jawaharlal Nehru University, who has bought a wide variety of shoes. “I street shopped everything from bellies and platforms to converse. The trick is to pick neutral shades that go with most dresses. And Dilli ki street shopping hai to bargaining zindabad,” she adds.Printing it safe!“Prints brighten any wardrobe almost instantly,” says Akshat Rawat, a student of College of Vocational Studies, DU. He adds, “So I choose the print that best compliments my personality and body type. I recently raided malls and bought a variety of print shirts at a stellar deal! Since I love indigenous prints, I’ve got Bandhani shirts to be paired with skinny jeans and men’s sandals. I’m gonna take my look a notch up, this year.” The giant hair affair“A bad hair day has the potential to ruin the sharpest of outfits, and campus life is replete with assignments that need running around! Who would have the time to blow dry their hair every day? So when I recently got to know that my regular salon, which I had been visiting before the lockdown, is giving discounts on Kera-smoothening, I immediately took up the offer. Plus when I saw that my hairstylist was clad in a PPE gear, I opted to get a haircut as well. With this makeover, bad hair days are here no more,” quips Mansha Khanna, a DU aspirant from Ghaziabad.Bag-ging much more than discounts“Prints brighten any wardrobe almost instantly,” says Akshat Rawat, a student of College of Vocational Studies, DU. He adds, “So I choose the print that best compliments my personality and body type. I recently raided malls and bought a variety of print shirts at a stellar deal! Since I love indigenous prints, I’ve got Bandhani shirts to be paired with skinny jeans and men’s sandals. I’m gonna take my look a notch up, this year.” Making a statement with the right mask and phone coverKanupriya Pandey from Jamia Millia Islamia feels campus fads are all about “standing up for what you believe in”. A regular at protests and street plays, Pandey says, “I’ve developed this new liking for mobile covers that have quirky tagline. There are so many online portals where one can even get a customised message printed on phone cover. But, this time, I’m thinking of getting a face mask customised! I’ve even ordered a few masks with statement one-liners. While some are quite chill, others are informative; and the messages on them are bi-lingual so they have a mass appeal... Since I have shown pictures of these to my friends, they have been after my life to order some for them too!” Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook  and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/college-admissions/unlock-campus-fashion-students-prep-to-unleash-their-vogue-for-session-2020/story-LVD9WHx1IaNowlzAWwXV6M.html

However, piers will be 20m high at Madhuban Chowk (crossing with Line 1) and 25m at Haiderpur Badli Mor where this line will cross Line 2.At Haiderpur Badli Mor, the viaduct level is going to be at 28m, the highest in the history of Delhi Metro, the statement said.Presently, the highest point is at Dhaula Kuan, where the Line 7 viaduct passes at a height of 23.6m.Piers, in terms of civil engineering are vertical loadbearing structures which act as intermediate support for adjacent ends of two spans.They form the vertical support structures on which the elevated metro viaducts stand. Metro piers today dot innumerable road medians in Delhi through which elevated Metro corridors run. Pier numbers are now important landmarks for addresses across the Delhi-NCR.The 28.92-km-long Janakpuri West-R K Ahsram Marg corridor is an extension of Magenta Line and will come up with 22 stations. While 21.18 km of this corridor will be elevated, 7.74 km will be underground. Construction work on this particular section had started in December last year.On July 17, the work on the underground section of this corridor was commenced with the beginning of D Wall construction work at the Krishna Park Extension Metro station. On 24th June, DMRC had started the casting work of u-girders which would be installed on the elevated section of this corridor.Under Phase-4, 61.679 km of new metro lines shall be constructed across three different corridors comprising 45 metro stations. These new sections shall provide interconnectivity among the already operational sections of Delhi Metro. Out of this, 22.35 km will be underground while rest will be elevated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-metro-casts-first-pier-under-phase-4-work/story-Nsa1leAPCBeizXrgMmNaxJ.html

I would rather prefer that he sits at home than risk his life for some grades,” says Gurugram-based Shruti Kakar, an MNC employee, who is certain that schooling has taken a back seat as the world deals with the pandemic. “From commuting to school to being in the classroom, each step is dangerous, and I’m not willing to gamble our lives,” adds Kakar. And, she isn’t alone as parents across Delhi-NCR are concerned about how to make up their mind to send their kids to school, whenever they reopen. For some, the bigger question is about affording their child’s education amid major salary cuts that have already hit the budget of most households. Noida-based Akanksha Arora — whose husband lost his job due to coronavirus leading to an economic slowdown — says they have had to withdraw their kids from a private school in Noida. “We were anyway worried about sending our daughters to school. My business of organising events has suffered massive losses, and with the school not giving a waiver on the fees, we had no choice but to plan to teach our kids at home, for this entire year. It’s not a bad idea to teach kids at home, but this decision has been forced upon us by the circumstances.”Most parents have already doubled up as teachers since the schools had closed for lockdown. As classes continue online, and teachers struggle to adapt to virtual teaching, Deepika Pawra, a sales manager, who is helping her 7-year-old son Unnat with online classes, says, “Till the time the pandemic dies down completely, the idea of schools reopening seems misplaced. It’s very hard to ensure safe social distancing among children. With the general school strength, how will they be seated? How will they interact with each other? A lot of questions need to be answered if the schools mull on reopening.” In fact, parents are now widely discussing the idea of schooling their kids at home to keep them safe. They have been asking for study material online as well as guidance from parents who have been homeschooling their children for years now. Aditi Jain, a Gurugram resident, is one such parent who says, “I’m trying to understand the curriculum, to make my son adjust to it when I teach him at home. The present Work From Home scenario might become a permanent feature of my job, and since coronavirus has put a big question mark on the safety of public spaces including schools, I felt it’s better if I take things in my hand and keep my kid safe!” Author tweets @bhagat_mallika For more stories follow Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/parents-day-2020-covid-19-compels-parents-to-turn-tutors-for-kids-sake/story-aeNnmHcRa9pCrjN3ZsHP1J.html

Over 14 lakh children in both primary and upper primary schools are covered under the MDM scheme in the state. It is also learnt that even these six samples were taken from just three districts of the state, with no testing from the rest of the 19 districts. Now, the MHRD has also directed the education department to carry out a social audit of the scheme in all districts. A social audit is a tool for monitoring and reviewing the official record of scheme with public’s participation to ensure proper implementation of scheme.All these issues were raised in the recent meeting of the Programme Approval Board - Mid Day Meal (PAB-MDM) of the MHRD held through video conferencing, to consider annual work plan and budget 2020-21. The meeting was informed that 19 complaints on food grain, quality and quantity of MDM were received and taken care of. The MHRD directed the department to get meals tested through accredited laboratories across the state.On cooks and helpers working without gloves, the education department said, “Due to the scarcity of funds, the cooks- cum-helpers have not been provided with gloves. Head-gear and aprons are being used while cooking of food.”MDM general manager Prabhcharan Singh refused to comment on issue. “I am not authorised to speak, please talk to DPI elementary education.” DPI elementary education Lalit Ghai said, “Let me check,” and disconnected the call. Punjab education minister Vijay Inder Singla, said, “Currently, foodgrain are being supplied to students at their homes as MDM. Punjab State Civil Supplies Corporation Limited (PUNSUP) is ensuring quality. As soon as the situation is normal, we will assign the task of sample collection to health department and will provide gloves to cooks-cum-helpers.”Singla claimed that the state government had also allocated foodgrains and cooking cost for summer holidays for the first time in the history. He also claimed that 8,263 metric tones (MT) of foodgrain had been sent to schools to deliver rice and wheat in sealed packets to students for the first financial quarter of the academic session 2020-21. The state education department told MHRD that they have started social audit in three districts of Amritsar, Jalandhar and Patiala in association with Panjab University. The ministry asked the state to speed up the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/centre-raises-concern-on-punjab-s-testing-of-mid-may-meals-only-6-samples-taken-last-yr/story-xwTTu7Mz9RqNKJlXljSzMO.html

In a letter to the MC last week, the local bodies department has asked officials to submit details of the wards with population, blocks and numbering by July 30. Though a poll date is yet to be announced, the notification says elections will be held in 50 wards with 2.36 lakh people voting, of which 25,000 belong to the scheduled caste (SC) category. Five seats have been reserved for SC candidates, two for women (SC) , three for backward classes (BC) and two for women (BC). There are 43 general category seats, of which 23 are for women and 20 for men. Kamal Kumar, MC commissioner, said though dates were yet to be announced, it had been decided that elections would be held in 50 and reservation of candidates had been fixed. The MC mayor is elected for a period of five years. In the last term the Congress had 14 councillors and the Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party and Azad group had 33 councillors and two independent councillors. Meanwhile, Punjab cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said the Congress was ready for MC elections. The people of Mohali had seen development in the past few years, he added. The term of former mayor Kulwant Singh had been fairly challenging because of tussles with Sidhu over several issues. In April this year, heated words were exchanged when Sidhu said credit for all development works in Mohali in the past eight months should go to the state government. Refuting the charge, Kulwant Singh had said most of the development took place in his tenure and that in the Congress most of the agenda approved by the house had remained stuck at local bodies’ offices.Former deputy mayor Manjit Singh Sethi said after lockdown norms were eased the state government should make plans for holding the elections so that development works in Mohali could be carried out. “I am thankful to all the wise 50 councillors, who contributed in the development of the city,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mohali-mc-to-gear-up-for-polls-in-50-wards-in-oct-submission-of-details-by-july-30/story-7csCJi9nq8CZEjY3voT9uL.html

Believe it or not, pet parents are ensuring that their doggos don’t feel left out when it comes to getting rain gear. And why not? Akshay Mahendru, from The Pet Point, Punjabi Bagh, says the variety of rain coats available is huge. “This year we have got a very nice range of rain gear. This includes raincoats, shoes and even an inverted umbrella. We have seen that now people like walking dogs in rains so the variety of rain coats has in terms of colours and patterns. Raincoats range from ₹500 to ₹800 depending on the size. We also have washable walking shoes, which are important so that the pet doesn’t carry muddy feet inside the home. Shoes start from ₹500 and can go upto ₹1,100. One of the most interesting products we have this year is an inverted umbrella, which is very practical for small and medium dogs since the pet parent can carry the umbrella while walking.”Gurugram-based home chef Shahla Ahmad, who wants her pooch to be safe yet look good, says, “There’s heavy rainfall predicted for this monsoon so thinking to buy rain gear for each one of my pets. I’m also looking for an umbrella hat for my big boys.”   It’s raining cats and dogs! #itsrainagain #rain#raincoat #raincoatfordogs #raincoatforpets #walking#crossroadsA post shared by  Aron (@poodlearon) on Nov 16, 2019 at 9:09am PST“Avoid getting your pooches wet in the rain and keep them as dry as possible. Pet Shoes come in handy (specially in this season) as they reduce the chance of pets getting tick infestation; as ticks climb from pets’ paws,” says Hemlata, from Pet Gallery, in Gurugram, which is selling pet shoes, and jackets. Ankit Mehra, a pet groomer, echoes the same sentiment and adds, “Shoes are the most important while taking pets out for a walk. As mostly ticks get on them through feet while strolling in the park. Shoes avoid that from happening, plus they also help in keeping the paws clean. Moreover, they aid in reducing the use of anti-tick medicines. And if a dog can’t bear heat then raincoats can irritate them since dogs can’t perspire. This irritation usually happens to hairy breeds like Shihtzu and Saint Bernard. Wearing a raincoat blocks air that may make them uncomfortable. But if the weather is cold enough then rain coat won’t be a problem for hairy breeds,” he adds.   ⁣⁣ "You can stand under my umbrella," said Rihanna.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ "No, thank you, I prefer my HUFT Drizzle Buddy Raincoat," replied every smart doggie ever. ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ 💧Made with light fabric⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ 💧Provides maximum coverage without hindering your pet’s movement⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ 💧Protects underbelly from muddy splashes⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ 💧Hood to keep the ears dry ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ 💧Elastic drawstrings help it stay in place⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ 💧Leash gap on the back for convenience⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Take a walk on a cloudy day with your best bud by your side in his HUFT Drizzle Buddy Raincoat.

Sanjeev Kumar, CEO, of these pet care brands, says, “We have rain coats in all sizes between ₹300 and ₹800. Waterproof jackets have also been introduced this year and cost between ₹800 and ₹1,500. Sales go up this time of the year as people want these products. Shoes have always been trending but the sales go up in this particular season, and the market for raincoats is still growing. ”Ishan Agarwal, senior marketing manager at Heads Up for Tails, says, “Rain coats can help keep the coat dry in case of unexpected showers or through light drizzles. But please don’t walk your dog in heavy rain. Our Drizzle Buddy Raincoat was designed in-house and made specifically to suit a dog’s body; so it’s cut and styled to suit their needs and movement.

To prevent pets from wearing damp collars or harnesses, these rain friendly ones are waterproof.

26-07-2020||Pune||Law students from 12 different colleges in Pune demand fees reduction||The Covid-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on all sectors of society, including education. Amidst the ongoing crisis, more than 400 first year law students from 12 different colleges in Pune under Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) have come together to demand a reduction of 50 per cent fees for the ongoing academic year. They have written to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and also to the SPPU vice chancellor. Most of these students come from rural areas and are currently at their villages or home towns. Of the 12 law colleges they are studying at, six law colleges are only aided under SPPU and rest all other colleges are unaided with huge fees. Due to the lockdown the financial condition of the students is weak and so they are united for the reduction of fees demand. “In the last academic year, the admissions for first year went on till December 2019 and the actual classroom lectures started very late. While the second semester started late in the month of March this year and hardly 10 classroom lectures took place after which a countrywide lockdown was announced. Since then, none of the students have gone to college and the syllabus is covered online. So our demand is to reduce this academic year fee by 50 per cent and give us instalment options to pay the fees,” said Karan Naiknaware from ILS Law College. “During May 19 to May 25, 2020, we conducted an online survey of law students from these 12 law colleges about the fees. The result of the survey was that majority of students which is 99.3 per cent students are in favour of fees reduction by 50 per cent for this academic year.” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/law-students-from-12-different-colleges-in-pune-demand-fees-reduction/story-tC9dTTSftR65CTcf48WbyJ.html

Till July 24, only 38 people have come forward for plasma donation and 35 have recovered via plasma therapy, according to civic officials. On Saturday, PCMC commissioner Shravan Hardikar via a video message on civic body’s official Twitter handle appealed to residents who have recovered from the virus to come forward and donate plasma. He said, “The patients are getting good treatment facilities at Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital (YCMH), including plasma therapy. To continue this facility we will need to collect plasma from recovered patients,” he said. According to guidelines of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), after screening of suitable donors, 500ml of plasma is collected. “Many people have wrong assumptions about plasma therapy. Donating plasma does not cause any health issues. People who have recovered should donate plasma without fear,” said Dr Rajendra Wable, dean, YCMH hospital. Get in touch Interested people can register themselves at YCMH and provide blood group details or one can also register on Smart Sarathi app.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/despite-9-435-recoveries-only-38-donors-for-plasma-therapy-in-pcmc/story-j3Td6Hs2bmfii3Z5B6TjHL.html
26-07-2020||Kolkata||Kolkata Port Trust moots tunnel under Hooghly river for truck movement||The Kolkata Port Trust (KoPT) is weighing the option of constructing a tunnel under the Hooghly river to facilitate container truck movement from one bank to another, a move that will help decongest the city roads, an official said.Buoyed by the success of underwater tunnelling work for East-West Metro corridor, the KoPT, rechristened as the Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port, is planning to appoint a consultant to conduct a feasibility study for building a similar structure under the river, he said.“It is just an idea as I saw such tunnels in Antwerp port (in Belgium). So we are appointing a consultant to look into it,” the port’s chairman Vinit Kumar told PTI.This could potentially free city roads of 700-800 trucks daily, he said.Trucks that trudge through Garden Reach Circular Road, Kidderpore Road, Hastings and Vidyasagar Setu, also known as the Second Hooghly Bridge, causing traffic snarls and pollution could cross the river via an underwater tunnel then head to the destination from the opposite bank in Howrah.The port authorities are also exploring RoRo (roll on, roll off) ferry services to facilitate movement of trucks by avoiding city traffic, he said.Asked whether the current Covid-19 outbreak has impacted the port activities, he said, “Eight pilots tested positive for the disease in a day last week and overall 180 cases have been detected among port employees and support workers. We have not stopped operations for a single day as it causes inconvenience to port users.” Meanwhile, speaking at a seminar organised by CII, Shipping Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said the Centre has waived off waterways charges.The Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) had levied the waterway usage charges at a rate of Rs 0.02 per gross registered tonnage (GRT) per km for inland cargo ships and Rs 0.05 for cruise vessels on national waterways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/kolkata-port-trust-moots-tunnel-under-hooghly-river-for-truck-movement/story-5w3c3QLVBp9mxaiWSGl6xI.html

According to Electronics trading association, 10 to 15 per cent sales of laptops was registered and many shopkeepers said innerwear sale picked by 8 to 10 per cent. Parents, teachers and students were seen queuing up outside electronics outlets in areas like Sadashiv peth, Tilak road and Laxmi roads to buy mobile handsets and laptops. Sujit Dawane, manager, HP Computer Showroom on Tilak road said that post lockdown many parents have turned up to buying laptops for their children’s online education. “The situation was different during the previous lockdowns when staff working with IT-related firms bought laptops to work from home. During this period, several parents, teachers and academicians are turning up to buy laptops as education has gone online. Most of them are looking at buying laptops between Rs 35,000 and Rs 40,000, a segment which appeals to the middle class,” he said. ‘Karan Chaturvedi, who had come to the store with his friend said, “My mother is a teacher and has to conduct classes online. Mine is the only laptop at home. I am here to buy a laptop for my mother.” The shoppers also bought smartphones as most of the schools and colleges have started online classes. Pradeep Umardand and his wife Chaitra who bought a Samsung mobile phone from an outlet in Sadashiv peth said, “Our mobile was not suitable for online education of our child. Hence, we bought a new one.” According to Vikram Mande, manager of SR Hosiery Shop on Laxmi road, most customers are opting to buy innerwear from city markets as shops in suburbs are shut. “Maximum customers are male. As cloth takes more time to dry during the monsoon season, there is a rise in demand and we expect more customers in the coming days,” he said. Sanjay Kumar, a petrol pump attendant who had come to buy innerwear, said that shops near his residence in Bhavani peth are shut as the areas have been declared containment zone. So, he had to visit Laxmi road for purchase. A huge crowd was seen at cloth stores in Tulshibaug on Saturday. “The sale of casuals and innerwear has picked up since Friday after the lockdown ended,” said Nitin Pandit, secretary, Tulshibaug market shop owners association. Kavita Shinde, a resident of Wanowrie, said, “We were locked inside for four months. We had limited stock of home wear for my five-year-old son. With uncertainty about future lockdowns, I bought clothes for my kid in bulk.” Kailash Changedia, an electronics shop owner from Camp, said, “We have received inquiries from customers who are seeking office furniture for home set up. Demands for computers, laptops, work stations, dishwashers, washing machines, ceiling fans and stationary fans has risen after the lockdown period. Many people are calling up seeking to book an appointment before visiting our store and the footfall has increased.” “We have ensured that social distancing rules are maintained strictly and business is carried out with care and caution,” he said. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/surge-in-sale-of-laptops-innerwear-after-shops-reopen-in-pune/story-JIGbQ7xLCoy36S8EJBK10N.html
26-07-2020||Pune||Kumar: Increasing manpower, better infra top priorities to tackle virus situation in Pune||On July 12, 2020, the Maharashtra government in a sudden shuffle replaced Shekhar Gaikwad as the Pune municipal commissioner and appointed Vikram Kumar as Pune’s civic chief. Kumar took charge at a time when the city is battling an unprecedented pandemic that has affected 49,370 residents. Kumar spoke to HT’s Abhay Khairnar on the challenges that lay ahead, the uncertainty that comes with it and the combat plan by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). Q - Pune’s Covid-19 situation is getting critical; the Covid positive patients are not getting beds in private hospitals. How are you going to deal with this situation?A- It is true that there has been a surge in the number of patients and there are complaints that patients are not getting hospital beds, however we are trying our best. My strategy is to tackle the ongoing pandemic at four levels. First, is to improve the infrastructure at private hospitals. Second, is to improve government and PMC hospitals’ infrastructure. Third, is to build a jumbo facility with 800 beds and fourth is to promote home isolation for asymptomatic patients. My efforts are to create more infrastructures considering future demand.Q- Though it was expected that cases will increase and Pune will require more infrastructure, do you think that the government machinery was not prepared to handle it, whether the PMC’s planning has failed?A- The Covid-19 pandemic is a global crisis. Not only Pune but many cities and also developed countries are struggling. Our efforts are ongoing to ensure that each patient gets proper treatment. The government and administration is working hard to improve the infrastructure, testing facilities. Even many NGOs and corporates are coming forward with a helping hand. Q- The physical infrastructure can be created but what would be your action plan about the medical and para medical manpower?A- Along with the infrastructure, we are working on escalating manpower. The doctors and paramedical staff are getting appointed. There is a demand to increase the stipend for intern doctors. We are trying to hire these intern doctors very soon. As testing has been improved, we are requiring more technicians. The PMC had also recruited more manpower for carrying out maximum tests.Q- You spoke about the jumbo facility, an 800-bed hospital. Is it possible to get it ready in a short period?A- The 800-bedded hospital will be ready in hardly 15 to 20 days after issuing work orders. The Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) is co-ordinating it. Once ready, the facility will offer a big relief, as all the 800 beds will be reserved for critical patients. The PMRDA has already floated an expression of interest and the contractor will be finalised after following due process.Q- The centre and state government are taking efforts to unlock and start many activities? Will Pune city get more relaxations like public gardens, hotels in the future?A- We have planned to take a review of the situation every week. The state government will also issue fresh guidelines. As per the state government’s new guidelines, we will be taking a call on opening public gardens, and allowing hotels and other businesses to be fully functional in the city.Q- Due to the lockdown and Covid-19 crises, the civic body is not getting enough income. Do you think it would affect projects like the metro in future?A- Despite the Covid-19 crises and financial worries, mega projects like metro will not be affected. Already, these projects are in the pipeline and have received necessary sanctions. Even the financial institutes are finalised. The Centre, state and the PMC has made budgetary provisions for it. In consideration that the metro project will be continued, projects that have not begun and are in the pipeline may be postponed. Q- What is your long term plan for Pune as the municipal commissioner?A - My long term plan and the first priority is to make the city Covid-19 free. This is a big challenge and we all need to overcome this crisis. Covid-19 has given us a lesson and, henceforth not only Pune but everywhere health would be a priority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/kumar-increasing-manpower-better-infra-top-priorities-to-tackle-virus-situation-in-pune/story-73Mjwb7zJX4RHowEpGpLfL.html

People visiting mosques for the prayers have to wear face masks and maintain social distancing, Minority Welfare and Wakf Department Secretary A B Ibrahim said in an order issued on Friday. It said the Hilal committee has decided that the Eid-ul- Azha, also known as Bakrid, would be celebrated on July 31 in Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Kodagu districts while it would be on August 1 in the rest of the state. Noting that mass prayers were one of the important rituals Muslims perform during Bakrid, the order said in view of the Covid-19 pandemic such events at Eidgah and other places were prohibited. However, prayers would be allowed in mosques with the restriction that not more than 50 people should take part. If there were more people, the prayers should be performed in batches, the department said in the order. Mass prayers should not be performed in any other places such as halls, community buildings and ‘Shadi Mahal’, the order added. Karnataka has allowed temples, mosques and other places of worship to be open for devotees from June 8 with all Covid-19 preventive measures in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/no-mass-prayers-in-eidgah-for-bakrid-up-to-50-allowed-at-a-time-in-mosques-karnataka-govt/story-VIsY7pYgXsgsLyhFZavSPN.html

According to Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association (PRAHA) president Ganesh Shetty, the bill counters saw less transaction because of less customers and thin staff. Most of the restaurants were shut due to lack of manpower and guidelines imposed by the state government. Takeaway parcels were being given at important locations across the city like Fergusson College road, Wanowrie, NIBM road, Aundh, Kalyaninagar and other areas of the city. Shetty said, “At least 8,500 restaurants are shut and the total lockdown losses are around Rs 250 crore with more than 2 lakh employees returning to their native places.” “There is a shortage of staff and the government has still not allowed restaurants to open, except food delivery. Small shops can operate on this takeaway model, but bigger establishments are into huge economic loss. The business is around 10-15 per cent and it is quite less,” he said. Ikram Khan, restaurateur, who runs joint ventures with several prominent brands of hotels said, “The restaurant industry was shut during lockdown and reached a point of no return. Currently, the business of takeaways and online-based deliveries is only 10 per cent.” Sanika More ( 21), who picked up her favourite Masala Dosa and coffee parcel at Hotel Vaishali on FC road, said “I felt happy to enjoy my favourite masala dosa and beverage after a long time. Pune has been a city for the youth, but unfortunately, the lockdown has affected the day-to-day life.” Chintamani Mani, owner of Sadguru Snack Centre at Salunke Vihar, said on Saturday, “Not many buyers are coming to pick up parcels as there is fear about the spread of Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 (coronavirus) infection.” “I barely managed to do 10 per cent business today,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/demand-for-food-delivery-drops-in-pune-praha-claims-losses-of-rs-250-crore-during-entire-lockdown-period/story-BISizGmL7e8YbkHmPIOhFL.html

26-07-2020||Pune||YourSpace: Must follow Kerala model to control virus spread, say Pune residents||With Covid-19 cases rising in the city and lockdowns apparently not helping in containing the virus spread, what should be the step forward? Pune residents list out actions authorities should take to ensure restriction norms are followed strictly.The city has seen multiple lockdowns, but cases are rising despite that. Is the lockdown a perfect solution? Epidemiologists should explore and explain it to the residents. It is true that lockdown is affecting the economy and people’s livelihood, especially of the toiling masses. The government should transparently explain the aims and objectives of lockdown with scientific evidence, and also its benefits.What needs to be done if lockdown is not working apparently:1) Tracing, testing and treating is very important to prevent the spread of disease. Kerala model of tracing the suspects and contacts in hotspot areas, testing as much as possible, quarantining of positive patients and treating was a five-point strategy followed by the state. We must follow the Kerala model efficiently.2) Due to the fear of isolation in government’s poorly managed Covid care centres (CCCs), people are trying to hide their illness. Hundreds of beds are vacant in CCCs. To prevent this, a properly managed CCC is needed so that people will feel comfortable in these centres. 3) We should provide adequate supply of essential commodities to those living in hotspot areas so that they follow the regulations with wilful participation.4) Despite information overload on Covid, people, in general, are not receiving scientific details about the pandemic and preventive measures. We should take steps towards information, education and communication (IEC) and tell residents the benefits of measures like physical distancing, use of scientifically correct mask and washing. 5) High-risk groups of people need special attention and consideration. This vulnerable population needs screening, tracing, testing and treatment of comorbidities. Preferably, Covid healthcare centres exclusively for suspected high-risk and positive high-risk patients.6) There is tremendous chaos in the overall management of the pandemic. Patients are not getting beds, creating more panic among people. The government should publish a white paper on the projections of cases in coming days and how they are preparing to match the demand and supply of healthcare to both Covid and non Covid patients. Dr Sanjay Dabhade Social distancing, masks, washing hands the gold standard We are going through an unprecedented situation, wherein Pune city recorded the highest single-day rise in patients in the last 24 hours, despite being under strict lockdown. According to epidemiological studies, enforcement of a lockdown is one of the most important measures we can undertake to mitigate the spread of the contagion. It restricts activities and allows administration in capacity building and preparedness. Whether lockdown is helping us or not is questionable, as only a fraction of the society is behaving as responsible citizens. There is a lot of confusion and misinformation regarding the virus. Only we, as citizens, can control the spread of this virus, simply by following basic sanitation guidelines. It is our city and we need to protect it and ourselves. Lack of coordination at the administrative level, where everyone is trying to do things on their own, with very little interdepartmental communication, is responsible for the delay in decision making, implementation and awareness creation. We have to focus on increasing our testing capacity and importantly take action in isolating and monitoring positive patients. Due to variability and lag in the results of tests, patients unknowingly are capable of spreading the disease during this time. With advancements on the medical side regarding diagnosis, treatment and vaccination in the last four months, it is still the public health measures like social distancing, hand washing, wearing a mask that are the gold standard. I would advise all to restrict activities, irrespective of the status of lockdown, and to avoid sharing air space for more than 20 minutes in closed rooms where the air is stagnant. Let us support our local administration in their efforts to control this pandemic because as we know, the season of festivities will soon be upon us. So, let’s gift ourselves and our community good health for this festive season. Dr Sanjay Patil Enforcing lockdown not a Covid remedy nowThe national lockdowns were important because they were an intervention to give us time to get educated and better equipped to handle the Covid-19 infection. The lockdown gave us the much-needed buffer, today the administration is experienced, protocols are refined, Covid warriors are better armed, and more importantly, the citizens are now mentally and emotionally prepared to fight this battle without much panic. But enforcing lockdown across the city after three months of preparation is not a remedy to the virus. The latest lockdown had become a compulsion, which could have easily been prevented with proactive action from the administration to enhance our medical infrastructure. The step forward is that we as a society have to accept that this virus is here to stay and, till a vaccine is found and distributed across the population, we need to learn to live with the virus. I believe the only way to achieve a balance between life and livelihood is to make this a community lead movement. From educating the citizens with hygiene protocols to effective contact tracing and early testing, we can gain control over the pandemic. Education and emphasising on mandatory mask usage, social distancing and other hygiene protocols among your locality, loved ones and friends is by far the best deterrent to the spread of Covid-19 within your community Siddharth Shirole Lockdown is a dearth of visionary planning In Pune, the number of new Covid-19 infected patients is increasing at a rapid pace. At present, the daily count increases by more than 2,100 new patients. The ten-day lockdown initiated on July 13 proved a complete failure. The basic purpose of a lockdown is to impose a stringent restriction on crowding by masses in public, self-isolation of citizens and observing the rules of prevention on one side. On the other side, the ten-day period should have been used for micro-planning to manage the impending surge which is predicted in mid-August. It should have also been used to bring down the spread of infection. The civic administration failed in many aspects. Everywhere, the doors for the admission to hospitals are closed. The government, as well as private hospitals, are overflowing. At any given time as of today, there are no ordinary beds available, no beds with oxygen and a big no for ICU beds. The civic administration is strangling the private hospitals to increase the number of beds and, every day, for every small mistake eager to pitch legal notices on them. There seems to be no attempt to increase the number of beds like Mumbai arranged a makeshift hospital at BKC or the Delhi government turned the train coaches into hospital rooms. There is an acute shortage of doctors to treat patients. The government doctors and residents are overworked and to compensate for the deficiency the private doctors are asked to work, leaving their own practice, causing inconvenience and injustice to their regular patients. The Ayush doctors who are competent in handling Covid patients with moderate symptoms are not used in full capacity. The medical service in all private hospital has already become lame due to unavailability of trained nurses and other healthcare workers. The biggest problem for the government is the inability to pay a decent remuneration or salary to private doctors and the medical or paramedical staff. The field activity in such a situation demands a thorough contact tracing of infected patients. It seems to have taken a complete halt. The testing needs to be increased by five-fold, with the use of recently purchased rapid antigen testing kits, but there is no initiative in this regard. There must be a house-to-house survey in containment zones, to check symptomatic persons, individuals with co-morbid conditions and to perform their testing to find out and diagnose at the early stage and treat them. The lessons of hygiene in using public toilets in slums, which are mostly the hotspots of the pandemic, should be given. The disinfection of these toilets after every use has to be stressed and taught to dwellers. This basic step in the epidemic control is ignored at large. The awareness training about using masks, keeping physical distance and washing hands for the inhabitants in containment areas are like things from a forgotten past in Pune. It is predicted that the pandemic will take a serious turn in mid-August. There is a dearth of a visionary plan to counter it. Dr Avinash Bhondwe Imperative to set up Covid-19 nodal authority in Pune The manner in which the lockdowns are implemented since March 2020 — sometimes on and other times off. Due to this, the public is not taking the restrictions seriously. This is mainly because the Centre did not understand the seriousness of the pandemic. Cut back to the Central government guidelines which states could implement, but not dilute. These should have been framed by experts, not IAS and IPS officers. Some states became over-enthusiastic and gave lockdown, unlock orders which gave a clear message to the public that no one was sure, but we are experimenting with what would work, if at all. Local authorities were also unsure where sometimes more than two authorities were issuing orders which were contradictory to each other. These orders were not posted on a common website, but released as press notes, bits and pieces communicated on social media. All this resulted in people not taking the provisions in the orders seriously, but mocking them by partying, hanging out with friends, not maintaining social distancing and not wearing face masks. At many places, it was seen that masks were hanging around the neck mainly by politicians, which is a damaging vision for the public to see. Hence, it is imperative that the state government must set up a centralised Covid-19 nodal authority in Pune headed by a senior IAS officer since Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) covers authorities such as district collector, PMC, PCMC, three cantonments and two police authorities, district cooperation department. All of them issue orders on micro-management of Covid-19 which are contradictory to each other. It is a reality which cannot be denied that official rising figures prove that we are into stage four that is herd immunity. No amount of lockdowns will help as cases will spike/surge as soon as the lockdown is lifted. The only solution is to have experts frame the guidelines, fine violations heavily, insist on social distancing and ensure corporators to hold workshops in their wards about building immunity levels. Qaneez Sukhrani Lockdown successful, 75,000 tests carried out We have been able to achieve what we wanted to during this lockdown period. We have carried out about 75,000 tests in these ten days which is more than what we even did in the three months. The intention was to increase testing, which we did. It was not that the lockdown was necessary for testing, but these two are parallel things. If people keep roaming out then even one lakh tests per day would not be enough. The intention was that people must not roam out breaking social distancing norms and then this period could be dedicated completely to increasing testing which we did. The chain must break and it depends on how people follow the lockdown norms. Pune has the maximum number of testing in the country.

26-07-2020||Lifestyle||Covid-19 protection: Right safety gear to use in the pandemic||The country is unlocking really fast and with the coming unlock 3.0, more relaxations will be introduced. So Delhiites have resorted to buying essentials to be extra careful. But, with ample options available in terms of safety gear, many are getting confused. Here’s a guide to what you should buy and what should be its features.Face MasksRight from the cotton masks stitched at home, to the N95 and N99, double-layered, triple-layered and designer ones, the market has a wide range of masks on offer. “Maintaining social distancing norms and wearing a mask when stepping out remain the paramount guideline to avoid contracting the infection. As the new study suggests the virus is airborne, it means people who don’t have Covid-19 patients in their vicinity are also prone to it now,” says Dr Arunesh Kumar, a senior consultant and head of respiratory medicine at a Gurugram hospital. How can one choose a right mask? “One should look at the degree of protection required. We do not need N95 mask for daily use as its breathability is very low. For office and travel, breathability should be good,” says Anuj Prasad, a Delhi-based designer of face armour, desmania aarmr. Masks should be skin-friendly, the outer layer should have a water-resistant fabric. The inner layer should be water-absorbent and the middle layer should act as a filter.PPE Kits There are multiple options available in PPE kits. “When it comes to gloves and overall PPE kits, people prefer only surgical products that can be disposed of after a single use,” says Delhi-based Mandeep Arora, MD of Ubon, a manufacturer of PPE kits, masks, gloves, sanitisers and other safety gear. Rajat Meena, a resident of Dwarka who bought a PPE kit recently, says, “I’m associated with a third-party delivery system, and there are times when we have to travel long distances, so I prefer to wear PPE kits, they are use-and-throw ones. It’s better to be safe than sorry.Face Shields Is it better to use a face shield than using a mask? “A face shield covers the entire face, including the nose, mouth and eyes. So this has extra protection as chances of touching exposed areas are minimal,” adds Prasad. The shields are generally transparent, washable and can be bought keeping the use in mind. For work, travel or leisure, shields which are compatible for the fight against germs, can be used. Medical professionals require shields with extra protection. SanitizersIn sanitisers, right from the alcohol-based variety to the ayurvedic and skin-friendly ones, the variety is endless. But, denizens must remember that cheap sanitisers can burn the skin, or cause allergic reactions. Arora informs, “Sometimes, long exposure to the fragrance of some sanitisers and disinfectants can result in nausea, etc. While buying sanitisers and disinfectants, one should look for the amount of alcohol in them. A safe sanitiser should consist of about 60% to 95% of alcohol in ethanol, propanol or isopropanol form. Also, it should be made according to the formula recommended by the World Health Organisation and certified by government testing labs.” Author tweets @ruchikagarg271For more stories follow Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/covid-19-protection-right-safety-gear-to-use-in-the-pandemic/story-JM2sDM4lggiEr8byUeuR3N.html

Delhi’s recovery rate for coronavirus patients is hovering around an enviable 90% mark with 1,14,875 people having been cured or discharged, the health bulletin released by the government stated. The bulletin added that 21 deaths were registered over the last 24 hour period, taking the total casualties caused by the infection to 3,827 on Sunday. 6,976 active patients have been kept in home isolation in the capital, while over 3,000 people who arrived here on Vande Bharat Mission and bubble flights have been accommodated in dedicated Covid care centres.

Delhi is only a fraction short of completing a million tests with the current figure of 9,46,777 accomplished tests. Delhi recorded its first coronavirus case on March 2 this year, over a month after India recorded its first case on January 30 in Kerala. Ten new areas have been added to Delhi’s containment zones on Sunday, pushing the count of restricted areas to 714. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who had claimed last week that Delhi has turned a corner in its fight against the virus, again took to Twitter on Sunday to say that the occupancy of designated hospital beds for Covid-19 has come down sharply in the national capital over the last one month.Also read | In its fight against coronavirus, Capital has turned a corner: CM Kejriwal“Corona bed occupancy has come down sharply from 23 June to 26 July.

26-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi Police to intensify patrolling, conduct verification drive ahead of Independence Day||Delhi Police Commissioner S N Shrivastava has directed officers to conduct a thorough verification drive across the city ahead of Independence Day, police said here on Sunday.The police chief reviewed the security arrangement across the 15 police districts in the city in a meeting held via video-conferencing on Saturday, they said.In view of the forthcoming Independence day, all the district DCPs have been asked to intensify patrolling in their areas and conduct door-to-door verification to ensure safety and security across the national capital to avoid any untoward incident, they police said.Shrivastava laid emphasis on increasing police presence, intensive and coordinated checking at vulnerable points, verification of tenants and servants, sensitisation of cyber cafe owners, security guards, second-hand car dealers and mobile dealers among others in order to strengthen counter-terrorism measures, they said.Even though hotels and guest houses aren’t operational due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the officers have been asked to stay vigilant. “In view of forthcoming Independence day, security arrangements across all the 15 police districts in the city were reviewed via video-conferencing. We have also collected intelligence inputs and are working on it accordingly. A thorough verification drive is being conducted at all places across the city to ensure the safety and security ahead of the big day,” a senior police officer said.Besides, Independence Day security arrangements, issues concerning cybercrime were reviewed and redressal of public grievances was also discussed in the meeting, he said.Shrivastava also rewarded personnel from West, Outer and Dwarka districts in recognition of exemplary outstanding work performed by them during the last few days.Unlike every year, the Centre has asked all states to avoid large congregation, ensure social distancing and webcast Independence Day events as the novel coronavirus cases continue to spiral unabated.Gearing up for Independence Day arrangements, a senior officer from the north district said police personnel have already been deployed and weapons training for over thousands of staff concluded.The staff deputed in checking and frisking teams, which consist of 200 police personnel, have been strictly advised to ensure social distancing in the wake of ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The staff will wear personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and use sanitisers after every checking and frisking, he said.More electronic devices are being installed to avoid close contact during frisking. Over 300 CCTV cameras have been installed in and around the Red Fort, where the Independence Day event is held every year, the officer added.The event this year will consist of a guard of honour by the armed forces and the Delhi Police to the prime minister, unfurling of the national flag, the 21-gun salute, speech by the prime minister, singing of the national anthem and release of tricoloured balloons at the end.In its advisory, the Home Ministry said it was imperative to follow certain preventive measures while organising various programmes or activities for the Independence Day celebrations amid the pandemic.The measures include maintaining social distancing, wearing of masks, proper sanitisation, avoiding large congregations, protecting vulnerable persons and follow all Covid-19 guidelines issued by the ministries of health and home, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-police-to-intensify-patrolling-conduct-verification-drive-ahead-of-independence-day/story-nvxduKiworA4wP06FkX5AN.html

26-07-2020||Delhi||Average office rental in Delhi-NCR market declines 9% in H1 2020||The average office rental in the Delhi-NCR market declined by 9 per cent to around Rs 78 per sq ft a month during the first half of this calendar year as demand was hit due to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a report. In its half yearly report, property consultant Knight Frank India has said that the gross absorption or leasing of office space fell 45 per cent to 21 lakh sq ft during January-June 2020 compared to 38 lakh sq ft in the year ago period. The new supply plunged 86 per cent to 8 lakh sq ft from 59 lakh sq ft during the period under review. “As all business activities had paused during the lockdown, many organisations approached landlords for rent waivers and deferments in the second quarter of 2020. “Businesses are reworking their targets and outlook for the remainder of this CY/FY and want to save on real estate operating expenditure which constitute nearly 3-5 per cent of their operating income,” the report said. The demand for office spaces from the co-working sector has also slowed down considerably in NCR, which was a major occupier segment until H2 2019. “As a result, rents have come under downward pressure as landlords fear exits from existing tenants. In H1 2020, weighted average rentals declined by 9% YoY to INR 844 per sq meter per month (INR 78.4 per sq ft per month),” the report said. Going forward, the consultant said that rents might be further rationalised when leases come up for renewal. At the same time, demand contraction for office spaces in the short term would provide an opportunity for corporates to lock-in long term leases for expansion at cheap rents, in premium office buildings in otherwise expensive locations across NCR. “2019 was a landmark year for National Capital Region (NCR’s) office market as it witnessed huge supply infusion of 123 lakh sq ft, the highest in the past 8 years. Occupier demand, too, remained strong with total office space leasing of 86 lakh sq ft, the highest in a decade,” the report said. The weighted average rentals recorded only 4 per cent annual growth in 2019. Knight Frank said that the market was poised for large scale occupier expansions to materialize in 2020, but the Covid-19 outbreak in March completely altered the scenario. “As the national lockdown was imposed in India from March 25th, 2020, limited gross leasing of 21 lakh sq ft was recorded in NCR in H1 2020 (Jan-June period) as decision making at corporate occupiers’ end came to an abrupt halt,” the report said. Planned real estate space take-ups have been put on hold as occupiers wait for the situation to evolve in the second half of the year before taking decisions regarding real estate occupancies for offices. In line with past trends, Knight Frank said that the two prime office markets in NCR, Noida and Gurugram, commanded the lion’s share of the total leasing pie with a 52 per cent and 44 per cent share respectively. However, unlike the trend witnessed in the past seven years, more office space was leased in Noida than in Gurugram, mainly due to availability of new supply at lower rentals as compared to Gurugram’s key locations. The number of leasing deals in NCR came down from 81 in H1 2019 to 66 in H1 2020. The first half of the year saw its average transacted space decrease to 31,506 sq ft from 46,718 sq ft in the same period in 2019. IT/ITeS and Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) were the major demand driver. “Like many other businesses, Covid-19 has sent shockwaves to co-working business, which until last year was a major contributor to the overall leasing in NCR. Co-working, which accounted for 12 per cent of the total leasing in NCR in H1 2019 saw its share diminished to 3 per cent in H1 2020. In terms of quantum, the space leased by coworking operators shrunk from 492,983 sq ft to 70,000 sq ft, registering an 85 per cent YoY decline. Vacancy rate might increase as many corporate occupiers have started serving notices to landlords to surrender offices spaces in NCR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/average-office-rental-in-delhi-ncr-market-declines-9-in-h1-2020/story-xUXkAwJOfSvXhScNblNQyM.html
26-07-2020||Mumbai||Ram temple ‘bhoomi pujan’ can be done via video link: Uddhav Thackeray||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has said the ground-breaking ceremony for the Ram temple construction in Ayodhya can be conducted through video-conference in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.Thackeray, who is also president of the Shiv Sena, said he can go to Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh for the ceremony, but asked if lakhs of “Ram bhakts” can be stopped from going there.According to members of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to visit Ayodhya on August 5 for the “bhoomi pujan” ceremony to begin the construction of the Ram temple.“An e-bhoomi pujan can be done. The ground-breaking ceremony can be held through video-conference. This is an event of joy, and lakhs of people would be interested in attending the ceremony. Will we allow the spread of coronavirus?” Thackeray said in an interview published in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ on Sunday.He said the Ram temple issue has a background of struggle.“This is not an ordinary temple. Today, we are fighting the coronavirus pandemic and religious gatherings are prohibited. I can go to Ayodhya for the ceremony, but what about lakhs of Ram bhakts. Will you stop them? You can do e-bhoomi pujan through video-conference,” he suggested.Thackeray recalled that the last time when he had gone to Ayodhya, he was stopped from performing ‘aarti’ at the Saryu river there since the Covid-19 pandemic spread had just started.“Before that I had seen huge crowds on the river banks. Ram Mandir is a matter of faith. How can you stop people from going there?” he asked.Thackeray visited Ayodhya in March to commemorate 100 days in office.He assumed office as the chief minister of the Sena- led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on November 28 last year, after his party joined hands with the NCP and the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ram-temple-bhoomi-pujan-can-be-done-via-video-link-uddhav-thackeray/story-NkQgEuUUSZiGseMSB7xPnM.html
26-07-2020||Mumbai||Do it if you can: Uddhav Thackeray dares opposition to topple his govt||Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday challenged the opposition to pull his government down as the Maharashtra chief minister emphasised he was at the helm of the three-party coalition government in the state. In the last of the two-part interview to the Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana, Thackeray said the fate of his government was not in the hands of the opposition.The chief minister, while speaking to Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, also targeted the Centre’s ambitious Mumbai- Ahmedabad bullet train project to put his point across.Replying to a question related to the opposition criticism that his government was a three-wheeled vehicle, in a reference to his alliance partners - the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, Thackeray said his Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government represents the poor people.“If it is the choice between a bullet train and a three-wheeler, I will choose the latter as it is the travelling mode of the poor people. It is a strong government and I am at the steering wheel with two other partners,” he said.Thackeray, who will turn 60 on Monday, also pointed at the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre to deflect the criticism.“The ones who have been raising questions about our ‘three-wheeler’ should look at the government at the Centre. How many parties are there as coalition partners? When I attended the NDA meeting last time, there were 30-35 leaders representing ruling parties. It should be called a ‘train’ government then,” he added.Thackeray said that there were no differences between the three parties even though there was a lack of continuous dialogue due to the outbreak of the Covid-19.“Congress had some issues related to the matters on public policies. After our meeting, they have been solved. We have better coordination between us. I take guidance regularly from NCP chief Sharad Pawar Saheb and occasionally speak Soniaji Gandhi,” he said.The Shiv Sena chief also took a dig at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for its alleged attempt to topple the Congress government in Rajasthan. He said Operation Lotus would not reap any success in Maharashtra.“It is strange that the use of money for political gain is not a crime and the opponents are targeted using central agencies. But this would not last for too long. They should also keep in mind that days keep passing by,” he said.“They tried to topple the Rajasthan government perhaps because there is no pandemic spread in that state or in Madhya Pradesh. The leader of opposition [Devendra Fadnavis] criticised the Maharashtra government over the handling of Covid-19 during his Delhi visit, perhaps because the pandemic exists only in our state and not in Rajasthan or Madhya Pradesh,” he said.The chief minister said it was not correct to say that the decision-making process regarding the coronavirus pandemic in the state is driven by the bureaucracy.“Our handling of Covid-19 pandemic, especially in Dharavi, has been applauded at the international level. I was chosen as among the popular chief ministers. If the bureaucracy was at the driving seat, why was the government praised and was it done by the bureaucracy without any control from the government?” he asked.“The government policies are after all implemented by the officers and the bureaucracy and is the duty of the government to stand firm by the efficient officers. I will firmly support such officers,” he added.Thackeray said he has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take a uniform decision over the policies related to China as India is faced with a border standoff with that country.“Our policies related to China should not be deviating as they differ in case of Pakistan. During times of trouble, we boycott these countries and after a few days extend an olive branch before them. During one of our interactions, I requested Modiji to take a firm stand on China and decide finally on the trade with Chinese companies. We have put our memorandum of understanding with them (Chinese companies) on hold,” the CM said.Thackeray said the decision to allow the bullet train between Mumbai and Ahmedabad will be taken on the basis of people’s mandate. He said he would want to a bullet train to run between Mumbai and Nagpur as it will prove more beneficial for the development of the state.“My individual opinion or that of my party’s stand on the bullet train project could be different, but as a state, the government will take its decision at the appropriate time. Currently, it is on hold. The government decision will be based on the people’s mandate about the project and after discussing it with all the stakeholders,” he said. Thackeray added that if the people of Maharashtra decide against the bullet train, he will cancel it.The Shiv Sena leader also suggested a virtual bhoomi pujan ahead of the construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya to avoid the crowding at the site, saying it could lead to the spread of Sars-Cov-2, which causes the coronavirus disease. He said lakhs of Hindus from all across the globe worship Lord Ram and would want to flock for the bhoomi pujan.“Instead of putting their lives in danger, the laying of foundation stone could be done online,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/do-it-if-you-can-uddhav-thackeray-dares-opposition-to-topple-his-govt/story-xA7ZxfoUsL3TYnMniIxS1O.html

The department has been providing educational and psychological counselling services to students through its YUVA Helpline since 2006.“In a bid to help citizens with mental health amid the Covid-19 pandemic which has limited people’s physical movement and caused several damages in the employment sector, the Delhi government has taken this decision,” the government said in a statement.It further said that people who need support on educational/emotional/psychological/personal issues can call on toll-free numbers 1800116888 or 10580 to get assistance.It also said that identities of these people will be kept confidential.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-delhi-govt-to-launch-job-portal-to-help-people-find-employment-opportunities/story-PtrP7KyvOwWmELaNotIeTP.html

26-07-2020||Delhi||Indian matchmaking hit hard in era of distancing and coronavirus||Few people in the Capital can talk about matchmaking as insightfully as Poonam Sachdev. After all, she runs Connex’on, previously called ‘Rishte hi Rishte’, Delhi’s oldest matchmaking company, which was started in the early 1970s by her uncle Dharam Chand Arora, the city’s legendary matchmaker. Their catchphrase Rishte Hi Rishte: Ek Baar Mil Toh Lein (matches and more matches, meet us at least once) used to be scrawled along railway tracks across north India in the 1980s.Sachdev, 53, who has been in the business of matchmaking for 30 years, says Covid-19 has made her job more complicated than ever before. “Matching two people and arranging a marriage takes endless rounds of meetings and negotiations between two families, most of which used to take place in hotel lobbies. But hotels are closed and families do not want to invite each other to their homes because of the fear of the coronavirus disease, though they continue to press us for finding suitable matches for their children,” says Sachdev. “While my business has gone down by 80%, one positive aspect of the pandemic is that those seeking matrimonial alliances have never before been so flexible about their demands regarding salaries, looks, the family status. Suddenly, a lot of people seem to believe in a simple marriage.”Her sentiments are shared by many other well-known matchmakers in Delhi, who before the pandemic had an estimated 3,000 matrimonial bureaus. While a large number of them have had to permanently shut shop in the past three months, as business has nosedived like never before, those that have survived say finding a perfect match has never been so tough.“Given the constraints of meeting spaces, I tried arranging meetings on Zoom, but it did not quite work out. Zoom, I realised, is not a place where boys and girl can meet, families can discuss budget, and most importantly, the two families can see each other’s houses and lifestyle, which plays an important role in a matrimonial alliance in Delhi. I managed to arrange a few meetings in hotels outside Delhi, but family members want to see each other’s faces during such meetings, but asking everyone to take off their masks is a bit awkward and not safe,” says Shree Garg, who, along with his father RK Garg, and brother, runs Guptaji Marriage Bureau in Shakti Nagar. “We used to charge 1% commission on the total budget of a wedding, but now those who wanted to spend ₹50 lakh wish to spend only ₹5 lakh on a wedding.”Neelam Pathak, who runs Pathak Ji, another well-known marriage bureau, testifies to the ‘downturn in the groom’s market,’ saying the seemingly suitable boys might not actually be as suitable in reality. “He may be working in an MNC earning an astronomical salary, but given the current economic uncertainties, one can never be sure about what might happen in the next couple of months,” says Pathak, adding, “While our income has crashed like never before; the prevailing situation suits families with lesser means, who are now able to find a good match without the pressure of having to spend much on the wedding, which is currently a close family affair.”Sachdev concurs: “There are a lot of middle-class families who want me to find a match for their children as soon as possible so that the wedding takes place before the pandemic is over. I worked over the phones and have already helped a couple of such as families to find the perfect match without obligations as to how and where the wedding should take place. ”The loss of offline matchmakers has worked to the advantage of matrimonial websites, which have introduced newer features such as video profiles and video calling. “We have got 30% new users in the past three months,” says Rohan Mathur, chief business officer, Jeevansathi. “During the pandemic, we have sought to be a match-meeting destination through secure video calls whose use has gone up three times in the past three months.”So, will the pandemic change the fat Indian wedding forever?“In India, weddings have been a way to make a social statement. But right now there is no social pressure on anyone to organise big weddings,” says Anuja Agrawal, associate professor, sociology, Delhi School of Economics, whose specialisations include anthropology of family, kinship, and marriage.Referring to the present trend of people getting married in courts, temples and at home with a small ceremony streamlined live for relatives, she says, “Some of these alternative weddings will survive after the pandemic is over. But a lot will depend on how long the Coronavirus crisis lasts, and also on the experiences of the people who are adopting these alternatives.”But right now Sachdev’s primary concern is to stay safe as she looks for suitable matches for her clients. Giving an example of matchmaking horribly gone wrong, she says, the pandemic has not only made her job difficult, but dangerous. “Last month, I came across the case of a matchmaker who contracted Covid-19 and died a couple of weeks after she visited a prospective groom’s house,” says Sachdev. “ It turned out the boy’s grandfather had been sick for a few weeks and still the boy’s family invited the matchmaker to their house with the girl’s family. Eventually, the grandfather tested positive and died.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/indian-matchmaking-hit-hard-in-era-of-distancing-and-coronavirus/story-J8sKLGxzNk1k28SFVgiAPP.html
26-07-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM hails Canada’s decision to reject ‘Refrendum 2020’||Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday hailed Canada’s decision not to recognise the result of the ‘Referendum 2020’ being organised by the pro-Khalistan group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ).Reacting to a report carried in these columns on Saturday, Amarinder hoped that other countries would also follow Canada’s example and reject the secessionist `Referendum 2020’, which the SFJ was promoting to divide India on communal lines.The CM said the categorical stand taken by the Justin Trudeau government on the issue is exemplary and other nations and governments should also come out openly against the SFJ, which has been banned by India as a terrorist organisation and whose founder Gurpatwant Singh Pannu has been declared a terrorist for actively promoting Pakistan-backed terror activities on Indian soil.Amarinder said failure to openly oppose the separatist SFJ could set a dangerous precedent for any country as it could be seen as a case of covert support to an organisation that is freely propagating secessionist activities. It was in the interest of global peace and security to reject forces that are bent on spreading terror, he said, adding that Sikhs in Punjab had categorically rejected SFJ’s pro-Khalistan movement, which the outfit was spreading at the behest of Pakistan’s ISI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-cm-hails-canada-s-decision-to-reject-refrendum-2020/story-fvJSRRKmtPFvXdE6ZLMLVI.html

But unfortunately, it is found lacking in the present case. The IOCL is either denying its responsibility or delaying performance of its obligation,” read the order.The bench directed the IOCL to deposit Rs 25 crore, in addition to the Rs 17 crore paid in May last year, with the Central Pollution Control Board for restoration of environment and public health.The orders are based on the findings of a joint team comprising CPCB, Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) and Panipat deputy commissioner. The team had found that the samples from the effluent treatment plant of the unit were non-compliant and the ambient air quality was exceeding the norms.The orders categorically mentioned that the compensation will not debar the HSPCB from initiating prosecution for violation of provision of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, against the company and its senior officials who failed to prevent commission of crime, as per statutory mandate.The bench directed the joint committee to give its further independent report after site inspection as to the status of compliance and execution of action plan by December 31 by email and fixed February 17, 2021 for hearing.When contacted, HSPCB member secretary S Narayanan said, “The order is self speaking. IOCL has already deposited around Rs 17.31 crore and will pay Rs 25 crore more. We will prepare our plan the environment restoration for the area in consultation with CPCB and the district administration.”When contacted, IOCL’s general manager for corporate communications SK Tripathi said, “We will respond only after studying the orders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ngt-directs-iocl-s-panipat-refinery-to-pay-up-rs-25-cr-for-environment-restoration/story-37LPRGk0QHjOoYDpH6Sk8J.html
26-07-2020||City||Punjab sets target of 12,000 tests per day||Though the health officials are facing a tough task to achieve the daily Covid-19 testing target due to limited resources and manpower, the health department has increased the state’s testing target by 25%.The state government had earlier set the daily testing target at 9,480, with the highest target given to three hotbed districts—Amritsar, Ludhiana and Jalandhar—of 1,050. However, the target was set at 9,480 when the state had the testing capacity of approximately 9,800 per day, with government medical colleges (GMCs) in Faridkot, Patiala and Amritsar testing 9,000 samples daily. The other 800 tests can be done at private labs, private hospitals and PGIMER, Chandigarh.The state government now revised the daily target to around 12,000 tests and directed Amritsar, Ludhiana and Jalandhar authorities to test 1,300 samples per day. Also, the state government said in the notice that 915 health workers, in 305 teams, are required to achieve the daily sample collection target. The target has been increased after spike in the testing capacity from 9,000 tests in government institutions to 12,000 tests per day. Besides, four new labs for testing Covid-19 samples have been established at Jalandhar, Ludhiana and Mohali and the capacity of each lab would be 250 per day to begin with, which will be increased to 1,000 per day by August-end.A health official, requesting anonymity, said: “The daily testing target has always remained a challenge. Against the set target of 9,480, the state was only testing 7,000-8,000 patients per day till early July. On June 29, only 6,926 samples were tested and the number was 7,561 on June 30. It was after the sudden spike in cases in Ludhiana and Jalandhar that the daily testing target was being achieved.”As per the state’s Covid-19 bulletin, only 8,705 samples were added to the total tests on July 24. State covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said: “The testing capacity in GMCs of Amritsar, Patiala and Faridkot have been increased from 3,000 tests each to 4,000 tests each per day. The revised targets have been set accordingly. We are continuously directing district officers to increase the daily sample collection so that more and more tests can be conducted. We have already conducted more than 5 lakh Covid-19 tests in the state and tests are being done as per capacity.”‘UPHILL TASK TO ACHIEVE TARGET’ “We have limited staff to collect samples as most of them are assigned contact tracing and screening tasks at public places. Different teams are required to conduct antigen tests. We are collecting, on an average, 800-900 samples daily. Efforts are on to achieve the target,” said Amritsar assistant civil surgeon Dr Amarjit Singh.Jalandhar civil surgeon Dr Gurvinder Kaur said: “We are collecting 900-1,000 samples per day but people are reluctant to get themselves tested. Persuading them and then collecting samples takes a lot of time.”The testing capacity of the state is set to increase as rapid antigen testing will start in all districts of the state after the successful completion of its pilot project.The state government started the antigen testing project on July 10 on the symptomatic people, with 5,000 kits at its disposal. “Till now, 109 people were tested positive in Punjab through this testing. The results are accurate and antigen testing has been approved. 10,000 more antigen kits have been ordered for the state”, said Dr Bhaskar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-sets-target-of-12-000-tests-per-day/story-9AQ3UwIVBPFGmXIfHBNwXK.html
26-07-2020||Mumbai||Parents in Maharashtra demand uniformity in Class 9, 11 oral exam syllabus, format||A few days after the state education department asked schools and junior colleges to promote Class 9 and 11 students to the next class on the basis of oral exams, parents have now demanded uniformity in the syllabus and format of the exams.Parents said that they want schools to give a question bank through which students could prepare. “Students were not prepared for an oral exam and need to be given some consideration in the current situation. Some schools want to ensure good results for Class 10 and thus implement strict marking system for Class 9 students. At least this year, such things should not be done,” said the parent whose child studies in a Dadar school. On Friday, Shikshak Parishad, an association of teachers, wrote to the education department, urging authorities to come up with some guidelines for schools in this regard. “Some schools have told parents that questions will be asked on the entire syllabus. This can become really stressful for students and add to their existing pressure amid the current situation. The department should give some guidelines to make the process uniform across schools and colleges,” said Shivnath Darade, secretary, Shikshak Parishad. Despite repeated attempts, officials from the education department did not respond to HT’s calls and messages. As per the government resolution (GR) dated July 21, schools have been asked to conduct the oral exams by August 7. “Under the current conditions schools should conduct an oral exam of such students either by calling them to school or via video conferencing,” stated the GR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/parents-in-maharashtra-demand-uniformity-in-class-9-11-oral-exam-syllabus-format/story-xMuvoOAFVFAdkJzrh7jK4I.html
26-07-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government slashes 25% syllabus for Class 1-12 students||The state education department on Saturday announced that the syllabus for Class 1 to Class 12 of Maharashtra board will be reduced by 25% for the current academic year. The decision has been taken owing to the loss of teaching hours, as schools are yet to reopen in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. “The syllabus of 101 subjects has been reduced. While some chapters have been reduced from languages, the grammar next to each of these chapters will still be taught and considered for assessments. For practical exams, we have taken care to ensure that they are edited as per the current conditions and concepts to be taught in these exercises will be retained. We have tried to ensure that the original structure of chapters is not disturbed,” said Dinkar Patil, director, Maharashtra State Council of Educational Research and Training (MSCERT). On Saturday, MSCERT uploaded a detailed document on its official website maa.ac.in with the subject-wise details on the revised content. “In the revised syllabus, nothing is omitted because doing that would be detrimental to students. Instead, a few chunks of chapters have been kept for homework or self-study,” said Vikas Garad, deputy director of MSCERT. While schools can download the class-wise documents and convey them to students, Balbharti is soon going to upload a revised set of books which demarcate the old and the revised syllabus. “The syllabus in blue will be the syllabus which stays and the parts in red will be for self-study or homework,” added Garad. Teachers welcomed the move and said that this would provide relief to students and parents. “It was needed under the current situation. However, the relaxation could have been a little more - upto 30% like the central boards,” said Rajesh Pandya, teacher at Fatima Devi High School in Malad. The changes Languages: While some chapters and poems, which are difficult to understand or are lengthy, have been excluded for most classes, while activities that need to be done after reading the chapter have been kept for self-study. Social sciences: While some trivia columns titled “Did you know” have been excluded, for Class 9 and Class 10, some parts in the political science textbooks have been removed. For instance, the chapter on challenges ahead of Indian democracy for Class 10 civics, the board has removed subthemes such as communalism, Maoism and terrorism. Mathematics: Most topics have been retained, but exercises have been drastically reduced. Some sums of moderate and difficult levels are not included in the revised syllabus. Science: Several activities and experiments which require apparatus and detailed guidelines have been kept out of evaluations this year. A lot of extra information on concepts that exist in the textbooks has been kept for self-study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-slashes-25-syllabus-for-class-1-12-students/story-dqEEy0rE9BsTtyB2oCZf0H.html
26-07-2020||Mumbai||Artificial intelligence helps Mumbai civic body detect 1,255 comorbid patients||To detect comorbidity in patients of Covid-19 and their high-risk contacts, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has been working with companies that use artificial intelligence (AI) to diagnose pre-existing medical conditions and utilise resources effectively. BMC is working with Radical Health-tech Private Limited, a startup that had participated in an AI innovation challenge organised by Maharashtra government and Niti Aayog in March 2019. Ashwini Bhide, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, said, “Some AI entities are working with BMC’s health department for early detection of Covid positivity as well as comorbidities in people by analysing chest X-rays, CT scans as well as retinal images using AI tools. Radical Health-tech is among them. They detect comorbidities among high-risk contacts and mildly-symptomatic [Covid-]positive patients using retinal screening.”In June, Radical Health-tech started screening people at 15 locations, including all the patients at the jumbo facility in Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC). Until July 23, Radical Health-tech had screened 3,167 people of whom 1,255 had co-morbidity. Of the 1,255 people, 65% had been unaware that they had comorbidities. The screening led to 259 people being newly detected with glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration; 188 were newly detected with diabetes; 376 with hypertension; and five with other systemic comorbidities like asthma, jaundice, tuberculosis, and kidney stones. Since those with comorbidities are more vulnerable to contracting a serious case of Covid-19, 88 people or 2.78% were placed in high-risk category; 713 people or 22.51% were in the moderate category; and 2,366 people or 74.71% were in the low-risk category. On July 24, BMC’s public health department sanctioned Radical Health-tech to work with the civic body at jumbo facilities (HT has a copy of the sanction letter). Co-founder of Radical Health-tech, Rito Maitra said, “If you have diabetes or hypertension, blood vessels all over the body will show some sign or another. Changes are seen in hands, in legs, in the brain, in the eyes. They are subtle. However, in the eyes they can be noticed non-invasively. It is the only place in the body that allows this [through retinal imaging]. Reports are immediately given to patients and to the doctors of the facilities.” Radical Health-tech is also working with BMC to ensure patients follow up on their comorbidities after being discharged from Covid care centres (CCCs). Maitra said, “All people, but especially those from low-income groups, do not pro-actively do yearly check-ups. Many are not aware of the comorbidities. Many are not even aware of simple facts about human anatomy that we take for granted, for example, the function of the liver. So we are counselling these patients to help them understand what their comorbidities mean and continue treatment with BMC later.” BMC has also been working with the Covid-19 Data Science Consortium since May. The consortium is convened by Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a non-profit based in Mumbai which uses AI for social good and was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Mumbai in 2018. It includes volunteers from prestigious organisations like Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru, and Stanford University in the United States of America.Janak Shah, formerly with the office of the chief minister of Maharashtra and now associated with the Wadhwani group, said the institute is backed by international agencies like Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Google. “We are helping with future case prediction using machine learning and artificial intelligence, healthcare resource predictions, and human resource predictions,” said Shah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/artificial-intelligence-helps-mumbai-civic-body-detect-1-255-comorbid-patients/story-z9ips72D65wlrql7ZKklfL.html
26-07-2020||Mumbai||3 cops die of Covid-19 in Maharashtra in 24 hours; state police death toll touches 93||Three police personnel have died of Covid-19 in the past 24-hours in the state, taking the death toll of Maharashtra Police to 93. One of the three personnel who died was attached to Mumbai Police, which has now lost 53 of its personnel to Covid-19. Assistant inspector general of police (law and order) Vinayak Deshmukh on Saturday said that the other two personnel who died in the past 24 hours were from the constabulary in Thane and Satara police commissionerates. The three personnel were above 50 years of age. A total of 8,232 police personnel (7,371 constables and 861 officers) from across the state have contracted the virus until Saturday, of whom 6,314 have recovered, with many of them even reporting back to duty. Active cases in the state’s force stand at 1,825. Mumbai Police has the maximum cases (3,600) of Covid-19 in the state, followed by Thane Police which has 896 cases. The police said the department has taken multiple steps to prevent the spread of the virus in the force and has also allowed personnel aged above 55 years to stay at home to curtail the fatality rate. The police also recently decided to send all personnel deployed at containment zones for testing. Naval Bajaj, joint commissioner of police (administration), who is the designated nodal officer for Covid-19 management in Mumbai Police, said that personnel in the 45-55 age group will undergo rapid antigen testing. After their testing procedure is completed, personnel from the age groups below this will also undergo testing. A senior IPS officer had recently admitted that though the police department is taking all the possible measures to protect the lives of its personnel, it was helpless in cases of infected policemen aged above 55 years or those with comorbidities. An internal assessment report prepared by the Mumbai Police to understand the spread of Covid-19 among its personnel till July 1 has found that the fatality rate in the city police is 1.34%.  The fatality rate was the highest at 82% among those personnel aged above 50. The report found that police personnel between 31 and 40 years of age were affected the most. High blood pressure and diabetes were the most common ailments among comorbid personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/3-cops-die-of-covid-19-in-maharashtra-in-24-hours-state-police-death-toll-touches-93/story-NElaVMMYsBwTYRlBHuTmiK.html

26-07-2020||Chandigarh||Children of a lesser God: Donations dry up, orphanages struggle to stay afloat||BATTLING THE VIRUS Child care homes being run by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the region are facing a fund crunch due to a dip in donations during the Covid-19 pandemic. The orphanages get limited aid from the government and are seeking financial help to meet educational expenses of children. Many have not taken in new children in four months as they struggle to cope. The Supreme Court has also sought details from the Centre on funds for children homes. The government will file an affidavit in two weeks about funds made available to states and Union Territories to run child care institutions. Setback for children with special needs: Student strength reduced to half, teachers worried break in learning will stall progress  The Covid-19 pandemic has left child care homes run by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) high and dry. With no sign of the situation easing, donations are drying up and the number of children in such institutions is seeing a steady decline as all activities come to a standstill. NGOs are dependent on corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives of the local hosiery and cycle industries. With the economy slowing down, these institutions are not getting enough funds through CSR. Some homes have had to cut staff strength to save cost, while others are struggling to make ends meet. Neelam Sodhi, who runs NGO Ashirwad, an institute for children with cerebral palsy since 1999, says: “Donations are not flowing in. With schools closed, we are relying on one-on-one therapy. These are special children and even a small break in learning stalls their development and takes them back a year in their mental growth.” While the institute’s strength has fallen from 70 to 35 students in this academic session, Neelam had to reduce her staff to manage expenses. “Parents just stopped sending these children to school. We are relying on speech therapy and online classes,” she adds. Rajinder Kumar Sharma, the owner of Noble Foundation that runs 36 schools for slum-children across the state, says, “We have seen a decline in donations by half.” Before the lockdown, there were more than 5,000 students across his chain of schools but now there are 2,200. “Most children were wards of labourers who have gone back to their native places. They have not returned as train services are skeletal,” he says. “We are relying on online classes. Industrial groups who used to pay us under CSR have expressed their inability to do so this year. We owe Rs 34 lakh to our suppliers of books, stationery and uniforms. Times are tough,” says Sharma. Niranjan Kumar, the general secretary of Darpan, a centre for the autistic, says, “We had 75 children until last year but now the centre is closed and we haven’t got any donation this time.” - Aneesha Sareen Kumar No birthday celebration in four months  Covid-19 has robbed children at rescue homes of the simple joy of celebrating their birthday. Managements are in a tight spot as donations have stopped coming with visitors staying home. “We run this centre with the support of people. Now that no visitor is allowed due to social distancing, a few donors contribute to our bank account that is helping us buy food for 70 inmates in the 1 to 24 year age group. We pay shopkeepers in instalments,” says Satnam Singh, a trustee member of Unique Home, Jalandhar. “The children have not celebrated their birthdays in four months. Their annual trip to Manali was also called off,” he says. During the lockdown, the Centre received a new member in a one-and-a-half year old child from Gurdaspur. The Nari Niketan Trust is in a similar state. “With the entry of visitors banned since March, donations have declined. The common man has suffered loss, too,” says Navita Joshi, the CEO of the trust. She says 36 children, ranging from three months to 19 years, stay in the institution but are not allowed outside. Capt Jagdish of Pingla Ghar says donations have been hit as no one is allowed to meet the 350 inmates. Jatinder Mahal With no public dole, orphanage reaches out for funds  Home to 19 children up to the age of 15 years, Sri Anant Anath Ashram at Nathana village is the only NGO-managed child rescue and adoption centre of Bathinda district. Four months after the Covid-19 pandemic, it is battling financial challenges as public contribution has dried up. “Our monthly budget is about Rs 1 lakh, which includes expenditure on salaries of 14 staffers, food and electricity. Earlier, people contributed in cash and kind but visitors stopped coming since March. Young children need baby food daily. We are managing somehow,” says Krishan Kumar Bansal, the chairperson of the society that runs the orphanage. “Earlier, people would donate flour, pulses and ghee to commemorate a family occasion but after the pandemic all such activity has been suspended. As social remittances have stopped, a close family group is planning to pool in funds to keep the institute running,” he says. The 10-year-old institute also got aid regularly from a local corporate house. “We never had to ask anyone for support but now our teams are approaching people for funds,” he says. Residents of the nearby Ganga, Giddar and Poohla villages ensure milk supply of 20 litres a day for the orphanage. District child protection officer Ravneet Kaur said the children and staff have been screened for Covid-19. “The department has informed the state authorities through the deputy commissioner about the difficulties the orphanage is facing. We have yet to get any information,” she adds. - Vishal Joshi Dipping into savings to survive in Amritsar  In these tough times, NGOs in Amritsar are forced to dip into their savings to run child rescue homes. One of the oldest such institutions in Punjab, the Central Khalsa Orphanage is run by the Chief Khalsa Diwan (CKD), a 117-year-old organisation with multiple resources. But the pandemic has hit it in terms of donation. “Though donations have dropped drastically, we are dipping into our savings but ensuring children get the facilities they used to,” says CKD president Nirmal Singh, who has donated 51 quintals of wheat during this crisis. CKD member Bhag Singh Ankhi, who is in-charge of the orphanage, says, “We have 250 inmates and our average monthly expenditure is about Rs 15 lakh. The institution has closed new admissions till the situation improves.” The All India Pingalwara Charitable Society is also struggling to cope. Society president Inderjit Kaur says, “We relied on donations and would get about Rs 3 crore a month. We’ve got a negligible amount since the lockdown so we are using savings. We didn’t lay off staff or cut pay, but we appealed to them to donate from their salaries.” The society has, however, continued to get wheat and paddy from people of Amritsar and its adjoining districts. Surjit Singh ‘Need funds to clear education expenses’  For the first time in 106 years, the Yadavindra Puran Bal Niketan, an orphanage and adoption centre in Patiala, is seeking funds to take care of its 32 children. Orphanage chairperson Urmila Puri says, “There has been a 50-60% drop in donations in four months and we are forced to seek help for clearing the educational expenses of the children. Fortunately, we have adequate food stock.” Another NGO running the SOS Children’s Village in Rajpura has been operational since 1996 and houses 106 children at present. Its director Anup Singh says, “The donation has been reduced to 50%. Some of our permanent members have faced job losses and salary cuts, while businesses have been hit during the lockdown so there has been a decline in donations. Now that the school results have been declared, our children need to apply for higher education so we need cash donations to pay their fees.” Child protection officer Roopwant Kaur says efforts are on to help the orphanages. “We have fulfilled the requirements they put before us during the lockdown earlier,” she says. - Harmandeep Singh Shelter homes struggle to make ends meet in Haryana  Shelter homes run by NGOs in Haryana have seen a dip in donations over the past four months due to the Covid-19 pandemic and are stretched for resources. The management of Karnal’s MDD Bal Bhawan Anath Ashram needs about Rs 6 lakh a month for food, clothing, electricity, medical facilities and school fee of the 100 children it houses. In addition, it spends Rs 22,000 on monthly rent for the building and salaries of 30 staff members. “We get Rs 2,000 a month for each child from the government but that is not enough,” says PR Nath, the general secretary and a founder member. “These are uncertain times. People can donate only after meeting their own needs,” he says. 15 NEW INMATES DURING LOCKDOWN During the lockdown, 15 children joined the 100 inmates, including 49 girls. “Besides, we have 15 differently abled boys in a separate building. We don’t get anything from the government for them and they need two attendants round the clock”, he says. It’s a similar situation at Bal Ashram at Ladwa in Kurukshetra district that is home to 30 children. “The government released last year’s funds now. It pays Rs 2,000 per child per month. We used that amount to clear the dues. It’s becoming difficult to even buy ration,” says Shish Pal Mandhan, the ashram director. Baldev Raj Arya of Shradhanand Orphanage in Karnal says, “In such times, people with even two kids are facing problems and we have to take care of 110 children, including 65 girls.” The first two months of the lockdown were worse but donations are picking up gradually. “The government works according to its policies. We will face this situation and ensure the best for our children,” he adds. Neeraj Mohan Donations down by 80%, banking on hope in Himachal  Orphanages being run by NGOs in Himachal Pradesh are facing tough times with 80% of donations affected due to the pandemic. Naresh Thakur, the manager-cum-incharge of Titeli: Home for Children at Samula village near Palampur in Kangra district, says, “Though our orphanage is supported by a trust, we have not received any public donation since the lockdown began. Visitors are not allowed either.” No new child has been admitted or adopted at the centre in four months. The child care institution run by Global Hands for Rural Development was set up in 2016 and is home to 17 children.

He also said the temporary healthcare facilities being developed to deal with the ongoing health crisis would be converted into permanent facilities. Thackeray on Saturday launched two dedicated hospitals for treatment of Covid-19 at Dombivli, with a capacity of 210 beds, and at Kalyan, having a strength of 194 beds. He also inaugurated a Covid testing facility at Gauripada, Kalyan, where 3,000 tests can be conducted in a day, once it is functional. “It is necessary for us to remain vigilant until an effective medicine arrives in the market for Covid-19 treatment. We are not in a position to be negligent or careless,” the chief minister said at the launch. “We have developed temporary facilities for Covid-19 patients. However, in the coming days, those have to be converted in to permanent one. Defeating the virus is a big challenge before us, but together we can win this battle,” he added. Thackeray also stressed the fear among people about the pandemic needs to be removed by holding counselling sessions. Meanwhile, the state health department has issued an order to release ₹95 crore for the districts to continue relief work against the Covid-19 pandemic. The decision was taken by the state disaster management authority in its meeting held on July 15, states a government resolution issued on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dereliction-of-duty-will-cost-the-state-dear-in-its-fight-against-covid-19-says-maharashtra-cm/story-lnBTRpVVCdyNhXIT4XGJhM.html

Most of them are asymptomatic, while some have comorbidities and are identified as high-risk patients. The institute, under the non-governmental organisation Children Aid Society, houses 268 mentally challenged individuals upto 70 years of age and is funded by the state.Dr Jayesh Vasule, the only doctor at the rehabilitation and shelter facility, told HT that a few days ago, some of those staying at the home had shown Covid-19 symptoms, following which they were tested for the virus. Authorities of the facility suspect that the residents may have been infected from some of their staff. The staff of the facility and those of another child care institute at Mankhurd, which recently reported three cases of Covid-19, live in the same quarters. “Sixty individuals underwent testing. On Saturday, 29 tested positive, including four minors and two above the age of 50. Most of them are asymptomatic and we have isolated them within the home. It is, however, very difficult for us to ensure that the inmates follow social distancing norms and hygiene,” Dr Vasule said.The authorities at the facility are in talks with senior doctors of Sion hospital to shift the five high-risk patients, who have comorbidities, to a Covid facility. “The doctors have assured that the five patients will be shifted to the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC),” said Dr Vasule.Mansi Sawant, the principal and in-charge superintendent of the facility, said the situation is being taken care of and that there is no need to panic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/29-from-mumbai-s-mankhurd-facility-for-special-people-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-xuDhCNVfEGo4Xzl2coO9hJ.html

26-07-2020||City||Will those seeking lifting of lockdown take responsibility for deaths, asks Maharashtra CM||Justifying his decision to not hastily open up the restrictions to contain the spread of Covid-19, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray asked if those demanding lifting of the lockdown would take responsibility for the fatalities.Thackeray has been criticised for treading cautiously on lifting the curbs in Maharashtra. It is also said that Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar intervened to convince him to allow opening up of businesses and industry. In a clear indication that the lockdown could continue after July 31, Thackeray said the government would provide further relaxations in activities.In part one of the two-part interview to Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut for Sena mouthpiece Saamana, Thackeray said living with coronavirus is a tightrope walk that requires balancing the economy and health of the public. He also warned against lifting of lockdown at once, citing several countries have reimposed lockdowns after lifting them all at once. “There are several smart people speaking against the lockdown... Fine, we will open everything for you, but if, unfortunately, people die due to this, will you take the responsibility for it? There is no problem in opening up, but will they take responsibility? I am not using the word ‘lockdown’ now. I will not say that I am lifting the lockdown, but gradually restrictions are being lifted. And my attempt is that once an activity is opened, there should be no need to shut it again,” he said.“Just thinking about the economy too will not work. Those who are only concerned about the health situation, however grave it may be, too, will have to think a little about the economy. Living with the coronavirus is a tightrope walk,” Thackeray said.In the interview published in Saamana on Saturday, Thackeray spoke about various topics, including the first six months of his government, the role of Opposition leader, the government’s measures to tackle Covid-19, and his view on final-year examinations, among others.Saying that people were tired of sitting at home, Raut asked Thackeray when will vada pav, a popular snack in Mumbai, be available and when will the suburban train network resume for common man.“People may be bored [of the lockdown], but we can’t lift restrictions to give them a break from it. If we hastily unlock, and someone loses their life, then what is the use of livelihood? What will happen if this virus spreads in a factory? Then we must decide that no matter how many people succumb to this disease, we do not want a lockdown. Are you prepared for it? I am not. I am not [Donald] Trump, I can’t see my people suffer in front of my eyes… We will start [suburban] local trains and vada pav [stalls on the roads], but first, decide on one extreme. Families are falling ill and dying. Who will open the lockdown in that family,” he asked.Thackeray also remained measured in the success of containing the spread of Covid-19 in Dharavi, India’s largest slum, and in acknowledging the reducing numbers from Mumbai. “I am not going to speak about it. The danger has still not passed. If I appreciate the work now, complacency may creep in.” The ‘Dharavi model’ was praised by the World Health Organization (WHO).The chief minister also took potshots at former chief minister and leader of Opposition in the legislative Assembly Devendra Fadnavis. The former chief minister is touring the state to review the Covid-19 situation and criticising the government on its shortcomings. He also visited Delhi earlier this week. Thackeray said, “He [Fadnavis] must have gone to see the Covid-19 situation there, but he did not say anything about the situation there. He is going to Delhi because he has given Maharashtra’s fund to Delhi (Centre).”Thackeray said that Fadnavis might have “stomach ache” after an organisation ranked Thackeray as one of the best chief ministers in India. “He could have a stomach ache because without stepping out anywhere, one organisation ranked me as [one of the] best chief ministers in the country. This must be a cause of stomach cramps because corona has varied symptoms.”Thackeray dismissed the criticism that he has not gone to Mantralaya as much as he should have. He said that he is using technology to take stock of the situation in the state. “Mantralaya is shut now. The technology has advanced to such an extent... If one cannot use technology, then it is really unfortunate. I am meeting officials and public representatives. In one go, I am covering the entire state and taking decisions. If it is important to visit physically, you go to that place, but with video-conferencing, you can cover the state,” he said.The chief minister also remained firm on the state’s decision to not hold final-year examinations, while giving an option to appear for exams after the Covid crisis goes away. “We have taken a decision. I think now the Governor too has understood [it]. Nobody is against the idea of holding exams. I am in favour, but understand there is an option for students to accept the grades based on average of previous semesters or appear for exams. We do not know yet when these exams can be held,” he said.The Sena chief also dodged a question on Pawar’s comments on Ram Mandir being a priority over tackling Covid-19 for the Centre. The CM said this is not “Thackeray sarkar”, but “everybody’s sarkar, especially that of the people of the state, who have accepted this experiment.” “I am not bothered about the political challenges. People have faith in me,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-those-seeking-lifting-of-lockdown-take-responsibility-for-deaths-asks-maharashtra-cm/story-xzmm8Ae3U8gR43SYd7XV2L.html

26-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s Sector 33 residents peeved over dumping of rubble, overgrowth of wild grass||On the dividing road of sectors 32 and 33, an empty patch of land is cluttered with malba (construction debris or rubble) and overgrown with wild grass causing major inconvenience to residents.The patch has become a haven for reptiles and insects to thrive, claim the residents of Sector 33, adding that no action is being taken.Secretary of the Sector 33B resident welfare association (RWA) Kuljinder Sra said, “Mounds of malba are mounting and the officials are busy passing the buck. During monsoon, to prevent the spread of diseases it is important that this patch is cleaned. New officers should be appointed who are made accountable for any mishaps happening here.”President of the Sector 33A RWA Jagdish Singh Sarpal added that the situation was similar in other parts of the sector as well. “Dumping grounds have been made near the Landmark Hospital, Tender Heart School and the petrol pump here. We keep complaining to the authorities but no action is taken.”Saying that the malba problem had been created by the residents themselves, local area councillor Rajesh Kumar Gupta said, “We have got the patch cleared numerous times but people are now used to dumping the malba there. Wherever any construction or renovation is carried out in the sector, the malba is taken from the sites and brought to this patch by carts. Recently, two carts were even impounded.”Gupta added that the land belonged to the administration and getting the grass cut was their prerogative. “I have requested the UT administration officials many times to send a JCB here to lift the malba and cut the grass, but they don’t listen to us,” he said.Officials of the UT engineering wing said that they had cut the grass around three weeks back, but it had regrown due to the rain. “We will clear the overgrowth soon,” they said.SOUTHERN SECTORS NO DIFFERENTSector 33 is not the only place in the city where an empty, neglected patch of land has been covered with wild grass and is being used for dumping malba. President of the Sectors 38 (A and B) RWA Joginder Singh said the situation was similar in Sector 38. “There are entire patches of land parallel to Dakshin Marg that are lying neglected and have thick overgrowth. They need to be cleared immediately,” he said.General secretary of the Sector 40C RWA SK Khosla added that in Sector 40 as well, malba was being dumped in empty patches. “Due to monsoon, the spots are filled with long and wild grass. The administration needs to clear the malba here and cut the grass.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-sector-33-residents-peeved-over-dumping-of-rubble-overgrowth-of-wild-grass/story-nKIqX3FN1rNnrzHmHZIv8K.html

26-07-2020||Chandigarh||PU devises promising method for forensic analysis of wood||A research carried out at the Institute of Forensic Science and Criminology, Panjab University, has revealed a new method which can be used for the forensic analysis of wood and trace it to its origin.The method can be useful in forensic work of crime scenes and creation of a database of wood to prevent its smuggling.The research, which has been published in ‘Vibrational Spectroscopy’ by Elsevier journal on June 27, has been carried out by PU assistant professor Dr Vishal Sharma in collaboration with the Department of Wood Science, Mendel University, Czech Republic.During the study, various hardwood and softwood samples were collected and analysed using infrared spectroscopy. The research was further validated by analysing unknown wood samples to predict their source/origin using the same technique.Stating the applications of the method, Dr Sharma said, “In the type of crimes where wooden objects are pieces of trace evidence or weapons used to commit them, the wood fragments get attached to the perpetrators or victims. These fragments can often be identified and linked to standards from crime scenes using this method.”Even the smuggling of wood can be prevented using infrared lasers for onsite crime scene analysis and this method can also be used in establishing the area of origin of the wood species, he said.The PU faculty is planning to contact the Union environment, forest and climate change ministry about the exploration of further research in this area.Dr Sharma said this method gives better and more accurate results on wood analysis than all the other techniques and the results are readily acceptable for criminal proceedings in the court of law. “Above all it is a non-destructive method. It can be used to create the database of wood samples of any country for future reference and matching,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pu-devises-promising-method-for-forensic-analysis-of-wood/story-b4YFB6oaFiaDsZOB4yxdSJ.html
26-07-2020||City||Very rare species of mangroves rediscovered after 63 years: Report||A mangrove species, believed to be extinct from city forests, has been documented across Gorai and Charkop mangroves after 63 years. The last documentation of this ‘very rare’ species - lumnitzera racemosa - was in 1957 from Mumbai, according to the mangrove cell. The details were revealed in a report ‘Status of Mumbai’s Mangrove’s, prepared and submitted to the state mangrove cell, by Suchandra Dutta from the department of botany, RD and SH National College, Bandra.“We found less than 10 shrubs of the Lumnitzera racemosa towards the northwestern suburbs of Mumbai,” said Dutta, principal investigator of the project.The cell also released location-wise sapling plantation data for the Konkan coast from 2015 to 2020 with survival rate ranging from 75% to 80%. The mangrove plantations were done over 1,480 hectares (ha) along the west coast including Mumbai at a cost of ₹40.36 crore over five years. “With 20 lakh saplings in our nursery, post-monsoon plantations over 200 ha has been planned this year,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell).The reports were shared ahead of the international day for mangrove ecosystem conservation on Sunday.Researchers from National College identified 13 species and 37 mangroves associates from Mumbai while studying 260 plant species belonging to 231 genera and 92 families across 17 locations.Mumbai has 6,600 ha mangrove cover, about 90% of which are dominated by one species, Avicennia Marina or the grey mangrove - a fruiting plant with dark green leaves. The remaining 10% is dominated by other species such as Acanthus ilicifolius, Ceriops tagal, Bruguiera cylindrica, and Aegiceras corniculatum. However, species such as Kandelia candel, Sonneratia caseolaris and Avicennia alba that were documented from Mumbai between 1905-1957 have gone missing. Lumnitzera racemosa was one of them until the latest rediscovery. Though it is common across Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts, it was identified from Bandra and Thane by late Dr Arvind Untawale from National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) in 1957. N Vasudevan, former mangrove cell chief, said, “This is an important find as this is a locally threatened species and brings to the fore the unique biodiversity of Mumbai’s mangroves.”Growing urbanisation and demand for development in the space-starved city had made mangrove forests a target for developers altering their ecosystem, the report said. “Dumping of construction waste, sewage discharge and encroachment are some of the issues behind the depleting cover,” said Dutta. “Mangroves across Bandra, Gorai, Dahisar, Lokhandwala and Mira Bhayander are facing these issues leading to ecosystem changes.”The study also identified the differentiating characteristics among four species of Avicennia, and documented a fifth member (new taxa) as Avicennia marina forma pumila near Tarzan Lake, Charkop. “Distinguishing factors showed this was a dwarf tree having different leaf shape, apex, and fruit,” said Dutta. She is now working on a study to check whether Salavadora alii (a mangrove species discovered in 2016) is present in Mumbai.The National College report recommended mangrove tourism (as developed along the Thane flamingo sanctuary) be replicated across Bandra, Gorai, Mira Road, Virar, and biodiversity-rich water bodies at Nerul (Talawe wetlands), Charkop (Tarzan lake) and Lokhandwala lake. “Apart from establishing a mangrove information centre, locals can act as tourist guides, which help develop awareness and reduce further anthropogenic disturbances,” said Dutta.Tiwari said all recommendations would be considered. “The small grants program by our Mangrove Foundation is being given for similar research with unique findings to help strengthen mangrove and marine ecosystem conservation efforts,” he said.MMR gets first marine animal treatment centreEquipped with two 1000 litre tanks and five 500 litre tanks, an operation table, medicines, equipment and visiting veterinarians, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) will get its first marine animal transit cum treatment centre on Sunday at the Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Centre at Airoli, Navi Mumbai. The treatment centre will be catering to cases of cetaceans and sea turtle strandings, injuries, post-mortems, and rescues. Before this, a treatment centre was located only in Dahanu. In 2018, the forest department along with various non-profit groups began a marine respondent network to coordinate a fast response to marine animal treatment cases but a designated centre was not present.Why it matters- Between June and July, 45 sea turtles have been rescued from various beaches along Konkan coast including 40 Olive Ridley, 3 Hawksbill and two Green sea turtles. In all, five died due to injuries.- In 2019, 10 Olive Ridley turtles and a Hawksbill turtle were stranded along the Mumbai coast. Three of the 11 turtles were treated and released back to sea while remaining succumbed to injuries and infections.- Apart from sea turtles, cetacean strandings in 2019-20 around Mumbai include two baleen whales, an Indian Ocean humpback dolphin and a striped dolphin (all these were dead strandings).(Source: State Mangrove Cell)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/very-rare-species-of-mangroves-rediscovered-after-63-years-report/story-D1ujM1QMVZ7RGaNhdFAO0O.html

John Buttar is under treatment and would be arrested after his recovery.TENANT VERIFICATION WAS NOT DONEAs per the police, the accused had rented a flat in Aman Homes through a broker. Though the rent agreement was entered, the broker failed to get the mandatory police verification of the tenants done. The flat is owned by Harcharan Singh, who is unwell, so the broker was handling all the rent dealings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kharar-shoot-out-gangsters-sent-to-5-day-police-remand/story-J5rAJ5nqUJPyEO8GLlmQJL.html
26-07-2020||Chandigarh||First heart transplant of 2020 conducted at PGIMER, Chandigarh||The Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) performed the first transplant of the year on Saturday by harvesting the organ from a 10-year-old brain dead girl from Kharar, Mohali.The heart from the donor, whose identity has been kept confidential on the request of the parents, gave a second lease of life to three people with the donation of the kidneys as well.The 10-year-old had had a fatal fall on July 14 at her home. After an initial treatment at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, she was shifted to PGIMER on the same day.This is the sixth heart transplant conducted at PGIMER to date. Among the previous transplants, only one person had died before being discharged from the hospital, and two people had survived for three years and three months respectively; two of them are still alive.The first heart transplant at the institute was conducted in August 2013.Kidneys from another 11-year-old donor were also transplanted to save two other lives on July 22. Donor’s father Amandeep of Chikha village in Rupnagar displayed the rare courage of organ donation of his deceased son who was admitted at PGIMER on July 16 with intracranial bleeding. His condition kept worsening and finally Amandeep was declared brain dead.CHALLENGING IN THE TIME OF COVIDProfessor Jagat Ram, director of PGIMER, describing the challenges amid the pandemic, said, “With the numbers consistently surging, PGIMER is overwhelmed with Covid positive patients. So, introducing those waiting to receive an organ to this environment as well as conducting transplants is ridden with multiple challenges. The credit goes to each and every member of the team whose untiring efforts helped save five lives with the two latest organ donations.”Professor Ashish Sharma, head of the Department of Renal Transplant Surgery, who led four kidney transplants back to back, said, “Special precautions were taken to proceed with the transplants. The deceased donor, as well as both recipients, were tested and confirmed to be negative for Covid-19. Fortunately, all four kidneys have started to function well. The recipients had been on dialysis for more than three years.”Professor Vipin Koushal, nodal officer, Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation, said, “The act of organ donation during these difficult times shows magnanimity on part of the donor families who agreed to donate despite suffering a loss of their young children, both being less than 12 years old. It’s an extremely tough call but ‘spirit of giving’ overcomes all obstacles.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/first-heart-transplant-of-2020-conducted-at-pgimer-chandigarh/story-pRT6lTIuNfAAvQZRIBXgjN.html
26-07-2020||Mumbai||Need advisory on swearing-in process, Governor writes to RS chairman, LS Speaker||Days after a controversy erupted over the slogans raised by Bharatiya Janata Party parliamentarian Udayanraje Bhonsle in Rajya Sabha (RS), Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Saturday wrote a letter to vice-president and RS chairman M Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha (LS) Speaker Om Birla, urging them to issue an advisory that will help to “preserve the sanctity and dignity” of the swearing-in process of elected representatives. “Adding names of party leaders or any other person, to whom members owe their faith or allegiance, to the format of the oath-taking violates the sanctity of oath-taking process”, wrote Koshyari in his letter.“Observing that some of the newly-elected members of Parliament and legislatures are departing from the prescribed form of language for oath-taking and adding the names of their party leaders or venerable personalities while reading oaths, the Governor today urged vice-president M Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to come up with an advisory to be adhered to in the context of the form and oath being read out by members,” read a statement released by Raj Bhavan on Saturday. Earlier this week, Bhonsle, after taking his oath in the RS, chanted the “Jai Bhavani, Jai Shivaji” slogan, to which Naidu had expressed his disapproval. Naidu’s disapproval over the slogans drew criticism from Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders, who said that the vice-president had insulted Chhatrapati Shivaji. However, Bhonsle downplayed the incident and clarified that the Rajya Sabha chairman had not insulted the Maratha warrior king. Naidu, too, reacted to the controversy and said that he had only reminded the members of the upper House about the conventional practice and meant no disrespect to anyone.In his letter, the Governor also mentioned the December 30 incident where he had to intervene and direct Congress legislators KC Padvi and Varsha Gaikwad, who were being sworn-in as ministers of the Maharashtra cabinet, to repeat their oath strictly as per the prescribed format without any addition or deletion.Padvi, now the tribal development minister, had added a few lines of gratitude to his voters after reading out the written oath text, while Gaikwad, who is the school education minister, had invoked Dr BR Ambedkar’s name while taking her oath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/need-advisory-on-swearing-in-process-governor-writes-to-rs-chairman-ls-speaker/story-FiicPk3JHoTk5Fvvg8LiiJ.html

26-07-2020||Mumbai||4 of gang arrested for making fake e-passes||Officers from crime branch’s unit 3 on Friday busted a gang and arrested its four members for making fake e-passes and medical certificates to travel within the state from Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) during the lockdown. According to the police, the accused would charge ₹3,000 for a fake pass or medical certificate, which is mandatory for every citizen for travel to another other city or state during the lockdown. The accused have been identified as Sindhudurg resident Abdul Karim Mohammad Shaikh alias Aslam, 35; Girgaum residents Samir Shamsuddin Shaikh, 36; and Noor Mohammad Abdul Gani Shaikh, 39; and Vasai resident Vinay Mohan Pate, 36. Shaikh, Samir and Noor run a travel company in Mumbai, while Pate runs a computer class in Vasai. The police received a tip-off about a gang which had been duping citizens who had to travel to other districts in the state from MMR. During inquiry, the police discovered that the accused were operational from Malvan and would send the e-passes from there to citizens on WhatsApp or email. The numbers of their mobile phones were registered on Delhi addresses. “Based on the tip-off, an officer approached Shaikh posing as a customer and asked for a police e-pass to travel to Satara from Mumbai. The documents were sent on WhatsApp,” said senior inspector Ashok Khot of unit 3. After receiving the pass, a police team visited Malvan and arrested the Shaikh Samir and Noor from there, while Pate was arrested from his home in Vasai. The police also seized the laptop, mobile phones and several fake e-passes from the accused. “It appears that someone in authority may have also helped the gang. We are probing further,” said police inspector Nitin Patil. The four were produced in a local court and remanded in police custody till Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/4-of-gang-arrested-for-making-fake-e-passes/story-dwh7lzdUfUxjMPZ9zvM37N.html
26-07-2020||City||4 held for shouting slogans outside activist’s house, released on bail||Four men, including a journalist who runs a news web portal, were arrested on Saturday morning, for allegedly shouting ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans outside the house of RTI activist Saket Gokhale on Friday evening. The Thane court released them on a personal bond. Saket Gokhale had on Thursday tweeted about the alleged handling of the social media campaigns of the chief electoral office of Maharashtra by a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader. He had also filed a petition in the Allahabad high court to halt the bhoomi pujan for Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, on the grounds that it was in violation of the Centre’s protocol. The court dismissed his petition on Friday. Gokhale on Friday alleged that Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) members shouted slogans outside his house in Kashimira, Mira Road, and threatened his family members. He also alleged that RSS members were giving him death threats over the phone. The state government then provided protection to the activist and announced a probe into the incident. The accused arrested – Ranveer Jaiprakash Vajpaye, 33, Mira Road resident; Vishal Jagannath Patil, 35; Bhayander resident, Harshal Raghunath Davane, 28, Kashigaon resident; and Kashimira resident Roshan Baliram Ghare, 28 – were booked under sections 143 (a) (unlawful assembly), 188 (disobedience), 269, 270 (spread of infection) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

26-07-2020||City||Covid pandemic in Ludhiana: Spike of 1,000 cases in 17 days reinforces need for masks, social distancing||While Ludhiana recorded 200 Covid-19 cases on June 1, over two months after the first case was reported on March 24, the district has seen the cases steadily rise through June and July, already crossing the 2,400 mark.From 1,000 cases in a month (between June 1 and July 5), the cases doubled to 2,000 in just 17 days on July 22.Even thereon, there has been no let-up in cases, with the district witnessing 100 new cases every single day, reaching 2,439 on Saturday. This has once again reinforced the significance of complying with Covid-19 protocols, such as social distancing, wearing masks in public and frequently sanitising or washing hands.“The surge in cases is largely because the public, especially the young and the middle-age group, have ignored government guidelines on social distancing and wearing masks. Public places are teeming with people, with residents even throwing parties,” said Dr Bishav Mohan, a senior cardiologist and member of the COVID-19 task force of the Punjab government.He said which way the graph goes in the near future depended on public’s abidance to the Covid-19 protocols.Dr Mohan also emphasised the need for early testing and treatment to contain the spread of virus, as with the onset of monsoon, dengue cases may also rise and increase the load on the district’s health infrastructure. He urged residents to make wearing a face mask a part of their lifestyle and avoid attending social gatherings to break the chain of infection.Dr Milan Verma, who is supervising the Covid-19 unit at the civil hospital, said, “August will be crucial in containing the virus. Cases began to rise in June as the borders were reopened and residents returned to their routine. Naturally, majority of the patients are from the working age group, as they started venturing out to make a living.” He said majority of the 50 patients, who have so far succumbed to the virus, had comorbidities, such as tuberculosis (TB), diabetes and hypertension, adding that residents with these ailments needed to exercise extra caution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-pandemic-in-ludhiana-spike-of-1-000-cases-in-17-days-reinforces-need-for-masks-social-distancing/story-bdoJCeVBZB6zWWfJKgKv0L.html
26-07-2020||City||Thane hospital loses Covid unit status for overcharging||In a first, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has cancelled the registration of a hospital, Horizon Prime Hospital, for a month and its recognition as a Covid hospital for allegedly charging 56 Covid patients an additional ₹6 lakh. The civic body has stationed a team of two doctors at the hospital around-the-clock to ensure the admitted patients receive proper treatment. The hospital authorities termed the action “unfair”, saying a clarification has been sent to the civic body.The hospital was recognised as a Covid facility on April 2. Last week, TMC chief Dr Vipin Sharma set up an audit committee to check the bills imposed by private hospitals on Covid patients. The committee found 196 patients across the city were overcharged and have sent notices to 15 private Covid hospitals.Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner, said, “We had received complaints from several patients that this hospital overcharged them. Accordingly, our audit committee set up to look into the bills generated by all Covid Hospitals in the city checked the bills imposed by the hospital. A total of 797 patients were treated at this hospital until July 12. Of the 57 bills submitted by the hospital for the audit, 56 were found to be exorbitant. An excess of ₹6,08,900 was charged in these 56 bills.”The committee issued a notice to the hospital on July 20 to give a clarification in two days. Malvi said, “The hospital did not send any clarification, which suggests they have cheated the patients.”Dr Raju Murudkar, medical health officer of TMC, said: “The hospital has proved to be inefficient to give medical treatment to common Thane residents. It will be no longer recognised as a Covid hospital and we have cancelled their registration for one month.”The hospital has been given a period of 30 days to appeal against the directives before the Thane civic commissioner.Dr Hrishikesh Vaidya, medical director of Horizon Prime Hospital, said, “We have given the clarification on the reason for excessive bills to TMC on Friday, a day before they issued these directives, so it is possible they haven’t read the explanation. We will meet the officials and resolve the issue.”He added the charges on all patients were imposed as per the government rule. Vaidya said, “We have given discounts to 50 patients under the Mahatma Phule Jan Arogya Scheme and to over 50 cops under the police schemes. There are many patients who are critical and need extra care for which additional charges might have been imposed and we have clarified that. Moreover, there are sanitisation charges, as the rate of biowaste management has increased three times. We are not a charitable hospital and need money to manage expenses.”He said the hospital was the first private Covid hospital in Thane and had treated over 1,000 patients successfully.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-hospital-loses-covid-unit-status-for-overcharging/story-fieoKgi0p52GnbTtnHlvGO.html

26-07-2020||Patna||Flood waters causing damage to heritage structures in Bihar||The flood fury, an annual menace in Bihar during monsoon, has marooned over half a dozen monuments, heritage sites and ancient temples in the northern parts of the state amid growing concern over the loss of these historic structures due to persistent damage and decay. Some of the flood-affected structures include the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and Union Ministry of Culture protected sites such as the Ashokan Pillar at Lauria in West Champaran district; the Buddhist stupa at Kesaria in East Champaran district and the remains of the fort of the ancient ruler Raja Bali at Balirajgarh in Madhubani district. Religious places of interest such as Punaura Dhaam temple, the widely-regarded birthplace of Goddess Sita in Sitamarhi district; Haleshwarsthan, an ancient Lord Shiva shrine in Sitamarhi believed to have been built by mythological King Janak, who was the ruler of the ancient kingdom of Janakpur and the father of Goddess Sita as depicted in the epic Ramayana; and the ancient Bodhaayan temple in Sitamarhi district have also been affected by the flood. The Kesaria Stupa and the Ashokan Pillar are surrounded by water, while the floodwater could enter the Punaura Dhaam temple’s main shrine anytime. The temple campus of Haleshwarsthan has turned into a veritable water pool. “We may lose these monuments and heritage sites for good, if the flood fury persists every year. Prolonged waterlogging and seepage will damage these ancient structures. Many historical remains are in danger of getting washed away,” said CP Sinha, former director of KP Jayaswal Research Institute, a Patna-based institution that works in the field of history and archaeology. “If we lose these ancient structures, then the country will lose its historical evidence,” he added. Local residents have also expressed a similar apprehension. “Little effort is being made to protect these historical monuments from the annual flood fury. The Ashokan Pillar and Kesaria Stupa get inundated by floodwater every year. To make matters worse, even the recently excavated site near the Kesaria Stupa has been flooded,” said Mukhia Chaudhary, a local resident. Ramashankar Shastri from Sitamarhi district said Punaura Dhaam gets submerged by floodwater every year. “Sitamarhi has become a flood-prone district. The authorities need to make adequate arrangements to preserve the ancient historical sites,” he said, HS Naik, superintending archaeologist, ASI, Patna circle, said plans are afoot to preserve these ancient monuments and historical sites. “We will send our engineer to assess the extent of the damage at the Ashokan Pillar and the Kesaria Stupa after the floodwater recedes. Strategies are being worked out to preserve the ancient monuments and sites,” he said. “A wall can be erected around the Ashokan Pillar to protect it from the floodwater. While some other strategy needs to be adopted to preserve the Kesaria Stupa,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/flood-waters-causing-damage-to-heritage-structures-in-bihar/story-VgjL5MqsAfTFx5NXELbX2I.html

Police said the pit was dug up for an ongoing construction work in the area. Police are yet to verify which agency was involved. Quoting eyewitnesses, a police officer said the man drowned while trying to save two children who were playing in rainwater near the pit. Police identified the dead teenager as Mohammad Aamir,18, a resident of Khadda colony near Jasola Vihar. His father is a tailor.According to the police, around 4.30pm Wednesday they received a call reporting that a man has drowned in a pit dug up in Jasola. A police team reached the spot and pulled out the body with the help of fire personnel and local residents. The body was sent for a post-mortem examination and was later handed over to Aamir’s family, police said.“During preliminary probe, witnesses said the streets in Jasola were waterlogged after the rain on Wednesday. Two boys who were accompanying Aamir had fallen into the pit. Aamir fell into the pit while trying to rescue the two kids. Though he safely pulled the two children out, he drowned,” said the officer.Deputy commissioner of police (south east) RP Meena said police have registered a case under section 304A (causing death due to negligence) of the Indian Penal Code. Meena said police are probing whose negligence led to the death. This is the third rain-related death in Delhi in the past one week. On July 19, a 56-year-old man had drowned in the waterlogged Minto Road underpass near Connaught Place. The same day, a 28-year-old man died after falling in a waterlogged street in Amar Colony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-drowns-in-waterlogged-pit-in-jasola/story-nN6ykZD6U4pCCNPoayWkCM.html
26-07-2020||Noida||National consumer commission dismisses complaint against Noida builder||The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) on Friday dismissed the complaint of a homebuyer against a Noida developer as the total value of the suit, including the interest amount, did not exceed Rs 1 crore. Dismissing the complaint, the NCDRC—which only hears cases with value exceeding above Rs 1 crore— stated the flat buyer had demanded excess compensation without any legal basis and directed the complainant to approach the Uttar Pradesh commission instead. The complainant had booked a flat in a Noida housing project on August 7, 2011. The total cost of the flat was Rs 55.97 lakh, and the complainant said she had paid Rs 48.08 lakh to the developer till the filing of the complaint. She had alleged in her complaint that the possession of the flat was not been to her by the builder.Her counsel had pleaded that the national commission should direct the builder to hand over the possession of the flat and pay interest at the rate of 24% per annum on the deposited sum of Rs 48.08 lakh.In her plea, she claimed the interest amount would be around Rs 78 lakh and the total consideration amount would exceed Rs 1 crore.The counsel stated that the complaint was earlier filed before the Delhi state commission and the same was returned on the ground of territorial jurisdiction. Satisfying the territorial jurisdiction, the complaint was then filed before the Uttar Pradesh state commission in 2018. The UP state commission returned the complaint on the ground of pecuniary jurisdiction—referred to the jurisdiction of a court over a suit based on the value of its subject matter—as they only hear cases where the value of compensation is below Rs 1 crore, following which the complaint was filed with the NCDRC.The NCDRC on Friday observed that the main prayer in the complaint was for possession of the flat. In such a case the compensation is calculated from the date of scheduled possession ( which was May 2015 in the case) and not from the date of booking.The commission stated demand for a higher interest would be an exaggerated and inflated claim without any legal basis and cannot be taken into consideration for the purpose of determining the pecuniary jurisdiction.If compensation in the form of interest at the rate of 18% per annum is awarded, it will cover the losses of all kinds, including the financial loss and distress and mental agony caused to the flat buyer, since the financial loss would not be more than 10-11% per annum, considering the rates of interest prevailing during the relevant period, the commission observed.“The NCDRC on Friday stated the consumer complaint is not maintainable before it for want of pecuniary jurisdiction and therefore the complaint is dismissed,” advocate Aditya Bhati, who is also the representative of district consumer forum advocates association, said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/national-consumer-commission-dismisses-complaint-against-noida-builder/story-5FD5aJKIvHatrRvH2IbTGM.html
26-07-2020||Delhi||Bhalswa landfill 12 metres shorter, claims North Delhi Municipal Corporation||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Saturday said the height of the Bhalswa landfill, located near the GT Karnal Road, has reduced by 12 metres over the last eight months. According to officials of the north civic body, the height of the garbage pile was reduced with the help of trommel screening machines deployed at the landfill site, to treat the waste. On Thursday, east Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir had said the east civic body had reduced the height of the Ghazipur landfill by 40 feet, by treating legacy waste. In 2019, the landfill had touched a height of 65 metres. Bhalswa is the second biggest dump yard in the national capital, after the Ghazipur landfill. However, on Friday, the AAP said the BJP MP was “lying”, claiming there was a significant increase in the width of the landfill. The AAP, in a statement, said it’s party’s MLA from Kondli Kuldeep Kumar on Friday inspected the Ghazipur landfill site to check the authenticity of the BJP’s claim about reducing the height of the landfill.Apart from its adverse impacts to the ecology of the national capital, the Ghazipur landfill has also proved fatal in the recent past. In September 2017, two persons had died when a portion of the Ghazipur landfill collapsed. Pradeep Bansal, chief engineer, north corporation, said the civic body had in September 2019 decided to use trommel machine-cum-ballistic separators to segregate solid-waste and inert materials at the Bhalswa landfill site. The first mechanical screening machines started segregation of waste at the Bhalswa landfill site on October 6, 2019. The height of the waste dumped at the site was then 65 metres.  “Till Friday, we have segregated 5.6 lakh tonnes of waste and reduced the height of the landfill site by 12 metres. Currently, 15 trommel machines are functional at the landfill site and are lifting and separating 4,500 metric tonnes of legacy waste per day. Two more trommel machines will be pressed into service from Monday. Our capacity per day to segregate waste will further increase to 5,500 metric tonnes,” Bansal said. He said the corporation’s target is to flatten the landfill site in a few years. The Bhalswa landfill site is an open dumping ground created in 1984, and currently spread over 70 acres. It reached a saturation point in 2006, but still receives about 2,100 metric tonnes of mixed waste every day. Bansal said waste is taken from the top of the landfill and put into trommel machines. These machines segregate the waste in three parts — waste usable as RDF, C&D waste and inert soil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhalswa-landfill-12-metres-shorter-claims-north-delhi-municipal-corporation/story-D6vN5IpTAzEglB25uxhraO.html
26-07-2020||Delhi||CAA stir: Sharjeel accused of sedition, cops file charge sheet||The Delhi Police on Saturday charged former Jawaharlal Nehru University student Sharjeel Imam with sedition in a case related to communal riots in north-east Delhi in February following anti-Citizen Amendment Act (CAA) protests.An officer from the Delhi police’s crime branch said the police submitted a charge-sheet against Imam in the Patiala House court on Saturday in the case registered against him on January 25. The police have said that Imam had given a seditious speech at AMU in January. Besides sections of the stringent sections of stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the police have invoked section 124-A (Sedition), 153(A) (Promoting enmity), 153-A (promoting enmity, hatred between different communities), 153-B (Assertion prejudicial to national integration) and 505 (spreading rumors) of IPC in the charge-sheet. “In the garb of protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA), he (Imam) exhorted people of a particular community to block the highways leading to the major cities and resort to ‘chakka jaam’, thereby disrupting normal life. Also, in the name of opposing CAA he also openly threatened to cut off Assam and other Northeastern states from the rest of the country,” the officer said. Imam’s lawyer Ahmad Ibrahim denied the allegations and said he has faith in the judicial system. He said they are sad Imam has been incarcerated for six months without any offence, especially when he has been found coronavirus positive. “We will soon move a bail application in the concerned court. It is a planned way of keeping him in prison as today six months were getting over had the police not filed the charge-sheet, he could have been released on bail by default,” Ibrahim said.Imam was arrested from Bihar’s Jehanabad on January 28. On April 18, police had filed the first charge-sheet against Imam in connection with the violence outside the Jamia Millia Islamia campus, during which protesters had clashed with the police. In the first chargesheet, police had accused Imam of allegedly instigating riots at the campus during a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens. The court is likely to take up the matter for hearing on July 27.Imam is currently lodged in Guwahati Jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sharjeel-imam-charged-with-sedition/story-1Gr28V5f8bXg3LK2QBzZ9I.html
26-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots: Shahrukh Pathan claims threat to life in jail||Shahrukh Pathan, who was caught on tape pointing a gun at a policeman during the riots in north-east Delhi in February, moved a city court on Saturday claiming threat to his life inside Tihar jail. The 23-year-old’s photograph, which showed him with a gun on the streets of Jafrabad-Maujpur road in north-east Delhi, had gone viral. Pathan on Saturday also sought court’s help in issuing directions to Tihar jail authorities to continue his incarceration in the high-risk prisoners’ cell. Inside the prison, a high-risk cell is guarded round-the-clock by armed guards, and inmates lodged in this cell are not mixed with other prisoners. Pathan, who was arrested on March 3, said in his plea that he has been informed by the jail authorities that he would be transferred from high-risk prisoners’ jail to another cell for general inmates/prisoners. The plea stated that the Pathan wants “to continue in the high-risk prisoners’ cell as there is a threat to his life and there is apprehension that any untoward can take place at any point of time if he is shifted with general prisoners”. The plea will be heard on July 29. On May 1, the Delhi Police filed a 350-page charge-sheet against Pathan and two others -- Kaleem Ahmad and Ishtiyak Mallik -- in connection with the case. Also on Saturday, another city court granted one more month to Delhi police to complete probe in a case against the president of Alumni Association of Jamia Millia Islamia, Shifa-Ur-Rehman who was arrested under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in connection with the riots. The police told the court that Shifa-Ur-Rehman, being the president of AAJMI, collected funds from suspicious and unaccounted sources. Rehman, also a member of Jamia Coordination Committee, was booked for alleged involvement in the riots and was arrested by the Special Cell of the Delhi Police in April. Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana on Friday allowed the special cell to complete its probe by August 24, after the agency sought more time claiming that the case was related to a “deep-rooted and large scale conspiracy behind the riot incidents” and that its searches in other states were being hindered due to the coronavirus lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-riots-shahrukh-pathan-claims-threat-to-life-in-jail/story-DZh4L8sDVDsdWo5fpFz1SO.html
26-07-2020||Delhi||Kejriwal, Jain inaugurate 450-bed Covid centre in Burari govt hospital||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal inaugurated a 450-bed Covid-19 centre in a government hospital in Burari on Saturday. “I am very happy to be inaugurating Burari Hospital today. I could not be there due to Covid and various other arrangements. I visited the hospital a few days back to inspect all arrangements that were being made in the hospital. The opening of this hospital will add 450 more beds to the health infrastructure in Delhi. The two crore people of Delhi along with the central and the state government have attained victory over Corona, but it would not be correct to say that the fight is over,” said Kejriwal in a video address. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain, who resumed work on Monday after recovering from Covid-19, was present at the hospital for the inauguration. The government had decided to open the Burari hospital in May when the number of Covid-19 cases had started going up, with Delhi recording over 1,000 cases a day towards the end of the month. The number of cases in Delhi have now started coming down with about 1,000 cases being reported each day from a peak of almost 4,000 cases recorded in third week of June. Only 3,135 hospital beds in the Capital were occupied as on Saturday, against 15,475 available beds. So far, 129,531 people have been infected and 3,806 have died of Covid-19 in Delhi, according to Delhi government’s daily health bulletin. The Burari facility was designed to be a 768-bed tertiary care hospital, which has been under construction since the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s first full term in 2015. The government also plans to open up another 200-bed Covid facility in its under-construction hospital in Ambedkar Nagar. The three new hospitals that the Delhi government is constructing in Burari, Ambedkar Nagar, and Dwarka will add over 2,500 beds to the existing 11,770 beds in Delhi government-run hospitals. “The Delhi government is setting up a new world-class hospital having 700 beds. We are currently providing 450 beds for the treatment of corona patients in view of the prevailing situation. Oxygen facility has been installed on every third bed in this hospital. Besides this, oxygen will be supplied from the cylinder on 125 additional beds,” said Kejriwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/450-bed-covid-facility-inaugurated-in-upcoming-hospital-in-burari/story-DVFVM24eyw7y3C9Ds2pVJO.html
26-07-2020||Delhi||With limited public transit, cycling picks up speed in Delhi, finds study||Nearly two-and-a-half months after Delhi started relaxing the lockdown norms put in place to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, roads of the national capital have started seeing a surge in the number of cyclists, a study has found. The initial finding of the ongoing study by five researchers—all alumni of IIT-Delhi and IIT-Roorkee—shows that on at least 22 of the 56 stretches monitored, the number of cyclists has increased by 4% to 12%. The reason for the increase vary from limited public transport options to a preference for contactless modes of travel to keep the Covid-19 infection at bay, says the draft report.P Shridhar, the road safety engineer heading the project, said the stretches were studied to find how commuting patterns and traffic volume have changed after the city came out of lockdown, imposed on March 25. The restrictions were eased gradually from the second week of May with public transport resuming in the capital on May 20.“Our study is focusing on commuting patterns since May 18, when the city started unlocking its economy. While the volume of private vehicles has increased, we also observed that the volume of cycles on arterial roads has gone up,” said Shridhar, who is also a consultant for the governments of Karnataka, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu to make commuter friendly public spaces. He said, “Apart from seeing these cyclists as just numbers, we also did a detailed survey to ascertain if they were new cyclists, and if so, why had they made the switch and what kind of infrastructure problems do they face during their commute.” On 22 stretches, the study found that the increase in the number of cyclists was in the range of 4% to 12%. The 22 stretches included Mathura Road (between Apollo Hospital and Jangpura), India Gate roundabout, Noida Link Road, August Kranti Marg, Sri Aurobindo Marg, Panchsheel Marg, Pankha Road, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, Dabri-Gurgaon Road in Dwarka, Vedant Desika Mandir Marg (near Ber Sarai), and GT Karnal service road (near Shahdara metro station), among others.While most of these stretches are in the upscale parts of south and central Delhi — roads in these parts are wider and the traffic volume low, making them ideal routes for cyclists — curiously, the rise in cyclists numbers was also seen in many parts of west and north Delhi, both with predominantly working-class populations. “Lower middle-class users are switching to cycles for economic reasons. With a restriction on public transport and given their limited income, many are seeing cycles as a long-term option to save on commuting expenses,” the study draft reads. “For the middle and upper-class cyclists, who mostly own a private vehicle, the reasons for the switch are completely different -- they are using cycles for shorter distances, recreational purposes and also as a means to keep fit amid the pandemic scare,” it said further. Based on their findings, the research team have assessed that in the coming year, road share of cyclists could go up by as much as 20% to 25%. Delhi government estimates show, there are nearly 1.1 million regular bicycle users in the city, but this figure is from before the pandemic. A similar analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) found the share of cyclists of total road commuters will rise from 4% to 12%. “The takeaway from this is that cities will have to be planned to be more cyclist and pedestrian friendly. This is an opportunity,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), CSE. Mehul Srivastava, who leads a cycling group in south Delhi, said new cyclists are joining the team for health reasons and also to reduce contact with other people. “There are those who now prefer to cycle to the local market. Many who were using cabs or auto-rickshaws for short commutes are also switching to cycling because they do not want to risk any exposure to the virus. Health has become a priority among people, but the infrastructure for cyclists is still poor,” Srivastava said. He said most parts of the city do not have dedicated cycle tracks and even in areas where they are located. Cyclists, he said, also often become victims of road accidents and crimes such as snatching and robberies. Delhi traffic police data echoes cyclists’ concerns. Data on road accidents over the past 10 years shows that of the total fatalities on Delhi’s roads, cyclists and pedestrians make up 70%. A senior Delhi traffic police officer said, “In lower income areas, people don’t have a choice. The frequency of buses, which is their primary mode of transport, is low and so they prefer to cycle. Central and south Delhi areas have plenty of cycle groups with professional gear. But for the benefit of all classes, road infrastructure has to be safe. Sadly, that’s not the case now,” the officer said.Experts say similar upward swings in cycling have been observed in cities abroad. Alejandro Schwedhelm, urban mobility associate at World Resources Institute (WRI) Ross Centre for Sustainable Cities, said the surge was seen in cities in China, Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Aniket Tikoo, owner of Bikers Loft, a biking equipment store in Lajpat Nagar, said the sale of cycles has increased by 10% to 15% over the past two months, but it was too early to say if the rise would remain consistent in the coming months. “People are mostly buying multi-geared comfort hybrids and road bikes. So, business has been good,” he said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/in-post-lockdown-delhi-cycling-is-picking-up-speed-finds-study/story-pKcgSlEs69JnvHcjEBrkhO.html
26-07-2020||Noida||Man held for ‘accidental’ death of 13-month-old daughter||A 28-year-old man was arrested by the Noida police on Saturday in connection with the “accidental” death of his 13-month-old daughter on July 23.The suspect, identified as Jamshed, is originally from Bihar and lived with his wife, Gulafsa (23), and daughter in Sector 22. Both parents work as daily wage earners.According to the suspect’s wife, the incident took place on Thursday afternoon around 1:30pm. “We were sitting in the courtyard and Jamshed was holding our daughter in his lap. For the past few months, there had been some problems between us, and on Thursday we started arguing again. Suddenly, he became very agitated and started shouting at me. In his anger, he almost threw our daughter at me who then fell from his hands and hit her head on the floor,” said Gulafsa.She said that on hearing the commotion, a few neighbours rushed to her aide and they immediately called up the police. “A PCR team came to the spot and I rushed my daughter to the government hospital in Nithari. But the hospital authorities their said that she should be taken to Safdarjung hospital in Delhi, and it was during the ride that she died,” Gulafsa added. Her husband fled the spot as soon as the police were called.The child’s body was then sent for an autopsy and later handed over back to the family. Gulafsa filed a complaint with the Sector 24 police on Friday following which a case was registered against Jamshed under section 304 (punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code.Police officers said the suspect’s primary intent was not murder and the death of the child was an accident.“We first received a call about the incident around 2pm on Thursday, and from the statement of the mother it seems that the suspect lost control during an argument which led to the child dropping on the floor and hitting her head which led to her death. A search had been on for the father ever since the incident,” said assistant commissioner of police, zone 1, Rajneesh Verma.The suspect was nabbed by the Sector 24 police on Saturday afternoon from the Sector 12-22-56 tri-junction. He was produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/man-held-for-accidental-death-of-13-month-old-daughter/story-DCz5joiLskAplkejz48XvI.html
26-07-2020||Delhi||Centre to draw plan for states to follow Delhi’s Covid-19 model||The Central government will on Monday hold a meeting to chalk out a plan for other states to replicate the ‘Delhi model’ of Covid-19 management, senior government officials said on Saturday. The meeting will be chaired by Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla. A senior official in the Delhi government, who did not wish to be named, said, “The high-level meeting has been called to decide the steps that can be taken to replicate Delhi’s success model in other states that are seeing a surge in Covid-19 cases. Apart from this, the Covid-19 strategy for the coming days in Delhi will also be discussed.” According to the agenda, Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev will present the key components of Delhi’s Covid-19 management strategy before the top Central government officials. The meeting will also have Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan and NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul in attendance along with other officers. Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu were responsible for nearly two of every three new infections reported till early July, but the current spurt in Covid-19 cases are being reported from Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. In an interview with HT on July 18, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the ‘Delhi model’ was all about testing, home isolation, transparent data, hospital beds and plasma therapy. “But to achieve these five things, we followed three principles - 1) teamwork, 2) acknowledging constructive criticism and fixing what is wrong, 3) not giving up as a government no matter how bad the situation got,” he had said. The Delhi government in a statement on Saturday said,“CM Kejriwal has always said the essence of the Delhi Model is teamwork. At such a critical juncture, it’s very important all states work together to defeat Covid-19. If the steps taken by Delhi government that helped reduce cases can help in other states, it will be a badge of honour for the Delhi model.”As per Saturday’s health bulletin, Delhi’s Covid-19 recovery rate crossed 87% — the best among all states in India and higher than the national average of 63.5%. The Capital’s active cases also dipped to 12,657 on Saturday, the lowest in more than seven weeks, even as 1,142 fresh instances were recorded on Saturday. The national capital has, as on Saturday, recorded 129,531 cases of the disease.A senior official in the state health department said the initial trends suggest Delhi is approaching herd immunity. “Delhi could be one of the first states or cities in India inching towards herd immunity. The serological survey was conducted between June 27 and July 10. Generally it takes around 10-15 days for a recovered Covid-19 patient to generate antibodies. So, the survey mostly showed the trend of Delhi from the first 10 days of June. If it was almost 24% in early June, it must have crossed 30-35% by now,” the official said.Earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appreciated the efforts of the Centre and Delhi government in containing the disease outbreak in the city and directed that a similar approach against the pandemic be adopted across the National Capital Region. To get a clearer picture, the government has now decided to conduct similar sero surveys over the first five days of every month, the first of which will be held between August 1 and 5. Schools and colleges, bars, cinema halls, and the metro services are still closed in Delhi. In government buses, the government has rationed the number of passengers inside the bus to ensure social distancing. In government offices, meetings are held over video conferencing, in police stations, the citizens interact with police personnel outside office building. Police in Delhi have also started questioning suspects or meeting complainants over video conferencing. In the three jails — Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli — the authorities are yet to start the bi-weekly family visits. The courts are also conducting holding hearings over video conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/centre-to-draw-plan-for-states-to-follow-delhi-s-covid-model/story-JiqrBnBnxXmlyyibf2MEhI.html

This is evident at the quick queues (with social distancing norms) that have been mushrooming at popular eateries in the city, as soon a place announces that it’s reopening. There’s little doubt that people missed street food during the lockdown. And now that the markets are open and abuzz with din and delicacies, denizens aren’t missing out on the chance to savour their favourite street food at the roadside stall — be it chaat or kebab. “Chole bhature is the most iconic representation of Delhi’s food culture. And everyone truly missed that during the lockdown, which is visible in our sales that have thankfully picked up again after a lull post the lockdown,” says Puneet Kohli from Sita Ram Diwan Chand in Paharganj, which is synonymous with chole bhature.   #Repost @foodama • • • • • • Ganesh Restaurant, Karol Bagh Lovingly called Ganeshi,late mr.Harichand, once proved his dedication to food by immersing his own hands in boiling oil, just to clear his customer's doubts and gracefully succeeded.

And a rainy day in Delhi-NCR is incomplete without chai and pakoda. “People are coming to buy our speciality, fish pakoda because they know we use fresh fish, always,” says Deepak Kumar, owner, Ganesh Restaurant at Karol Bagh. Vouching for the variety of non-veg pakodas he makes, Kumar adds, “Keeping in line with safety measures, we are preparing food in front of our customers, sanitising our premises every day, and recording the temperature of all employees. Log jaante hain ki hum unki safety ke sath compromise nahi karenge.” When it comes to gorging on momos, even a pandemic can’t stop a foodie! “People are once again coming from far off to order momos, and some eat here and also get them packed for later,” says Dolma Tsering aka Dolma Aunty, from Lajpat Nagar Central Market. “Since I’ve restarted business, I’m unable to produce as per my maximum capacity because there are not enough hands, but the response of customers has been great... Some people came to tell me they tried making these at home during lockdown, but couldn’t get the same taste and were missing these; this was heartening.” With chat vendors back in action, although equipped with face masks and hand gloves, the golgappa fans are rejoicing! Even chowmein and other fast foods now seem to be the “current favourite”, says Varun Puri, owner of IMLY. “During the lockdown people got bored of eating plain simple home food and the chatpata-ness was missed badly it seems. Also, fast food or street food is quick to eat and convenient for customers to takeaway. Our top selling dishes of late are desi chowmein, dahi kebabs, jalebi rabri and tandoori momos.”Foodies in Gurugram are thronging the popular Galleria Market. “People don’t mind sitting on benches and relishing their fav roles. Even biryani and shawarma are being lapped up like anything,” says Anas Qureshi, owner, Lazeez Food informing that they are packed on most of the days. “When people see that we are using sanitisers, gloves, caps, etc toh customer ko lagta hain na ki sab theek hai, fresh bana hai. Jo trust bana hai customers ka humare liye, woh iss wajah se hai ki everything is cooked live in front on them.

The government through an order on Friday appointed Dr Nitin Bilolikar, chief district surgeon, as PMC health chief, after Dr Ramchandra Hankare, current health chief, goes on medical leave. “I am on medical leave and will join the office on Monday (July 27). Recently the state government had appointed additional IAS officers in Pune to tackle the Covid situation and an additional health chief has been appointed at PMC. Now the municipal commissioner will distribute the work between both of us,” Dr Hankare said.Both Hankare and Bilolikar are from the state service. PMC elected members have many times raised the question in general body meetings of appointing the health chief from the civic body as the elected official will know the ground reality. Health chiefs were appointed from PMC, before a state service official was given the post in 2019.Congress leader Gopal Tiwari expressed unhappiness over Hankare’s leave. “When the city is facing a spike in Covid cases, why did the municipal commissioner approved his [Hankare] medical leave? He could have worked from home.” Meanwhile, at a review meeting with health department staff after taking charge as PMC commissioner, Vikram Kumar instructed the officials to improve performance and carry out more work on the ground by visiting hospitals and other medical centres.Bilolikar, a medical professional, was previously posted as deputy director of health services, Pune region. His appointment comes in the wake of government appointing bureaucrats who studied medicine as municipal commissioners in Mumbai metropolitan regions, including Thane, Mira-Bhayandar and Ulhasnagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-gets-additional-health-chief-after-present-incumbent-goes-on-leave/story-J2iMKFZ8KsCpZAYGp5ZVbP.html
26-07-2020||World||Some US police resist enforcing coronavirus mask mandates||Lang Holland, the chief of police in tiny Marshall, Arkansas, said he thinks the threat of the coronavirus has been overstated and only wears a face mask if he’s inside a business that requires them. He doesn’t make his officers wear them either.So the day after Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed an order requiring masks to be worn in public throughout Arkansas, Holland made it clear his department wasn’t going to enforce the mandate in the Ozarks town of about 1,300, calling it an unconstitutional overreach.“All I’m saying is if you want to wear a mask, you have the freedom to choose that,” said Holland, who said he supports President Donald Trump. “It should not be dictated by the nanny state.”Holland is among a number of police chiefs and sheriffs in Arkansas and elsewhere who say they won’t enforce statewide mask requirements, even within their departments. Some say they don’t have the manpower to respond to every mask complaint, treating violations of the requirement as they would oft-ignored minor offenses such as jaywalking. Others, including Holland, reject the legal validity of mask requirements.The pushback is concerning to health officials, who say a lack of enforcement could undermine what they say is a much-needed and simple step that can be taken to slow the spread of the coronavirus.“If people undermine that mandate, they undermine the public health benefits of masking in the setting of this pandemic, and that just doesn’t make any sense to me,” said Dr. Cam Patterson, the chancellor of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, who had called for a statewide requirement.More than half the states have issued orders to wear masks in most public settings, with virus cases and hospitalizations on the rise. Polling shows overwhelming public support for such requirements, and even Trump, who had long been dismissive of wearing masks, last week said it was patriotic to wear one.The most vocal police pushback to mask requirements is coming from Republican-led states that aggressively reopened businesses or previously opposed stricter measures such as mask requirements. Hutchinson, who was among a handful of governors who didn’t issue a stay-at-home order, long resisted issuing a mask mandate in Arkansas, but he relented in the face of the state’s worsening numbers.Arkansas’ active virus cases, meaning those excluding people who have died or recovered from Covid-19, have nearly quadrupled since Memorial Day. The number of people hospitalized with the disease in the state is almost five times higher than it was that day.“This is a way to enlist the support of everyone in this fight,” Hutchinson said before signing the order, which took effect Monday.Several police chiefs and sheriffs immediately said they wouldn’t enforce Hutchinson’s order, which prohibits people from being jailed for violations and only imposes fines for repeat offenders. The Texarkana Police Department said it wouldn’t enforce the order, saying its primary responsibility was “fighting crime and providing police services.”John Staley, the sheriff of Lonoke County in central Arkansas, said he agrees with the need for masks and his deputies wear them when in contact with the public. But he said his department doesn’t have the manpower to respond to complaints about them.“I support the governor’s position and his decision, but we’re not going to be out writing tickets for masks,” Staley said.None of the resistant law enforcement agencies are refusing to respond to disturbances related to masks, which have turned violent or deadly in some incidents. Staley and officials from several other law enforcement agencies have said they would respond if businesses complain about people refusing to wear masks or to leave the premises.Several sheriffs in neighboring Texas have also said they wouldn’t enforce a mask requirement issued by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. And a group of 38 sheriffs in Montana signed an op-ed this months saying they believe that the mask requirement issued by the state’s Democratic governor this month “is not a mandate for law enforcement to issue citations and arrest violators.“Enforcement of Alabama’s mask rule, which took effect this month, has also varied. Some police said they would provide masks to those not wearing them in public, and others said they didn’t plan to ticket people for violations.“We as law enforcement are NOT the social distancing police OR the face mask police. Just be responsible, that’s all, and be safe,” the Bay Minette Police Department announced in a Facebook post.In New York City, which was at the heart of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak early on in the pandemic, the nation’s largest police department has struggled with how to enforce mask mandates. Police initially assigned 1,000 officers this spring to enforce mask wearing and social distancing rules, but they backed off after some violent arrests were caught on video.Now, the city relies chiefly on civilian workers and community group members to hand out masks and encourage people to wear them.Hutchinson said he would defer to local police and sheriffs on how to enforce his order, saying it was their prerogative on how to prioritize offenses. But he also said police “don’t pick and choose” which laws they enforce. The difficulty of enforcing a mandate in a rural state like Arkansas was one of the reasons Hutchinson gave for resisting the requirement until recently.Not all police departments are resistant to enforcing mask mandates, though they’re hoping to avoid the need to write anyone up for not complying.“I am confident that the overwhelming majority of Fort Smith residents and visitors care about each other and will choose to help us through personal accountability, making the need for enforcement action non-existent,” Danny Baker, the chief of police in Fort Smith, an Arkansas city along the Oklahoma border, said in a statement.Supporters of mask mandates say penalties were never their goal and that they never envisioned police having to respond to every complaint about someone not wearing one.“Nobody’s asking for a masking gestapo,” Patterson said. “We’re just asking for good behavior and support from our local communities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-us-police-resist-enforcing-coronavirus-mask-mandates/story-3z8pIJcaYbMkynVm9wckxL.html

The court heard that Vidhya Chandran, 40, a mother of two, was stabbed to death by her husband, Ugesh C S, on September 9 last year.Hailing from Kerala, Vidhya was supposed to fly home with her children that night to celebrate Onam, the Gulf News reported. While Vidhya’s family said her husband had been harassing her for several years, Ugesh told police that he suspected she was cheating on him by having an affair with another man, the paper said.According to official records, the victim’s manager testified that he had called her, but she didn’t answer his calls. He then asked an employee to look for her.“I went outside and I saw her covered with blood and [lying] motionless. She was stabbed and I think she was dead when I saw her,” the 32-year-old Indian manager said.The police identified the victim and her husband, who had entered the UAE on a visit visa. The husband was arrested the same day in Jebel Ali.The defendant said that he had received a text message from his wife’s manager, alerting him that his wife was in a relationship with another man.“The defendant claimed that he was talking to the manager about the message as he too was suspicious of her behaviour. When his wife came, she got angry with her husband because he had embarrassed her in front of the manager,” a policeman said.After a heated argument, he stabbed her three times with a knife and left the spot.The Dubai Court of First Instance found the defendant guilty and sentenced him to life in jail, to be followed by deportation. The verdict will be subject to appeal within 15 days from July 20, the paper said. Reacting to the verdict, Vidhya’s elder brother Vinay Chandran said he appreciated the life sentence given to the convict though the family was expecting a capital punishment for him. A friend of Vidhya in the UAE said the victim struggled to make ends meet and would sometimes live on biscuits to send money home.“Though she was constantly harassed by her husband, she silently suffered everything and just lived for her daughters,” she said. In the UAE, a life sentence means a 25-year jail term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-man-sentenced-to-life-for-stabbing-wife-to-death-in-dubai-report/story-58NYfnbpVIdjYnxFE6HA6M.html

26-07-2020||World||100 Days: Challenge mounts for Donald Trump as 8 in 10 Americans say US heading in wrong direction||With the November election 100 days away, more Americans say the country is heading in the wrong direction than at any previous point in Donald Trump’s presidency, putting the incumbent in a perilous position as his reelection bid against Democrat Joe Biden enters a pivotal stretch.A new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research also finds Trump’s approval for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic falling to a new low, with just 32% of Americans supportive of his approach. Even Trump’s standing on the economy, long the high water mark for the president, has fallen over the past few months after seeming ascendant earlier this year.Those political headwinds have sparked a sudden summer shift in the White House and the Trump campaign. After spending months playing down the pandemic and largely ignoring the virus’ resurgence in several states, Trump warned this past week that the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better. After repeatedly minimizing the importance of wearing masks to limit the spread of the virus, Trump urged Americans to do exactly that. And after insisting he would press forward with a large campaign convention in August, the president announced that he was scrapping those plans.Trump’s abrupt about-face underscores the reality of the situation he faces just over three months from Election Day. Even as he tries to refocus his contest with Biden on divisive cultural issues and an ominous “law and order” message, Trump’s reelection prospects are likely to be inextricably linked to his handling of the pandemic and whether voters believe the country will head back in the right direction under his leadership.The AP-NORC poll makes clear the challenge ahead for Trump on that front: 8 in 10 Americans say the country is heading in the wrong direction. That’s more than at any point since Trump took office. The poll also finds just 38% of Americans say the national economy is good, down from 67% in January, before the pandemic upended most aspects of everyday life.Biden’s campaign is eager to keep the final months of the campaign focused squarely on Trump, confident that the former vice president can emerge victorious if the contest is a referendum on whether the current commander in chief has succeeded during his four years in office.“People are sick and tired of a government that is divided and broken and unable to get things done,” said Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager. “What people feel like they’re getting from Trump right now is a hodgepodge mess of self-interested political talk.”The past few months have proved to be beneficial for Biden’s campaign. He managed to swiftly consolidate the Democratic Party in ways Hillary Clinton, the party’s 2016 nominee, struggled to do. Biden’s fundraising, a weakness for him in the primary, has surged, allowing his campaign to build out infrastructure and start ad spending in both traditional battleground states and more aspirational targets, including Texas and Georgia.Biden has also benefited from Trump landing on the wrong side of the public in his initial reactions to the pandemic. For example, 3 in 4 Americans back requiring people to wear masks in public, which Trump initially dismissed.Another pandemic test for the president lies ahead in August and September, as Trump and his administration aggressively try to sell a skeptical public on reopening schools. The poll finds that about third of Americans are opposed entirely to the idea, while close to half say major adjustments to instruction will be required.The limitations the pandemic placed on the candidates’ ability to travel and hold large rallies have also played more to Biden’s strengths. While Trump relishes headlining rallies at packed arenas, Biden is less adept in those settings. He’s instead spent the past several months delivering speeches to small groups of invited guests and journalists within driving distance of his home in Delaware, and holding virtual events with supporters and donors.Trump argues that shows Biden doesn’t have the stamina for a full-blown campaign; Biden’s advisers say voters want to see their leaders abide by the same public health guidelines they’re urging others to follow.Democrats have been buoyed by public polls finding Biden ahead of Trump both nationally and in some battleground states by a comfortable margin. However, Biden advisers caution that they expect the race to tighten in the final stretch before Election Day as more Republicans who may be dissatisfied with Trump’s job performance gravitate back to their party’s leader.Overall, 38% of Americans approve of the president’s job performance — well within the narrow range that Trump’s approval ratings have stayed throughout this presidency, but down slightly from earlier this year before the pandemic. Most Republicans — 81% — approve of Trump’s job performance, but just 68% of Republicans support his handling of the pandemic.Publicly, Trump and his advisers say they have been here before: underestimated and counted out. They point to public polls throughout the summer of 2016 that showed Trump trailing Clinton, only to eclipse her on Election Day.But privately, Trump’s political aides and allies have spent months trying to sound the alarm bells for the president, warning that he could lose the Midwestern battlegrounds he carried in 2016, as well as some reliably red states, if the trajectory — both of his campaign and the virus — continues.One of the most concrete signs that Trump recognized he had gone off course came this month, when he demoted longtime campaign manager Brad Parscale, replacing him with experienced GOP operative Bill Stepien.Stepien told reporters he expects the campaign to “be a knock-down, drag-out fight to the very end.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/100-days-challenge-mounts-for-donald-trump-as-8-in-10-americans-say-us-heading-in-wrong-direction/story-XDmGeMECrf4ITeC4Zcdd7J.html
26-07-2020||World||Workers praise Disney coronavirus safety, but will visitors come?||Every week, it seems, Kaila Barker, her husband and their five children change their minds about whether to travel from their home in Connecticut to Florida’s Walt Disney World as planned in September.On the one hand, the lack of crowds means more opportunities to go on rides without long waits. On the other hand, Connecticut and Florida have implemented pandemic-related quarantines for each other’s residents and visitors, and the Barkers worry whether the Disney “magic” will get lost with mandatory mask-wearing for visitors and workers, temperature checks and no parades, fireworks shows or up-close “meet-and-greets” with costumed characters.“We keep going back and forth. It’s such a hard decision to make,” Barker said last Tuesday.Two weeks after Disney World started opening its theme parks for the first time since closing in March because of Covid-19, the Barkers’ quandary affects not only Disney World’s future but that of central Florida’s tourism-reliant economy.More than 75 million visitors came to Orlando in 2018, mostly due to its reputation as a theme park mecca, which also includes Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando. But the coronavirus has upended Orlando’s status as the most visited place in the U.S.In the week that Disney World’s Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom started welcoming back visitors, occupancy of hotel rooms in the Orlando area was down more than 60% from the previous year, a much deeper drop than the state as a whole, which declined more than 41%, according to STR, which tracks hotel data.Less than half of Disney World’s 43,000 unionized workers have been recalled to their old jobs, contributing to two Orlando-area counties having the state’s highest unemployment rates last month — Osceola at 22.9% and Orange at 17.2%. Disney World has an overall workforce of 77,000 employees, the nation’s largest single-site labor force.Many of those still-furloughed workers are about to lose federal benefits at the end of the month.“This is an extremely difficult moment,” said Paul Cox, president of the local union that represents stagehands and show technicians at Disney World. “There are still a majority of workers who are staying at home and they’re about to lose support. Things are going to get bad.”Union officials estimate the Disney parks are no more than a third full, but that may be more by design to maintain social distancing. Disney World doesn’t release attendance figures, but in pre-pandemic times its four parks and two water parks could host around 150,000 visitors a day.Florida has had a surging coronavirus caseload recently, and other Disney parks around the globe have run into coronavirus-related roadblocks. Hong Kong Disneyland Park was forced to close earlier this month following the city’s decision to ban public gatherings of more than four people, and Disney’s California parks delayed reopening while they awaited state guidelines.Cowen Inc. estimated recently that Disney’s parks and resorts won’t return to pre-pandemic profitability until fiscal year 2025, and there is a “meaningful” probability that Disney World could close again because of the pandemic.Leaders of the Disney World workers’ unions describe the virus-related safety measures Disney has taken as “exemplary.”After workers complained about patrons walking around with their masks pulled down while eating food like turkey legs, Disney World updated its mandatory mask policy, requiring visitors to eat in one place while maintaining social distancing.In response to other worker concerns, Disney has distributed personal hand sanitizer containers for workers to wear on their belts, added additional break rooms to limit the number of workers in them and reduced the number of riders on buses that shuttle workers from parking lots to the parks. Performers dressed as Disney princesses being driven in a horse-powered carriage through the parks now sit individually in rows separated by clear-plastic window partitions.“Singing their praises seems so strange,” said Julee Jerkovich, an official with a United Food & Commercial Workers union, which represents Disney merchandise and banquet workers. “As far as this grand experiment, I would have to say Disney has done a really good job.”But not all unions are happy. The union that represents actors and singers has filed a grievance with Disney World, saying their 750 members were locked out of returning to work after they complained about Disney ignoring their demands for getting coronavirus tests since they can’t wear masks while performing. Some performers, though, are eager to return to work and are pushing the union to reach an agreement with the company, as they worry about Disney replacing their shows with temporary ones featuring non-actors.There have been isolated cases of workers and visitors connected to the theme parks getting sick with COVID-19, “but we haven’t seen any large number of positive cases that come from any of the parks,” Dr. Raul Pino, health officer for Florida’s Department of Health, said last Monday.Disney’s policy of granting sick workers with paid time off so they can quarantine has made a difference, said Eric Clinton, president of Unite Here! Local 362, which represents Disney World park greeters, attractions workers and custodians.But Clinton wonders if the current operating model can last until the pandemic is over, given that just over 20,000 of the 43,000 workers represented by unions have returned to work, only half of Disney World’s 30 onsite hotels currently are back open and several in-park restaurants still are closed.“Disney is a strong brand. They have a great product, but does the novelty wear off? Do people want to go to a theme park now? Is it more appealing with less crowds?” Clinton said. “I’m hopeful but nervous.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/workers-praise-disney-coronavirus-safety-but-will-visitors-come/story-xAKel164vjG2q0QHyqFjQO.html
26-07-2020||World||UN says thousands of anti-Pakistan militants in Afghanistan||A UN report says more than 6,000 Pakistani insurgents are hiding in Afghanistan, most belonging to the outlawed Pakistani Taliban group responsible for attacking Pakistani military and civilian targets.The report released this week said the group, known as the Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP), has linked up with the Afghan-based affiliate of the Islamic State group. Some of TTP’s members have even joined the IS affiliate, which has its headquarters in eastern Afghanistan.The Afghan government did not respond Sunday to requests by The Associated Press for comment.The report said IS in Afghanistan, known as IS in Khorasan province, has been hit hard by Afghan security forces as well as U.S. and NATO forces, and even on occasion by the Afghan Taliban. The report was prepared by the U.N. analytical and sanctions monitoring team, which tracks terrorist groups around the world.The report estimated the membership of IS in Afghanistan at 2,200, and while its leadership has been depleted, IS still counts among its leaders a Syrian national Abu Said Mohammad al-Khorasani. The report also said the monitoring team had received information that two senior Islamic State commanders, Abu Qutaibah and Abu Hajar al-Iraqi, had recently arrived in Afghanistan from the Middle East.“Although in territorial retreat, (the Islamic State) remains capable of carrying out high-profile attacks in various parts of the country, including Kabul. It also aims to attract Taliban fighters who oppose the agreement with the United States,” the report said, referring to a U.S. peace deal signed with the Taliban in February.That deal was struck to allow the U.S. to end its 19-year involvement in Afghanistan, and calls on the Taliban to guarantee its territory will not be used by terrorist groups. The deal is also expected to guarantee the Taliban’s all-out participation in the fight against IS.The second and perhaps most critical part of the agreement calls for talks between the Taliban and Kabul’s political leadership.Late Saturday, the U.S. State Department issued a statement saying its peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad was again shuttling through the region seeking to jump start those negotiations, which have been repeatedly postponed as both sides squabble over a prisoner release program.The U.S.-backed deal calls for the Afghan government to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners and the Taliban to free 1,000 government and military personnel as a so-called good will gesture ahead of talks. Until now the government is refusing to release nearly 600 Taliban prisoners it calls high-profile criminals and has offered to free alternatives. The Taliban have refused.“The parties are closer than ever to the start of intra-Afghan negotiations, the key next step to ending Afghanistan’s 40-year long war,” said the U.S. State Department statement. “Although significant progress has been made on prisoner exchanges, the issue requires additional effort to fully resolve.”The Taliban’s political spokesman earlier this week said it was ready to hold talks with Kabul’s political leaders after the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha at the end of the month, providing the prisoner release is completed.A big worry for Pakistan is the presence in Afghanistan of militants, particularly linked to the TTP or Jamaat-ul-Ahrar or Lashkar-e-Islam, as well as those with the Baluchistan Liberation Army, which has taken responsibility for high-profile attacks this month in the southern Sindh province as well as in southwestern Baluchistan Province. Several Pakistan military personnel have been killed this month in southwestern Baluchistan province in battle with insurgents.The TTP took responsibility for one of the most horrific attacks in Pakistan in 2014, when a Pakistani army school was attacked and 140 were killed. Most were students, and some were as young as 5.“The total number of Pakistani foreign terrorist fighters in Afghanistan, posing a threat to both countries, is estimated at between 6,000 and 6,500, most of them with TTP,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-says-thousands-of-anti-pakistan-militants-in-afghanistan/story-1MHskwonXvgq7EIitVovxH.html
26-07-2020||World||Serbia seeks more warplanes amid Balkan tensions||Serbia will strengthen its armed forces and is seeking to purchase more warplanes amid simmering tensions in the Balkans, the Serbian president said Sunday.President Aleksandar Vucic said “certain initiatives” have been made to buy a fleet of fighter-bombers, accusing the US and other Western countries of arming Serbia’s NATO neighbors and its breakaway former province of Kosovo.“The Americans, Turks and Germans are taking care of their beloved child,” Vucic said, referring to Kosovo. He said the U.S. has recently delivered a number of armored vehicles to Kosovo’s security forces.During a tour of a Serbian army tank brigade, Vucic said his country cannot compete with “NATO donations” to its neighbors when it comes to weapons, “therefore we must do it alone.”Vucic did not specify what type of warplanes Serbia plans to buy, but the pro-government media said his government has officially asked the U.S. for the delivery of 20 fighter-bombers. The reports said Washington has not yet responded to Belgrade’s request and that in case of a refusal, it is likely to purchase Russian-made Sukhoi-25 attack aircraft.Serbia, which claims military neutrality, has recently received a sophisticated anti-aircraft system from Russia, which has also provided fighter jets, attack helicopters and armored vehicles. Another Serbian ally, China, has delivered military drones.U.S. officials have in the past spoken openly about introducing sanctions against Serbia if Moscow sends more arms to the country, especially those that could jeopardize the security of neighboring NATO-member states.The Russian and Chinese arming of Serbia is being watched with unease in the West and among Serbia’s neighbors. Tensions are growing in the Balkans, which went through a devastating civil war in the 1990s. NATO intervened in Serbia to stop a bloody Serb crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists in 1999.Despite formally seeking to join the European Union, Serbia’s populist leadership has further strengthened close political and military ties with the Kremlin, as well as Beijing.Serbia, as well as Russia and China, don’t accept Kosovo’s independence, which is recognized by the U.S. and most of the West.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/serbia-seeks-more-warplanes-amid-balkan-tensions/story-RIgJyyUVW8kyv6xJxEApfP.html

In January they announced plans to lead a more independent life and to finance it themselves.Harry and Meghan married in May 2018 in a wedding heralded at the time as infusing a blast of Hollywood glamour and modernity into the British monarchy and which made them one of the world’s biggest celebrity couples.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-harry-took-offence-at-brother-s-advice-says-book/story-3T371h8FcK65gjr8jdgSTM.html
26-07-2020||World||Australia’s migration intake to fall by over 2 lakh due to Covid-19; Indians affected||Australia’s migration intake will drop significantly to 31,000 in 2020-21 from 232,000 in 2018-19 due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, impacting thousands of Indians planning to emigrate to this country. While the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Australian economy are still evolving, migration, which is a key driver of the economy, has been hit following the travel bans, border closures imposed earlier this year since the contagion began. The Australian Economic and Fiscal Update report, released on Thursday by the treasury department, said that the Net Overseas Migration (NOM) is significantly affected by the international travel restrictions and constraints on the ability of applications to meet visa application requirements. “The NOM is assumed to fall from 232,000 in 2018-19 to be 154,000 in 2019-20 and 31,000 in 2020-21,” it said. The Indian community in Australia is comprised of nearly seven lakh people. India is one of the top sources of skilled immigrants to Australia. Approximately 90,000 students are studying in Australian universities. The report further said that the international borders were expected to reopen in Januray next year, but a two-week quarantine period would remain in place for arrivals to Australia. “Future migration levels remain highly uncertain, due to the path of the pandemic and the nature and duration of measures taken to contain its spread at home and abroad. “The government implemented international travel bans in March 2020. This prevented all arrivals on visitor and temporary migration visas and prevented Australian citizens and permanent residents from departing Australia,” the document read. According to the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, no decision was taken yet on when Australia’s travel ban will be lifted. “In terms of the borders, the assumptions are… to very gradually start to come back that the quarantine is applied, that you start bringing in some international students…,” he was quoted as saying by AAP news agency. “Of course, the environment with respect to coronavirus is very fluid. So decisions haven’t been taken about the start dates for that. These are treasury’s forecasts and as you can understand, it’s a very dynamic environment,” he said. According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the contagion has infected over 16 million people and killed more than 644,000 across the world. In Australia, the Covid-19 has infected over 13,900 people and killed 155 others. The Covid-19, which originated in China’s Wuhan city in December last year, has also battered the world economy with the International Monetary Fund saying that the global economy is bound to suffer a “severe recession”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-s-migration-intake-to-fall-by-over-2-lakh-due-to-covid-19-indians-affected/story-lsk7abTGhHQPtsFgKh3iEK.html
26-07-2020||World||Why Democrats don’t hold Donald Trump accountable||When President Donald Trump recently commuted the prison sentence of Roger Stone, his longtime ally and now a convicted felon, reaction on Capitol Hill was swift. Representatives Carolyn Maloney and Jerrold Nadler, the respective chairs of the House of Representatives’ Oversight and Reform and Judiciary committees, promptly issued a joint statement. “By this action, President Trump abused the powers of his office in an apparent effort to reward Roger Stone for his refusal to cooperate with investigators examining the President’s own conduct,” said the chairs of two of the most august committees in the House. “This transparently corrupt commutation damages public confidence in the justice system and the rule of law.”Then Maloney and Nadler brought down the hammer. “Among other things,” they stated, “we intend to seek an immediate briefing from the White House Counsel on the circumstances surrounding Roger Stone’s commutation.”Intend to seek? A . . . briefing? Among . . . other things?There are countless examples of the broken state of our national government — the mounting deaths from Covid-19 chief among them. But few are more distressing than the chairs of two powerful congressional committees intending to seek a briefing about impeachable conduct.True, Democrats have tried. They held public hearings with the president’s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, as the lawyer, under oath, described Trump’s alleged involvement in insurance fraud and an illegal payoff scheme to silence women who claimed to have had sexual affairs with Trump. More recently, they took testimony from Geoffrey Berman, the federal prosecutor whom Attorney General William Barr falsely claimed had resigned but who in fact Barr had fired under highly suspicious circumstances. They demanded an end to Trump’s corrupt purge of inspectors general. They issued subpoenas to executive branch employees. They impeached the President of the United States, presenting voluminous evidence of guilt from a range of credible witnesses and documents.It wasn’t enough.In a telephone interview, Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence who led the House’s impeachment case, recounted a familiar litany:The wholesale disregard for our institutions of Congress; the blanket defiance of congressional oversight; the personal intervention by the president in cases before the Justice Department; the willingness of the attorney general to establish a second standard for friends and criminal allies of the president; the attacks on the inspectors general (the list goes on and on); the demonization of the institution of a free press as the ‘enemy of the people’; things that are the usual respite of dictators — all of these have become hallmarks of the Trump administration.It’s a sign of Trump’s spectacular volume that Schiff left out other stunning abuses like the abductions of migrant children from their parents, a likely human rights crime, and the funneling of millions in public tax dollars and private campaign contributions into Trump businesses.While Trump has excelled at breaking government, Democrats have been impressive, too, at failing to restrain his violence toward democracy. “Is it possible that Democrats are just bad at oversight?” poses Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University and an expert on Congress. “Perhaps. But I think the real challenge is leveraging and keeping the press’s attention given this ceaseless 24/7 news cycle and the near-constant fireballs sent out by the president.”Democrats, Binder said, confront a “flood of potential inquiries. One day the president’s daughter is advertising canned beans on her public Twitter page, the next day the president is claiming credit for shutting down Covid-19 testing sites. There’s only so much alleged malfeasance that Congress — and the media — can shine a light on.”The inability of Democrats to deliver consequences for outlandish behavior elicits howls from Democratic partisans and advocates of rule of law, who repeatedly demand more aggressive tactics. “A sternly worded letter won’t stop fascism,” former Bernie Sanders aide David Sirota chided. Congressional scholar Molly Reynolds of the Brookings Institution points out that Democrats have failed to use what is arguably their most potent weapon. “To me, the biggest unused tool in Congress’s toolbox is to use the power of the purse to threaten to defund some of the executive branch’s most egregious overreaches,” Reynolds emailed. “The biggest challenge here is not necessarily getting Republicans on board; it’s that the reliance on large omnibus spending bills passed on the brink of a government shutdown makes it harder to pick fights with the White House over individual spending provisions because the cost of doing so is so high (see: the 2018-19 government shutdown).”Still, Congress pulled its biggest sledgehammer, impeachment, out of the shed, and thanks to every Republican senator but Mitt Romney, it had little discernible effect on Trump’s conduct. If anything, his acquittal emboldened him. In just the past week, Trump refused to commit to abide by November’s election results and unleashed a secret army to escalate tension — that is, violence — in an American city, against the express demands of its mayor and governor. He committed to altering the decennial census, in defiance of the plain language of the Constitution, to benefit Republicans. Meantime, it was revealed that he had sought another foreign emolument — this time, the transfer of the prestigious British Open golf tournament to his Scottish golf club. Every day brings the promise of new assaults on law and democracy.Part of the problem is institutional. Congress, after ceding ground to the executive over many decades, now has far less institutional power. In 2015, before Trump’s election, Kevin Kosar, a veteran of the Congressional Research Service, wrote: “Today, the United States has an executive branch that can do just about anything it pleases, over the objections of the people’s representatives, and sometimes to spectacularly bad effect.” While the executive branch has ballooned, Kosar wrote, “Congress has downsized its research and analytical support staff by about one-third over the past 40 years,” thereby shrinking its capacity to joust with the executive.Congressional scholar Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute, co-author of an influential (and prophetic) 2012 book on the anti-democratic devolution of the GOP, cites “a wider abdication of responsibility by Congress, which includes leaving details of policy to executive agencies, giving and not subsequently rescinding sweeping emergency authority to the president through a slew of laws, putting a lower priority on oversight, and not using the power of the purse effectively to check and balance a president.”Congress has been too meek, Ornstein insisted in an email. But the obstacles to oversight are also formidable. “Where the House has tried to move aggressively, it has been stymied by two factors — the blanket refusal of anyone in Trump World to comply with requests for information, to testify when called, or to respond to subpoenas, and the frequent willingness of courts, mostly via Republican judges, to enable them. It is a witches’ brew of bad stuff.”No one inside or outside government has been able to constrain the president’s abuses, fully explore the nature of his apparent subservience to one of the nation’s most hostile adversaries or exercise effective oversight over a subversive administration.“I think what we have seen during this painfully illustrative three and a half years is that norms are not sufficient, but even statutory provisions are not alone enough, the Constitution is not alone enough,” said Schiff. “As we pointed out during the trial, if right doesn’t matter here anymore then it doesn’t matter how well our Constitution or laws are written because they can be ignored.”Given a White House that is impervious to shame, bolstered by an attorney general who behaves more like the president’s  “consigliere” and backed by the complicity, silent or vocal, of the Republican Party (excepting Romney and a few others), what can Democrats, or anyone, do?“This is a hard one,” said Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth College, in an email. “I don’t know what a plausible model of effective oversight looks like right now given how little attention toothless House hearings will get, how likely they are to be seen as partisan by non-Democrats who do hear about them, etc. I can also imagine that, strategically, Democrats don’t want to turn the focus onto themselves when Trump is doing so poorly.”Indeed, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has sought to keep her troops focused on the coming election, believing that only votes can bring true deliverance. She is not alone. “I’m inclined to believe little can be accomplished on corruption and the rule of law (beyond what is currently underway) until after the election, with Democrats in charge of both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue,” emailed congressional scholar (and Ornstein co-author) Thomas Mann.Trump’s acquittal by the Senate exposed a governing structure that is largely defenseless against an authoritarian breach — provided the authoritarian has sufficient accomplices inside the walls. The Founders installed safeguards, including the Electoral College, to keep out demagogues. In case of a breach, they provided impeachment. But to succeed, impeachment requires democratic parties acting in the interests of democracy. “It’s obviously an imperfect remedy when the party of the president acknowledges the president’s guilt but expresses its unwillingness to use the remedy,” said Schiff.If the question is how to expel a dangerous threat from the heart of democracy, “have another election” seems a shaky answer. It was an election, after all, that installed the threat in the first place. In their 2018 book “How Democracies Die,” authors Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt detail democracies destroyed not by coup or invasion but from within — by the winner of an election who turns democracy’s inherent vulnerabilities against itself.From Venezuela to the Philippines, democratically elected leaders have curtailed democratic practices and oversight to advance their interests. Hungarian leader Viktor Orban used elections to gain power, and then used his power to reshape elections, politics and the media, the better to win more elections and exercise more power. It’s an unvirtuous circle familiar to Vladimir Putin, among others.Levitsky and Ziblatt show that the greatest safeguard of democracy is not elections, which can be won by demagogues, or government oversight, which can be thwarted once a demagogue gains power. It’s the vigilance of political parties. “Put simply, political parties are democracy’s gatekeepers,” they write. The parties must take responsibility both to foreclose access to demagogues and to reject alliances with illiberal parties. “How Democracies Die” has successful examples of both.The Republican Party, however, has already let the demagogue inside. Party leaders failed to coordinate to stop Trump in 2016. Instead of aligning with an illiberal party pushing from the outside, the GOP is fast becoming an illiberal party itself. As a result, the means of democratic revival are narrower, the time more fleeting.The election of 2018, which transferred power in the House from Republicans to Democrats, was a milestone in rebuffing Trumpism. The haphazard spread of the coronavirus, and the Twilight Zone mismanagement that facilitated it, may be the preface to another one. Polls show Trump and Republicans battered by the White House failure. Public confidence in Trump’s presidency continues to decline. It’s impossible to dismiss the potential for electoral sabotage over the next four months, sourced from Russia, the Oval Office or elsewhere. Trump’s public refusal to concede in the event of defeat is itself a visceral attack on democracy. But without a change in the context or direction of the race, or an extra-democratic intervention, Trump appears on course to lose. Schiff said he and Democratic colleagues are working on reforms to make it easier to check the corruption of a wayward president — in effect, post-Trump reforms in the spirit of the post-Watergate reforms of the 1970s. “I think there will be bipartisan support,” Schiff said. “Not necessarily in this Congress where Republicans all live in fear of an angry tweet, but I do think when this president is gone, these reforms will have bipartisan support. Republicans will not want a Democratic president to behave as Donald Trump did and abuse the power of his office. They will suddenly have an interest in their own institution again.”But Schiff acknowledged the limited utility of even strengthened laws against empowered anti-democratic forces. Hyper-partisanship, along with the erosion of democratic values in one of the major parties, and the fraying of the forbearance that long enabled power to pass smoothly from one party to another, have savaged democratic norms. Yet laws, in the end, are also acutely vulnerable. Trump has proved that with party support, the law can be overrun.That leaves only elections. “Ultimately the people have the power either to embrace or repudiate this anti-democratic lurch of the country under Donald Trump,” Schiff said. “And if they embrace it then God help us. The Founders did count on the good sense of the American people and I’m counting on it, I believe in it, I have reason for optimism about it. But, ultimately, Americans will get the kind of democracy that they want. And they express that desire at the polls.”(This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

26-07-2020||World||Hit hardest by virus, Europe’s economy on way to recovery; to outpace US||The euro area economy is for once set for a sprightlier recovery from crisis than the U.S., thanks to starkly different responses to the coronavirus.America’s failure to get a grip on the pandemic is putting the brakes on its rebound compared with Europe, where many former virus hot spots managed to resume economic activity without causing a similar surge in infections.Crucial for a sustainable recovery is confidence that the virus is no longer out of control, and Europe’s relative success may help encourage shoppers to spend and businesses to invest, further propelling demand and growth. The region has also done a better job of protecting jobs and incomes, at least for now, with furlough programs keeping millions of workers on payrolls.According to JPMorgan Chase & Co., Europe will do better because it has “broken the chain” that links mobility and the virus. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has cited effective virus control as one reason it expects a “steeper and smoother rebound in the euro area than elsewhere.”“It’s very clear that the euro area turned down more sharply but we also expect it to bounce back more sharply,” said Jari Stehn, chief European economist at Goldman Sachs. “It’s pretty rare that the euro area would outgrow the U.S. over a horizon of one to two years.”Since 1992, the U.S. has outperformed the euro area in all but eight years, according to IMF data. Although the euro area managed to grow when the financial crisis hit in 2008 and the U.S. shrank, in 2009 the U.S. contraction of 2.5% was far shallower than the euro area’s 4.5%.Aggressive lockdowns mean the euro area is set for a sharper second-quarter contraction than the U.S., something that will be seen in GDP figures due this week.The euro-area economy probably shrank 12% in the three months through June, according to a Bloomberg survey. The U.S. contraction, on an annualized basis, is forecast to be 35%, or a roughly 10% decline quarter-over-quarter.But high-frequency data suggest Europe is on the mend faster, and Bloomberg Economics estimates that the lead has widened recently.“Having been hit hardest it’s pretty impressive that we think that Europe will recover more fully,” said Bruce Kasman, chief economist at JPMorgan. “They’ve broken that link -- the mobility numbers are going up” without a resurgence of the virus, thanks to better contract tracing, mask-wearing and social distancing measures, he said.JPMorgan expects the euro area’s economy to shrink 6.4% this year, slightly worse than the 5.1% contraction seen for the U.S. But for 2021, the bank forecasts a 6.2% rebound for the euro area, more than double America’s 2.8% growth.In the U.S., a jump in cases across the South and West has led several states to halt or even reverse reopening plans. Measures of mobility and restaurant bookings have plateaued, and more than 1 million applications for unemployment benefits continue to be filed each week.Meanwhile, euro-area purchasing managers indexes jumped more than forecast in July, while numbers for the U.S. came in lower than expected, especially for services, which make up a much larger part of the economy than manufacturing.The U.S. economic situation could worsen if lawmakers don’t extend -- in some form -- the extra $600 per week in unemployment benefits that have supported incomes and spending in recent months.Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell is set to release the GOP’s proposal on Monday after the party and President Donald Trump squabbled last week over the details of the plan, giving Congress almost no time to avoid a lapse in the unemployment aid.The divergence is reflected in markets. European stocks and bonds have benefited from renewed investor popularity, thanks to the bloc’s agreement on a historic 750 billion-euro ($860 billion) accord. The euro has risen more than 6% against the dollar in the past two months, and could have further to run.In Europe, generous loan and furlough programs prevented an immediate surge in unemployment, which is also helping the near term. Many were modeled on Germany’s renowned Kurzarbeit and largely proved efficient at getting aid to workers.But it’s early in the recovery phase, and countries can’t keep funding support indefinitely. If demand doesn’t come back strong enough, companies may eventually have to cut costs, meaning Europe may only have delayed a damaging increase in joblessness.Just because Europe is in a relatively better position to come out of this in the second half of the year, “doesn’t mean the U.S. can’t catch up,” said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Plc.In the U.S., the $2 trillion rescue package that Congress passed in March ranks among the most aggressive in history, but the distribution has been patchy and uneven. Unemployment offices were overwhelmed with claims, and many jobless Americans have still yet to receive the unemployment benefits they’re owed.At the same time, the allocation of loans to small and medium-sized businesses had its own challenges, resulting in a chaotic scramble among business owners to get government assistance. Even so, the Paycheck Protection Program helped save as many as 3.2 million jobs, according to a study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Federal Reserve researchers.High-frequency data suggests “things have stalled out, either because there’s exhaustion of initial pent-up demand or because of the virus creating a change in consumer behavior,” said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America Corp. While the third quarter will get a boost from initial state reopenings, “now the question is, how sustainable is that bounce?”(Adds GOP proposal in 15th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hit-hardest-by-virus-europe-s-economy-on-way-to-recovery-to-outpace-us/story-zj5BpEg49odMXOdpZpqnRK.html
26-07-2020||World||Vietnam confirms first local Covid-19 cases since April||Vietnam reported two locally-transmitted coronavirus cases after more than three months of no new infections of such, prompting authorities in the city of Danang to restrict activities to prevent a wider spread of the disease.One patient, a 57-year-old man, had been in Danang city for about a month and hadn’t traveled to other provinces, the government said in a statement on Saturday. He had no communication with strangers, and was mostly in contact with family members and neighbors. He sought treatment at a hospital on July 20 for fever and cough.On Sunday, officials said a 61-year-old man also tested positive, without saying how he got the virus or if he had been in contact with the first case. The man had also been in Danang for about a month and hadn’t traveled to other provinces, according to the health ministry. He went for treatment at a hospital on July 18.Danang’s authorities locked down the hospitals where the two victims visited and ordered their patients, medical staff, caregivers and family members -- about 7,000 people in total -- to be quarantined for 14 days, local media reported.Authorities in Danang also requested people to adhere to social-distancing measures and not gather in public spaces where there are more than 30 people, apart from workplaces, schools and hospitals. There will also be a temporary suspension of festivals, religious ceremonies and operations of beauty spas, bars, massage parlors and dancing halls.Danang will also stop tourists from entering the city for 14 days starting Sunday, according to the city’s authorities.Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc ordered authorities to tighten border and immigration controls to prevent foreigners from illegally entering the country, according to a separate statement Saturday.Vietnam had 418 Covid-19 infections and no deaths as of early Sunday. The case confirmed on Saturday was the first local transmission since April 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vietnam-confirms-first-local-covid-19-cases-since-april/story-H3ibN0fl9z0g7BHudhFWCI.html
26-07-2020||World||Spain second coronavirus wave swells, fuels concern across Europe||Spain is scrambling to stay ahead of new outbreaks of the coronavirus that prompted the U.K. to impose a quarantine on travelers returning from the country, dealing a new blow to its tourism-dependent economy.Only weeks after the U.K. included Spain on a list of countries safe for summer holidays, the government reversed course and announced late Saturday it would impose a 14-day quarantine on anyone arriving from Spain. The move came after cases in the country jumped, particularly in the Catalonia region, where authorities are racing to stamp out new outbreaks.Norway on Friday announced a 10-day quarantine for people returning from Spain, and France issued new travel warnings for the Catalonia region, which is home to Barcelona and popular beaches. The moves will further weigh on bookings in the peak travel period for a country that depends on tourism for more than 10% of gross domestic product.Spain’s health ministry reported more than 920 new cases on both Thursday and Friday, the highest numbers since early May, when the government began easing one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns.“We must be able to take swift, decisive action,” said Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Sky News on Sunday. “Otherwise we risk reinfection into the U.K., potentially a second wave and another lockdown.’Catalonia in northeastern Spain is at the epicenter of a new jump in cases and has been expanding restrictions to try to flatten the curve. In Barcelona, nightclubs have been ordered shut for two weeks and imposed there is a midnight curfew on bars. A partial lockdown affecting 200,000 people has been already imposed in the western district of Segria.“We are quite frustrated. We actually feel safer here, because everyone is wearing masks,” Carolyne Lansell, a British tourist, said in interview with Spanish state-television broadcaster TVE.Tui, the U.K.’s biggest tour operator, suspended all its flights from Spain and the Canary Islands that were due to leave today, Sky News reported. The World Travel & Tourism Council called the U.K. decision a “bitter blow” for travelers and said local lockdowns, not broader travel restrictions would be a better solution.“The majority of the country and its islands, which are incredibly popular holiday destinations, have less cases than the U.K.,” the tourism group said in an emailed statement.Spain was one of the hardest hit countries in Europe by the coronavirus and has already suffered more than 28,000 fatalities, the fourth-highest tally in Europe after the U.K., Italy and France. A national lockdown started in March had largely tamed the spread of Covid-19, but the easing of those restrictions and the start of the summer tourism season has contributed to an uptick, particularly among young people frequenting crowded bars and clubs.Countries around the Mediterranean Sea were praying that a glimpse of tourism would get them through the summer before the cold snap drives people indoors and ushers in a second chapter to the pandemic. Now, it appears the spread of the virus may not wait for the winter months.Governments across the globe have been bracing for a second wave, though there is little appetite for reimposing large scale lockdowns on already crippled economies. The hope is that localizing quarantines to towns, cities and regions will be enough to snuff out bouts of infections as they come.Italy was the first Western democracy to quarantine the entire population as it became apparent its death toll was going to overtake that of China, where the virus originated. A person close to Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte described that decision as “shock therapy” that can’t be repeated. The euro’s weakest economy this week became the biggest beneficiary of the European Union’s $860 billion rescue package.U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was initially reluctant to order a lockdown and then ended up in intensive care fighting for his life after contracting Covid-19. Yet he finds the idea of isolating the nation again so off-putting that he compared it to a nuclear deterrent: “I certainly don’t want to use it.”French Prime Minister Jean Castex, was equally blunt: “We won’t survive, economically and socially.”With the world facing its worst recession since the Great Depression and U.S. President Donald Trump fighting for re-election in November, voters are on edge. Politicians of all stripes are looking for ways to ease the pain—not add to it—as fear morphs into anger and discontent.“Populations can be summoned to heroic acts of collective self-sacrifice for a while, but not forever,” political scientist Francis Fukuyama, author of “The End of History and the Last Man,” wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine. “A lingering epidemic combined with deep job losses, a prolonged recession, and an unprecedented debt burden will inevitably create tensions that turn into a political backlash—but against whom is as yet unclear.”Restaurants and BarsThe political calculus is to try and it ride it out. Yet while efforts to get people back to stores, restaurants, bars and hairdressers demonstrate the urgency among governments of reviving economies, they also show the risks.Europe’s hardest-hit country, Britain, reopened pubs and is now finding spikes in virus cases. Johnson, who aims to return to “significant normality” by Christmas, on Friday said his government is preparing the health service for a second wave of infections over the winter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-second-coronavirus-wave-swells-fuels-concern-across-europe/story-pkET0WVbpc13pg47XRVdEK.html
26-07-2020||World||Rishi Sunak considers ethnic minority figures on UK coins||UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak is reportedly considering a proposal for influential ethnic minority figures to be featured on a set of UK coins to celebrate Britain’s diversity.According to ‘The Sunday Telegraph’, plans have been submitted to the Royal Mint to work out some proposals as the Indian-origin finance minister reflects upon a campaign to put influential black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) figures from history on a set of coins titled “Service to the Nation”. The candidates in the running include Noor Inayat Khan, who was the first Indian-origin World War II spy for Britain, and Khudadad Khan, the first soldier of the British Indian Army to become the recipient of the prestigious Victoria Cross, the highest military award for gallantry in the face of the enemy given to British and Commonwealth forces.“We propose a specific next theme of service to the nation by black, Asian, and other ethnic minority people, both in military conflict and on the home front,” says Zehra Zaida, an Indian-origin Conservative Party candidate behind the campaign, in a letter to Sunak.“This theme will unite people, especially now as the nation has come together through the pandemic, and is collectively recognising the heroic work by ethnic minority staff in our health and care services,” according to the letter.“It is surely essential that this country does not lose another opportunity to demonstrate that the contributions of black, Asian, and other ethnic minority groups are truly valued. Symbols matter and we urge you to support our campaign,” the letter notes.UK Treasury minister John Glen told ‘The Sunday Telegraph’ that Sunak was “keen to support” the “timely proposal”.“The Chancellor [Sunak] is reflecting on the letter from Zehra and will reply in due course,” he said.“We are obviously supportive and keen to be positive about it, we need to see some firm proposals from the Royal Mint but we are keen for this to happen,” he said.Zaidi’s campaign is supported by several historians including Shrabani Basu, the author of ‘Spy Princess: The Life of Noor Inayat Khan’, and politicians such as Conservative Party MP Tom Tugendhat and Green Party MP Caroline Lucas.“I am absolutely delighted that the story of Noor Inayat Khan has inspired so many people and that she has become an icon. Noor was an extraordinary war heroine,” said Basu, the Founder-Chair of the Noor Inayat Khan Memorial Trust.Zaidi was previously behind a campaign to get the Bank of England to select an ethnic minority heroine for a newly-printed GBP 50 note, proposing Noor Inayat Khan among the options. However, Britain’s computer pioneer Alan Turing was the choice for the new banknote which goes into circulation from next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rishi-sunak-considers-ethnic-minority-figures-on-uk-coins/story-bzWhKDIJVb7qTxr1de28wO.html
26-07-2020||World||Italy sees no critical budget issue, cash in line with forecast||Italy doesn’t see any “critical issue” for the country’s budget as its cash availability is developing in line with forecasts.The Italian Treasury said in a statement late Friday that it expects to have more than 80 billion euros ($93 billion) in cash at the end of July, near 2019 levels, amid the coronavirus emergency which forced the country to delay some fiscal payments.As the first European economy crippled by the pandemic, Italy is under pressure to increase spending to ignite a recovery. While activity has started to rebound since the government relaxed a lockdown, there are concerns the coming months will bring more pain when aid measures expire, including a ban on firing workers and the suspension of tax and loan payments.The finance ministry sees “encouraging signs” that economic activity is revamping in July. The first data on value-added tax collection for July show a decline of 4.7% versus 2019, which is a much smaller drop than in the previous three months, it said.The statement is a response to speculation in local media that Finance Minister Roberto Gualtieri was pushing the government to use the European Stability Mechanism credit lines to avoid any risks to the country’s budget. Health Minister Roberto Speranza said Italy should consider using the ESM to get 20 billion euros in funds that are urgently needed for its health system, according to an interview with daily La Stampa on Saturday.The government approved a proposal for 25 billion euros in extra spending earlier this week, with the extra money allocated to help businesses with temporary layoffs and liquidity as well as to provide subsidies to local and regional authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-sees-no-critical-budget-issue-cash-in-line-with-forecast/story-PPqux1lIiel2TylTRHEq2I.html
26-07-2020||World||Russian Navy to get hypersonic nuclear strike weapons, says Putin||Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday the Russian Navy would be armed with hypersonic nuclear strike weapons and underwater nuclear drones, which the defence ministry said were in their final phase of testing.Putin, who says he does not want an arms race, has often spoken of a new generation of Russian nuclear weapons that he says are unequalled and can hit almost anywhere in the world. Some Western experts have questioned how advanced they are.The weapons, some of which have yet to be deployed, include the Poseidon underwater nuclear drone, designed to be carried by submarines, and the Tsirkon (Zircon) hypersonic cruise missile, which can be deployed on surface ships.The combination of speed, manoeuvrability and altitude of hypersonic missiles, capable of travelling at more than five times the speed of sound, makes them difficult to track and intercept. Speaking in St Petersburg at an annual naval parade that showcases Russia’s best ships, nuclear submarines and naval aviation, Putin said the navy’s capabilities were growing and it would get 40 new vessels this year. He did not specify when it would receive new hypersonic weapons, but suggested that day was drawing closer.“The widespread deployment of advanced digital technologies that have no equals in the world, including hypersonic strike systems and underwater drones, will give the fleet unique advantages and increased combat capabilities,” Putin said.In a separate statement released via Russian news agencies, the defence ministry said testing of the Belgorod, the first submarine capable of carrying the Poseidon drones, was underway and testing of the weapons systems was nearing completion.“Work is being successfully completed to create modern weapons systems for the Navy,” it was cited as saying.Putin last year threatened to deploy hypersonic missiles on ships and submarines that could lurk outside U.S. territorial waters if the United States moved to deploy intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe.Washington has not deployed such missiles in Europe, but Moscow is worried it might.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-navy-to-get-hypersonic-nuclear-strike-weapons-says-putin/story-rVDpUSAXC4NCveXlFldRXI.html
26-07-2020||World||Staff leaving US Chengdu consulate under high security as deadline looms||Staff of the US consulate in Chengdu made final efforts to clear the premises on Sunday as security remained tight outside, ahead of a Monday closure ordered by Beijing as China-US relations continue to worsen.A mini tourist atmosphere prevailed outside the facility on a tree-lined street on a hot Sunday, as onlookers shared sidewalk space with dozens of uniformed and plainclothes police opposite the entrance.Consulate closures in Houston and Chengdu have escalated a sharp deterioration in ties between the world’s two biggest economies, which were already their worst in decades amid disputes over trade and technology, the Covid-19 pandemic, China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea and its clampdown on Hong Kong.Police asked people to move on when crowds formed outside the consulate, as onlookers took photos and videos of what they expected would be the last time to see the compound in US hands. The street was closed to traffic, except for consular or police vehicles let through by police.China on Friday ordered the closure of the Chengdu consulate in the southwestern provide of Sichuan. That means an evacuation deadline of 10 a.m. (0200 GMT) on Monday, according to the editor of a state-run tabloid.In Houston on Friday a group of men accompanied by a US State Department official were seen forcing open a door at the Chinese consulate, shortly after the US closure order took effect for a facility that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called “a hub of spying and intellectual property theft”.A coach that had been on the Chengdu consulate premises on Saturday left on Sunday morning. It was unclear who or what was inside. Since Friday, staff have been seen coming and going, including at least one with a suitcase. Removal vans entered and left on Saturday and Sunday.“China’s response was reciprocal,” said a 63-year-old local resident who gave only his surname, Yang. The situation “is quite regrettable.”On the Chengdu police account on Weibo, similar to Twitter, some netizens were asking the authorities to be lenient toward to a man who lit a firework outside the consulate Friday.“I believe our country is so powerful, so it has the ability to handle it properly, and provide me with enough safety,” said a 25-year-old finance worker surnamed Zhao when she passed by the consulate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/staff-leaving-us-chengdu-consulate-under-high-security-as-deadline-looms/story-rxlrWx61fYROmzuwbo2WeL.html
26-07-2020||World||DNA change, microchips: False claims made about Covid-19 vaccines on social media||The world is working on a vaccine which can check the spread of Covid-19 that has killed lakhs across the globe. From Americas to Australia, there is hardly any major country left which is not affected by the coronavirus disease.But since its outbreak, fake information on social media too has been flowing incessantly. The ‘infodemic’ has led to numerous false claims being made on WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms.In March, when India had just entered the first phase of the lockdown, fake bank account details were circulated for contributions to the government relief funds.There are also a number of other such misinformation being circulated including about the Covid-19 treatment and on ways to avoid getting infected from the deadly coronavirus.In fact, the Press Information Bureau (PIB) launched a fact-checking Twitter handle which keeps on debunking such news.And since the time the Oxford University announced the results of its vaccine candidate, the focus of the rumour mill has been the human trials and vaccine safety.One of the videos being widely viewed on Facebook falsely claims that people who will be administered Covid-19 vaccine will see their DNA change. The video has been made by US-based osteopath Carrie Madej.Without giving any evidence, she also claims that these vaccines will link people up to an artificial intelligence interface.According to the results presented by the Oxford University, their vaccine Astrazeneca will trigger immunity response against the Sars-CoV-2 virus by invoking the T-cells. Moreover, the researchers have said that the vaccine will undergo rigorous trials and a series of checks before it is recommended for widespread public use.Then there was a claim that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said in an interview that he expects 7,00,000 people to develop negative side effects from a coronavirus vaccine. In fact, some of the posts falsely quoted Gates to say that 7,00,000 people will die after taking Covid-19 vaccines.The interview happened in April, but the clips started circulating in July.The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation confirmed in a statement that Gates’ reference was hypothetical. “Strong scientific evidence shows that vaccines are safe and they have a proven track record of preventing diseases,” the statement said. “Experts believe that a vaccine against Covid-19 will be critical to ending this pandemic ​once clinical trials show that they are safe and effective in a broad group of people.”There was more controversy and false claims regarding the vaccine work being done by Gates. Some of the posts on the social media said that the tech billionaire is planning to implant microchips in people through Covid-19 vaccine. This theory was propounded by Russian Communist Party Gennady Zyuganov in May. In a column, Zyuganov attacked “capital globalism” and claimed that the mandatory vaccination plan is a “ploy by so-called globalists to implant chip in every human being so that their movements could be monitored”.Gates said in an interview last week that he wants the truth to reach people and hoped the fake news “dies down”.Gates and a foundation led by him and his wife Melinda are working to find a vaccine for Covid-19. In February, the foundation had announced that it is donating US $100 million to vaccine research and treatment efforts.Another false claim made through memes is that the 50 million fatalities reported during the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918 were caused by vaccines.The US Centres Centers for Disease Control has called it “the most severe pandemic in recent history”, but stated that there was no vaccine at that time which caused such a large number of fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dna-change-microchips-false-claims-made-about-covid-19-vaccines-on-social-media/story-d0b1SmhDUAzG3Ryq3zUJCN.html

Sri Lanka has already extended the polling time for the twice-postponed August 5 parliamentary elections by one hour after conducting several mock polls in adherence to the safety guidelines due to the coronavirus pandemic.President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on March 2 dissolved the Parliament, six months ahead of schedule, and called for snap polls on April 25. However, the election commission in mid-April postponed the elections by nearly two months to June 20 due to the coronavirus outbreak in the island nation.The commission last month informed the apex court that the polls cannot be held on June 20 because of the coronavirus pandemic and the new date was decided following a unanimous decision reached between the members of the commission. Sri Lanka’s coronavirus tally currently stands at 2,764 with 11 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-sri-lanka-to-conduct-advance-polling-for-people-under-quarantine/story-jjwHG2PcepJZ28hG4BuLZM.html

Malaysia has stepped up maritime patrols since the outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic in a bid to stop Rohingya boats from landing.Although some have made it ashore many boats have been turned back, sparking anger from rights groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-24-rohingya-migrants-feared-drowned-off-malaysia-report/story-3VE7mfcBYgdeQVpA67DvyL.html

Also read: China tried to jab India with a new claim on Bhutan. Why it has boomerangedThe messaging behind the PLA’s latest drill is directed at the US, which had also, earlier this month, deployed two of its frontline aircraft carriers and their strike groups comprising more battleships, in the SCS besides flying reconnaissance aircraft in the region.The PLA, however, did not share the specifics of the exercise.Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert, told the nationalistic Global Times tabloid that maritime live-fire drills by the air force usually include shooting aircraft and surface vessels.“Such drills could train to secure air superiority and target hostile warships in the SCS,” Song said.In a potential anti-ship exercise featuring the PLA’s Rocket Force, ballistic missiles can target large surface vessels and heavy anti-ship cruise missiles could also conduct long-range strike from 300 to 400 kilometres away, Song told the tabloid.Earlier in the month, China’s air force held live-fire drills and sent more fighter jets to one of its bases in the SCS, official media reported.A brigade under the PLA Southern Theater Command Navy aviation forces based in south China’s Hainan Province held live-fire maritime target attack drills with JH-7 fighter bombers, China National Radio (CNR) reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-begins-live-fire-drills-with-powerful-ammo-near-south-china-sea/story-rtUlQhCKpIAkU5Okj1HL5O.html

City police declared an “unlawful assembly” around 11pm, and what appeared to be tear gas was deployed to disperse the group.Protesters had been planning for days the demonstration that was called “Richmond Stands with Portland,” news outlets reported, in an apparent reaction to ongoing tensions between protesters and US agents at the federal courthouse in Oregon’s largest city.Weeks of nationwide unrest have struck several US cities since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25.Saturday’s protest in Richmond started at a park and then demonstrators marched to police headquarters, according to news outlets.Police tweeted a photo of rocks, batteries and other items the department said were thrown at its officers during the protest. A video also showed an officer extinguishing a mattress on fire in the middle of a road.Glass windows were also shattered at a Chipotle restaurant and a Virginia Commonwealth University dorm, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fires-set-windows-shattered-in-virginia-in-solidarity-with-protestors-of-portland/story-xAbBzsrFzo1AxuA7P39SWP.html

Corruption charges against Netanyahu have further fuelled the demonstrations.“Bibi, go home,” read one sign held by a protester. Another placard read “Everyone can see that the emperor has lost his clothes.” Hundreds of protesters Saturday also gathered outside Netanyahu’s beach house in the upscale town of Caesarea.Last week, police used water cannons to disperse crowds in Jerusalem.After what has been called a hasty and erratic reopening of the economy in May, infections shot up with the average number of new cases daily at 2,000. The country’s economy has been battered by virus restrictions and the unemployment rate has skyrocketed to nearly 20%.Protesters say the government’s offers of financial assistance have been nowhere near enough.The protests came in the shadow of Netanyahu’s corruption trial which resumed this month. Hearings will start in January. He is charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a series of scandals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israelis-continue-protests-against-pm-netanyahu-s-handling-of-covid-19-pandemic/story-dMO3c0jEZ5LWoVZTcChtRP.html

According to federal officials, the infection is linked to recalled batches of salad mixes by Fresh Express production facility located in Illinois.The salads mixes contained red cabbage, iceberg lettuce and carrots and other products by Fresh Express. The first few cases of infections were reported between May and this month across 11 US states including Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Wisconsin.“The FDA, along with CDC and state and local partners continue to investigate a multistate outbreak of Cyclospora infections potentially linked to salad products that were made by Fresh Express containing iceberg lettuce, red cabbage, and carrots and that were sold in several regions of the United States. The investigation includes Fresh Express branded products as well as products made by Fresh Express for retail store brands sold at ALDI, Giant Eagle, Hy-Vee, Jewel-Osco, ShopRite, and Walmart. Investigators continue to look into whether other retail brands may be impacted,” the FDA said in a release.Also read: North Korea’s Kim Jong Un locks down city after suspected Covid-19 caseThe US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has urged people to steer clear of salads. “Consumers should not eat, and restaurants and retailers should not sell or serve any of the recalled products. These products may either be branded with the Fresh Express label, or they may be branded with a number of retail store brand labels. The recalled retail store brands are ALDI Little Salad Bar, Giant Eagle, Hy-Vee, Jewel-Osco Signature Farms, ShopRite Wholesome Pantry, and Walmart Marketside,” the FDA stated.Cyclospora, a microscopic parasite, affects the intestinal tract and causes diarrhoea that can last for over a month. A person may start showing the symptoms nearly a week after consuming contaminated food or water.This comes at a time when the United States is battling the Covid-19 pandemic. With over 4 million coronavirus infections till date, the US tops the global coronavirus tally followed by Brazil and India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-600-people-fall-sick-in-us-after-contracting-infection-from-bagged-salads/story-9mWy4jBO0pfMKAgf3kh5gP.html

State Premier Daniel Andrews said the deaths included seven men and three women. A man in his 40s became one of the youngest Covid-19 fatalities in Australia. There are 459 new infections, the 21st straight day of triple-figure increases. The fatalities bring Victoria’s toll to 71 and Australia’s national tally to 155. A total of 228 people are hospitalized in Victoria, 42 in intensive care. Victoria processed 42,973 tests on Saturday, Andrews said, “far and away the biggest testing result that we’ve seen on a single day.” He said he is not currently planning to extend the lockdown in Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city.

26-07-2020||World||Protesters clash with cops amid anger over surge of federal agents in major cities of US||Police in Seattle used flashbang grenades and pepper spray Saturday against protesters who set fire to construction trailers outside a youth jail, amid a wave of public anger over President Donald Trump’s planned “surge” of federal agents into major cities.The sounds of repeated small detonations rang out in the streets of the city in Washington state, and smoke rose from an area where demonstrators had set fire to trailers by a construction site for the youth detention facility, an AFP reporter observed.Demonstrators slashed car tires and smashed trailer windows.Police in riot gear faced off against the demonstrators, some of whom held up umbrellas against falling pellets of pepper spray.The Seattle Times newspaper quoted police as saying 16 people were arrested on suspicion of assault against officers, obstruction and failure to disperse.The latest spasm of violence came after police and federal agents fired tear gas and forcefully dispersed protesters further south in Portland early Saturday, also in anger over Trump’s heavily-criticized “surge” of security forces.The city, the biggest in the state of Oregon, has seen nightly protests against racism and police brutality for nearly two months, initially sparked by the death of unarmed African American George Floyd at the hands of police in Minnesota. Portland is also a stage for the highly controversial crackdown by federal agents ordered by Trump -- one that is not supported by local officials there, and which many say smacks of authoritarianism.Civil unrest was not only confined to Portland. On Saturday, three members of a black militia were shot in Louisville, Kentucky at a Black Lives Matter protest, local media reported, citing police. Their injuries were not life-threatening.The protest, to demand justice for a black woman who was killed by police as she slept in her home, drew members of the black militia and a rival far-right militia, with the heavily armed groups facing off while separated by riot police. The groups dispersed peacefully later Saturday afternoon.In Portland, Friday’s demonstration was mainly peaceful, with crowds playing music and dancing, blowing soap bubbles and setting off fireworks.But it ended -- like many before it -- in a showdown between protesters and police, which escalated in a haze of tear gas and flashbang devices.One group of protesters formed a line with umbrellas and makeshift shields to try to protect themselves, as at least two fires burned outside fences around a federal courthouse.Tear gas was first fired around 11:00 pm. By 2:30 am police and federal agents were clearing the scene outside the courthouse with tear gas, pushing protesters back. Earlier, protesters who spoke to AFP complained of the federal agents’ presence in the city and voiced their support for the Black Lives Matter movement, which helped drive demonstrations across the country for weeks after Floyd’s killing.“I don’t like what’s happening down here, what Trump is doing,” Mike Shikany, a 55-year-old aerospace engineer, said, adding he did not “want to get anywhere near the little green men,” meaning the federal troops.Portland retiree Jean Mullen, 74, said that without pressure nothing would change. “It’s time to become the country we always brag about being. And we can’t brag anymore, about anything. We aren’t first in anything and it’s a terrible, terrible thing to see at the end of my life,” she said.The inspector general of the US Justice Department on Thursday opened an official investigation into the federal crackdown, but a federal judge in Oregon on Friday rejected a legal bid by the state to stop agents from detaining protesters.Trump, who is campaigning for re-election in November on a platform of “law and order,” announced on Wednesday a “surge” of federal agents to crime hotspots including Chicago, following an increase in violence in the nation’s third-largest city.Agents deployed there will partner with local law enforcement, not riot control forces as seen in Portland.Local officials have warned they would draw the line at any Portland-style deployment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protesters-clash-with-cops-amid-anger-over-surge-of-federal-agents-in-major-cities/story-d40VbKfBn1uha14WGikVzH.html

Sidelining the civil institutions altogether would allow Xi to play on both sides of the board,” he said.Questioning the nature of the deal, the author said that the secretary of maritime affairs refused to show the highly confidential agreement to even the Senate Standing Committee on Finance.The article stated that by 2050 Xi plans to have ultimate control of the majority of the emerging-market economies.Andani said, “Xi doesn’t want the Belt and Road Initiative or any of its components to be held accountable or face resistance. He knows that his Chinese Dream of indoctrination of a majority of free people of the world by 2050 will not be fulfilled if the people of the countries victimised by the BRI come to know about his strategy to destroy their futures and those of their future generations.”He said that the CPEC authority will be the Communist Party of China’s (CPC’s) authorised representative in Pakistan responsible for conceiving, implementing, expanding, enforcing, controlling, regulating, coordinating, monitoring, evaluating and carrying out all activities related to the CPEC.The CPEC authority will also the constitutional power to initiate any investigation or even impose penalties against any public office holder, including the Prime Minister and President of Pakistan, or those directly or indirectly involved in CPEC-related activities wilfully resisting directions, instructions or specified orders, Andani said while adding, “Even the Prime Minister’s powers will be limited to what is specified in the CPEC Authority Bill 2020. So he too will have to obey Xi’s commands.”“The truth is that Xi is burdening those countries in debt traps while they are already suffering from intense balance-of-payments crises. Xi will slowly poison Pakistan and other poor economies by creating extreme shortages of foreign-exchange reserves. In the end, these countries will have to accept the invasion of their political and economic systems by the Communist Party of China,” he said.The author opined that the “selected” government of Pakistan is fulfilling Xi’s dreams at the cost of the country’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and freedom of its people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-plans-to-control-pakistan-s-politics-economy-via-cpec-authority-report/story-HrIv80Vg8PtPZDgNQHomOO.html

Such behaviour only underlines the importance of the review the (UK) government is currently conducting”, he added.Tensions between Britain and Russia have been high in recent weeks, as Britain has targeted Russians with new sanctions, accused Russian actors of trying to meddle in last year’s election and said Moscow has tried to hack into vaccine research.Separately, Britain announced on Monday it would suspend its extradition treaty with Hong Kong in an escalation of a dispute with China over its introduction of a national security law for the former British colony.Earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered equipment from China’s Huawei Technologies to be purged completely from Britain’s 5G network by the end of 2027.China - once courted as the prime source of investment in British infrastructure projects - has accused Britain of pandering to the United States.The Mail on Sunday newspaper reported that Johnson was also set to overhaul the United Kingdom’s treason laws to counter threats posed by China and Russia, with the step likely to see a new Treason Act, a new Espionage Act and a rewriting of the Official Secrets Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-boost-ability-to-handle-space-threat-from-russia-china-uk-defence-secretary/story-3IFVYBb4AyzpbEkFK4HOFP.html

Hagia Sophia was previously a museum and most Greeks view it as central to their Orthodox Christian religion: church bells tolled in mourning across Greece on Friday.“We see that the targets of those countries who have made so much noise in recent days are not Hagia Sophia or the eastern Mediterranean,” Erdogan said in a televised speech.“(Their targets) are the presence itself of the Turkish nation and Muslims in this region,” he said. In a statement earlier on Saturday, the Turkish foreign ministry spokesman said “Greece showed once again its enmity towards Islam and Turkey with the excuse of reacting to Hagia Sophia Mosque being opened to prayers”.He strongly condemned hostile statements by the Greek government and parliament members and Turkish flag-burning in the Greek city of Thessaloniki.The Greek foreign ministry responded with its own statement, saying “the international community of the 21st century is stunned to observe the religious and nationalist fanatic ramblings of today’s Turkey.”On Friday, Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis called Turkey a “troublemaker”, and the conversion of the site an “affront to civilisation of the 21st century”.Greece and Turkey disagree on a range of issues from airspace to maritime zones in the eastern Mediterranean and ethnically split Cyprus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-and-greence-in-war-of-words-of-over-prayers-at-hagia-sophia/story-x0utu1pkVGfrWc7ykJz5NI.html

I hope I’ll see it in real life one day,” Queen Elizabeth said after watching the portrait be unveiled via video conference.The 94-year-old monarch also thanked foreign ministry staff for their efforts to repatriate British nationals who struggled to return home due to coronavirus restrictions, and also heard about international efforts to develop a vaccine.“Her Majesty the Queen is our best diplomat,” Simon McDonald, head of Britain’s diplomatic service, said.The queen sat twice for the portrait by Escofet, who was born in Barcelona but has spent most of her life in the United Kingdom, and won Britain’s most prestigious prize for portraiture in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-sees-new-portrait-unveiled-at-britain-s-foreign-office/story-x99380LLVh8NepBBcDKHZJ.html

The two are inextricably linked,” said the former chief executive of Unilever Paul Polman, who signed the letter.Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, who has campaigned to have the 2013 death of her nine-year-old daughter from asthma officially linked to illegal levels of air pollution, said she hoped that as a father with a baby, Johnson would understand the impact.“This is not an elitist conversation, air pollution affects the poorest and vulnerable the most, and we need to continue the fight,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.“Every time the prime minister goes ‘build, build, build’, I worry there’s nothing green about the initiatives,” said Kissi-Debrah, who is the World Health Organization’s advocate for health and air quality.Parents plan to gather outside the prime minister’s residence in Downing Street on Sunday to coincide with the letter, coordinated by climate activist groups Mothers Rise Up and Parents for Future UK.The parents, standing a metre apart, will carry hand-held wind turbines to symbolise the need for low-carbon investment.The British government has a binding target to cut its greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050.In June, Britain’s independent Committee on Climate Change said the country would have to move faster to achieve that goal.Its chairman John Gummer emphasised the need to take advantage of a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” presented by the pandemic to shift the economy onto a greener path.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/children-need-green-pandemic-recovery-celebrity-parents-tell-uk-pm-boris-johnson/story-dPxgfYjvNYLZXJAPUUl26H.html
26-07-2020||World||Covid-19-weary Texas braces as Hurricane Hanna makes landfall||Hurricane Hanna made a second landfall in Texas on Saturday afternoon.The first hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season made its second landfall at around 6.15 pm in eastern Kenedy County, about 15 miles north-northwest of Port Mansfield. It had maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (145 kph).Earlier in the afternoon, the storm had made landfall on Padre Island, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) north of Port Mansfield, which is about 130 miles (209 km) south of Corpus Christi and about 70 miles (113 km) north of Brownsville. Hurricane Hanna roared ashore onto the Texas Gulf Coast, bringing winds that lashed the shoreline with rain and storm surge, and even threatening to bring possible tornadoes to a part of the country trying to cope with a spike in coronavirus cases. The hurricane made landfall around 5 pm CDT about 15 miles (24 kilometers) north of Port Mansfield, which is about 130 miles (209 km) south of Corpus Christi and about 70 miles (113 km) north of Brownsville. As of Saturday evening, it had maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (145 kph). Many parts of Texas, including the area where Hanna came ashore, have been dealing with a surge in coronavirus cases in recent weeks, but local officials said they were prepared for whatever the storm might bring. Corpus Christi Mayor Joe McComb said Saturday that he had seen some residents doing last-minute shopping for supplies, but he warned that if that hadn’t been done already, people should stay at home and ride out the storm. “We’ve been staying at home for five months because of the corona(virus). ... So staying home doesn’t sound real popular, but right now this is a real important matter,” McComb said, adding that residents should remember to wear masks if they have to evacuate their homes. Steady rain fell Saturday in Corpus Christi and the winds got stronger.Sherry Boehme, who lives in a condo along the beach there, said the storm’s approach had increased the anxiety she has felt during the pandemic. The 67-year-old has mostly stayed at home because of health issues related to chronic lung disease. “It’s almost like a double whammy to us,” Boehme said Saturday by phone. “I think it’s made a lot of people nervous. ... We’ll get through it. Everybody is good and strong and sticks together.” Boehme said she’d already felt 60 mph wind gusts at her condo and had seen a surge of water coming from the bay. Most people seemed to be staying home, as traffic was light, she said. Judge Barbara Canales, Nueces County’s top elected official, said officials were highly concerned about storm surge that was already moving inland. Live webcam footage showed waves sweeping over popular Whitecap Beach near Corpus Christi hours before the hurricane was expected to make landfall. First responders in Corpus Christi proactively placed barricades near intersections to have them ready to go if streets began to flood, McComb said. More than 35,000 people throughout South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, were without power early Saturday evening, according to AEP Texas. Corpus Christi is in Nueces County, where health officials made headlines when they revealed that 60 infants tested positive for Covid-19 from July 1 to 16. Farther south in Cameron County, which borders Mexico and where Brownsville is located, more than 300 confirmed new cases have been reported almost daily for the past two weeks, according to state health figures. The past week has also been the county’s deadliest of the pandemic. The main hazard from Hanna was expected to be flash flooding. Forecasters said Hanna could bring 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) of rain through Sunday night — with isolated totals of 18 inches (46 centimeters) — in addition to coastal swells that could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Coastal states scrambled this spring to adjust emergency hurricane plans to account for the virus, and Hanna loomed as the first big test. South Texas officials’ plans for any possible rescues, shelters and monitoring of the storm will have the pandemic in mind and incorporate social distancing guidelines and mask wearing. Gov Greg Abbott said Saturday that some sheltering would take place in hotel rooms so people could be separated. “We cannot allow this hurricane to lead to a more catastrophically deadly event by stoking additional spread of COVID-19 that could lead to fatalities,” Abbott said. Various resources and personnel to respond to the storm were on standby across the state, including search-and-rescue teams and aircraft. Mobile teams that can continue testing for Covid-19 were also being deployed. Abbott said he has issued a disaster declaration for 32 counties in Texas and had asked the federal government to approve a similar declaration. Tornadoes were also possible Saturday for parts of the lower to middle Texas coastal plain, forecasters said. A hurricane warning remained in effect for Port Mansfield to Mesquite Bay, which is north of Corpus Christi, and a tropical storm warning was in effect from Port Mansfield south to Barra el Mezquital, Mexico, and from Mesquite Bay north to High Island, Texas. Mexico’s northeasternmost states, coastal Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon just to its west, also took precautions ahead of the storm’s arrival. Tamaulipas was preparing shelters and disinfecting them to try to avoid spreading Covid-19, the state’s governor, Francisco Cabeza de Vaca, tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-weary-texas-braces-as-hurricane-hanna-makes-landfall/story-rDzjeTq8mHpCqm0ggcXcuN.html
26-07-2020||World||Hurricane Hanna makes landfall, rakes Texas coast with high wind||Hanna, 2020’s first Atlantic hurricane, made landfall on Padre Island Saturday evening, bringing “life-threatening” storm surges, flooding rains and tree-toppling winds to south Texas.The storm came ashore with 90-mile-per-hour (145 kmph) winds, the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory at 6 pm EDT. Hanna is moving west-south-west at about 8 miles per hour.A Category 1 storm, the lowest on the five-step Saffir Simpson scale, much of Hanna’s damage is likely to come from dangerous storm surge and flooding inland rains. Video of flooded and streets blocked with debris have been posted on Twitter. Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration for 32 counties in Hanna’s path.Three other named Atlantic storms have hit the US in 2020 so far but at below hurricane strength.“Life-threatening storm surge will continue along portions of the Texas coast,” Stacy Stewart, a senior hurricane specialist at the center, wrote in his forecast. “Hanna is expected to produce heavy rains across portions of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico.”Water in many Texas bays could reach 6 feet above high tide levels and residents in its path have been told to flee, a situation made more complicated by the presence of Covid-19. Seas are already starting to rise along the coast. Storm surges kill about half of all those who die in hurricanes.The storm could have an impact on cotton crops in the region, but Hanna’s most powerful winds are rather compact, stretching just 25 miles from its center, said Ryan Truchelut, president of WeatherTiger LLC in Tallahassee, Florida.While Hanna has prompted some offshore rigs to evacuate, the impact on oil and natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico has been muted.Hanna isn’t the only threat. Hurricane Douglas is still bearing down on Hawaii also 90-mph winds, the center said, although it’s weakened after peaking as Category 4 storm on Friday. Douglas was about 440 miles east of Hilo and on its current track it could clip Maui and Oahu overnight Sunday into Monday.Heavy rain is likely regardless of whether Douglas makes a direct strike on one of the Hawaiian islands or just passes by, and could touch off mudslides and floods. While it will weaken as it nears the chain, Douglas will probably be at least a Category 1 hurricane at that point. President Donald Trump approved an emergency declaration for the state.Meanwhile, compact Gonzalo fell apart near the Caribbean Windward Islands. Forecasters are also watching a tropical wave of thunderstorms moving off Africa that has a 70% chance of becoming Isaias, 2020’s ninth named storm.“The tropical wave is a major concern for the week ahead,” Truchelut said. “This system is likely to develop, and may target the Southeastern US in around 10 days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-hanna-makes-landfall-rakes-texas-coast-with-high-wind/story-NBuUnVSSuoq4t8XWgDaWFP.html
26-07-2020||World||North Korea’s Kim Jong Un locks down city after suspected Covid-19 case: Report||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un placed the city of Kaesong near the border with South Korea under total lockdown after a person was found with suspected Covid-19 symptoms, saying he believes “the vicious virus” may have entered the country, state media reported Sunday.If the person is officially declared a virus patient, he or she would be the North’s first confirmed coronavirus case.North Korea has steadfastly said it has no single virus case on its territory, a claim questioned by outside experts.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The lockdown was declared Friday afternoon. The Korean Central News Agency said the suspected case is a runaway who had fled to South Korea years ago before illegally crossing the border into the North early last week.KCNA said respiratory secretion and blood tests showed the person “is suspected to have been infected” with the virus.It said the suspected case and others who were in contact as well as those who have been to Kaesong in the last five days were placed under quarantine.Describing its anti-virus efforts as a “matter of national existence,” North Korea earlier this year shut down nearly all cross-border traffic, banned foreign tourists and mobilized health workers to quarantine anyone with symptoms.But the Kaesong lockdown is the first such known measure taken in a North Korean city to stem the pandemic.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Foreign experts say a coronavirus outbreak in North Korea could cause dire consequences because of its poor public health care infrastructure and chronic lack of medical supplies.Kaesong, a city with an estimated 200,000 people, is located just north of the heavily fortified land border with South Korea. It once hosted the Koreas’ jointly run industrial complex, which remains stalled since 2016 amid nuclear tensions. Last month, North Korea blew up an inter-Korean liaison office in Kaesong to protest a campaign by South Korean activists who have been sending anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border.During an emergency Politburo meeting Saturday, Kim also declared a state of emergency in the Kaesong area and “clarified the determination of the Party Central Committee to shift from the state emergency anti-epidemic system to the maximum emergency system and issue a top-class alert,” KCNA said.It quoted Kim as saying that there was “a critical situation in which the vicious virus could be said to have entered the country.”Kim said he took “the preemptive measure of totally blocking Kaesong City and isolating each district and region from the other within July 24 afternoon just after receiving the report on it,” according to KCNA.The Politburo meeting also discussed the “loose guard performance” at the border area where the suspected case crossed over to North Korea.KCNA said that Kim and other leaders were briefed on the results of an intensive investigation of a military unit responsible for the border crossing case and discussed administering “a severe punishment.”More than 33,000 North Koreans have fled to South Korea over the past 20 years to avoid poverty and political suppression, mostly via the long, porous border with China.Buy it’s rare for North Korean refugees to return to their homeland by crossing the mine-strewn inter-Korean border.The South Korean government has no immediate comments on the North Korean announcement.“Blaming an alleged return defector for bringing COVID-19 into the country is likely intended to shift blame for spread of the virus away from China and Pyongyang and on to Seoul,” Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said.“This may also be a tactic for ratcheting up diplomatic pressure on (South Korea) and trying to further dissuade North Koreans from defecting to the South,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-locks-down-city-after-suspected-covid-19-case-report/story-Fgx6aspHmHLAnPal2vSEgL.html
26-07-2020||World||6,500 Pakistan terrorists present in Afghanistan, most belong to TTP: UN report||The total number of Pakistani terrorists in Afghanistan is estimated at between 6,000 and 6,500, most of them belonging to the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), posing a threat to both countries, according to a report by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).The 26th report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team concerning ISIS, al-Qaeda and associated individuals and entities was submitted by the 1267 monitoring committee of the UNSC.The report stated that TTP, which is a large terrorist group present in Afghanistan, is led by Amir Noor Wali Mehsud, supported by his deputy Qari Amjad and spokesperson Mohammad Khorasani.“TTP has claimed responsibility for various high-profile attacks in Pakistan and has facilitated others by Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA) and Lahskhar-e-Islam. Many former TTP members have already joined ISIL-K (Islamic State of Iraq and Levant-Khorasan) and member states expect that the group and its various splinter groups will align themselves with ISIL-K,” it said.“The total number of Pakistani foreign terrorist fighters in Afghanistan, posing a threat to bothcountries, is estimated at between 6,000 and 6,500, most of them with TTP,” the report noted.This report has yet again proved that Pakistan continues to be sheltering and supporting terrorists on its soil.On July 21, Islamabad’s claim of not aiding terror was busted after Pakistani ID cards were recovered from the bodies of terrorists killed in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province, Khaama news agency reported. In another recent attack, 25 Taliban terrorists, including 12 Pakistanis, were killed in an airstrike by NATO Rescue Support in Takht-e-Pol town of the province.Last month, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan raked up a controversy by calling slain terrorist and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden a “shaheed” (martyr) while addressing the National Assembly.Amid frequent reports of Pakistan’s misdemeanour, the country received another extension on the ‘Grey List’ during the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) plenary session on June 25. Islamabad is yet to complete 13 out of 27 items of its FATF Action Plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6-500-pakistan-terrorists-present-in-afghanistan-most-belong-to-ttp-un-report/story-PrwAo3ZXzvUptauzMsDQfM.html
26-07-2020||World||UK quarantines travellers from Spain, recommends ‘only essential travel’||Britain abruptly imposed a two-week quarantine on all travellers arriving from Spain after a surge of coronavirus cases, a dramatic and sudden reversal on Saturday to the opening of the European continent to tourism after months of lockdown.The quarantine requirement was due to take effect from midnight (2300 GMT on Saturday), making it impossible for travellers to avoid it by rushing home.The British foreign ministry also announced it was recommending against all but essential travel to mainland Spain, a move likely to prompt tour operators to cancel package holidays and trigger claims against insurers.Spain’s Canary and Balearic Islands were not covered by the advice to avoid travel to the mainland, but holidaymakers returning to Britain from the islands will still be subject to quarantine on return.Britain’s government urged employers to be “understanding” towards staff who are unable to return to their place of work for two weeks after they return from holiday.The sudden British move followed steps this week by other European countries. On Friday Norway said it would re-impose a 10-day quarantine requirement for people arriving from Spain from Saturday, while France advised people not to travel to Spain’s northeastern region of Catalonia.But the total collapse of tourism from Britain would have far more impact. Britain accounted for more than 20% of the foreign visitors to Spain last year, the largest group by nationality. Tourism normally accounts for some 12% of Spain’s economy.Spain had been on a list of countries that the British government had said were safe for travellers to visit - meaning tourists returning home would not have to go into quarantine.The announcement of such lists just weeks ago had allowed Europe’s tourism sector to begin its revival after the near total shut-down prompted by the Covid-19 pandemic.Responding to the British measures, Spain said on Saturday it was a safe country with localised, isolated and controlled outbreaks of the coronavirus.A Spanish Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said Spain “respects decisions of the United Kingdom” and was in touch with the authorities there.The British move will affect not just Spain’s tourism sector but airlines and travel companies struggling to get back to business.Britain’s opposition Labour Party said the news was “deeply concerning” and called for support for British people affected.A ‘SAFE’ COUNTRYAntonio Perez, the mayor of Benidorm, a resort on Spain’s Costa Blanca that is hugely dependent on British tourists, called the move “another tough blow”.“We have suffered lot this year and then this happened. We thought that the British were going to come back but this makes things harder for now,” he said.Spain was one of the worst hit countries in Europe by the pandemic, with more than 290,000 cases, and more than 28,000 deaths. It imposed very strict lockdown measures to contain the spread, gradually easing them earlier this summer.But the last few weeks saw a surge of cases, forcing local lockdowns to be reimposed in some areas.On Friday Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya told CNN television that like many countries around the world that have managed to control the disease, Spain “has outbreaks but the governments -- both national and regional -- are working to isolate cases as soon as they appear”.The Catalonia region reported 1,493 new coronavirus cases and three deaths on Saturday. The regional government has urged residents of Barcelona to stay at home, and ordered all discos to shut from Saturday for the next 15 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-quarantines-travellers-from-spain-recommends-only-essential-travel/story-hif0U5tAhwF1aAx6JQvg4H.html

The incident happened after terrorists opened fire on the security forces during their routine patrolling near Pidarak in Kech district, approximately 35 kilometres southeast of Turbat, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.“During the exchange of fire, Lance Naik Javed Karim was killed while three other soldiers got injured,” the ISPR said.Security forces have come under increasing terror attacks by terrorists in Baluchistan and also the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in recent weeks.On July 14, three soldiers were killed and eight others injured when they were ambushed by terrorists in the Panjgur district of Baluchistan.In May, six security personnel of the Frontier Corps, including a Major, were killed in an explosion in the Buleda area of the province.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-soldier-killed-three-injured-in-terror-attack-in-pak/story-xud8DKHw35pVjMYICC3TlL.html
26-07-2020||India||AG wants streaming of court proceedings||Attorney General KK Venugopal advocated video-streaming of court proceedings across India so that court hearings anywhere in the country are accessible, and “capacity” of lawyers and judges can be ascertained.He said one silver lining of Covid-19 and the lockdown of courts was that it compelled the legal fraternity to adopt e-filing of cases and hearing through video conferencing.“I would suggest that we go one step further and have video streaming as well so that the entire population of lawyers will be able to listen to any case which is going on in any court in this country. We would be able to judge the capacity of judges and lawyers, and the nature of cases which are being handled in courts including lower courts, district courts, high courts and the Supreme Court,” he said.Venugopal was speaking at the launch of a district-level awareness programme in regional languages on e-court services by the Supreme Court e-committee.“I never believed that we could have progressed to this extent. Now I am optimistic that in due course, all courts in the country will be e-courts. I am sure that in the next one year, the whole of this country will be familiar with e-courts. We should congratulate the e-committee for what they have achieved,” he said at the inaugural function held via video conference on July 25.The work of the Supreme Court e-committee has been on an overdrive after the Covid-19-induced lockdown. The e-committee is proposing to introduce radical changes to filing of cases across the country by introduction and operationalisation of e-filing to replace physical filing of cases.After the lockdown imposed on March 25, courts across the country had to adopt video conference and e-filing, albeit as an ad-hoc measure to tide over the shutdown of courts due to pandemic. But e-filing is likely to be made a permanent fixture of our court system in the coming years.The work towards this end as far as the Supreme Court is concerned is at an advanced stage and a new e-filing module is expected to be rolled out soon. The e-committee is also in constant touch with high courts for digitization of records, and a standard operating procedure will be drawn up for high courts and district judiciary across the country for digitization. Supreme Court judge Justice DY Chandrachud, who is the chairperson of the e-committee, released a training manual, video tutorials and brochures in regional languages with regard to e-court services on July 25.The training manual, which is a step by step guide for e-filing of cases, was released in 11 regional languages — Assamese, Bengali, Nepali, Urdu, Mizo, Tamil, Hindi, Hindi-UP, Garo, Khasi, Pnar. Brochures, which would assist lawyers to familiarise themselves on e-filing, were released in 14 regional languages.Speaking on the necessity of such a step, justice Chandrachud highlighted that there is a technological divide between metropolitan cities and rural areas in India, and on several occasions, lawyers at the district and taluka level do not have access to information technology (IT).“There is a technological divide in India. Those who work and live in metros have the best facilities at their command in terms of IT. But the backbone of the judicial administration in the country is provided by advocates who work at taluka and district levels. The first interface of citizens with justice and his or her attempt to remedy injustice is when they contact an advocate at the taluka and district level and go to their chambers for remedying their problems”, he pointed out.Therefore, unless the lawyers at taluka and district level are also carried along and made part of the e-courts project, the mission will not succeed, he said.As part of the first stage of the awareness programme, the e-committee trained 25 master trainers on June 20 through video conferencing — one for each high court in the country.In the second stage, the 25 master trainers, in turn, trained 461 master trainers across the country in their respective states and respective regional languages through video conference.In third phase, these 461 master trainers will be conducting the training programme in every district of the country for the advocates. “This project we have conceived is an attempt to spread knowledge of Information and Communication technology initiatives among the members of the bar. Our target is to attain 100% computer literacy among members of Indian bar,” justice Chandrachud added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ag-wants-streaming-of-court-proceedings/story-zpZgIK3GTOdsxXnqb46JRK.html
26-07-2020||India||After killing of LeT man, no resident of Srinagar is in terrorist ranks: IGP||Srinagar: A day after Lashkar-e-Taiba(LeT) commander Ishfaq Rashid Khan along with another terrorist was killed by security forces in an encounter in Ranbirgarh-Panzinara area of Srinagar, Kashmir Inspector General of Police (IGP) Vijay Kumar on Sunday said that no resident of Srinagar is now among terrorist ranks. “After killing of LeT terrorist Ishfaq Rashid Khan yesterday, no resident of Srinagar district in terrorist ranks now,” Kashmir police’s twitter handle quoted IGP Kumar.However, the statement contradicts with the fact shared by Kumar on June 23 when he said that Hilal Ahmad, a PhD scholar of Bemina Srinagar who had gone missing during a hiking trip to Ganderbal on June 14, has joined Hizbul Mujahideen outfit. He is still unaccounted for.So far, 10 militants have been killed in Srinagar in various encounters - a few of them belonging from the district.The two militants killed on Saturday were trapped after a joint cordon and search operation was launched by JKP, 29 RR and CRPF in the said area.A police spokesman said that during the operation they were given an opportunity to surrender. “However they fired indiscriminately upon the joint search party, which was retaliated leading to an encounter. In the ensuing encounter, the two were killed,” he said.The bodies of the terrorists were sent to Ganderbal for their last rites. Earlier on July 3, after an encounter on the outskirts of Srinagar, Kumar had said that Srinagar city would never be terrorism-free as terrorists from other districts of the Valley keep on coming here. “Srinagar is a city where terrorists come often. Sometimes, they come for medical treatment, collecting funds or even for meetings. Srinagar can never be free of terrorism.”“Terrorists will keep on coming here. And when we get information about them, we will keep on carrying out encounters,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-killing-of-let-man-no-resident-of-srinagar-is-in-terrorist-ranks-igp/story-J6Wr5jJwe3ukfvhBqcrGAO.html

Police spokesman Manoj Kumar said that the seizure was done by a joint party of army and police at a checkpoint in Kupwara. “Ten kilograms of brown sugar, an AK-47 rifle, two pistols, 20 grenades and other ammunition recovered by a joint team of army and Kashmir Police during checking at Sadhna Top Kupwara in north Kashmir,” he said.Three persons travelling in two vehicles were arrested and the vehicles seized. “Some more arrests are expected,” he said.An army spokesman said that it was a ‘huge consignment’ of war-like stores and narcotics, and the arrests were made after getting inputs about smuggling. “An army dog, aided by detectors and scanners, facilitated the finding of hidden packages from the vehicle. The search operation led to apprehension of three suspects and seizure of two vehicles,” the spokesman said.More searches are going on in the area. “Joint search operation is in progress,” he said.On June 27, security forces had arrested two alleged drug and weapon smugglers and recovered a large cache of items in Kupwara district. Police had said that approximately 13.5kg of narcotics, estimated to be worth Rs65 crore, and arms and ammunition, including two pistols, four magazines, 55 pistol rounds, four hand grenades and 10 detonators, had been recovered.Earlier in June, the police said they had busted a narco-terror module in which three LeT militants were arrested. and 21kg heroin, worth Rs100 crore, and Indian amounting to Rs1.34 crore, were seized from their possession.In 2018, 12 kilograms of contraband substance was recovered along with two AK-56 rifles by the Border Security Force (BSF) in Tangdhar and four persons were arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trio-held-with-arms-narcotics-in-kashmir/story-jUARocpoLoXlLwcdgsYVEK.html
26-07-2020||India||Prez Kovind donates ₹20L to army hospital||NEW DELHI: On the 21st anniversary of the Kargil War victory, President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday donated Rs 20 lakh to the Army Hospital (Research and Referral) in Delhi, as a tribute to the soldiers who fought valiantly and sacrificed their lives in the war.The money presented to the Army Hospital (Research and Referral), will be used to purchase equipment to help doctors and paramedics combat the Covid-19 pandemic effectively, a statement from the President’s office said.“The President’s contribution to the Army Hospital has been made possible due to an exercise to economise expenditure in the Rashtrapati Bhavan and thus make more resources available to contain Covid-19. The President had earlier issued directions to reduce expenses by initiating a slew of measures in the Rashtrapati Bhavan. As a sequel to this initiative, he had earlier deferred the proposal to buy a limousine which was to be used for ceremonial occasions,” the statement said.In his role as the supreme commander of the armed forces, the president’s gesture will boost the morale of the front-line Covid warriors of the Army hospital, it said.On July 26, 1999, the Indian Army announced the successful culmination of “Operation Vijay”, declaring victory over Pakistani forces, after the nearly three-month war on the icy heights of Kargil district of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. The day is observed as “Kargil Vijay Diwas” to commemorate India’s victory in the war.Prime Minister Narendra Mod also paid homage to the armed forces saying that the valour of the soldiers continues to inspire generations. “On Kargil Vijay Diwas, we remember the courage and determination of our armed forces, who steadfastly protected our nation in 1999. Their valour continues to inspire generations,” the PM tweeted.Union defence minister Rajanth Singh visited the National War Memorial in the Capital on the occasion. “I congratulate all Indian citizens on the occasion of Kargil Vijay Diwas. The sacrifices made by soldiers, which helped us win the Kargil war, will always be a source of inspiration for the armed forces,” Singh said at a ceremony held to pay homage to the soldiers.Union home minister Amit Shah said Kargil Vijay Diwas is a symbol of India’s self-respect, unparalleled bravery and strong leadership.“I bow to the bravehearts, who, with their indomitable courage, drove the enemy from the difficult hills of Kargil and waved the tricolour there again. The country is proud of the heroes of India who are dedicated to protecting the motherland,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prez-kovind-donates-20l-to-army-hospital/story-f7l1p5tpeLk6OCCxVLHYpN.html
26-07-2020||India||Now, a religious theme park to come up in Haridwar; 52 Shakti Peeths identified||Uttarakhand government has identified 10 hectare land in Haridwar to develop religious theme park based on 52 Shakti Peeths, said officials. The religious theme park based on 52 Shakti Peeths will be developed at Kankhal in Haridwar district and is a part of the state government’s ambitious project to develop tourist destinations in each one of the thirteen districts of the state. A 10-hectare land has been earmarked at village Devpur Ahatmal near the ancient shrine of Shri Daksheshwar Mahadev temple in Kankhal area, where according to Hindu tradition, Sati (Parvati) plunged into fire leading to the formation of 52 Shakti Peeths. According to Hindu tradition, after the death of Sati, Lord Shiva carried her body and wandered throughout the subcontinent and Shakti Peeths are places blessed with the presence of shakti (power) due to the falling of body parts of Sati while Lord Shiva wandered. District magistrate Haridwar C Ravi Shankar said soon a detailed project report will be submitted to the state government and process for land clearance, no objection certificate from forest department has been started on a priority basis. “Basic infrastructural facilities, amenities, development of nearby tourist and religious places of importance will also be done under this project. At the chosen site a grand religious theme park featuring all the revered fifty-two Shakti Peeths will be featured which will be one of its kind. It surely will draw pilgrims and tourists from across the country,” said Shankar. District tourism officer Haridwar Seema Nautiyal said that the concept of 52 shrines theme park is unique as pilgrims and tourists will witness all these religious seats of importance at one destination. Lauding the development of the theme park where 52 Shakti Peeths replicas would be featured at one place, Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad, the apex body of all the Akhadas, said that this will add another place of religious importance to the already world-famous Haridwar. “Replica structures of all the fifty two shrines spread in India and outside will be a unique concept, which will provide one place for people to know about revered shrines, whose pilgrimage is of utmost religious significance for devotees,” said Mahant Hari Giri Maharaj, general secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad. “These Shakti Peeths are mentioned in Vedic texts and scriptures so putting them all together at one place will make the theme park almost a shrine itself,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-a-religious-theme-park-to-come-up-in-haridwar-52-shakti-peeths-identified/story-rn9fWp9nTNRXJfcF5XtpUK.html
26-07-2020||India||Gehlot says democracy is in danger, seeks session again||Jaipur/New Delhi: Democracy is in danger and the atmosphere in the country is worrisome, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said on Sunday, while requesting governor Kalraj Mishra to convene an assembly session.“He [the governor] is himself concerned about the coronavirus, and discussions on it will be held in the assembly. We will also discuss the economic impact of corona in the session,” Gehlot said, a day after his government sent a fresh proposal to Mishra and requested him to convene the House from July 31.The Congress has been demanding a special session in the wake of a power struggle between Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot. The Gehlot camp feels that a floor test in the House is its best bet to end the political crisis but accuses Mishra of delaying the session due to pressure from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government. Mishra denies the charge and says he will follow constitutional norms to convene a session.“The honourable governor is a veteran politician; he is friendly, mild-mannered. The position he holds is a constitutional one and carries a lot of dignity. I hope that he will grant us the permission soon and we will call the assembly,” Gehlot said on Twitter.On Friday, legislators supporting Gehlot staged a five-hour demonstration at Raj Bhavan. Gehlot himself said if the demand for convening a session was not met, MLAs will “not be responsible” if the people gherao the governor’s house.And on Sunday, the Rajasthan Congress decided it will not hold a protest outside Mishra’s residence in Jaipur even as the high command planned a nationwide demonstration outside Raj Bhavans.“We have submitted a revised cabinet note for holding an assembly session to the governor. We hope he will give his approval...soon,” Rajasthan Congress chief Govind Singh Dotasra said, announcing that there will be no such protest in Jaipur.Raj Bhavan officials, who did not want to be named, said the governor was yet to take a final call on convening a session.“There is a view in the party that this battle should be fought politically rather than legally...,” said a Congress functionary who requested anonymity.Pilot and 18 Congress MLAs moved the Rajasthan HC on July 16, challenging the disqualification notices issued to them by speaker CP Joshi. Subsequently, the high court on July 24 ordered status quo on the matter, admitted the writ petition by the Pilot camp and deferred its final verdict on the matter.Before that, on July 22, the speaker filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court, challenging a July 21 order of the high court directing speaker to defer disqualification proceedings.The top court will on Monday resume hearing Joshi’s plea related to whether or not courts can interfere with disqualification proceedings initiated by an assembly speaker against lawmakers even before a decision has been taken.“Speaker’s lawyers will be making arguments before the Supreme Court on Monday though the possibility of withdrawing the petition has not been ruled out,” said a second Congress functionary.The speaker’s lawyer in Jaipur, Prateek Kasliwal, said the decision regarding withdrawing the SLP will be taken by the legal team in Delhi.Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who has represented the speaker in the HC, said his party wanted a floor test in the Rajasthan assembly and was “begging” for it, but the governor was not convening the House and “delaying” the trust vote allegedly at the behest of the Centre.The fresh proposal sent to the governor did not have any mention of floor test though. A third Congress functionary who did not want to be named explained the rationale.“Since no party has demanded a floor test, there is no need to mention that the House has to be convened for holding it. As already stated by the chief minister, the House will discuss Covid-19 situation and also conduct some important legislative business,” he said.Senior Congress leader Ajay Maken accused the Centre of conspiring to topple his party’s governments in various states. “Small businesses are on the verge of closure. China has taken over our territory. But the Prime Minister, instead of fighting the coronavirus, the economic crisis and China, is conspiring to topple Congress governments,” he told reporters in Jaipur.The BJP, which blames differences in Congress’s for the crisis, was quick to hit back. BJP general secretary Bhupender Yadav said the Congress was “imploding in the face of internal feuds”. “...To save the party, the Congress needs to look within,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gehlot-says-democracy-is-in-danger-seeks-session-again/story-7JppUAML1lu3yUMiYKcuMK.html

A time capsule will be placed about 2,000 feet down in ground at Ram Temple construction site. So that in future anyone who wishes to study about the history of the temple, he’ll get the facts related to Ram Janmabhoomi, so that no new controversy can arise,” Chaupal told ANI here.He also said that the time capsule will be placed inside a Tamra Patra (copper plate) before being placed below the site.Chaupal, who is the lone Dalit member of the Trust, also said that soil from various teerths (pilgrimages) across the country and water from the sacred rivers is being brought to Ayodhya for ‘Abhisheka’ during the ‘bhoomi-pujan’ which is scheduled to be conducted on August 5 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“Water from sacred rivers and soil from teerths, where Lord Ram visited, will be used during the ‘abhisheka’ in ‘bhoomi pujan’. Our volunteers have been sending them from across the country to Ayodhya,” he said.Chaupal further slammed Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli for his recent statement over Ayodhya and Lord Ram and said that Oli knew neither about “Indian traditions or that of Nepal and was doing so just because of his greed for power.” PM Modi is scheduled to lay the foundation stone of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya on August 5, according to Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, the president of the temple trust.The construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya will begin after the ceremony to lay the foundation stone (bhoomi poojan) in which chief ministers of many states, ministers from the union cabinet and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat are also likely to participate.According to sources, the ‘bhoomi poojan’ of the temple is to be celebrated on the lines of the festival of light - Diwali - with all temples and houses across the country to be lit up with diyas and candles.The Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust, set up in accordance with the Supreme Court verdict, held its second meeting last week.In March this year, the ‘Ram Lalla’ idol was shifted to a temporary structure.The SC on November 9 last year had directed the central government to hand over the site at Ayodhya for the construction of a Ram temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/time-capsule-with-ram-janmbhoomi-s-history-facts-to-be-placed-below-temple-site-trust-member/story-jZFMuewPhQjo4wuh1c50vJ.html

ADJ Mahendra Kumar Tripathi, 56, died in a private hospital at Nagpur on Sunday morning and his son Abhiyanraj Tripathi, 33, was declared brought dead at the Nagpur hospital on Saturday night having been referred from a Betul hospital on Saturday evening, police said. The police suspect it to be a case of food poisoning but are looking into another angle to check if the judge and his family members were administered poison by someone in their food under any criminal conspiracy. Superintendent of Police (SP), Betul, Simala Prasad said, “We have initiated a probe in the matter.” Additional SP Shraddha Joshi said, “Tripathi and his two sons- Abhiyanraj and Sonu, 25, had eaten chapattis (bread) for dinner on July 21 while his wife had taken only rice, not chapaatis. On the same day, Tripathi and his sons had some snacks too given by a woman from Rewa, who is known to the family, in the evening. On July 22, Tripathi and his sons complained of uneasiness and diarrhoea. They took some medicines at home but their condition deteriorated on July 23. All three were admitted to a private hospital in Betul from where Tripathi’s younger Sonu, 25, was discharged on July 24.” Joshi, said, “When the condition of the judge and his elder son deteriorated further they were referred to a private hospital in Nagpur on Saturday evening. Abhiyanraj was declared brought dead at the hospital.” The additional SP said, “The doctors, who treated them in Betul, said the deceased might have consumed some poisonous substance through their food. The police have collected the samples of the raw food items including wheat flour and sent it to a laboratory for examination to see if it contained some poisonous substance. The police are waiting for the post mortem reports from Nagpur. We are also trying to contact the woman, who served snacks to them on July 21 evening,” Joshi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-madhya-pradesh-district-judge-son-die-of-suspected-food-poisoning/story-r1s95U3OAOIyIZqK2IEZjP.html
26-07-2020||India||Rajasthan banks on new testing guidelines, says test more if positivity rate high||In a revamped strategy to fight coronavirus disease outbreak, Rajasthan on Sunday issued guidelines directing testing of more samples in the areas of state with high positivity rate. Additionally, samples will be reviewed in the areas of Rajasthan where positivity rate is low. Breaching the 36,000-mark on Sunday, Rajasthan reported 1,132 new Covid-19 cases, pushing the cumulative tally to 36,430, out of which 9,852 cases are active. There have been 621 deaths in the state so far, the state bulletin released on late Sunday evening stated. The state has tested 1,377,850 samples until Sunday morning. The guidelines mention 12 categories of people for testing, four for random sampling. The detailed guideline also includes the process of when a sample tests positive or negative. “We have issued the guidelines to ensure that we stop the spread of infection by studying the patter of patients and spread. The objective is also to ensure treatment to positive cases,” medical and health department principal secretary Akhil Arora said. The guidelines said samples of the following categories of people should be taken for test: people who have undertaken an international travel in last 14 days and have symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI); contacts of positive cases who have ILI; all health and front line workers engaged in Covid-19 care and have ILI; people who have symptoms of SARI (Severe Acute Respiratory Infection); close contacts of positive cases who are asymptomatic; people with ILI in hot spots and containment zones; all indoor patients with ILI or with co-morbid conditions or belonging to the risk group; people who travelled in from outside and have ILI; health and other workers who are in close contacts of patients; all indoor patients in medical institutions. The guidelines also talk about random sampling of four categories of people. These are: super spreaders such as domestic helps, fruit and vegetable vendors, grocery stores, hair dressers, beauty parlours, saloons and iron men; vulnerable groups (people above 60 years, those with chronic illness, diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, cancer, heart disease, kidney disease, chronic lung disease) in congested areas; people in areas where large assemblies occur such as mandis, bus stands, airports, public transport, banks and other financial institutions; and corona warriors and health care workers in government and private hospitals with high patient load. “If random sample suggest high positivity rate, the department will focus more on the area,” the principal secretary said. The guidelines said sample of people who are asymptomatic and are contacts of positive cases should be taken between fifth and tenth day of the positive report. Sample of people who travelled into the state and have ILI should be tested after seven days of institutional isolation and before home isolation. The department has directed lab technicians to feed profile of person whose sample is being drawn, into the RT-PCR app. “Upload Aadhaar of the person; if that is not available, upload Aadhaar of head of the family. Also indicate if the sample is new or repeat,” the guidelines said. The guidelines said a person who has been tested should be informed about the results, positive or negative, within 24 hours. “It is responsibility of the hospital, lab or department officials that every person whose sample has been taken is informed about the test result,” the guidelines said. “If a sample tests negative and the person is asymptomatic, advise him precautions. If sample tests negative and the person has mild symptoms, provide him treatment at home. If the sample tests negative and the person has moderate or severe symptoms, send him to SARI ward of non-Covid hospital for treatment,” the guidelines said. For samples testing positive, the guidelines said if they are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, put them in home isolation. If they are from the vulnerable group, a health officer should monitor them, especially their oxygen saturation. The home isolation will be for 14 days and after expiry of this period, the person will sign an undertaking of informing the department if there are symptoms. The department will give hydroxycholoquine (HCQ) as prohylaxis to close contacts and care givers of people in home isolation. If such people don’t have home isolation facility, they will be kept in Covid care centres, the guidelines said. They need to be followed up for seven days if there is no fever for three days in a row. There’s no need for Covid test after the home isolation if the person is asymptomatic. The guidelines said people with moderate symptoms, who test positive, shall be treated in Covid health centres, and those with severe symptoms, in dedicated Covid hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-banks-on-new-testing-guidelines-says-test-more-if-positivity-rate-high/story-pCh0VaQazQkV1b3ZkyE4xK.html
26-07-2020||India||MP cuts budget by 12%, health departments lose Rs 403 crore amid Covid fight||The Madhya Pradesh government has cut the annual budget for the year 2020-21 by 12%, including Rs 403 crore from the allocation to three key departments of public health and family welfare, medical education and Ayush, which, as per the Congress, need more money to deal with Covid 19 pandemic. The budget appropriation for financial year 2020-21 was approved by governor Anandiben Patel through Ordinance promulgated on Saturday, said Jagdish Deora, state’s finance minister. Last year, the budget appropriation was Rs 2,33,605 crore, while this year it has been decreased by Rs 28,000 crore to Rs 2,05,397 crore. The budget of every department has been cut down by 10-12%, according to the allocation made to each department as compared to the last fiscal. During the spread of Covid 19 pandemic, the deduction in budget of public health and family welfare department by Rs 142 crore, medical education department by Rs 249 crore and ayush department by Rs 12 crore raised concern as the state is still ill prepared to deal with the rising numbers of cases, said health experts. “Decrease in health budget is a matter of concern in a state like MP, where stories of a woman delivering on road in Chhatarpur, body being carried on a cot in Sidhi and death without treatment in Guna, are examples of poor health infrastructure. In MP, Covid 19 patients are mostly being treated in private hospitals,” health activist Arvind Mishra said.Also Read: ‘I am fine, salute corona warriors for serving selflessly’: Shivraj Singh ChouhanAnother health expert alleged that the move suggested that the government was relying on the private sector instead of the public sector.“The state government’s dependence on private health services will collapse the whole system of public health. There are so many departments where the budget could be reduced but it is like a sin to reduce the health budget during a pandemic. Like other states, there was a need to allot additional budget in view of the pandemic, but the MP government ignored it as they wanted people to go out of state for health facilities or spend money in private hospitals,” said Amulya Nidhi in a scathing comment. The Congress alleged the reduction will adversely impact Covid management and betrayed the state government’s insensitivity towards common people dying of the disease.“This is for the first time, that the reduced budget has been passed through an Ordinance. It is shameful. Instead of increasing the budget to improve health facilities and infrastructure during this pandemic, the budget was reduced by Rs 403 crore of health related departments,” former public relation minister PC Sharma said.Also Read: Recite Hanuman Chalisa 5 times a day to eradicate Covid-19, says Pragya ThakurFinance department minister Jagdish Deora explained the rationale for deduction and added that health services were government’s priority and won’t be allowed to suffer.“In the first quarter of this financial year, tax collections reduced by 65% due to the lockdown but health services continue to be our priority. The reduced budget will not hinder the health facilities and development projects,” Deora said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-cuts-budget-by-12-health-departments-lose-rs-403-crore-amid-covid-fight/story-bQYJcTX79IfnH7MSlYLOdL.html

26-07-2020||India||Self-proclaimed Mughal descendant offers gold brick for Ram Temple construction||Prince Yakub Habeebuddin Tucy, a self-proclaimed descendant of the Mughals has offered a gold brick weighing one kilogram to Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying it could be used for the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, reported ANI.Habeebuddin Tucy was also in news last year when he demanded to be appointed the caretaker of the Babri Masjid that once stood over the Ramjanmabhoomi land in Ayodhya, now handed over by the Supreme Court to the government for construction of a Ram Temple after prolonged court battle over the ownership of the land between Hindu and Muslim parties.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to lay the foundation stone for the temple on August 5 at 12.15 pm, considered to be an auspicious occasion for starting the construction of the temple. Tucy said it was a matter of happiness that an issue involving the faith and emotions of over 100 crore Hindus had been resolved in an amicable way. “My hearty congratulations to my Hindu brothers of India and the 1 kg gold brick that I promised is ready. I have asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for time to handover this gold brick to him,” Tucy said in an interview to news agency ANI. Also Read: Ram temple ‘bhoomi pujan’ can be done via video link: Uddhav ThackerayA century-long dispute over the site was resolved last year following the BJP’s landslide election victory. In November, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the temple trust, saying that Muslim petitioners would be given five acres at an alternative site.Symbolism of Tucy’s offer can be understood in the context of the popular belief that the Mughals had originally razed the temple to build a mosque over it in the ancient city of Ayodhya.The Bhumi Pujan ceremony to be held on August 5 is planned to be celebrated with lighting of earthen lamps and decoration with flowers to recreate the Hindu festival of Diwali which marks the homecoming of Lord Rama after several years in exile. Several top leaders of the Central and state governments are also expected to attend the function in Ayodhya along with the proponents of the movement including LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi.Yogi Adityanath, Uttar Pradesh’s chief minister had yesterday requested that temples in the city be cleaned and decorated before lighting of oil lamps in the evening. He also said the moment had arrived after 500-years of struggle.Also Read: Donations from all faiths to be accepted for Ram temple construction: Trust memberEarlier today, a member of the Ram Temple Trust formed to oversee its construction and management on the instructions of the apex court had said that members of all communities were free to donate for the cause of temple construction.“We will accept donations from whoever has devotion towards and faith in Lord Ram,” Vishwaprasanna Teertha Swamy, head of Udupi-based Pejawar Mutt in Karnataka was quoted as saying by PTI.He was asked if contributions would be accepted from all communities and not just Hindus.The trust had earlier indicated that it will collect the money for temple construction through a nationwide campaign for donation and not ask for government funds.The seer quoted above added that it was suggested in the last meeting of the trust that a sum of Rs ten per head and Rs 100 from each household be collected as part of the effort.“It’s just a suggestion, it’s not like tax. It’s kind of a road-map for people who are desirous of participating in the construction of the Mandir,” the seer told PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/self-proclaimed-mughal-descendant-offers-gold-brick-for-ram-temple-construction/story-LAiA2mU7tfqpS0LoG9v9QN.html

The ‘Baby’ and ‘Lupt’ actor shot at a plush resort in the scenic location of Lonavala. After returning to Mumbai on Friday morning he said, “Since March this is for the first time I stepped out for an outdoor shoot. Despite the hectic schedule and fear of getting virus infected, it turned out to be a memorable shoot. I feel all re-energized and relaxed about completing the project in the times of ongoing crisis.” Shooting at such secluded, scenic location in monsoon made the shoot more cherished for him. “Those ten days were the best spent time in my life. At times I felt as if I was living in paradise. Much needed tour it was.” The actor shot for a feature film ‘It’s Over’ which is based on the ongoing situation of lockdown. Karan admits that shooting in such situation was not easy. “The fear of being infected loomed over us, all the time. Due to pandemic our psyche has changed completely. We are living in a constant fear all the time. Thankfully, our film has just two characters me and my co-star (Swapna Pati). Besides, we had a very small crew and just a limited staff at the resort. It was very hectic as the film had only two characters and you are literally in every frame.” The film has been directed by Rajesh Kumar Mohanty. “I came on board just a month back. The makers were into preproduction since a long time. Then we obtained all required permissions, got our medical check-up done and joined the shoot.” He reveals that the film story is set in the backdrop lockdown. “I play a successful director who is spending time at this sprawling house when he gets to meet this struggling actor. Lockdown happens and sequence of events unfolds. It’s a very interesting story set in current times.” Swapna is well-known actor from Odisha and has earlier done Hindi film ‘Antardhwani.’ Karan is all set to shoot for another web film in November and will be back in Lucknow to shoot for another feature film in March 2021.

26-07-2020||India||‘If only nepotism could have applied in my case…’||Actor, model and voice-over artiste Aisha Ahmed believes that is always right to start early on. “Starting early in life is something that I decided after my high school boards. I came home from my boarding school after examinations and it was then my step father (filmmaker Faruk Kabir) asked me to take up some acting workshop or a short course,” she said.She went for a month-long theatre workshop. “It was during the process I realised that I was naturally inclined towards acting and by then I figured it out that this what want to do. So, it was then, I started auditioning and simultaneously continued with acting workshops,” she said over the phone.Born and brought in Mumbai, Aisha is daughter of actor Rukhsar Rehman who has worked in movies like ‘Sarkar’, ‘God Tussi Great Ho’, ‘PK’ and more. When asked being daughter of an actor did it help her to make it in Bollywood, she was quick to revert, “If only nepotism could have applied in my case, I would have been the happiest not running from pillar to post, auditioning and asking do I fit! My mother accompanied me for two auditions and then discreetly told me from here you have to find your path,” she said.She then I got to do some advertisements as a newbie. “It did help me to understand that it’s not going to be easy. Then, I become assistant casting director and learnt the technicalities involved in film making. My mother told me the same, I still see her auditioning for films and it did boost my morale that that’s the way life is. I remember I got a big brand ad and had to go to Bangkok but the shoot was coinciding with my board examinations. I was in a fix and it was then my mother said that I have to solely make this decision as it was my life and nobody will share the outcome of it.” The pretty lass shot to fame with her role of Nikhat Rizvi, in web series ‘Adulting’. “I shot for my first feature film ‘3 Storeys’ when I was 19 but it took over a year to release. I was disheartened as it appeared that my struggle was still on and this career choice is not going to be easy. It was then that I got offer for sketches (small videos) for YouTube and then my web journey started. ‘Adulting’ made me a known face and this followed with second season and other projects like ‘Minus One,’ ‘World of MG: Homecoming,’ short films ‘Chhaju Ke Dahi Bhalle,’ ‘Zindagi in Short,’ and more. In lockdown too I shot for several teasers back at home as that’s the way to work as of now,” said Aisha who took a webinar session in Lucknow, recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/if-only-nepotism-could-have-applied-in-my-case/story-TiVAt0FDQeQkRNe95cmaHN.html
26-07-2020||India||OTT enables actors to portray various shades: Darshan||‘Sarabjit,’ ‘Mary Kom’ and ‘NH10’ actor Darshan Kumar feels films are like fast-paced T20 cricket matches while over the top (OTT) series are like a test match that let actors carve their character and portray a variety of shades in one role. “Films are like a T20 match with limited time and people whereas OTT series are like a test match where you start slow but then gear up and bring out the best in you. Similarly, it happens with a character in the digital series. Slowly we develop the character and explore several layers of the character which is an amazing thing about this platform,” he said. Darshan was last seen in ‘The Family Man’. “OTT is a personal entertainment platform where people enjoy viewing anywhere, anytime also the viewers have personal connect with the characters and the story. This is a good phase for all the actors as we have so many mediums to perform. I am enjoying playing different roles especially on OTT as we get a lot of time to discover and relive the characters,” he said over the phone. The actor believes OTT does give space and time to actors to bring out their characters well. “See we all are human beings and we don’t remain same all the time. We get an opportunity in web shows to play and project our roles at a length. Suppose an actor is playing a certain character in a way in any series then maybe in next season another shade of that person can be highlighted so this way we get multiple chances to portray different human emotions. That’s the beauty of these series that you get a chance to show so many shades and characters in just one show.” Sharing more about his work, Darshan said, “Talks are on, I have almost finalised one film and two web-series. But, they are waiting for the right time to start. As it’s a bit early to start shooting again though I am a very positive person and believe all will be well. And, as soon as we get some vaccine we all will be good to go. For a film we shoot with a crew of at least hundred people and so it’s important that we shoot during safer times with minimum risk. So I’m in no hurry and we can easy wait for 2-3 months before we restart.” In his upcoming series ‘Avrodh the Siege Within’ he plays an army officer. “I loved playing such a layered and versatile character in the series. It was very challenging but very gratifying at the same time. There is sense of pride when we get to play roles associated with your country like in this series that is based on Uri attacks.” The Delhite has shot in UP in recent times. His film ‘Mirza Juuliet’ was shot in Varanasi where he plays Mirza. He also shot for a series ‘Ashram’ in Ayodhya. “Earlier this year, I have completed ‘Ashram’ with Prakash (Jha) sir. We have shot for three-four months in Ayodhya and it was just before the coronavirus pandemic started that we had a pack-up in March first-week. Shooting in Ayodhya was a lifetime experience for all of us.” Darshan will also be seen in the next season of ‘Family Man’ starring Manoj Bajpai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ott-enables-actors-to-portray-various-shades-darshan/story-fucQuZdNAUcQG3t963IhLN.html
26-07-2020||India||Uttarakhand man held for abducting prominent trader from Odisha’s Sambalpur district||The Dehradun police on Sunday arrested a 38-year-old man for allegedly masterminding the abduction of a prominent construction trader in Odisha’s Sambalpur district and carrying out the kidnapping along with three others on July 10, police said. The police swung into action after getting an input from the Sambalpur police on Saturday stating that the accused Rajiv Dua, a resident of Dehradun has been hiding in the city after committing the crime. “Following the input, we immediately formed a police team and mobilized our informers to nab him. With the help of electronic surveillance, we got to know about his location in city’s Raipur area. He was finally caught this afternoon from there,” said Arun Mohan Joshi, deputy inspector general, Dehradun. Joshi said that during the interrogation he confessed to the crime and said, “He used to run a cloth business in Dehradun’s Paltan Bazar but after he ran into heavy losses, he shut down the business in 2018 and went to his maternal uncle living in Sambalpur.”There again he started his cloth business and opened a garment shop. But as his business was not running well, he fell under heavy debt. “There in his shop he met two of accomplices who too were under heavy debt. The three of them decided to abduct the construction trader Naresh Agrawal who used to live in the same neighborhood as Dua’s uncle,” Joshi said. According to the plan hatched by Dua, the three along with one other person, abducted Agrawal on July 10 while he was out on work.

Scared, they all then dropped him near his house and fled. Dua then came to Dehradun by car on July 18.”“After his arrest, police have also seized his car and mobile phone used in the crime.

In the wee hours on Sunday at around 3am, the locals were woken up by the sound of an elephant strolling in the colony lanes uprooting plants, damaging four-wheelers and turning down two-wheelers. The residents tried to shoo away the jumbo by producing loud sounds and flashing torch lights in vain as the wild animal broke the boundary wall of the colony community centre. By the time forest department officials arrived, the elephant had done some damage leaving residents alleging laxity in controlling jumbo intrusions in the residential area. Shikhar Paliwal, local resident, whose car was damaged by the elephant, said in recent times, particularly since lockdown was imposed in late March, movement of wild animals has increased in their area. He noted that the ancient shrine of Bilkeshwar devoted to Lord Shiva, frequented by hundreds of pilgrims daily, is also nearby. Also Read: Uttarakhand CM Rawat asks officials to increase Covid-19 testing“It’s quite unsafe to venture out in the morning and at dusk owing to regular spotting of elephants and other wild animals. We have apprised forest department officials who have assured us of taking appropriate action but a foolproof long-term solution is needed to ensure the colony is safe from the intrusion of wild animals,” said Paliwal, who also runs a pro-Ganga Being Bhagirath Foundation. Haridwar forest division Ranger Dinesh Naudiyal said adequate measures were being taken by the department and regular patrolling was being carried out in areas where elephants are being spotted. Gagan Matta, assistant professor of environmental science in Gurukul Kangri University said the elephant spotted at Bilkeshwar this morning could be a new one since he seemed lost inside the colony and was caught up with dead-ends. “Bilkeshwar colony is surrounded by monsoonal drain and elephants often intrude into this colony, but mostly through outer stretch to reach bypass road and then move into dense forest terrain. But this elephant seems to have lost its path and probably in seeking an exit route, caused damage in the colony,” said Matta.

Police personnel deputed in the area had then shooed away the elephant which had come from nearby Rajaji Tiger Reserve forest terrain. Sighting of elephants at Jagjeetpur, Ajeetpur, Missirpur, Katarpur, Panjanhedi, Jiopata, Shyampur Kangri, Laldhang and nearby residential areas on outskirts of Haridwar forest division and Rajaji Tiger Reserve is also being reported in past few weeks since the monsoon season began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/early-morning-visitor-from-jungle-breaks-walls-crushes-vehicles-in-hardiwar-colony/story-vOgYKwZDrdAC7RVhXvrRFN.html

In a statement issued on July 18 after the release of Nidan Singh Sachdeva, the Sikh leader who was kidnapped in Paktia province last month, the external affairs ministry said the government had decided to “facilitate the return of Afghan Hindu and Sikh community members facing security threats in Afghanistan to India”. Sachdeva was among the Afghan nationals who reached New Delhi on a Kam Air flight at 2 pm on Sunday. The flight also carried Indian citizens who were stranded in Afghanistan because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Adesh Gupta, a leader of the Delhi unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and others received the Afghan Sikhs and Hindus at the international airport. Also read: Afghan Sikh abducted from Gurudwara thanks India for bringing him back to ‘motherland’“Travel of some members of the Hindu and Sikh [communities], interested in moving to India, was also facilitated,” the Indian embassy in Kabul said in a tweet. “We appreciate the efforts of the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in extending necessary support for the safe return of these families,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement. The Indian government had earlier expressed concern at the “targeting and persecution of minority community members [in Afghanistan] by terrorists at the behest of their external supporters”. Concerns among Afghanistan’s dwindling Sikh minority have increased after a terror attack on a Sikh place of worship in Kabul in March that left 25 people dead and others injured. The attack was claimed by the Islamic State, though Indian and Afghan security officials believe the assault was planned and executed by Pakistan-based Haqqani Network and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).

According to reports in the Afghan media, there were some 220,000 Sikhs and Hindus in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Their numbers dwindled to 15,000 when the Taliban were in power in Kabul.

26-07-2020||India||In a push to ‘neighbourhood first’ policy, India to send 10 railway locomotives to Bangladesh||India will hand over 10 railway locomotives to Bangladesh on Monday, reflecting a renewed focus on the “neighbourhood first” policy to bolster economic ties and connectivity within the region amid the border standoff with China. The handover of the broad gauge diesel locomotives, part of grant assistance from the Indian side, is in line with a commitment by New Delhi during Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s visit last October, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The locomotives will be handed over during a virtual event to be joined by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and railways minister Piyush Goyal and their Bangladeshi counterparts AK Abdul Momen and Mohammed Nurul Islam Sujon, as well as envoys of the two countries and senior officials. The handover will come close on the heels of the first cross-border container train reaching Bangladesh on Sunday with 50 containers of FMCG goods and fabrics. Last week, the two sides marked a notable achievement in maritime connectivity with the first shipment of container cargo from Kolkata to Agartala in the landlocked northeastern region via Bangladesh’s Chattogram port. The connectivity initiatives with Bangladesh coincide with other moves by India to shore up relations with key neighbours amid the standoff with China. In reject weeks, New Delhi has kept a wary eye on stepped up activities by Beijing in regional capitals such as Kathmandu, Male and Colombo. The people cited above believe China was behind Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s recent outreach to his Bangladeshi counterpart. On Saturday, India announced a $400-million currency swap facility for Sri Lanka under the Saarc framework, and Colombo’s request for a bilateral swap facility for $1.1 billion is also being considered by New Delhi. The Indian mission in Male, in a statement on Sunday to mark the Maldives’ Independence Day, said India had provided $400 million through an extended currency swap arrangement to tide over a liquidity shortage and will soon “announce another substantial financial assistance package” to help post-Covid-19 economic recovery. The people said India-Bangladesh railway cooperation is a vital element of efforts to promote trade and connectivity. Both sides are working to enhance rail connectivity by developing new projects and restoring old links. Currently, the four operational rail links between the two sides, all of which originate in West Bengal, are Petrapole-Benapole, Gede-Darshana, Singhabad-Rohanpur, and Radhikapur–Birol. The first container train that reached Bangladesh on Sunday left the Container Corporation of India Ltd’s (CONCOR) terminal at Majerhat near Kolkata on Friday and crossed over using the Benapole-Petrapole link. This container train will now be a regular service connecting CONCOR terminals in India to stations in Bangladesh such as Benapole, Jessore, Singia, Noapara and Bangabandhu Setu West, Indian officials said. The two sides signed an MoU for the service in April 2017 and a trial run was conducted in April 2018. There are also two passenger trains – Bandhan Express from Kolkata to Khulna and Maitree Express from Kolkata to Dhaka – though services are temporarily suspended due to the pandemic. Seventeen railway projects with a commitment of $2.44 billion were included in assistance extended by India to Bangladesh. India has offered lines of credit for these projects at a rate of interest of 1% a year, with repayment over 20 years with a moratorium for five years. Nine projects have been completed, including supply of wagons and equipment. The Kulaura-Shahbazpur line, being built at a cost of $78 million, is set to be completed by the end of this year, and the Khulna-Mongla line worth $389 million is set for completion by June 2021. A cross-border link of 12 km between Agartala and Akhaura is set to be completed by March 2021 and will enhance freight and passenger connectivity between the rest of India and the northeastern states. Experts believe the attention given to ties with Bangladesh is part of efforts to overcome the impact of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) on bilateral relations. Bangladesh’s leadership was irked by reports that illegal migrants in states such as Assam would be deported to the neighbouring country. Maya Mirchandani, senior fellow at Observer Research Foundation and professor of media studies at Ashoka University, said: “We’ve neglected the neighbourhood for some time. Bangladesh has been upset since CAA was passed, and the perception it has created about ethnic Bengali Muslims in particular.” She added: “In the current context, with Chinese adventurism on India’s borders, it is imperative for Delhi to be less dismissive of neighbours falling into China’s ‘debt trap’ and be more pro-active about repairing ties that have been starved for attention.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-push-to-neighbourhood-first-policy-india-to-send-10-railway-locomotives-to-bangladesh/story-TZ2enN1ZZH2OULNP9yNtLL.html
26-07-2020||India||Trinamool Congress launches video campaign for poll-bound Bengal||With the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) intensifying its activities in poll-bound West Bengal, the Trinamool Congress on Sunday launched a new tri-weekly video campaign to highlight the state government’s performance. Called Shoja Banglay Bolchi (straight talk in Bengali) the campaign features a series of short data-based videos complete with graphics and background score. The first video claims that unemployment rate in Bengal during the Covid-19 pandemic is low in comparison with figures in BJP-ruled states. The BJP, however, is not named in the video. The videos will appear on social media every Sunday, Wednesday and Friday, Rajya Sabha member and TMC’s national spokesperson Derek O’Brien, who hosts the campaign, wrote on Twitter. In the 41-second video O’Brien says, “According to the report of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, unemployment rate in Bengal in June was 6.5% whereas it was 11% nationally.” Unemployment rate was 9.6% in Uttar Pradesh, 9.2% in Karnataka, 8.2% in Madhya Pradesh and 33% in Haryana, says the MP. The figures also appear on the screen. “I am talking straight. Just think about it. Stay safe. Stay well,” O’Brien says at the end. Bengal BJP leadership called the campaign a useless exercise and said it comes at a time when people can see the Mamata Banerjee government making futile attempts to combat the Covid-19 crisis. “This sort of useless exercise means nothing to people. Around 10 lakh migrant workers returned during the lockdown. O’Brien should first explain why these 10 lakh people left Bengal for work if employment rate is so high here,” said Bengal BJP vice president Jay Prakash Majumdar. “This must be another brainchild of election strategist Prashant Kishor who has been roped in by Banerjee. What can be more shameful for her than the fact that she has to depend on someone who came from Bihar while her party claims that she has the final word in Bengal politics,” said Majumdar. The BJP leader also took a jibe at O’Brien for his Bengali accent. “Since they say that it is straight talk in Bengali the videos should feature someone who can properly pronounce Bengali words,” quipped Majumdar. HT tried to contact O’Brien for his reaction but he did not take calls or reply to a text message.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trinamool-congress-launches-video-campaign-for-poll-bound-bengal/story-tklmx4D3002RrelMsAuB2L.html

Among infected are 16 health workers and 12 police personnel including the central paramilitary guards. State capital Thiruvananthapuram remained worst affected with 175 new cases, triple lockdown is in force in many areas, especially along the coastal belt.

26-07-2020||India||Government identifies 1,474 exporters’ fraudulent claims worth Rs 2,020 cr||The finance ministry has identified 1,474 ‘risky’ exporters who have fraudulently claimed IGST refund worth Rs 2,020 crore and promised stern action against them. Some of these exporters enjoy a star rating, according to a senior ministry official. The fraudulent claims were caught out during a verification exercise which found exporters’ untraceable, following which their refund claims have been blocked, the official added.Integrated Goods and Services Tax or IGST refund has been suspended in all such cases where an adverse report was generated post verification of the exporter or his suppliers. However, Customs officials have been sensitized to expedite refunds to genuine exporters keeping the Covid-19 challenges in mind, the officer quoted above said.“Out of the 1,474 untraceable exporters, 1,125 exporters are from Delhi alone. Non-existing exporters have also been detected in large numbers at Surat (215), Thane (28), Faridabad (15) and Kolkata (11),” the official said.They were engaged in exports of a wide range of products including ready-made garments, wallpaper, wall coverings, leather apparel, smoking pipes, mobile phones, cigarette holders, footwear, plastics, floor coverings, ball bearings and roller bearings.Seven of these dubious business firms had star exporter ratings, five of them operated from Delhi and one each from Mumbai and Kolkata.Three adverse reports have been received in respect of other three star exporters, two in Mumbai and one in Jaipur. They tried to claim IGST refund amounting to Rs.28.9 crores unsuccessfully.The ministry started a programme for exporters’ risk management in June 2019 following assessment of fraudulent claims taking advantage of the fully automated IGST refund system. Their general modus operandi is to pay IGST at the highest rate of 28% in order to quickly encash the undue ITC claims, the official said.However, the programme uses data analytics based on 360 degree profiling of exporters using multiple data sources (GST, Income Tax, Customs, DGFT, etc.) and is able to weed out fraudulent exporters from genuine ones with a high degree of success, he said.“Some fake/risky exporters are lobbying with some prominent trade associations to allege that genuine exporters are being harassed by being asked for over 1,500 documents each for conducting verification, but this is completely untrue,” he said, adding that the two stage verification doesn’t require more than three to four documents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-identifies-1-474-exporters-fraudulent-claims-worth-rs-2-020-cr/story-3Q5njE5etvBUsrYGZhYNWN.html

The train, with the engine number 16557R A/W, had 50 containers and halted for about 25 minutes on the zero line for train immigration formalities.“The train is equipped with an electronic cargo tracking system (ECTS) and the containers are electronically sealed and tracked by the Transecur company. MGH Group Private Limited is involved in a contract with Container Corporation of India (CONCOR) to run this train,” the statement said.The statement further added, “Earlier, the wagons of the Good Trains could be tampered with for human trafficking as well as smuggling of contraband to Bangladesh through ICPs between India-Bangladesh by smugglers. The running of this container train will put a check on the smuggling activities at the border in the coming time. The electronic seal makes it impossible for smugglers to put illegal baggage in it. This will make it a lot more convenient and efficient for the BSF to checking the train on the zero line.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-first-ever-export-container-train-arrives-at-integrated-check-post-in-petrapole/story-VIswrHALkgtgGvg3GyVx2K.html

26-07-2020||India||Attorney General KK Venugopal bats for video streaming of court proceedings||Attorney General KK Venugopal has advocated video streaming of court proceedings across India so that court hearings anywhere in the country is accessible and “capacity” of lawyers and judges can be ascertained.He said that the one silver lining of Covid-19 and the lockdown of the courts was that it had compelled the legal fraternity to adopt e-filing of cases and hearing through video conferencing.“I would suggest that we go one step further and have video streaming as well so that the entire population of lawyers will be able to listen to any case which is going on in any court in this country. We would be able to judge the capacity of judges and lawyers and the nature of cases which are being handled in courts including lower courts, district courts, high courts and the Supreme Court,” he said.Venugopal was speaking at the launch of a district-level awareness programme in regional languages on e-court services by the Supreme Court e-committee.“I never believed that we could have progressed to this extent. Now I am optimistic that in due course, all courts in the country will be e-courts. I am sure that in the next one year, the whole of this country will be familiar with e-courts. We should congratulate the e-committee for what they have achieved,” he said at the inaugural function held via video conference on July 25.The work of the Supreme Court e-committee has been on an overdrive after the Covid-19 induced lockdown. The e-committee is proposing to introduce radical changes to filing of cases across the country by introduction and operationalisation of e-filing to replace physical filing of cases.After the lockdown, courts across the country had to adopt video conference and e-filing, albeit as an ad-hoc measure to tide over the shutdown of courts due to the pandemic. But e-filing is likely to be made a permanent fixture of our court system in the coming years.The work towards this end as far as the Supreme Court is concerned is at an advanced stage and a new e-filing module is expected to be rolled out soon. The e-committee is also in constant touch with high courts for digitization of records and a standard operating procedure will be drawn up for high courts and district judiciary across the country for digitization. Supreme Court judge, Justice DY Chandrachud, who is the chairperson of the e-committee, released a training manual, video tutorials and brochures in regional languages with regard to e-court services on July 25.The training manual, which is a step by step guide for e-filing of cases, was released in 11 regional languages - Assamese, Bengali, Nepali, Urdu, Mizo, Tamil, Hindi, Hindi-UP, Garo, Khasi and Pnar. Brochures, which would assist lawyers to familiarize themselves on e-filing, were released in 14 regional languages.Speaking on the necessity of such a step, Justice Chandrachud highlighted that there is a technological divide between metropolitan cities and rural areas in India and many a time, lawyers at the district and taluka level do not have access to information technology (IT).“There is a technological divide in India. Those who work and live in metros have the best facilities at their command in terms of IT. But the backbone of the judicial administration in the country is provided by advocates who work at taluka and district levels. The first interface of citizens with justice and his or her attempt to remedy injustice is when they contact an advocate at the taluka and district level and go to their chambers for remedying their problems,” he pointed out.Therefore, unless the lawyers at taluka and district level are also carried along and made part of the e-courts project, the mission will not succeed, he said.As part of the first stage of the awareness programme, the e-committee trained 25 master trainers on June 20 through video conferencing - one for each high court in the country.In the second stage, the 25 master trainers, in turn, trained 461master trainers across the country in their respective states and respective regional languages through video conference.In third phase, these 461 master trainers will be conducting the training programme in every district of the country for the advocates. 278 of these 461 master trainers will be covering two districts each so that all 739 districts in the country are covered.“This project we have conceived is an attempt to spread knowledge of Information and Communication technology initiatives among the members of the bar. Our target is to attain 100 percent computer literacy among members of Indian bar,” Justice Chandrachud added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/attorney-general-kk-venugopal-bats-for-video-streaming-of-court-proceedings/story-1U9h8xy3z3Af3i4VX6oorM.html
26-07-2020||India||Kerala smuggling accused funded terror activities, says NIA report||The multi-agency team probing the Kerala gold smuggling case says one of the accused K T Ramees is the key link in diverting proceeds of smuggling to fund anti-national activities in south India.In the petition seeking the remand extension of Ramees, who is in the custody of the customs now, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) said he seems to be the kingpin and was in constant touch with some fringe elements working against the interest of the country.“He used to insist on the other accused making use of the situation and bringing maximum amount of gold from the middle-east. He wants to weaken financial position of the country. He was also close to many who indulged in unlawful activities and he made frequent trips to abroad,” the NIA said in the custody report.Ramees was arrested by the customs from his house in Malappuram after the NIA detained two other accused Swapna Suresh and her accomplice Sandip Nair from their hideout in Bangaluru on July 10, five days after 30 kg gold was seized from a consignment in the name of an employee of the United Arab Emirates consulate in Thiruvananthapuram.“He made several trips to the UAE and other countries in five years. When asked about this, he said he runs a hotel in Dubai. But later, we found that it was incorrect. We have information that a good portion of the smuggling proceeds was used to fund fringe elements,” said a senior official familiar with the probe on condition of anonymity.Customs officials said Ramees (28) was first booked in 2014 in connection with smuggling 15 kg gold through cargo in Kozhikkode. But, he later got away with fines. In 2016, the forest department had booked him for hunting a deer. But the case was hushed up later. Another case was registered against him for allegedly smuggling six rifles into the country though Kochi airport.“We will also inquire how such a history- sheeter got away and who all helped him,” said the senior official, adding, that Ramees used to fund many political parties and indulged in social activities to dodge any suspicion. The multi-agency team headed by NIA and assisted by customs, DRI, Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax is also investigating the cross-link between hawala and smuggling. The investigators say the latest incident has again exposed the well-oiled network between smuggling syndicates, hawala modules and terror outfits.Meanwhile, the NIA has summoned M Sivasankar, former principal secretary of Kerala chief minister, for questioning in Kochi. Earlier, he was grilled by customs for nine hours and by NIA for four hours. A senior IAS officer, often touted as the blue-eyed boy of the CM, he was removed from the post and later suspended after reports of his alleged association with one of the accused Swapna Suresh surfaced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-smuggling-accused-funded-terror-activities-says-nia-report/story-NWvhVl7q0j9YlIDdRJIqLL.html
26-07-2020||India||Rajasthan guv reviews Covid-19 situation, Raj Bhawan security amid political crisis||Rajasthan governor Kalraj Mishra on Sunday reviewed the security arrangements at his official residence, Raj Bhawan, as well as the Covid-19 health crisis in the state, amid severe political turmoil which has seen Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot locked in a bitter power tussle with his erstwhile deputy and rebel leader Sachin Pilot.The security review at the Raj Bhawan comes barely two days after the Chief Minister accompanied by about 100 Congress legislators protested on the lawns of the Governor’s residence on Friday. They were demanding that the Governor should convene an assembly session by Monday and let them face a floor test in the 200-member assembly.After a lot of political drama, the Congress government in the state has urged him to summon the assembly session on July 31. The party has also called for a nationwide dharna in front of Raj Bhawans on Monday.Chief Secretary Rajiva Swarup and Director General of Police Bhupendra Yadav participated at the meeting at Raj Bhawan and briefed Mishra about the protest being organized by the Congress party on Monday. Adequate security arrangements have been made at the Raj Bhawan, a statement issued by governor’s office said.At the meeting, the statement said, the Governor also expressed concern about the growing number of cases of coronavirus in the state. Mishra said that the number of Covid-19 cases had gone up three-fold since July 1.Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday said that the government wants to hold a session of the assembly to discuss the Covid-19 situation in the state and the political crisis.According to the statement, Mishra directed the government officials that serious efforts should be made to control the growing cases of Covid-19 in the state. “A new strategy will have to be considered to control the pandemic in the state,” the statement said, quoting Mishra.On Saturday, a BJP delegation had submitted a memorandum to the Governor saying that the Congress threatening to surround the Raj Bhawan was a criminal act under Section 124 of the Indian Penal Code.Rajasthan Congress president Govind Singh Dotasara, said, “The Governor should not worry about anything. Congress follows Gandhian principles and protests, if any, would be peaceful.”BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek, however, pointed out that the post of the Governor is a constitutional one and the kind of statements the chief minister made had raised concerns and the review of security arrangements seemed necessary. He said the Rajasthan government since the last 15 days had been locked in a hotel, and a Covid-19 review by the Governor was necessary in public interest. On Friday, the Governor had written to Gehlot expressing concern at Congress legislators staging a protest on the lawns of Raj Bhawan on Friday afternoon. In his letter to the chief minister, the Governor wrote, “Before I could discuss the matter with experts regarding an assembly session, you have openly said that if Raj Bhawan is ‘gheraoed’ then it is not your responsibility.”“If you and your Home Ministry cannot protect the Governor then what about law and order in the state? What agency should be contacted for the Governor’s security? I’ve never heard such a statement from any CM. Is this not the beginning of a wrong trend where MLAs protest at Raj Bhawan?” Mishra questioned in his communication to Gehlot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-congress-protest-tomorrow-rajasthan-guv-reviews-security-at-raj-bhawan/story-9Mhe0ppplZVK8x5BvSwoSO.html

He was working as an Associate Director with Alibaba’s UC Web Mobile Company,” Parmar’s lawyer Atul Ahlawat was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Parmar, in his petition, is seeking a compensation of Rs 2 crores from the company alleging he was thrown out unceremoniously for objecting to alleged censorship of content and peddling of fake news on the Chinese mobile web platform, Reuters reported.UC Web mobile application was among the 59 applications banned by the Indian government recently over national security considerations. The decision was announced weeks after boundary clashes with China killed 20 Indian soldiers in eastern Ladakh. China has protested against the ban. Parmar claims that he was dismissed for raising similar concerns, according to a report by Reuters. Parmar alleges the company used to censor content seen as unfavourable to China. He also accused UC Browser and UC News of showcasing false news “to cause social and political turmoil”.The civil case was filed in the Gurugram court on July 20 following which, Jack Ma and Alibaba were summoned to appear in court either personally or through a lawyer. However, Parmar’s lawyer Ahlawat said there has been no response from the defendants so far.“Gurugram District Court has issued summons to the defendants, including Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba Group. Summons are returnable for 29th July. Till date, we have not received any response from the defendants,” Atul Ahlawat was quoted as saying by ANI.The judge has also sought written responses from the company and its executives within 30 days, according to the summons cited by Reuters.Parmar says he worked as an associate director at the UC Web office in Gurugram until October 2017 and he has attached clippings of some posts he claims were highlighted on the UC News app, which were false.Two of them were on very sensitive issues including demonetization and India-Pak tensions. While the first one from 2017 claimed that Indian currency of Rs 2,000 denomination will go out of circulation from midnight, the other one posted in 2018 claimed a war had broken out between India and Pakistan, according to the Reuters news report.Neither of the events actually took place.The petition also alleges that UC Web censored content considered unfavourable to China on its platform by filtering search strings such as “India-China border” and “Sino-India war”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alibaba-or-jack-ma-yet-to-respond-to-summons-by-gurugram-court/story-bFFQ2MZXXzTZtZWMTRKGCL.html
26-07-2020||India||High time Congress gets full-time president: Sandeep Dikshit||It is “high time” that the Congress appoints a full-time president by “selection or election”, party leader Sandeep Dikshit said on Sunday, asserting that the Congress Working Committee (CWC) comprising senior leaders should have settled the leadership issue earlier, dealing with it on priority.There is a “sense of drift” and a feeling that “we need to get on with the job” in the party with an interim president at the helm, Dikshit said.In an interview to PTI, the Congress leader said that for him, there was no “particular fixation” with any person, and Rahul Gandhi or anyone else could be appointed by “selection or election”, but the important thing is that the party needs a full-time president.Dikshit’s remarks assume significance as Sonia Gandhi nears completion of one-year as interim Congress president in early August and the party is abuzz with hectic parleys on the way forward. He also hit out at Jyotiraditya Scindia for switching to the BJP and Sachin Pilot for his rebellion in Rajasthan, asserting that the fight was not between the young and the old in the party, but between the “usurpers” and those persevering through hardwork.“Much as I would say that Mrs (Sonia) Gandhi is doing a very able and commendable job (as president), one of the reasons that she left earlier was that she felt that it is time for her to take to the background and for other people to take over. In her case, it was Mr (Rahul) Gandhi,” Dikshit said. “Here’s an interim arrangement. Interim is a very iffy word because you know if you are interim you won’t take long term decisions for the Congress. So, it is high time we get a full time president, whoever it is,” the 55-year-old former MP said. Whether it is through “selection or election” there is no issue, he said.“We should have a full-time president, whether it is Mr. A or Mr. B or Mr. Gandhi that is not an issue at all. Party ideology and collective leadership make a party,” Dikshit said.He said initially it was thought that the CWC, the party’s highest decision making body, will come together and select a president or maybe among themselves elect one, but that has not happened. It is not a bad idea to leave it open to the All India Congress Committee (AICC), where one can also have an election to the working committee, he said.“It (appointment of full-time president) should have happened earlier. I constantly maintain that here is the place where I point towards the inability of our senior leaders (CWC members) to have risen to the challenge, got together and got this thing done,” Dikshit said.“Mr Gandhi very clearly made a statement that I am not coming back, then what were you (senior leaders) busy doing running around and not being able to decide,” he said, adding that they should have got the process done. Noting that the CWC could not agree on one name and so it decided Sonia Gandhi should become interim president, Dikshit also pointed towards Scindia and Pilot for not taking a stand then as CWC members and enable a decision either then or later, whenever the party’s top decision-making body met.“All these people (in the CWC), including the Scindias and Pilots, why couldn’t they have fought for and enabled selection or election of a new president at that time. These people can do a revolt when it comes to personal ambition, but they could not risk their careers when it came to the party,” he said. Asked if Rahul Gandhi should come back as party chief in the prevailing circumstances, Dikshit said whoever comes will do well for the Congress.“If it is Mr Gandhi, I will follow him, if it is someone else, I will follow that person. No particular fixation with any particular person. I am an AICC member, I have one vote, which if needed, will be cast on my conscience,” he asserted.Earlier this year, Dikshit, son of three-time Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit, had voiced his opinion that the leadership issue must be settled and had asserted that the senior leaders must step up.His remarks come amid the crisis being faced by the party in Rajasthan with Pilot openly rebelling against the Ashok Gehlot government which comes close on the heels of Scindia toppling the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh by switching over to the BJP with MLAs supporting him.Talking about the back to back Scindia and Pilot episodes that have rocked the Congress, Dikshit said there is no such thing as the “young vs old” and these were the result of personal ambitions. “Basically it is their calculation, their self assessment and what they think they are. I don’t know about Mr Pilot, because we do not know what he is going to do. I think it is a little premature to say anything,” he said.Dikshit, however, added that both have shown all the weaknesses that political beings can have.Asked if Rahul Gandhi’s stepping down as party chief had heightened insecurities among the younger leaders in the party, he said it heightened the insecurities only of those who wanted to “climb on his tailcoat”. On why Gehlot or Kamal Nath were selected as chief ministers over their younger colleagues, he said that this question should not be asked of Rahul Gandhi or anyone else, but to the party MLAs in the respective Congress legislature parties. “More MLAs are with Kamal Nath than with Scindia. More MLAs are with Gehlot than with Pilot. So it is the MLAs’ decision,” Dikshit asserted. Criticising Scindia, Dikshit said that despite the royal scion losing the Lok Sabha, he was offered the post of state party chief and a nomination to the Rajya Sabha. For someone who claims to be a people’s leader, he should have accepted people’s verdict in the Lok Sabha and had the ability to remain without the trappings of power, fought for the party on the field and won back his seat for the party.“Mrs Gandhi offered him to become PCC (Pradesh Congress Committee) chief in November last year. Scindia never came back with a yes. So what did he want, we couldn’t have put him in place of Mr. (Narendra) Modi,” Dikshit quipped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-time-congress-gets-full-time-president-sandeep-dikshit/story-p2aAEhZZWR3yUUdVOU1dKN.html

This is the first evidence of tiger breeding in the protected area, a buffer zone of Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR), where the entire rhino population of around 70 was wiped out by poachers in 1983-84 at the peak of the Assam Agitation against foreigners of Bangladeshi origin. “Roar gets louder. First ever camera trap evidence of successful breeding of tigers in Laokhowa Burhachapori wildlife sanctuary, buffer of Kaziranga Tiger Reserve. Result of more than 15 years of hard work and effort. Kudos,” KNPTR’s official Twitter handle posted on Sunday. Located on the south bank of the Brahmaputra and spread over 114 sq km, Laokhowa Burhachapori lies within KNPTR and the Orang National Park and is part of the Kaziranga Orang Riverine Landscape (KORL), a major gateway for straying animals within protected areas of central Assam. “Prior to 2007, Laokhowa Burhachapori was treated as redundant in terms of wildlife conservation when we lost all our rhinos during the Assam Agitation. The area was brought under KNPTR in 2007 and conservation efforts renewed,” said P Sivakumar, director, KNPTR. The efforts bore fruit and within a few years the presence of four tigers was reported in the area, but there was no photographic evidence. In February 2013, a camera trap captured the photo of a tigress indicating wildlife was thriving again in the sanctuary. “Before we started our conservation efforts, the area was under the grip of encroachers. There used to be around 240 cattle stations inside Laokhowa-Burhachapori. We removed the encroachments and now the area is protected. It’s a good sign that tigers have started using the area as a habitat,” said Sivakumar. He informed that more than 30 camera traps were placed inside the area last year and they have been able to capture photos of four tigers between February and April this year. Sivakumar mentioned that there are now around 145 plus tigers in KORL—125 in Kaziranga and Laokhowa-Burhachapori and 19 in Orang. The data for Biswanath wildlife division, which is also part of KNPTR, is yet to be collected. “The camera trap photo confirms breeding of tigers in Laokhowa Burhachapori for the first time. This is a significant development and will strengthen tiger conservation efforts,” said M Firoz Ahmed, head of tiger research and conservation division at Aaranyak, a Guwahati-based wildlife NGO. “Tigresses don’t move from an area with their cubs till they are around two years old. Breeding by tigers in Laokhowa Burhachapori shows that there is a good prey base in the area and the ecosystem is healthy,” he added. Nearly 85% area of KNPTR spread over 430 sq km is inundated by flood waters at present. This monsoon, 129 wild animals including 14 rhinos (10 drowning, 4 natural causes) have died in and around the park.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-bit-of-evidence-of-tiger-breeding-in-assam-wildlife-sanctuary-brings-cheer-for-activists/story-NKMsrV9CFFbqfN9zuvOjJO.html
26-07-2020||India||IMA writes to Bihar CM for removal of health secretary||The Bihar branch of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has sounded a bugle of revolt against health department’s principal secretary Uday Singh Kumawat and has written to chief minister Nitish Kumar for his removal.“The approach of Kumawat is quite indifferent towards doctors, though all the principals and superintendents of medical colleges are rendering invaluable service in the midst of Covid-19 pandemic. The doctors are quite upset with the decisions taken by the officer,” said the letter written by IMA honorary secretary Dr Sunil Kumar to the CM.The IMA has urged the CM to reinstate former principal secretary, department of health, Sanjay Kumar, who had swapped positions with Kumawat on May 21. The copy of the letter has also been sent to health minister Mangal Pandey and chief secretary Dipak Kumar.Maintaining that Sanjay Kumar was sensitive towards doctors, the IMA has also raised a question mark over the behaviour of two district magistrates of Bhojpur and Gopalganj towards the doctors.“In the past also, they took unwarranted action against the doctors and the IMA had registered its protest against it,” the letter read, seeking the transfer of both officials so that the doctors could discharge their duty with high morale.Also read: ‘Don’t hide, get tested’ - Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s appeal after contracting Covid-19On the lines of a government order to earmark 25% beds in Covid-dedicated hospitals for police officers and administrative, the IMA has sought a similar arrangement for the government and private doctors. “The IMA has always worked shoulder-to-shoulder with the government. In the wake of the pandemic, the IMA appeals to all the doctors to work for providing healthcare to all the needy,” it added.In the wake of rising Covid-19 cases, the Bihar government had in a surprise move removed Sanjay Kumar from the post of principal secretary, department of health on May 21. Though the government cited no official reason behind the move, it was viewed as a result of slow testing and the growing spread of infection.During the Cabinet meeting on Friday, chief minister Nitish Kumar was said to be quite unhappy with the continued spike in Covid-19 positive cases, which has led to relentless attacks from the Opposition. The CM reportedly reprimanded health department principal secretary Uday Singh Kumawat after the health minister said that the officer did not even listen to him.The CM has been consistently asking for an increase in testing - the reason he was upset with Sanjay Kumar and why he is miffed with the new incumbent. “I want RT-PCR tests to be increased to 20,000/day and facilities should be made available at the sub-divisional level so that the patients could be treated there,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ima-writes-to-bihar-cm-for-removal-of-health-secretary/story-Lz184y6xjxRk8iLOVXChtL.html

Otherwise, it can become more toxic than fake news and misinformation”.Urging everybody to treat Covid-19 patients with understanding and empathy, he said “it should be remembered that nobody is totally safe and the invisible virus can infect anybody”.Pointing out that since time immemorial India is known as a land of tolerance and people have been displaying their empathic nature by coming to the assistance of those in distress, the vice president described as “disturbing” media reports of some people, including relatives, of stigmatising and ostracizing those infected with coronavirus, mainly due to fear of contracting the infection.Referring to instances where people opposed providing space for last rites to those who died of the virus, he said it was totally unacceptable and goes against the age-old Indian traditions of being in solidarity with bereaved family members.Observing that a host of factors such as illiteracy, superstitions, fake news and rumours fuel false beliefs among the people, Naidu urged the health authorities and the media to take up special campaigns to promote awareness and educate people on all the facts relating to the coronavirus and its transmission. “The correct message has to be reiterated, reinforced and widely disseminated to ensure that it creates a positive impact and brings about the desired transformation in behaviour,” he said.Expressing optimism that the dire situation caused by the pandemic can be overcome by striving collectively, he said the first and foremost task is to flatten the curve. “Every citizen has to act responsibly by adhering to the norms like frequent hand washing, wearing masks and maintaining social distance,” he emphasised.He also called for expressing gratitude to farmers, the “unsung Corona warriors”, who have been rendering selfless service in ensuring food security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fight-prejudice-against-covid-19-patients-says-venkaiah-naidu/story-hecovGvKYT25yPw2WBHq4J.html

Singh said the central government is constantly monitoring the flood situation in Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and other affected states in the northeast.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has personally enquired about the flood situation and is taking regular updates, he said. Singh said as DoNER minister, he is in constant touch with respective chief ministers and state governments.The flood this year in Assam has severely affected around 56 lakh people in 30 districts and the death toll due to it is over 120 as of now, Singh said. There have already been three waves of flood this year. These have caused extensive damage and disruption to normal life, and created a huge burden on the state, which is now facing the twin challenges along with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the Union minister said. The floods have affected human lives and the state’s rich wildlife, he said. Rescue and relief measures are in full swing and the state government is doing its best to rescue animals, including those in the Kaziranga wildlife sanctuary, with improved techniques and resources, Singh said.

A 100-year-old woman resident of Huvina Hadagali town in Bellary district, Karnataka is one such person who recently recovered from Covid-19 after testing positive for the virus earlier this month. The elderly lady described the infection nothing more than common cold. Speaking to news agency ANI, Hallamma said, “doctors treated me well. Along with regular food, I was eating an apple a day. The doctors are giving me tablets and injection, and I am healthy now. Covid-19 is like a common cold”.Earlier this month, 100-year-old Arjun Govind Naringrekar beat the contagious disease and was discharged from a hospital in Mumbai. Just hours before Naringrekar was to get discharged from the hospital, the staff surprised him by celebrating his birthday as he turned 100. Also read: ‘Don’t hide, get tested’ - Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s appeal after contracting Covid-19Every time the Kandivali resident was asked about his health by the doctors, the jolly old man would respond saying “all is good” in Marathi. Naringrekar was admitted after he reported low-grade fever and suffered breathlessness along with urinary problems. He developed lung infection but responded well to the treatment and was shortly discharged. 106-year-old Mukhtar Ahmed from central Delhi contracted Covid-19 from his son but successfully beat the disease. Ahmed was getting treated at Delhi’s Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital and was discharged in May after getting admitted in mid-April. Ahmed, Naringrekar and Hallamma are some of the country’s exceptions where age defied the threat of Covid-19 infection. Scientists and experts are still trying to learn more about the coronavirus disease and the virus that poses such a severe threat to human health. Multiple studies have linked a patient’s immune response to the severity of Covid-19 symptoms. A study published earlier this year explored how the immune system responds to the virus. Researchers at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity studied blood samples tested at four different time points from Covid-19 patients. “We showed that even though Covid-19 is caused by a new virus, in an otherwise healthy person, a robust immune response across different cell types was associated with clinical recovery, similar to what we see in influenza,” Professor Katherine Kedzierska said. Another study published in the scientific journal ‘Nature’ stated that patient’s immune response, rather than the virus itself, to be largely responsible for death in Covid-19 patients.“Numerous studies have suggested that the immune system contributes to the organ damage seen in some severe cases of Covid-19,” the paper read. The study was conducted by experts at the University of Edinburgh, UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-more-than-common-cold-meet-india-s-strong-willed-centenarians-who-beat-covid-19/story-flNU1f2Ugimxj9Cb6iLHUK.html

In a sharp but veiled dig, Priyanka Gandhi also questioned the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government’s leadership. “Leadership is recognised in times of crisis. In Corona’s national crisis, the country needs a leadership that works in the public interest. But the BJP government at the Centre has made its intention and its character clear by trying to topple the governments elected by the people. The public will answer,” Gandhi tweeted in Hindi on Sunday.Also read: Rajasthan crisis puts governors’ powers in the spotlightGandhi’s tweet comes amid the crisis gripping the Rajasthan government as it stares at the threat of political instability. Congress legislators backing Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot staged a five-hour sit-in on Friday asking governor Kalraj Mishra to call a special assembly session for a floor test. They accused Mishra of acting under pressure and not listening to their demand even as Gehlot expressed confidence of winning the trust vote necessitated by his tussle with his former deputy Sachin Pilot. Congress in Rajasthan has accused the BJP of working against democratic values by conspiring to topple the Ashok Gehlot-led government.Earlier today, Rajasthan Congress in-charge Avinash Pandey on Sunday alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is making attempts to “destabilise” Ashok Gehlot led government.“BJP is trying to destabilise our government.

Considering the unmet medical needs in Covid-19, Itolizumab, an already approved drug of Biocon, used for treating psoriasis - a skin condition - was approved for “restricted emergency use” in the treatment of coronavirus by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) recently. The permission to market the drug was granted for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome in ‘moderate’ to ‘severe’ Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome patients due to Covid-19. “The issue of including the drug in the clinical protocols was discussed in a meeting held on Friday. A majority of the members of the task force opined that there was not enough evidence currently to get the drug included in the clinical management protocols for Covid-19,” said an official source. A domestic biopharmaceutical company, Biocon, has been manufacturing and marketing Itolizumab, a monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis since 2013, under the brand name ALZUMAb, the Union health ministry had earlier said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-decides-against-including-itolizumab-in-clinical-management-protocols-for-covid-19-report/story-NAGIyUGbr2UlI0j4sv87qL.html

In an affidavit, filed by Prasad Mahajan, under secretary in the state Department of Tourism and Cultural Affairs, the government said its order prohibiting people above the age of 65 years from going to film and television shooting sets was not with a view to discriminate, but was in the general interest and for the safety of such people.The affidavit was submitted on Saturday in response to a petition filed by one Pramod Pandey challenging the guidelines issued by the state government on May 30, 2020, stating that no cast/crew member above the age of 65 years will be allowed to film and television shooting sets.A division bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and R I Chagla will take up the petition for final hearing next week.The 70-year-old petitioner said he was doing small roles in films and TV serials for four decades, and that he does not have any other source of livelihood.He further said in his petition that though he is physically fit, he is not allowed to go to studios and participate in shootings.The government in the affidavit said all its orders passed from time to time in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic specifically request senior citizens and children to stay at home and go out only for essential work and health reasons.“The said condition is not to deprive any cast/crew members above the age of 65 years nor can it be termed as discriminatory as interest of the cast and crew has been protected and balance is maintained by permitting them to either work from home or over video conferencing or other video sharing apps,” the affidavit said.“Those persons who are unable to go to the studios can work from home and earn their livelihood as being done by many individuals in private offices. If this too is not possible, then alternative arrangements should be adopted for earning livelihood and survival in this Covid-19 pandemic situation, the government said.The court on Tuesday asked the government if it relied on any data or statistics before passing the order.Replying to it, the affidavit said, No data/reports/ statistics were taken into consideration before issuing the impugned guidelines restraining cast/crew members above the age of 65 years from attending shooting sets or studios.” The affidavit said in order to check the rise in Covid-19 cases, the state government had imposed restrictions on various sectors. Some of these restrictions were relaxed from time to time.Several requests were made to the government to permit shooting of films and television series, it said.“As the economic progress of the country was hampered following the Covid-19 outbreak, the government gave permission to resume the film and television industry by relaxing few restrictions, the affidavit said.The government said the petitioner (Pandey) may be physically fit, but the fact remains that one never knows when a person would get infected by the coronavirus.“The virus could infect any individual who would come in contact with an infected person. A person could be asymptomatic and could spread the infection to others who have low or weak immunity, the affidavit said.It further said even guidelines issued by the central government in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic have imposed restrictions on the movement of senior citizens and children.“If the central government relaxes its guidelines pertaining to persons above the age of 65 years then the state government would also adopt the same, the affidavit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/barring-senior-citizens-from-film-sets-not-discriminatory-maharashtra-govt-to-hc/story-r74MHxnniwLxLJC8nRBcTK.html

26-07-2020||India||FATF review of India’s anti-money laundering and terror financing regime pushed to 2021 due to Covid-19||The much-awaited Financial Action Task Force (FATF) mutual evaluation of India’s anti-money laundering regime and legal measures framed to check financial crimes, scheduled for this year, has been postponed till early next year in view of the coronavirus pandemic, officials said. They said the on-site review to be conducted by experts of the global body was scheduled to begin in September-October but the FATF secretariat in Paris has conveyed to India that the review is being tentatively pushed to January-February next year. The FATF is a global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog that sets international standards to prevent illegal activities in the economic and financial channels of a country and its inter-connected linkages across the world. It conducts “peer reviews of each member on an ongoing basis to assess levels of implementation of the FATF recommendations and provides an in-depth description and analysis of each country’s system for preventing criminal abuse of the financial system.” The review of India’s anti-money laundering and terrorist financing regime was scheduled for this year as part of a regular review cycle after 10 years. The last such review was done in June 2010, a senior officer in an anti-money laundering agency said. The FATF, post this review, had said in 2013 that “India had made significant progress in addressing deficiencies identified in its mutual evaluation report and (the FATF) decided that the country should be removed from the regular follow-up process.” India has set up a joint working group comprising 22 central investigation, intelligence gathering and regulatory agencies to make presentations and brief the FATF experts, drawn from various countries, this time. Some of the prominent agencies in this grouping supervised by the Department of Revenue under the finance ministry include the CBI, ED, Income Tax Department, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), Customs, market regulator SEBI, banking regulator RBI and insurance regulator IRDAI. The Union government had also deputed Rahul Navin, a 1993-batch Indian Revenue Service officer of the Income Tax Department, to work as an officer on special duty (OSD) with the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to take these processes forward. Navin has authored a book, ‘Information Exchange and Tax Transparency: Tackling Global Tax Evasion and Avoidance’, and served in the international taxation wing of the tax department and worked closely with the OECD, another reputed global economic body. The ED is the nodal agency to undertake investigations under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in the country. A senior Union finance ministry official said all preparations to brief the FATF reviewing group were nearing completion when the Covid-19 outbreak happened. “We have been informed by the FATF that it has postponed the mutual evaluation of many jurisdictions scheduled this year including that of India due to the ongoing Covid-19 restrictions. It is expected that the new dates will be for early next year,” the officer told PTI. The FATF too made a public declaration in this context. “The gravity of the Covid-19 situation globally and the consequent Covid-19 related measures that countries have adopted, such as confinement and travel restrictions, are making it impossible for assessed jurisdictions and assessors alike to conduct on-site visits and in-person meetings. This situation has significantly impacted countries’ ability to actively participate in mutual evaluation and related follow-up processes.” “The FATF Plenary has therefore agreed to temporarily postpone all remaining FATF mutual evaluations and follow-up deadlines,” the FATF said. It said India’s possible on-site period is “tbc (to be considered)”. During the visit of FATF evaluators, the finance ministry officer said, India has prepared to present multiple dossiers of the action undertaken by it under the anti-money laundering law, criminal tax evasion probes and for strengthening the CFT (combating financing of terrorism) regime by the financial intelligence unit (FIU) and other agencies. The enactment of the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act in 2018, the anti-black money Act of 2015, amendments brought in the PMLA over the years, curbing tax evasion under indirect taxes by bringing in the GST (goods and services tax), new protocols to better regulate suspect transactions in banks and financial intermediaries and the 2016 demonetisation of two large currencies are part of the Indian presentation, another officer in a probe agency said. The high number of domestic and international attachment of assets under the PMLA and charge sheets filed by various probe agencies under criminal sections of the law against financial crimes and terror funding are also part of India’s presentation to the FATF review team, he said. The new compliance regime brought in by the FIU for banks and other financial institutions to report suspect cash and counterfeit transactions will also be part of the presentation, he said. The review takes about a year to finish and if all timelines are adhered to, the FATF will discuss the Indian legal system against financial crimes at its Plenary meeting in February, 2022 and subsequently issue a statement and recommendations about the country, the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fatf-review-of-india-s-anti-money-laundering-and-terror-financing-regime-pushed-to-2021-due-to-covid-19/story-HN26ZeE7UlSCCOmCSRmz9J.html

Sunday was the 21st anniversary of India’s victory over Pakistan in the Kargil war. The day is observed as ‘Kargil Vijay Diwas’.The president’s contribution to the Army hospital has been made possible due to an exercise to economise expenditure at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the communique said.The president had earlier issued directions to reduce expenses by initiating a slew of measures. “As a sequel to this initiative, he had earlier deferred the proposal to buy a limousine which was to be used for ceremonial occasions,” the statement issued by the Rashtrapati Bhavan said.In his role as the supreme commander of the armed forces, the president’s gesture will boost the morale of the frontline Covid warriors of the Army hospital, it said.“It will go a long way in providing a safe, conducive environment to them so that they can perform to the best of their ability. It is also hoped that the gesture will inspire other people and organisations to economise expenditure and utilise the savings to aid and support our Covid warriors,” the statement said. The Army Hospital (Research and Referral) is the apex medical care centre for the armed forces of India.Officiating commandant Major General Sarat Chandra Dash was also a participant in “OP VIJAY” for which he was awarded the Yudh Seva Medal, it said. On July 26, 1999, the Indian Army had announced the successful culmination of “Operation Vijay”, declaring victory over Pakistan after the nearly three-month-long battles in the icy heights of Kargil. The country lost more than 500 soldiers in the war.“In the prevailing situation, its doctors, nurses and paramedical staff are tirelessly working round the clock and providing the highest quality of medical care at great risk to their own lives,” the Rashtrapati Bhavan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/president-donates-rs-20-lakh-to-army-hospital-to-buy-equipment-to-combat-covid-19/story-h2gqg7WW62Tv2YatjpiWPK.html

26-07-2020||India||Surrendered Maoists to reconstruct schools demolished by them in Chhattisgarh||Around a dozen schools which were once demolished by Maoists between 2007-09 will now be constructed by the ones who surrendered and are living a normal life in the villages of Dantewada district of Bastar division in Chhattisgarh. These schools come under Bhairmagarh, Malangir and Katekalyan Area Committees of the Communist Party India (Maoist) which fall under Dantewada district.The construction of a demolished school in village Bhansi Massapa, around 20 kilometres from the district headquarters, started a week ago with the help of local villagers and Maoists who have surrendered.“The villagers, who were earlier Maoists, demolished the school in our village on the instructions of senior Maoists in 2012 after Salwa Judum but now we want to educate our kids hence we will construct it again. Our children also want to go for higher education and get jobs,” said Sarpanch of Bhansi Massapa village, Ajay Telam.Other schools that are to be constructed fall under Potali, Burgum, Nahri, Kutrem and Aalnaar village panchayats.“These schools are in core Maoist areas of the district. The construction of one such school has started in Bhansi. As and when a sizeable number of Maoists surrender in these villages and in turn takes responsibility to help in the construction of the schools, the villages will be chosen and sanctions for school building will be taken,” said Superintendent of Police ( SP) Dantewada, Abhishek Pallava.The SP further said that commencement of construction without taking security angle in mind may lead to mindless killing of villagers by Maoists.The activists working in Dantewada claimed it is a long demand of villagers to re-open the schools which were demolished by Maoists after Salwa Judum.“The villagers are eager to re-construct schools which were demolished but it should not be done by deploying police force in the village. They are very aware of the education of their kids. Secondly, the administration is also dilly-dallying the construction work of schools. In Potali village, the construction project has been sanctioned for the last four months but nothing has been done till now,” said Soni Sori, a tribal leader of Dantewada.Dantewada administration and police claimed that the school construction is going on in a process, keeping villagers’ security in mind. “Most of these schools were demolished around 2007-2009 during and post Salwa Judum campaign. Since schools were the only government structure in the villages during those times, security forces used to stay in schools and many camps were also opened in there during those days. As induction of paramilitary forces was at a great pace in Bastar due to prevailing security situation, schools were chosen as camp site. Maoists thus started targeting schools so that security forces do not get a foothold in their area,” said a senior revenue officer working in the area. The officer further said that the Maoists started instigating villagers against the police, forcing them to destroy schools. “Maoists also wanted to get the schools shut so that they could instil their ideology in children by putting them in Maoists’ schools. Since most of the teachers in schools that time were not residents of Bastar, they too fled to district headquarters fearing being targeted by Maoists and thus empty schools were an easy target. These schools were demolished or vandalized by lower-rung Maoists cadres mostly from the same village where a school is located under instruction from senior Maoist cadres,” said the officer.Now, for the construction of schools, the district administration is forming self-help groups (SHG) of these surrendered Maoists, which will help in the construction process.“The SHG will work as they are the local youths from the village who have joined Maoism in the past and thus know all the Maoists visiting the area. They are the people who yield influence in the village and villagers listen to them. Once they start helping in the construction of the school, the fear factor will decrease and since most of the low-rung cadres who surrender are between 20-30 years of age, they are young and energetic. They are village decision swingers and thus channelize other youths too in the mainstream. When a sizeable section of lower-rung cadres surrender, rest are bound to fall in line. Direct mentoring of these youth by district administration is bound to produce results,” said an intelligence officer posted in the region.“The SHGs of surrendered Maoists is a novel innovation and I am hopeful it would be a huge success. Those who had destroyed are now constructing the same schools and this would help these youth come out of the guilt that they had incurred so many crimes in the past,” said the SP Pallava.Pallava further said that it would also lead to true reintegration and rehabilitation of surrendered Maoists in the society. The realization of the importance of education among villagers is a welcome change and the police administration will render all help required to these youths.“Soft policing too can go a long way to solving complex the Naxal problem which has simmered for decades in Bastar,” said the SP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surrendered-maoists-to-reconstruct-schools-demolished-by-them-in-chhattisgarh/story-X1B7gYSo0OstlXYpVet26O.html

He said every countryman has to decide his/her role in it.“We too should determine our roles, bearing in mind the soldiers fighting on the borders under the harshest conditions,” he said in his monthly radio address, Mann Ki Baat, which coincided with the 21st anniversary of the Kargil Diwas.Addressing the 67th edition of his monthly radio programme Mann ki Baat, the PM also slammed Pakistan for stabbing India in the back by planning the Kargil war, which he said was carried out to divert attention from the internal problems in the neighbouring country. He said the attack was carried out at a time when India was trying to have good relations with Pakistan.Quoting a Sanskrit adage the PM said, “…to the wicked, enmity with all and for no reason comes naturally. People with such a disposition keep thinking of harming even their well-wishers… that is why when India extended a hand of friendship, Pakistan tried to respond by stabbing in the back.”Underlining the need to keep up the morale of the soldiers and their families, the PM said sometimes comments are made on social media that tend to lower the morale of the soldiers and are detrimental to the country.Also read: In PM’s Mann ki Baat address, tribute to Kargil bravehearts, Covid warriors“Whatever we speak or do during the times of war has an effect on the morale of the soldiers and their families, we should never forget this and therefore our behaviour and conduct should boost the morale and honour our soldiers,” the PM said.Also read: Tired of wearing masks, think of corona warriors - PM Modi on Mann Ki BaatOn the 21st anniversary of the Kargil victory, the PM referred to what former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee has said from the ramparts of the Red Fort after the Kargil war. “He reminded the countrymen about Mahatma Gandhi’s talisman that was if anyone ever has any dilemma about what to do and what not to do then he should think of the poorest and the helpless person in India and think whether his act will benefit that person or not. Taking a cue from this thought of a Gandhi ji, Atal ji had said the Kargil war has given us another mantra - that before taking any important decision we should think whether the action will honour that soldiers who sacrificed his life in those treacherous mountains,” the PM said.He urged the youth to share stories of the valour of the soldiers which will serve as an inspiration to others. Likening the ongoing fight against the corona pandemic to a war, he said in the last few months the way the entire country faced the challenges together has dispelled several apprehensions. “Today the recovery rate in our country is better than others, the fatality rate is also much lesser than most countries. It is tragic to lose even one person but India has been able to save the lives of lakhs of people,” he said and added that people should not let their guard down but remain extra vigilant and exercise caution.He said while fighting the pandemic, there is also the need to intensify efforts in scaling up business, jobs, and studies to take them to new heights. “During the corona times, our rural areas have shown the way to the entire nation. Good efforts of villages are continuously coming to fore,” he said.The PM also urged the youth to take a pledge to free the nation from the ongoing pandemic this Independence day and resolve to make India self-reliant. He asked the youth to learn and teach something new and resolve to earnestly carry out their duties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wicked-harbours-animosity-towards-one-and-all-pm-modi-slams-pak-in-mann-ki-baat-address/story-dieh5sZr3Ol75WZqo5cyHI.html
26-07-2020||India||Kargil War is symbol of armed forces’ valour, bravery and sacrifice: JP Nadda||JP Nadda, the Bharatiya Janata Party president, said on Sunday soldiers of Indian armed forces not only secured the country’s borders but also defeated the malicious intent of Pakistan during the Kargil War in 1999.The senior leader said the high-altitude conflict is a symbol of the valour, bravery and sacrifice of the armed forces’ personnel while addressing a programme on Kargil Vijay Divas.“It becomes my prime responsibility to reiterate on such forums time and again that Pakistan was in a very advantageous position, was on height and had taken strategic positions. Our soldiers attained victory on the basis on their valour and strategy,” he said.“This was the toughest battle on the highest mountains… and you must also remember that the forces fought in a temperature of minus 10 degrees Celsius. The future generations will remember how the soldiers ensured the security of our border, of our country and our security with their lives,” he added.Nadda said as the armed forces were fighting the battle on India’s border, the political leadership was fighting it on the international arena as he pointed that the then Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif had urged Bill Clinton, the US president, to intervene.“Atal ji received many messages, signals and several rounds of talks were held. But Atal ji had clearly said that India will not declare a ceasefire till the time we defeat Pakistan and secure our borders,” he said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said, has continued that policy of zero tolerance against intrusions till date. He spends every Diwali with the soldiers and officers of the forces posted on the borders of the country.“This sends a message that the Prime Minister is standing with the army. The Prime Minister himself went to Ladakh, stayed there the entire day, held meetings, boosted the morale of our soldiers and met injured personnel,” he added.Before addressing the Kargil Vijay Diwas programme, Nadda had tweeted his tribute to the soldiers who lost their lives in the conflict with Pakistan.“The battle of Kargil symbolises the valour of the heroic sons of Mother Bharati. I offer my heartfelt admiration for the indomitable courage, valour and dedication of Indian soldiers,” he had tweeted earlier.“The entire nation will always be grateful to all the warriors of Mother Bharati who waved the banner of their valour while protecting the sovereignty of the nation,” he said.This year India is observing the 21st anniversary of the successful ‘Operation Vijay’.India launched Operation Vijay to clear the posts in the high-altitude Kargil sector, which was occupied by the Pakistani soldiers and infiltrators on the Indian side of the Line of Control (LoC).The armies of the nuclear-armed nations fought the war between May and July in Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir and elsewhere along the LoC. Indian forces took nearly three months to recapture the posts.India lost 527 soldiers in the short but sharp conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kargil-war-is-symbol-of-armed-forces-valour-bravery-and-sacrifice-jp-nadda/story-rzsAZYrCCjS7AcxrkUbj5L.html

Vishwaprasanna Teertha Swami, head of Udupi-based Pejawar Mutt in Karnataka, who attended a recent virtual meeting of the trust, said it was suggested a sum of Rs ten per head be collected and Rs 100 from household as part of the resource mobilisation efforts. “It’s just a suggestion, it’s not like tax. It’s kind of a road-map for people who are desirous of participating in the construction of the Mandir,” the seer told PTI. “We will accept donations from whoever has devotion towards and faith in Lord Ram,” he said when asked if contributions would be accepted from all communities and not limited to Hindus only. Whoever has devotion and respect towards and faith in Lord Ram... there is nothing like they should be from this community... or they should not be from this community...thats left for them, the Pejawar Swamiji said. He also said Rs ten per head and Rs 100 per household is a suggested contribution, adding, the trust would accept any amount it could be Re one or Rs one crore. The trust proposed to raise additional financial requirements from corporate social responsibility funds of companies, he added. According to him, the temple construction, the ground- breaking ceremony for which is slated for next week, would cost an estimated Rs 300 crore, and another sum of around Rs 1,000 crore would be required for development of surrounding areas for temple-related activities. An extensive month-long funds mobilisation campaign would be held from around November 25, the pontiff added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/donations-from-all-faiths-to-be-accepted-for-ram-temple-construction-trust-member/story-Tf44lc0YzI1TcdUTnIlcKP.html

The Gehlot camp, which is confident of its numbers and feels a floor test may be its best bet to end the political crisis, has said the governor is delaying convening a session due to pressure from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government.Mishra has denied the charge, saying he will follow constitutional norms to convene the House.The governor had turned down the earlier proposal sent by the Congress government and said that it did not mention a date or a reason.Congress functionaries aware of the developments said on Saturday that the Rajasthan government has addressed Mishra’s queries on the urgent need for holding a special session of the assembly.Legislators supporting chief minister Gehlot had on Friday staged a five-hour demonstration at Raj Bhavan to push for their demand for a special sitting.Gehlot had told MLAs at a Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting on Saturday that he was ready to knock at the doors of the President’s House and protest outside the Prime Minister’s residence in the national capital to defeat the BJP’s “conspiracy” to topple his government, according to the Congress functionaries who did not want to be named.The BJP has denied the Congress’ allegations and said that an internal feud has triggered the current crisis. On his part, Pilot had said he has no plans of joining the BJP.Gehlot has the support of 101 members, excluding Speaker CP Joshi. Pilot has the backing of 18 Congress MLAs and three Independents, taking his tally to 22. The BJP and its ally Rashtriya Loktrantrik Party have 75 seats. Bhanwarlal Meghwal, one Congress MLA said to be close to Pilot, is indisposed.If Pilot’s tally is added to that of the opposition alliance, it takes their number up to 97.A three-member swing from the Gehlot camp to the Pilot camp or to the BJP could lead to the government falling in the event of a floor test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gehlot-resends-proposal-for-assembly-session-to-governor-no-mention-of-floor-test/story-ZWojZo4esE44MFBzBQGtLO.html

The prime minister reiterated the importance of wearing masks and maintaining social distancing amid the Covid-19 pandemic and applauded the efforts of groups in various states including Bihar, Jharkhand and northeast to promote local products amid the pandemic.He said this year’s Independence Day will be celebrated amid the pandemic and urged the youth to resolve to make India Atmanirbhar (self-reliant). The prime minister also expressed solidarity with those affected by floods across India. Also read: Tired of wearing masks, think of corona warriors - PM Modi on Mann Ki BaatHere are PM Modi’s top quotes from the 67th edition of Mann Ki Baat• Today is Kargil Vijay Diwas. 21 years ago, on this day our Army won the Kargil war. India can never forget circumstances under which the war was fought. Pakistan undertook this misadventure with sinister plans to capture India’s land and to divert its ongoing internal conflicts.• You can imagine, the enemy was perched high on the mountains while our forces were fighting them. But the high morale and true of our forces won against mountains.• Today, the Covid-19 recovery rate in our country is better compared to other countries; the mortality rate in the context of corona in our country is much less as well, compared to most countries, of course, the loss of even one life is saddening, but India has also succeeded in saving the lives of millions of her people. • At many places, Covid-19 is spreading fast. We need to be extra vigilant. We have to bear in mind that corona is as fatal today as it was in the beginning - that’s why we have to be cautious.• Wearing a face mask, using a ‘gamchcha’ or a light towel to cover, two-yard distancing, frequently washing hands, avoiding spitting anywhere, taking full care of hygiene and sanitation- these are our weapons to protect us from corona.• There are times when masks cause inconvenience, one feels like removing them from the face- especially during a conversation. When a mask is required the most, we tend to remove it. At such times, I urge you that whenever you feel your mask is bothersome and you want to remove it, spare a thought for those doctors, those nurses; think of our corona warriors.• You will find them wearing masks for hours together, diligently working to save our lives- sometimes wearing masks for a span of eight to ten hours. Doesn’t that discomfort them? Just think about them... you too will feel that as citizens, we should not be negligent at all; nor let others be so.• I urge the youth, the people of my country to take a pledge of freedom from the pandemic this Independence Day. Take a resolve for a self-reliant India, a resolve to learn and teach something new and a resolve to earnestly carry out our duties.• The festival of Raksha Bandhan is approaching. I have seen that many people and organisations are running initiatives to celebrate the festival in a different manner. Many are linking it to ‘Vocal for Local’ which is a step in the right direction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-pm-modi-s-mann-ki-baat-address-a-tribute-to-kargil-bravehearts-corona-warriors-top-quotes/story-Pzw8lm7uQdImaTPyHhVRyI.html

26-07-2020||India||‘High morale of our forces won against mountains in Kargil War’: PM Modi on Mann Ki Baat||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday recalled Indian Army’s victory in the Kargil War in 1999, and criticised Pakistan saying it undertook the misadventure with sinister plans to capture India’s land.“Today is Kargil Vijay Diwas. 21 years ago, on this day our Army won the Kargil war. India can never forget circumstances under which the war was fought. Pakistan undertook this misadventure with sinister plans to capture India’s land and to divert its ongoing internal conflicts,” PM Modi said on Mann ki Baat.“India was then trying to have cordial relations with Pakistan but as it is said it is the nature of wicked to have enmity with everyone for no reason. People of such nature think evil even of those who do good to them. That is why in response to India’s friendly endeavours Pakistan tried to backstab. But the world witnessed the valour and strength of India’s brave forces,” he added.“You can imagine, the enemy was perched high on the mountains while our forces were fighting them. But the high morale and true grit of our forces won against mountains,” said the prime minister.Earlier, PM Modi had tweeted on India’s victory in Kargil and said that “we remember the courage and determination of our armed forces”.On July 26, 1999, the Indian armed forces had defeated Pakistan in a conflict in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kargil district. Since then, the day is celebrated as ‘Kargil Vijay Diwas’ to rekindle the pride and valour of the soldiers who took part in Operation Vijay.The conflict began in May 1999 after Indian forces detected infiltrations by Pakistani troops and terrorists into Indian territory. The Pakistani side had a strategic advantage during the start of the conflict as they had positioned themselves in key locations and could fire at advancing Indian troops.After identifying the points of incursions, the Indian Army had launched Operation Vijay to take on the Pakistanis. The Indian Air Force too joined the conflict with their MiG-21, MiG-27 and Mirage-2000 fighters firing rockets and missiles at “fortified enemy positions” from their side of Line of Control or LoC.The victory came after nearly three-month-long battle in the icy heights of Kargil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-morale-of-our-forces-won-against-mountains-in-kargil-war-pm-modi-on-mann-ki-baat/story-zzFbRygsERtm9HLlNboqFJ.html
26-07-2020||India||MVA govt’s steering wheel is in my hands, says Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has dared the opposition to topple his government and said though it is a “three-wheeler” government, he is firmly in control of its steering wheel.Thackeray, who is also president of the Shiv Sena, said his alliance partners - NCP and Congress - are “positive” and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is benefitting from their experience.He also took an aim at the Centre’s ambitious Mumbai- Ahmedabad bullet train project, saying he would rather prefer such a high speed link between the state capital and Nagpur.“The future of my government is not in the hands of the opposition. The steering is in my hands. A three-wheeler (auto-rickshaw) is a vehicle of poor people. The other two are sitting behind,” Thackeray said in the second and last part of his interview published in Shiv Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ on Sunday, ahead of his 60th birthday on Monday.“Why wait for September-October as is being speculated. Topple the government right now since you get pleasure in toppling. Some people derive pleasure in constructive work while some are happy in destruction. If you feel happy in destruction, go ahead,” he said.“You say the MVA government is formed against the democratic principles but when you topple it, is it democracy?” the chief minister asked.Notably, his predecessor Devendra Fadnavis earlier compared the ruling MVA, comprising the Shiv Sena and its ideological opponents Congress and NCP, with a three-wheeler, auto-rickshaw, and raised doubts over its stability.To a question, Thackeray said he hadn’t switched sides, but only entered into an alliance.“I did this because the purpose with which I had joined hands earlier turned out to be hollow,” he said.Asserting that the party ideology is important, he said, “Show me one leader who has reached the top position in the party which he has defected to. It is all use and throw policy.” Targeting the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project, he said, “A three-wheeler is a vehicle of poor people. If I have to choose between a bullet train and an auto-rickshaw,I will chose the auto-rickshaw. If people don’t want a bullet train, then it will not happen,” he said.“If my government is a three-wheeler, it is moving in a proper direction, why should you have stomachache?” he said in a veiled attack at the opposition BJP.Thackeray said when he attended the NDA meeting last time, “there were 30 to 35 wheels like a railway train”.The chief minister said he would scrap projects which people feel are unwanted.He said MoUs worth Rs 16,000 crore signed recently are in initial stages and more investments are on the anvil.“If the state requires a bullet train, I would demand a bullet train to connect Mumbai and Nagpur. I would like a bullet train which connects my state capital and the second capital. The feeling of neglect among people of Vidarbha would be wiped out. Just like the Mumbai Nagpur Samruddhi corridor, I would be happy with a bullet train,” he said.He also said the Congress’s grievance of being neglected in the three-party alliance government was resolved after his meeting with the state Congress leaders.“I have good coordination with (NCP chief) Sharad Pawar. I make a phone call to (Congress president) Sonia Gandhi some times,” he said. Thackeray asserted that the tripartite MVA government was functioning well. “I admit that in the last few months, face-to-face meetings haven’t happened. One more minister is coronavirus positive now after Jitendra Awhad, Ashok Chavan and Dhananjay Munde. All ministers are in touch with each other over phone or through video conferencing,” he said.Thackeray admitted the state’s economy is not in good shape, but noted the entire world is facing such a crisis.He said Prime MinisterNarendra Modi has asked all chief ministers not to announce any waivers or subsidies as populist measures due to which the economy would be further burdened.In an apparent reference to his criticism over not moving out during the COVID-19 pandemic, Thackeray said discussions and deliberations as well as signing of MoUs were being done by him sitting at home.Asked about the participation of Chinese firms in investing in the state, he said more than the presence of Chinese firms in the recent MoUs, what is important is whether Chinese investments should remain in the country or not.“During a video conference meeting with the prime minister, I had requested him to frame a national policy on doing business with China,” he said.Thackeray also said his government had kept the MoUs with Chinese firms on hold.“There should be a policy on whether Chinese companies should be allowed to do business in the country. If tomorrow, the situation improves and the Chinese prime minister is welcomed in India, why should we miss the business opportunities now?” he asked.The chief minister also rejected criticism that bureaucracy has an upper hand in his government.“The government is the decision-maker and bureaucracy implements the decisions,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mva-govt-s-steering-wheel-is-in-my-hands-says-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray/story-taskXfW7ruHkvDxCT1Xi2H.html

The Pakistani side had a strategic advantage during the start of the conflict as they positioned themselves in key locations and could fire at advancing Indian troops.* The Indian Army was able to ascertain the points of incursion based on information from local shepherds and launched Operation Vijay.* IAF’s launched its air operations under Operation Safed Sagar in support of the army on May 26.

26-07-2020||India||Civil society organisations in Rajasthan demand assembly session for political stability||More than 86 organisations, their 200 representatives and prominent individuals wrote to Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra on Saturday to express concern over the ongoing political crisis in the state.Rajasthan is in the middle of a political crisis after the rebellion by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and a section of legislators backing him. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s camp is confident of its numbers and feels a floor test may be its best bet to end the crisis. It has said the governor is delaying convening a session due to pressure from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government. Mishra has denied the charge and said he will follow constitutional norms to convene the House.“In order to give the people of the state political stability, the decision of the cabinet to call the state assembly session should be respected and the state assembly session should be convened urgently,” they wrote. Also read: Rajasthan crisis puts governors’ powers in the spotlightThe letter also dwelled into legal arguments provided by several constitutional experts, who had a consensus that according to the Article 174 of the Constitution and the three Supreme Court judgments—1994 Bommai (Karnataka State), 2016 Rebiya (Arunachal State) and 2020 Shivraj Singh (Madhya Pradesh)—only floor test in Vidhan Sabha is the permissible way of establishing the majority of any party. “According to article 174 if the Assembly has to be convened the Governor ‘shall’ act on the ‘aid and advise’ of the Council of Ministers headed by the CM,” the letter said. It added that the only exception to this process, where the cabinet has exclusive rights to call a session of the assembly at the timing of its choosing, is if the governor believes based on an objective evaluation that the party in power has lost its majority--the only way in which its majority can be tested is on the floor of the house--and therefore, the governor can use his discretion to call the assembly under such circumstances.

Police have said he died by suicide.Watch: ‘Sushant changed 50 SIM cards’, other missing links cited for CBI probe Several people, including Rajput’s close friend Rhea Chakraborty, have called for a CBI inquiry into his death. Actor Shekhar Suman and Bharatiya Janata Party parliamentarian Subramanian Swamy were also among those who have called for a CBI investigation.However, Maharashtra’s home minister Anil Deshmukh has ruled out requests for a CBI probe in the case. Deshmukh has said that Mumbai Police ate capable of handling the case. Bhandari said the word “suicide came in within minutes of his death and that became a defining narrative on the entire media.”“The normal thing is to call it a mysterious death, investigate it and after you investigate it you may come to a conclusion that it’s a tragedy, it’s abetment to suicide, or it’s a foul murder,” he said.“But how do you come to that conclusion in a few minutes? So that means you have a predetermined conclusion. That was something which started me off. After that the questions kept on piling up, the deeper I went into it,” he added.The lawyer cited “lapses” on part of the police and other aspects that Rajput allegedly changed 50 SIM cards on his phone. He said he has written to the Mumbai Police, which is investigating the actor’s death, regarding these aspects.“In the first letter, I said that there is source-based, not even source-based, name-based information that Sushant Singh Rajput changed his SIM cards 50 times. I wrote to them asking whether they had ceased all those SIM cards, the electronic evidence of all of them as well as the electronic evidence of people incidental and connected to him. That’s basic,” he said.“That’s an extraordinarily high number and that is why I wrote that this evidence must be sealed. If Mumbai Police investigate it, hopefully, they would have already done it. If they have not done it, then that is raising more and more questions,” he said.He said he also asked them whether they had sealed the flat and conducted forensic search citing “reports in reliable mainstream media” that they did so after a day of Rajput’s death. “That is very surprising and a very glaring lapse of a procedure because we all know evidence can get contaminated. In fact, they say even the family pets should not be there in the room after there is an occurrence because even a pet can contaminate a scene, leave alone humans. So, why was that basic thing not done and I wrote a letter to them saying at the end of the day justice is about public confidence. Law and order is also about public confidence,” he said.Bhandari pointed out that nobody has come forward to say that the police followed procedures.“Those statements are not coming and the judgements of the highest courts of this country, which is the Supreme Court, says that public confidence is an integral part of justice delivery system and also where influential people are involved,” he said.Police have said they have recorded the statements of dozens of people, including his family, friends, co-stars and close aides, in the investigations ordered by the Maharashtra government into the actor’s death on June 14. He also said the police took days to record statements of “prominent people” in connection with the case. “So, anybody being questioned is by definition an influential person, is by definition a person with means and sources, is by definition a person close to all administrations. So, it has to go out of the local police to avoid any conflicts of interest and it has to a central agency,” he pointed out.The lawyer pointed to “the old maxim of law that justice not only is done, but it should also be seen to be done”.“So, this has to go to CBI. In this case, there are lapses also. I am saying even without lapses, this was a case which should have gone to CBI.”“The Maharashtra government as a best practice will give it to a central agency. In case they do not, one may need to go to the court and because people demand satisfaction in this case and they must have the satisfaction that justice and transparent justice is being done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-s-50-sim-cards-other-missing-links-call-for-cbi-probe-lawyer/story-P8VT2ezgXLj5XKOYpozjJJ.html

26-07-2020||India||China tried to jab India with a new claim on Bhutan. Why it has boomeranged||President Xi Jinping’s strategy to expand its territorial dispute with Bhutan to needle India appears to have brought the tiny kingdom nestled in the Himalayas closer to New Delhi. Thimphu, which had last found itself caught in the crossfire between India and China during the 2017 Doklam standoff appeared to have had second thoughts about its proximity to India vis-a-vis China, people familiar with the developments told Hindustan Times.There was lately, an emerging view in Bhutan, wedged geographically between India and China, that the kingdom should perhaps balance its ties with its two neighbours so that Thimphu isn’t squeezed between the giants again. “It was never spelt out in black and white but this view was gaining ground over the last two-three years,” people in New Delhi and Thimphu said.But there has been a change in Thimpu’s approach over the last one month after Beijing stunned Bhutan at the June meeting of the US-based multinational fund, Global Environment Facility, when Thimphu was seeking funds for the Sakteng wildlife sanctuary. The Chinese representative objected, claiming that there was a dispute between China and Bhutan over part of the sanctuary spread across 650 sq km. Also Watch | Trump’s minister warns world against China, calls India ties ‘all-important’ The Chinese move to make new territorial claims in Bhutan has convinced Thimpu that it should not hang to any hopes that its northern neighbour, 250 times bigger, would be fair. That if it cedes any ground to appease Beijing, it would only end up fueling its territorial ambitions, the people mentioned above said.Thimphu formally protested the China claim, issuing a demarche to the Chinese mission in Delhi. Bhutan and Beijing use their missions in Delhi to communicate. It also issued a rare statement earlier this month, underlining that disputes relating to the undemarcated border would be discussed at the next round of border talks.Bhutan and China have held 24 rounds of talks since 1984 to settle their border issue, the last in 2016. Beijing has been pressuring Bhutan to accept a package deal for nearly 20 years that would let it take over Bhutanese territory of Doklam, Sinchulung, Dramana, and Shakhatoe spread across 269 sq km in the western sector. In exchange, China would give up its claim over Bhutan’s Pasamlung and Jakarlung valleys in the north.China’s claim over the nature preserve spread across 650 sq km in eastern Bhutan’s Trashigang district almost doubles the area of the disputed territories between the two countries from the existing 764 sq km.Bhutan is yet to decide on an Indian proposal to build a road through the sanctuary that would sharply reduce the 450 km long distance between Guwahati and Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh by one-third. New Delhi is expected to take up the proposal with Thimphu as part of India’s hard push to border infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-tried-to-jab-india-with-a-new-claim-on-bhutan-why-it-has-boomeranged/story-rqplyG6gdbN7eOs3X1FInM.html

The 26th report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team concerning ISIS, al-Qaida and associated individuals and entities said that the al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) operates under the Taliban umbrella from Nimruz, Helmand and Kandahar provinces of Afghanistan. “The group reportedly has between 150 and 200 members from Bangladesh, India, Myanmar and Pakistan. The current leader of AQIS is Osama Mahmood…, who succeeded the late Asim Umar… AQIS is reportedly planning retaliation operations in the region to avenge the death of its former leader,” it said.Also read: 6,500 Pakistan terrorists present in Afghanistan, most belong to TTP, says UN report According to the report, “One member state reported that the ISIL Indian affiliate (Hind Wilayah), which was announced on May 10, 2019, has between 180 and 200 members”.It said that there are “significant numbers of ISIL operatives in Kerala and Karnataka states.” In May last year, the Islamic State (also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh) terror group claimed to have established a new “province” in India, the first of its kind announcement that came after clashes between militants and security forces in Kashmir. The dreaded terror outfit, through its Amaq News Agency, had said that the Arabic name of the new branch is “Wilayah of Hind” (India Province). A senior Jammu and Kashmir police officer had rejected the claim. Previously, ISIS attacks in Kashmir were linked to its so-called Khorasan Province branch, which was set up in 2015 to cover “Afghanistan, Pakistan and nearby lands”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/significant-numbers-of-isis-terrorists-in-kerala-karnataka-claims-un-report/story-JGHuHmJ1WxQKfY9gCiaRBP.html

26-07-2020||India||Groundwork needed to build trust in vaccine||This week marked several milestones in the global effort to develop a vaccine against coronavirus disease (Covid-19), with several groups pushing ahead to have a vaccine ready for use by early 2021.A man on Friday received the first dose of the indigenous Covid-19 vaccine in Delhi developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech and Indian Council of Medical Research. The vaccine, called Covaxin, produced no immediate side effects in 24 hours after vaccination, and the volunteer who was vaccinated will be under observation for another week at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, which is one of the 12 sites in the country where the vaccine is being tested.Also Read: COVAX Facility aims to deliver two billion doses by the end of 2021The results of two randomised trials published earlier this week in The Lancet have raised hope for a vaccine against Covid-19 by early 2021. Early results show AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine, which will be produced by Serum Institute of India (SII) in Pune and called Covishield, is safe and provokes both humoral and cellular immune responses. A recombinant adenovirus type-5-vectored vaccine from China also generated an immune response without side effects. Similar results were posted for the Moderna vaccine, which is being developed in the US in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health.“There are different waves of vaccines coming, you’ve got Moderna, China and AstraZeneca, which is one of our five partnerships coming at the end of this year, so we’ll see which vaccines are the most safe and efficacious. Till then, people will be exposed and slowly build herd immunity, but that will happen only after 50-60% people get infected, which is a long way away. We can’t count on herd immunity to protect before a vaccine, which will come sooner,” said Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer of SII.Also Read: Human trials for Covid-19 vaccines by Bharat Biotech, Zydus underway in 6 citiesHe cautioned that producing enough doses for the whole world won’t happen overnight. “Scaling up to cater to the whole population will take four to five years in terms of the global population,” said Poonawalla.Scientists warn that the hype around efforts is also feeding fears about vaccine safety, which is already being exploited by anti-vaxxers who are playing on the distrust of national governments and profiteering by pharmaceutical companies.Also Read: Cipla launching Covid-19 treatment drug Ciplenza in August at Rs 68 per tabletIn an editorial in journal The Lancet, which published results of the Oxford and China vaccine trials this week, editor-in-chief Richard Horton noted, “Opinion polls suggest that in some countries, such as the USA, as little as half the eligible population would be willing to receive a vaccine against Sars-CoV-2. The arguments cover familiar ground—ranging from claims that the pharmaceutical industry is trying to profit from the pandemic to the notion that the virus poses little danger to human health. The context of urgency is also strengthening the anti-vaccination movement. President Trump has called the US vaccine programme Operation Warp Speed. This designation has led some anti-vaccine activists to claim that corners are being cut in safety testing.”People in India have traditionally accepted mass vaccination programmes, which helped the country eradicate small pox in April 1977, two and a half years before its global eradication in December 1979. But over the past two decades, vaccine scepticism is growing.Also Read: The twin tales of vanishing antibodies, robust T-cells | OpinionPolio eradication wasn’t as easy, with the wild polio virus sustaining in several pockets because people refused to get their children vaccinated because of fake news and malicious rumours of side effects, such as autism and impotence.Campaigns to give children the Measles-Rubella (MR) vaccine against measles, and adolescent girls the HPV vaccine against cervical cancer ran into roadblocks, which makes it important to begin the groundwork to build the public’s trust in the vaccine.That is possible only by bringing people on board by increasing transparency in both information sharing, and discussing concerns. Governments and health agencies must allay fears about safety, availability and profiteering and assure the public that vaccination of those at risk, including front-line workers and older people, will be prioritised.Also Read: Serum Institute plans to manufacture one billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine over next year Public health campaigns should be planned keeping in mind learnings from polio and MR vaccination drives, where disinformation preceded vaccines across states, which primed communities to refuse even before health workers got a chance to explain its benefits.“A Covid-19 vaccination strategy demands a whole-of-society response—incorporating business, trade unions, faith communities, charities, media, entertainment, and sports. A vaccine to protect the public against SARS-CoV-2 is the most important and immediate technical challenge humanity has ever faced—at a moment when public trust in science and government is alarmingly brittle,” said Horton, in his editorial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/groundwork-needed-to-build-trust-in-vaccine/story-loTdSUP0RecsdWMXA0TtII.html

Expressing anguish over the rising number of fatalities, the opposition parties blamed the Pramod Sawant government for failure to rein in the virus outbreak.The 14-year-old is the youngest person in the state till date to succumb to Covid-19, after the 29-year-old who died five days ago.The deaths reported on Saturday also included two patients in their fifties, a 65-year-old and two people in their eighties, according to the official bulletin released by the state government.With 146 new cases reported on Saturday, Goa has recorded 4,686 cases of the novel coronavirus so far of which 3,047 have been declared as cured.“With death toll rising & a 14 year old losing life, Will @BJP4Goa @GovtofGoa @goacm still go ahead suspending all rules & pass budget & conduct business without discussion during 1 day Assembly Session? Is #CovidPandemic & peoples suffering last priority for Government?”, leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat tweeted, referring to the one -day monsoon session of the Goa Legislative Assembly that has been scheduled for Monday.Another opposition leader, Vijai Sardesai of the Goa Forward Party, too, hit out at the state government for the death toll. “It’s 6 deaths as of the moment, which includes a 14 year old & even 2 people of around 50 years of age! The comorbidity excuse also is not tenable! And the Govt looks all at sea!” he tweeted.Goa has also seen the positivity rate increase over the last few weeks which now stands a little above 4% but is expected to increase further with the testing capacity failing to keep pace with the rising demand for tests. The number of positive cases has remained steady over the last week or so, hovering a little below 200 positive cases per day, but nearly 7,000 swabs are pending for testing as labs are overwhelmed.However, an official said that more samples are being taken for surveillance purposes and the authorities are closely watching the (Covid-19) figures.“We are taking all measures that we are seeing that our labs are operating 24x7. Everybody is alert and aware and we are closely watching the figures,” health secretary Nila Mohanan said.“With the number of cases on the rise and new containment zones coming into place, we are taking more samples for surveillance purposes and then we also have Aarogya Setu data which is now routinely being used… people have started getting SMS and phone calls from the past one week onwards that recommends that they come forward for testing. So we are encouraging those people to come forward and give their samples,” Mohanan added when asked to explain the increased pendency in testing and the positivity rate.Despite being a small state, Goa’s numbers are more than double that of Himachal Pradesh and comparable to that of Uttarakhand and Chattisgarsh, states much larger but arguably more rural.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/14-yr-old-is-goa-s-youngest-covid-19-victim-positive-cases-rise-to-4-686/story-3Z1KH9ednrhrUDrhHU3eXJ.html
26-07-2020||India||St. Stephen’s College to penalise hostellers Rs 100 per day for not vacating rooms||The Delhi University’s St. Stephen’s College will be charging a penalty of Rs 100 per day from hostellers who will not vacate their rooms till August 7, a move that has upset many students. Students are unhappy with the latest notice and said it is “unfair” to them especially at this time when they are stuck in their home towns. According to college principal John Varghese, the students have been sent repeated reminders since the beginning of July and the college has to “fumigate” and “sanitise” the rooms for the students who will be coming after the new session begins. “Considering the ongoing pandemic, and the many requests submitted by the resident junior members, students who are unable to vacate their rooms will be allowed to retain their rooms with a modest room rent charge of Rs 100 per day starting from August 7, 2020,” a notice posted on the college website said. “Resident Junior members are also hereby notified that, if and when the government gives the permission to reopen the residence facilities, all belongings and luggage will be moved a week prior to the date of residence reopening to facilitate necessary cleaning and renovations. In such occasion, the college will not be responsible for loss or damages,” the notice added. Prior to this, another notice was issued to the students on June 23 asking them to vacate their rooms. A hosteller, who is currently in West Bengal, said the college is being “unfair” and is charging almost double the amount of what they would usually pay for the room. He left Delhi for his home town two days prior to March 9, when the mid-semester break started. The mid-semester break was till March 15 but before that the Delhi University announced that it would be closed in view of the coronavirus pandemic. “Subsequently, the lockdown was announced and we were unable to come back to Delhi. Even in the current situation, it is not safe to travel. Students are stuck in northeast and far off places and won’t be able to come back in time to collect their belongings. We usually pay Rs 1,400 as the room rent but going by the current rate, we will end up paying Rs 3,000 for a month,” the student said on the condition of anonymity.He said that students have been provided the option to authorise their local guardians to collect their belongings but that is also not possible since the keys of the rooms are with the hostellers. Another hosteller, who is stuck in Kashmir, cited the issue of unsafe travel during the pandemic and said that he has written to the dean (residence) but their has been no solution to the issue. “There are some students who live nearby Delhi and could travel by car and collect their belongings. But my local guardian lives in a containment zone and won’t be able to travel in such a situation. It is unfair during this time,” he said. The college principal said that a section of students is circulating “misinformation”. “By the time the lockdown happened, a lot of the students had gone for the mid-semester break. Since the lockdown happened, they didn’t come back. Nobody is talking about the fact that the college is not charging them from the period from the time they were not here till August 7. They have not been charged a single paise for the period they were not here,” Varghese told PTI. He said there were a few students who were there till June 30 and they would be charged only for the time they were here which means they won’t be charged for July. “We have admissions and we have to get ready for the fresh set of students and in our hostels, applications are made every year. So we have to get ready the rooms, carry out repairs, fumigation, sanitisation and then get rooms for the fresh set of students, who will come, but we don’t know when,” he added. “Unless the things are removed, we cannot carry out either repairs or sanitisation,” he said, adding that the dean (residence) has been telling all of them to remove their belongings and in case they are unable to come, they can authorise a friend or a relative in Delhi to come and remove their stuff. Many of the students have done that, the college principal said. From July onwards, regular notices and information have been going to the students and they have been given a deadline till August 7. “Now the lockdown has been opened up and there is no restriction on travel. What is preventing them? That will be true (about restrictions in certain places) but they are in direct communication with dean’s office and they have been asked to authorise someone here. I don’t think a big number of students have their belongings still kept here,” the college principal said. Varghese said that what they are being asked to pay is not a “rent” but a “penalty”. “You deposit a luggage in an airport or railway station’s cloak room and you are charged by the hour. But we have to be fair and we have to prepare for the students who are coming,” he said. In the current scenario, the process of sanitisation and cleaning is going to be a longer process, Varghese said. He added that there are “certain procedures” that can be followed if the students have taken the keys with them and they are aware about the process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/st-stephen-s-college-to-penalise-hostellers-rs-100-per-day-for-not-vacating-rooms/story-VDHDOs47v7v99e325atTaN.html

26-07-2020||India||India, China likely to hold fifth round of Corps Commander-level talks next week||India and China are set to hold a fresh round of high-level military talks next week to work out modalities for withdrawal of Chinese troops from Pangong Tso area in eastern Ladakh, government sources said on Saturday.So far, senior military commanders of the two armies have held four rounds of talks on disengagement of troops from the friction points in eastern Ladakh with an aim to restore peace and tranquillity in the region.The sources said the ongoing engagement and dialogue at military and diplomatic levels have resulted in complete disengagement of troops at patrolling point 14, 15 and 17 A in eastern Ladakh.“A meeting between senior military commanders of the two armies is expected in the coming week to further work out modalities of Pangong Tso lake area,” said a source.People familiar with the developments said Chinese military has pulled back from Galwan Valley and certain other friction points but the withdrawal of troops has not moved forward from Finger 5 to Finger 8 in Pangong Tso area as demanded by India.On Friday, the two sides held another round of diplomatic talks on the border issue. After the talks, the Ministry of External Affairs said both sides agreed that an early and complete disengagement of the troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in accordance with bilateral agreement and protocols was essential for overall development of bilateral relations.The people familiar with the developments said India conveyed a firm message to the Chinese side that it has to implement the disengagement process as agreed to during the four rounds of Corps Commander-level talks between the two militaries.National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a nearly two-hour-long telephonic conversation on July 5 to bring down tension in the region. Both sides commenced the disengagement process from July 6 following talks between Doval and Wang who are Special Representatives for the boundary question.After the fourth round of Corps Commander-level talks, the Army said both sides are committed to “complete disengagement” of troops, adding the process is “intricate” and it requires “constant verification”.During a visit to eastern Ladakh last week, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said progress has been made in the ongoing talks with China to find a solution to the border standoff but he cannot guarantee to what extent it would be resolved.The tension in eastern Ladakh escalated manifold after the violent clashes in Galwan Valley on June 15 in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed. The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details. According to an American intelligence report, the number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35. After the last round of military talks, government sources said the Indian side conveyed a “very clear” message to the Chinese army that status quo ante must be restored in eastern Ladakh and it will have to follow all mutually agreed protocols for border management to bring back peace and tranquillity. Government sources said India is keeping a hawk eye vigil on all areas along the LAC in Ladakh and will maintain a high-level of alertness to deal with any eventualities.

26-07-2020||India||Disengagement is complex, our aim is status quo ante: Army||Northern Army commander Lieutenant General YK Joshi on Saturday said that disengagement between Indian and Chinese soldiers deployed in forward positions at flashpoints along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) between the two countries was a complex and intricate process that required diligent execution -- indicating that the situation along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh hasn’t returned to normal. Joshi told news channels that the army would continue all efforts to restore status quo ante (the situation as it existed in early April) along the LAC. India matched a build-up by the Chinese in the area, starting early May, and matters came to a head on June 15 when Indian and Chinese soldiers clashed , leaving 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese ones dead. India and China have lately failed to make a breakthrough in reducing border tensions despite intense negotiations at the military and diplomatic levels, and the disengagement process at some points has virtually stopped, according to people aware of the developments. HT reported last week, citing people familiar with the matter, that the two armies have amassed almost 100,000 soldiers in their forward and depth areas. Joshi’s comments came a day after the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on India-China border affairs reviewed the situation in the border areas and the disengagement process in the western sector of the LAC.At the meeting, the two sides agreed that another meeting of corps commanders “may be held soon so as to work out further steps to ensure expeditiously complete disengagement and de-escalation” along the LAC, the ministry of external affairs said in a statement on Friday.The meeting is expected to be held next week but no dates have been finalised yet. Joshi said disengagement was initiated after four rounds of talks between senior Indian and Chinese military commanders, and it was being verified on the ground to “ensure its veracity and correctness.” He said de-escalation of the border conflict would begin after achieving complete disengagement.The ground situation remains unchanged in the Ladakh sector where both armies have amassed almost 100,000 soldiers in their forward and depth areas.During a visit to Ladakh on July 17, defence minister Rajnath Singh indicated that the negotiations to resolve military tensions along the LAC were complex. He said progress in negotiations should help resolve the border dispute but added that he “couldn’t guarantee to what extent the situation will be resolved.” On Wednesday, Singh asked the Indian Air Force to stay prepared for any eventuality.The disengagement process has barely made progress after the last round of meeting between senior Indian and Chinese commanders on July 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disengagement-is-complex-our-aim-is-status-quo-ante-army/story-HNDoGa05WiNXC9cFPJ0k6O.html
26-07-2020||India||We’ll protest at PM’s house, warns Gehlot||The Rajasthan government has addressed governor Kalraj Mishra’s queries on the urgent need for holding a special session of the assembly and requested him to convene the House on July 31, Congress functionaries aware of the developments said on Saturday, a day after legislators supporting chief minister Ashok Gehlot staged a five-hour demonstration at Raj Bhavan to push for their demand for a special sitting. Raising the pitch in the midst of a political crisis, Gehlot told MLAs at a Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting that he was ready to knock at the doors of the President’s House and protest outside the Prime Minister’s residence in the national capital to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s “conspiracy” to topple his government, according to the Congress functionaries who did not want to named. A letter by the Congress sent to Mishra stressed that the governor had to go by the aid and advice of the council of ministers on convening, proroguing or dissolving the House and that he cannot dictate procedures of the House, which was in the domain of the speaker, said the people aware of the developments. Mishra was yet to take a final call on convening the session till late Saturday night. Officials in his office, who did not want to be named, said a “considered” view was being taken on the fresh proposal and a decision will be announced at an “appropriate” time. “The fresh proposal has been prepared with keeping legalities and provisions in mind, and approved by the cabinet before it was sent to Raj Bhavan,” a minister in the Gehlot government said, a day after Mishra sought to know the emergency for summoning the session and its agenda. Facing protests by legislators backing Gehlot, Mishra, who was in the BJP before becoming the governor, also asked why the chief minister was pushing for a floor test even though no one had put forth such a demand and how the government was planning to protect the MLAs in the backdrop of the Covid-19 outbreak. “We have proposed calling the session from July 31, giving sufficient time for MLAs to reach and attend the assembly. The governor is also informed of the important bills and business to be tabled in house,” the minister quoted above said. He added that the Rajasthan Epidemic Diseases Ordinance 2020, notified in May for strict enforcement of Covid-19 restrictions, also needed to be tabled in the House. Rajasthan is facing a political crisis due to a rebellion by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and a section of legislators backing him. The Gehlot camp, which is confident of its numbers and feels a floor test may be its best bet to end the political crisis, says the governor is delaying convening a session due to pressure from the BJP-led central government. Mishra denies the charge and says he will follow constitutional norms to convene the House. “He had queries. We have replied to them,” a second minister. The proposal has been submitted after consultation with the speaker, he said. The draft proposal was prepared at a cabinet meeting that began at 10pm on Friday night and stretched to 1am, Congress functionaries said. It was finalised at another cabinet meeting later on Saturday. According to the law laid down by the Supreme Court, the governor notifies the holding of a session on the recommendation of the council of ministers. Former Chief Justice of India P Sathasivam said normally, as per the Constitution, the advice of the council of ministers is binding on the governor, but when there is a dispute about issues such as the number of lawmakers supporting a chief minister, then it is a special case. “The governor can exercise his discretion. He can then summon MLAs to Raj Bhavan [governor’s house], make inquiries, and have discussions with various MLA groups, etc. So the general rule that the governor is bound by aid and advice of the council of ministers might not be relevant in the Rajasthan matter,” said Sathasivam, who has also served as Kerala governor. Earlier in the day, a CLP meeting was held at a luxury hotel on the Jaipur-Delhi highway, where MLAs backing Gehlot have been camping since July 13. “We will not let the BJP conspiracy to succeed. If required, we will go to the Rashtrapati Bhavan and stage dharna; if necessary, we will protest outside the PM’s house,” a senior Congress leader quoted CM Gehlot as saying. “This fight is to save democracy.” Congress general secretary Avinash Pande said the high command made efforts so that members can freely talk about issues if they had complaints. “...but unfortunately, they became puppet in the hands of BJP and I don’t think that there return is possible from there,” he said, apparently referring to the Pilot camp. Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala praised the “unity and collectiveness” shown by the MLAs at Friday’s demonstration. “...in the future, it will be remembered how 102 people together defeated those who were trying to crush the Constitution,” he said. The BJP denies the Congress’s claim that it is behind the Rajasthan turmoil and says the crisis was triggered by an internal feud in the Congress. Pilot, for his part, says he has no plans of joining the BJP. Gehlot has the support of 101 members (though this does not include speaker CP Joshi). Pilot has 18 other Congress MLAs and three independents in his camp, taking his tally to 22. The BJP and its ally Rashtriya Loktrantrik Party have 75 seats. Bhanwarlal Meghwal, one Congress MLA said to be close to Pilot, is indisposed. If Pilot’s tally is added to that of the opposition alliance, it takes their number up to 97. A three-member swing from the Gehlot camp to the Pilot camp or to the BJP could lead to the government falling in the event of a floor test. Meanwhile, a delegation of 15 BJP leaders, including state party president Satish Poonia and MLAs from Jaipur City, met the governor in the evening and expressed displeasure at chief minister Gehlot’s Friday remarks that the people of the state could gherao Raj Bhavan if the Mishra did not convene a session.“The pressure on the governor to get a decision in their favour is a derogatory attempt to threaten constitutional institutions,” they said in a memorandum that was shared with the media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-ll-protest-at-pm-s-house-warns-gehlot/story-f4jJGTdDQx6y4TDhZbbO7I.html
26-07-2020||India||MP CM Chouhan tests positive for Covid, hospitalised||Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan tested positive for coronavirus, he disclosed in a series of tweets on Saturday while appealing to people who came in contact with him recently to get tested and isolate themselves. “My dear people of the state, I had symptoms of Covid-19 and after the test my report has come back positive. I appeal to whoever came in contact with me to get their Covid tests done. My close contacts should quarantine themselves,” Chouhan said in a tweet in Hindi. A few hours later he tweeted, “Doctors have advised me to get myself admitted to a hospital. I am going to the Covid-19 dedicated Chirayu Hospital for admission. A coronavirus patient should not insist he will stay in home quarantine and not go to the hospital. We should follow the instructions of the doctors. If Covid-19 is treated on time, a person is completely cured.” Chouhan and some colleagues visited Lucknow in a government plane on July 21 to attend the funeral of MP governor Lalji Tandon who died in Uttar Pradesh.“Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has appealed to the people of the state to be cautious. Even the slightest callousness may invite coronavirus. Everyone must take precautions, be safe and follow the guidelines,” said an official communiqué later from the state government. The CM said in one of his tweets, “I have been reviewing the status of corona infection every evening since March 25. I will try to review the corona situation through video-conferencing as much as possible.” However, he added that review meetings will now be conducted by home minister Narottam Mishra, urban development and administration minister Bhupendra Singh, education minister Vishvas Sarang and health minister Dr Prabhuram Choudhary in his absence. As questions did the rounds on social media about Chouhan choosing to get treatment at a private hospital and not a government facility, the official communiqué said patients suffering from other diseases were also treated at AIIMS and Hamidia Hospital, Bhopal; hence, the CM was admitted to Chirayu Medical College so that the common man did not face any difficulty. Ministerial colleagues of Chouhan, other ruling party leaders and Opposition leaders wished him a speedy recovery. Addressing the CM, senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia tweeted, “I pray to God for your speedy recovery from the disease. I wish you good health soon so that you can serve the people of the state.” The opposition Congress took a dig at the CM. State Congress president Kamal Nath said, “Shivraj ji, I am pained to know about your being infected with corona. I pray to God for your speedy recovery but it is a matter of regret that when we were serious over corona you dubbed corona as ‘darona’ [don’t fear], drama and a weapon to save (the then Congress) government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-cm-chouhan-tests-positive-for-covid-hospitalised/story-9ITiHcfBwvM1pPh5Vy2Y6M.html
26-07-2020||India||COVAX Facility aims to deliver 2 bn doses by end of 2021: Dr Poonam K Singh||Several experimental vaccines for Covid-19 are in final-stage clinical trials and early results from two of them have established safety levels and immune response. With vaccines expected to be ready by early 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently launched the COVAX Facility as a mechanism to guarantee rapid, fair, and equitable access to countries to a broad portfolio of vaccines and manufacturers to a demand-secure market. Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, WHO Regional Director for South-East Asia, spoke to Sanchita Sharma about the facility and how it aims to deliver two billion doses by 2021-end to prioritised population groups. Edited excerpts:When is the earliest the world can expect a Covid-19 vaccine to be ready?There are promising results from the clinical trials for some vaccine candidates, which is very encouraging. However, we need to wait for the completion of the trials and their outcomes to be in a better position to understand by when the vaccines will be ready. It is important the potential vaccines meet the recommended mandatory standards of efficacy and safety before they are used for mass vaccination.WHO is working globally with partners to accelerate research and development of a safe and effective vaccine and ensure equitable access for the billions of people who will need it. But even with an accelerated process, the development and production of a vaccine will take time. We must continue to accelerate vaccine research while doing more with the tools we have.How will WHO ensure equitable access to vaccines, especially in low- and middle-income countries?WHO is committed to and will continue to advocate countries to ensure that as medicines and vaccines are developed, they are shared equitably with all countries and people. In April 2020, a global collaboration of governments, global health organisations, civil society groups, businesses, and philanthropies came together to form the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator, or the ACT-Accelerator. The idea is to form a plan for an equitable response to the Covid-19 pandemic. There are four pillars under the ACT-Accelerator, of which vaccines are one.COVAX Facility has been established recently under the vaccine pillar of the ACT-Accelerator to manage the large, diverse portfolio of Covid-19 vaccines that are under development to ensure a global sharing of risks, associated with the development of Covid-19 vaccines and equitable access based on a fair allocation of the available vaccines. The facility is a mechanism designed to guarantee rapid, fair, and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines worldwide. By connecting a pool of demand to a pool of supply, it will allow countries access to a broad portfolio of Covid-19 vaccines and provide manufacturers access to a demand-secure market.All countries have been invited to participate, and those that will are expected to receive access to vaccines procured by the facility at the negotiated price. The facility aims to deliver two billion doses by the end of 2021 to prioritised population groups in all participating countries.Also Read: Groundwork needed to build trust in vaccineWhat will be India’s role in vaccine development?India is among the largest vaccine manufacturers and is rightly called the world’s pharmacy. It is also home to many research institutes and experts. Undoubtedly, they would play an important role in making the Covid-19 vaccines available globally.WHO convened a meeting of vaccine manufacturers from South-East Asia Region on April 29 to get a landscape of the development and manufacture of potential Covid-19 vaccines. Twelve vaccine manufacturers from India, Indonesia, and Thailand participated in the meeting and shared their collaborations with vaccine developers, platforms likely to be used by them to develop the vaccines, potential timelines, and capacities for vaccine production.Also Read: Unlock 3: Metro trains, schools likely to not reopenOnce available, how should vaccines be deployed?WHO is working with member states, partners, and stakeholders to develop an allocation framework, which is expected to help countries prioritise populations at risk so that the available vaccines are provided to these priority populations first and then expanded to other populations in all countries. The aim is to ensure an equitable and fair allocation of the available vaccines across all countries. This addresses the issue of who would have priority in accessing the vaccine first, such as health care workers, essential workers, and other vulnerable populations, and how groups could be progressively prioritised as more doses become available.Also Read: India ramps up testing infra, 420,000 tested in single dayWhat does early data show on the quality of protection? Are people likely to need a booster dose?There are 23 vaccines in clinical trials. We expect more to follow as there are at least 160 candidate vaccines. We are engaging with vaccine developers and others to ensure that we have standard endpoints and data collection mechanisms to regularly monitor both the efficacy and safety of the candidates. These trials, once completed, will help to understand better the extent and duration of protection.Different vaccines are being developed using different technologies and platforms and are likely to have different efficacies, product profiles, and characteristics. This robust vaccine pipeline gives us hope, even if there many unpredictable factors that will determine their success.Should everyone be vaccinated, including children?Equitable distribution of a safe and efficacious vaccine is one of WHO’s priorities. We will continue to advocate with member countries and work with them, providing guidelines and updated information on the population at risk and those who should be vaccinated on a priority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covax-facility-aims-to-deliver-two-billion-doses-by-the-end-of-2021-dr-poonam-khetrapal-singh/story-92YrG5wkUx1T9dZeJAYuZN.html
26-07-2020||India||Unlock 3: Metro trains, schools likely to not reopen||Barring a last-minute change of mind, the Narendra Modi government is unlikely to allow the reopening of schools in the next phase of easing of restrictions that is expected next week, according to top officials involved in the discussions related to this. The officials, who asked not to be named added that metro rail services too may not start soon while gymnasium and swimming pools might also remain out of bounds, as part of the measures to check the further spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. After a 68 day hard lockdown ended on may 31, the government has announced two phases it termed Unlock 1.0 and Unlock 2.0, in June and July respectively. Each phase has allowed more activities across domains -- in an effort to revive economic activity, and return to a semblance of normalcy. Also Read: ‘What if people die?’: CM Uddhav Thackeray warns against lifting lockdownTo be sure, most activities have been allowed only outside so-called containment zones where there are still clusters of infections.

It added 48,458 cases on Saturday to take its total case tally to 1,383,959. The HRD ministry on Monday began consultation with states and other stakeholders on reopening of schools which have been closed since March due to the pandemic. In the meeting chaired by the Secretary, School Education, Anita Karwal, state education secretaries also deliberated upon health and safety of students, hygiene measures in schools and issues regarding online and digital education.

On Friday, cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba told nine states at a special review meeting that two to three-day lockdowns alone are not enough to slow the spread of the disease -- some states have started imposing such lockdowns -- and pointed out while some states have demonstrated “the situation can be turned around” others have “showed how it can deteriorate”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/metro-trains-schools-likely-to-remain-shut-in-next-phase-too/story-xiLUQNvVhwdr02tn3DLKxK.html
26-07-2020||India||Rajasthan crisis puts governors’ powers in the spotlight||A governor’s powers and role in the state legislature’s affairs are back in focus amid the political crisis in Rajasthan. Congress legislators backing Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot staged a five-hour sit-in on Friday asking governor Kalraj Mishra to call a special assembly session for a floor test. They accused Mishra of acting under pressure and not listening to their demand even as Gehlot expressed confidence of winning the trust vote necessitated by his tussle with his former deputy Sachin Pilot.Is Mishra bound by the advice of the chief minister-led council of ministers when it comes to convening the assembly session and to what extent can the governor exercise his discretion? Also Read: BJP files complaint against Congress in Rajasthan, says protest violated Epidemic ActFormer Chief Justice of India P Sathasivam said normally, as per the Constitution, the advice is binding — but, he added, when there is a dispute about issues such as the number of lawmakers supporting a chief minister, then it is a special case. “The governor can summon MLAs to Raj Bhavan [governor’s house], make inquiries, and have discussions with MLA groups, etc. The general rule that the governor is bound by aid and advice of the council of ministers might not be relevant here,” said Sathasivam, who has also served as Kerala governor.What does the Constitution say? The Constitution’s Articles 163 and 174 are relevant in the context of the governor’s powers to convene the state assembly. Article 163 says there shall be a CM-led council of ministers to aid and advise the governor except when he is required, under the Constitution, to exercise functions in his/her discretion. When can a governor exercise discretion disregarding the advice of the council of ministers? Can he do the same when convening assembly? The answer to this lies in certain Supreme Court judgments and Article 174, which says the governor “shall from time to time summon the House of the state...as he thinks fit but six months shall not intervene between its last sitting in one session and the date appointed for first sitting in the next session”.Also Read: Rajasthan political drama is back in the Supreme Court, hearing on MondayArticle 174 originates from Article 153 of the draft Constitution. The third clause of Article 153 said the governor’s power to summon the House should be exercised with discretion. When the article came up for discussion in the Constituent assembly, certain members including B R Ambedkar opposed the clause. Ambedkar sought its deletion stating it was inconsistent with the scheme of a constitutional governor. His resolution won and the clause was deleted. Draft Article 153 eventually became Article 174. Thus, the intention of the Constitution makers was not to vest the governor with the discretion when it comes to convening assembly.There are judgements that reaffirm this. The 2016 Supreme Court judgment in the Nabam Rebia v Deputy Speaker reaffirmed this interpretation of Article 174 when a five-judge Constitution bench held that the governor’s power to summon, prorogue and dissolve the House should be on the advice of the council of ministers. In this case, Arunachal Pradesh governor Jyoti Prasad Rajkhowa had summoned the assembly on January 14, 2016. However, at least 20 rebel Congress MLAs joined hands with the BJP and met Rajkhowa expressing their displeasure with speaker Nabam Rebia. Also Read: ‘You be the judge’: Chidambaram digs out SC ruling after Rajasthan court orderRajkhowa rescheduled the session to December 16, 2015, after meeting the rebel Congress and BJP MLAs. This was done without the aid and advice of the council of ministers. Rebia moved the Supreme Court against Rajkhowa’s actions. The court held the omission of sub-article (3) of draft Article 153 was a matter of significance for determining the intent underlying Article 174. The inference that can be drawn is the Constitution’s framers altered their original intent, and decided not to vest discretion with the governor in the matter of summoning and dissolving the House, it court said. “We are satisfied in concluding that the Governor can summon, prorogue and dissolve the House, only on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister as the head. And not at his own.” Rajkhowa’s order of rescheduling the session was held to be in violation of Article 174 and quashed. Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan said if the council of ministers has the confidence of the House, there is no question that the governor is bound by its advice in convening the legislature. The Nabam Rebia judgment, however, also held that if the governor has reasons to believe the council of ministers has lost the confidence of the House, he can ask the chief minister to prove the majority.Also Read: Rajasthan Congress stages demonstrations, protest rallies against ‘autocratic’ BJPIn ordinary circumstances, during the period when the council of ministers enjoys the confidence of the majority of the House, the power vested with the governor under Article 174 to summon or dissolve the House must be exercised in consonance with its aid and advice. “But where the Government in power on the holding of such floor test is seen to have lost the confidence of the majority, it would be open to the Governor to exercise the powers vested with him under Article 174 at his own, and without any aid and advice,” the court said in the Nabam Rebia case.But even there, the governor’s power is only to call for a floor test to determine the majority -- which would suit Gehlot and his supporters just fine because their urgency in calling for an assembly session is to get a floor test conducted immediately. Going by these, Mishra can insist on constitutional provisions and established protocol be followed, and also insist on adequate safeguards given the pandemic, but eventually, according to the law, he has to summon the assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raj-crisis-puts-governors-powers-in-the-spotlight/story-bBCTpwzT008KlgZ7W8slsK.html
26-07-2020||India||Franco Mulakkal moves top court seeking discharge in rape case||Former Jalandhar bishop Franco Mulakkal moved the Supreme Court earlier this week seeking discharge in a case in which he stands accused of raping a nun two weeks after the Kerala high court quashed a similar plea. Mulakkal is accused of raping a nun, who was a member of the Missionaries of Jesus congregation, on at least 13 occasions between 2014 and 2016 when he visited Kerala.Mulakkal, whose plea was quashed by a trial court in March, claimed that he was falsely implicated after he initiated disciplinary proceedings against the nun on account of alleged financial misdealings. The high court dismissed the plea on July 7 observing that the antecedents of victim do not make out any case to doubt the prosecution story.“Rape is the most revolting, cruel and hated crime to a woman… Thus when the records indicate that prima facie materials are available to show that the Sister was subjected to sexual assault including rape from the hands of the superior authority who is the Bishop of the Diocese, it is not possible to infer that this Bishop was falsely implicated by the Mother Superior of the Home functioning under him, on mere enmity as contended by him,”it said. The survivor lodged a complaint in June 2018, and in September, a group of nuns held a sit-in demanding Mulakkal’s arrest. A chargesheet was filed against him in April 2019. “Due to the disciplinary proceedings initiated by the petitioner (Mulakkal) against the sister, she has maliciously and falsely implicated him...,” Mulakkal had told the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/franco-mulakkal-moves-top-court-seeking-discharge-in-rape-case/story-fzO3MRcyaLzxYQsr7xB5MJ.html
26-07-2020||India||Top court to take up Rajasthan speaker’s plea tomorrow||The Supreme Court will on Monday resume hearing Rajasthan speaker CP Joshi’s plea related to whether or not courts can interfere with disqualification proceedings initiated by an assembly speaker against lawmakers even before a decision has been taken.A justice Arun Mishra-led three-judge bench last heard the matter on July 23 when it said the issue will require a prolonged hearing since the “question involved is of the very democracy itself”. Joshi moved the apex court on July 22 challenging the Rajasthan high court’s July 21 order that directed him to defer proceedings on disqualification notices issued to 19 rebel Congress lawmakers, including former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot.The high court was scheduled to pronounce its verdict on the challenge to Joshi’s notices of July 14 when the speaker moved the top court. It ordered a status quo on the matter on July 24. The ruling meant Joshi cannot decide on disqualifying the rebels.Joshi, through his counsel Kapil Sibal, submitted before the Supreme Court on July 23 that courts cannot interfere with the disqualification proceedings until the speaker makes a decision. It is settled by the judgment of this court in the Kihoto Hollohan case of 1992, Sibal argued. In the case, a five-judge Constitution bench held judicial review should not cover any stage prior to the making of a decision by the speaker/chairman. No interference would be permissible at an interlocutory stage, the Kihoto Hollohan judgment said.Joshi, therefore, sought a stay on the proceedings before the high court. “We are trying to find out whether the procedure adopted [by speaker] is correct or not. Can the voice of dissent be shut down like this in a democracy?” Justice Mishra said. The SC declined to stay high court proceedings. Consequently, Joshi’s plea before the Supreme Court seeking a stay on high court proceedings was rendered infructuous since it passed an order on July 24. Admitting Pilot’s plea, the high court asked Joshi to defer action on the notices served until it decides the case. The Supreme Court will hear the larger issue concerning whether courts can interfere with a speaker’s exercise of disqualification powers. “We will hear only on the question of jurisdiction of court to interfere with the speaker’s proceedings. We will not go into whether speaker acted mala fide or bona fide. We cannot go into that,” justice Mishra remarked during the July 23 hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-court-to-take-up-raj-speaker-s-plea-tomorrow/story-Bq5nCtbRaVUj2dZKnHCqeN.html

Meanwhile, the Indian Air Force (IAF) choppers on Saturday carried out relief operations in three of Bihar’s worst affected districts—Darbhanga, Gopalganj and East Champaran. Besides the three major districts like Gopalganj, East Champaran and Darbhanga, Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Supaul, Kishanganj, Muzaffarpur, West Champaran and Khagaria are also facing the devastation due to floods of various scales, officials said.The Bihar Disaster Management Department Authority (BDMDA) principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit on Saturday said that around 10 lakh people have been affected due to the floods in the state and the Darbhanga district is the worst affected. He added that there has been a slight reduction in the water levels across the state and around one lakh people have been evacuated.Deputy chief minister Sushil Modi said that each flood-affected person would be given Rs 6,000 each as relief from the government. “Compensation for loss of standing crops would be announced after the assessment. Farmers would be provided seeds for alternative crops to offset the losses,” said Modi.Over half a dozen monuments, heritage sites and ancient temples, located in flood affected districts in northern part of the state, have been inundated by flood water. The Ashokan pillar at Lauria in West Champaran, the Buddhist stupa at Kesaria in East Champaran and the remains of the fortification of ancient ruler Raja Bali at Balirajgarh in Madhubani district have been inundated, officials said. HS Naik, superintending archaeologist of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Patna circle, said the ASI has taken the matter seriously. “Soon after the flood water recedes from Champaran and Kesaria stupa site, we will send our engineer to assess the damage and also to draft the strategies to keep the monuments and sites safe,” he said. Meteorologist Ravindra Kumar said, “Bihar is likely to receive heavy rains after July 26. Widespread rain with greater intensity is likely to hit entire Bihar on July 27 and 28. A yellow category warning for heavy to very heavy rain coupled with thunderstorm and lightning has been issued for North Bihar and several parts of south-western districts.”Separately, an Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopter on Saturday airlifted essential commodities for the people of two remote villages in North Sikkim, which are cut off from other parts of the state due to landslides, an official release said.The MI-17 helicopter carried out three sorties and dropped essential supplies comprising 100 bags of rice weighing 50 quintals each, 550 litres of cooking oil, 1.5 quintals of salt, 100 packets of candles and matches and medicines among others for the people of Sakyong and Pentong villages of North Sikkim, the release said.The two villages are cut-off from the nearest town Dzongu since July 10 last as multiple landslides had washed off roads and bridges connecting these villages due to incessant rainfall.(with inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/floods-ravage-bihar-assam-rain-causes-landslips-in-sikkim/story-NqPE3oFPOwYlsVJqXpq3TI.html

26-07-2020||India||Kashmiri student held under UAPA||The Jammu & Kashmir police have arrested a 26-year-old post-graduate Kashmir University (KU) student in a 2018 case filed under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), two officers said on Saturday.It was not immediately clear why was UAPA slapped on Aqib Ahmad Malik even as his family said they suspect the case related to a protest he had held on the campus in 2018 against poor food quality served in hostels.Malik, who had been home in the Shopian district since the university’s closure because of the Covid-19 pandemic, was summoned on Friday to Srinagar’s Nigeen police station near the university and arrested immediately.“We have arrested him in a 2018 case under UAPA,” said station house officer Gowhar Ahmad. He refused to provide more details of the case.Officials aware of the matter said Malik has been booked under UAPA’s section 13, which deals with “a person who advocates, abets, advises or incites the commission of, any unlawful activity”.Police superintendent Sudhanshu Verma said they arrested Malik after collecting evidence in the case. “Without evidence, we could not have arrested him. Besides due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it [arrest] took some time. That is why he was arrested now,” said Verma. He did not also provide further details.Malik’s family cited the protest and added they suspect he has been arrested because of it. “He was home for three months and was called to reach the police station where he was arrested. He had protested against the bad quality of food in 2018,” said Faizan Mushtaq, Maik’s brother. “He had raised a voice against corruption in the varsity and that is why things went bad against him.”Nisar Ahmad Mir, the Kashmir University registrar, said they have nothing to do with the case. “The university has been closed because of Covid-19 and no classes are going on. He is our student and has appeared in a recent exam. It is a 2018 case in Nigeen police station and we have not filed any case against him. Issues in hostels are a part of the University life,” said Mir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmiri-student-held-under-uapa/story-n7my20d4xgjLteHskd8v9N.html
26-07-2020||India||Ayodhya will be lit up to mark construction of temple: UP CM Yogi||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said the ceremony to mark the start of construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya on August 5 has come after a wait of 500 years and will be celebrated on the lines of Deepawali. He said temples and houses across the country will be lit up with diyas (earthen lamps) and candles to mark the occasion — much like Deepawali which, in some parts of the country, is celebrated to mark Lord Ram’s return home to Ayodhya after a 14-year exile.Adityanath, who was in Ayodhya to review preparations for the ceremony, said the Hindu community has been waiting for a long time for the event on August 5 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to lay the temple’s foundation stone.He added that 11,000 diyas will be lit at Ram Ki Paidi on the banks of the Saryu river in Ayodhya. “The Prime Minister will visit Ayodhya. We will make Ayodhya the pride of India and the world. Cleanliness should be the first condition,” news agency ANI quoted Adityanath as saying. “We all will be coming together for an auspicious event. There will be deepotsava (festival of lights) in all houses and temples on the nights of August 4 and 5. Deepawali is associated with Ayodhya and it cannot even be imagined without Ayodhya.”The Supreme Court paved the way for the temple’s construction last year when it ordered that a temple be built on the disputed Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site in Ayodhya. Adityanath met members of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust, which is overseeing the preparations for the ceremony. He visited Ram Janmabhoomi and paid obeisance to its presiding deity, Ram Lalla, at a makeshift temple.Champat Rai, the trust’s general secretary, briefed Adityanath about the preparations for the ceremony and the carved stone slabs being prepared for the temple. Carving of pillars and stones for the temple has been going on for years and the work is likely to gather pace in the run-up to August 5. The pre-construction activity for the temple began on May 11. Around 200 people are likely to be invited to the event. The CM requested the saints to attend the ceremony only after they get invites from the trust and urged them against bringing any additional persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayodhya-will-be-lit-up-to-mark-construction-of-temple-yogi/story-3nWP3v436YrUku4OaSUR9H.html
26-07-2020||India||New foreign students can’t enter US for online courses||Newly enrolled international students, including from India, will be denied entry into the US for starting their studies if their courses will be taught fully online in the fall semester, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement said.The move, announced late on Friday, came days after the US on July 14 withdrew a rule that required international students, including hundreds of thousands of Indians, to leave the country if their institutes held classes entirely online in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has prompted social distancing measures and severely affected international travel.“Non-immigrant students in new or initial status after March 9 will not be able to enter the US to enrol in a US school as a non-immigrant student for the fall term to pursue a full course of study that is 100 percent online,” said the ICE statement. It directed universities against issuing Form 1-20s, required to apply for student visas, to newly enrolled students if their classes were to be online only.March 9, the cut-off date, is when ICE issued guidelines allowing foreign students to continue to stay in the country and pursue their classes online, wholly, as required by the universities. It made an exception in view of the Covid-19 pandemic to a rule under which foreigners are not issued student visas for online-only classes.Ishmeet Bagga, co-director at Mindscan education, which offers overseas education consultancy and career counseling, said: “A lot of undergraduate students do not mind the online programme since they have a four-year course. So even if they end up taking six months of online lessons, they know that they can study in the US for the next three-and-a-half years. Postgraduate students, on the other hand, are rethinking their decision.”Sangram Mukherjee, a Mumbai resident who planned to begin his postgraduate degree in the US this year and secured a scholarship, said he was selected in two universities. “However, only one of them offered a three-fourth reduction in tuition fee for online classes and that was a factor in choosing the university...while it has given the choice to students to opt for online or offline classes, I have chosen to defer my admissions till January due to the uncertainty arising out of the Covid-19 situation.”A 26-year-old anthropology doctoral candidate enrolled at the City University of New York said the decision was disappointing, but not worrying. “The courses will be held online for all students...,” the doctoral candidate said. “But it’s disappointing since I was excited to move to New York.” “Moreover, if I had fallen sick in the US, health care would have cost a significant amount. We are hoping the situation normalises by January and then we can join our universities,” said a Production Masters students who still is deciding between a university in California and New York. The number of foreign students impacted by the new order could not be immediately ascertained. There were nearly 270,000 new foreign students enrolled in graduate, undergraduate and non-degree courses for the academic session starting 2019 fall, according to Open Doors, a standard resource on international students. The US admits an estimated one million international students annually and they generate around $41 billion worth of economic activity and support 450,000 jobs, according to the American Council on Education, which represents US colleges and universities. Incomes generated from foreign students are critical to the financial health of many US colleges. According to the Student and Exchange Visitor Programme, 194,556 Indian students were enrolled at various academic institutions in the US in January. India is the second-largest source of foreign students .Universities are being extra vigilant as the US is facing a second surge in Covid-19 cases and fatalities. Harvard University, for instance, has declared its fall classes will be all online.Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology filed a lawsuit challenging the earlier plan announced on July 6 that sought to strip foreign students of their visas if they did not attend at least some classes in person. Over 200 universities later backed the lawsuit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-foreign-students-can-t-enter-us-for-online-courses/story-F6uwTxB2R7lAkfrmytutrO.html

26-07-2020||India||Covid impact: 20% people in Odisha and 45% in UP see a grim financial future, says study||At least 20 percent of Odisha households do not envisage any change in their financial situation in the near future while 45 percent in Uttar Pradesh expect the situation to deteriorate even further. As many as 53 percent of the households in Odisha feel that restoration of jobs and incomes would take up to six months while 33 percent in UP feel the same. While 81 percent of the households in Odisha were concerned about the well-being of their neighbours during the lockdown, it was 41 percent in Uttar Pradesh.These are the initial findings of a telephonic survey conducted by New Delhi-based policy thinktank, National Council of Applied Economic Research, in collaboration with the Nossal Institute for Public Health at the University of Melbourne on the “Impact of Coronavirus on Households in Odisha and Uttar Pradesh” last month. The survey among 2,068 households across four districts of Odisha and UP was done by NCAER to gain insights into the impact of the pandemic on incomes, jobs, migration, availability of essential items, and existing health conditions in these two states. The four districts of Uttar Pradesh and Odisha (Bargarh and Dhenkanal in Odisha and Chandauli and Firozabad in UP) were chosen earlier as part of a larger NCAER-Nossal study on “Health Seeking Behaviour in Four Indian States” where respiratory illnesses are high.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe telephonic survey, done between June 9 and 18 soon after the national lockdown was lifted, found that 95 percent of the households in these two states supported the lockdown imposed by the government and 92 percent expressed confidence in the government’s ability to deal with the Covid-19 crisis. The proportion of households reposing faith in the Government was higher in Odisha (97 percent) as compared to UP (88 percent).Principal investigator of the survey, PK Ghosh said a comparison was made of the occupation structure with respect to the major source of income for the households surveyed between the two periods, i.e., before the lockdown and during the lockdown. “No major variations in occupation structure were observed between Odisha and UP before the lockdown. However, during the lockdown, UP witnessed a severe impact for households relying on casual labour or non-agricultural self-employment as their main source of income, whereas in Odisha, the impact was felt primarily by households whose members were engaged in casual labour. About 30 percent and 27 percent of the households in UP and Odisha, respectively, had no income during the lockdown,” he said.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The survey found that the pandemic caused many households to shift occupations for sustaining their livelihoods. About 40 percent of the households in these two states witnessed a disruption in incomes earned from their main occupations. While 11 percent of the households had to change their occupations, 29 percent of the households lost all income sources during the lockdown. The highest degree of shift in occupations (18.1 percent) and also loss of incomes (46.5 percent) occurred among casual labourers.The survey revealed that a large majority of households- 77 percent in UP and 81 percent in Odisha - reported some reduction in income. In UP, a higher proportion of urban households (88 percent) reported income reduction than rural households (73 percent), but there was no significant difference in income loss between urban and rural households in Odisha. Again, households engaged in casual work (over 90 percent) and those self-employed in non-agricultural work (80 percent) suffered the maximum loss in incomes, with Odisha recording higher figures than UP. In both States, salaried and agricultural workers were relatively less affected by the pandemic. Farmers reported loss in incomes, probably because of the reduced demand for farm goods from bulk consumers like hotels and restaurants that had shut down.To cope with the loss of income, 59.3 percent of the households in Odisha had to fall back on savings or sale of assets while it was 52 percent in UP. In UP, as many as 65 percent households also resorted to borrowing money to meet expenses. After the lockdown was lifted 75 percent of the households in Odisha, that had completely lost all income during the lockdown, returned to work while it was 46 percent in UP.The possibility of again finding a livelihood was reported higher in Odisha than UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-impact-36-people-in-odisha-and-45-in-up-see-a-grim-financial-future-says-study/story-lBe9mBeAEH0gaFVoqjX6gK.html
26-07-2020||Editorials||Washington takes on Beijing | HT Editorial||The United States (US) and China are the world’s two superpowers and they can barely stand each other. Senior US officials have given four speeches explaining why their government feels it is no longer possible to do business-as-usual with China. The US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, gave the last one, adding a call for other democracies to recognise the nature of the threat, and suggesting that perhaps an “alliance of democracies” was the need of the hour, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. Earlier, the US’ national security adviser, attorney general and head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation gave expositions on elements of Beijing’s “designs for hegemony”. The statements portrayed present-day China as a powerful entity, controlled by a malevolent leader, Xi Jinping, and a communist party, whose ideology of control and repression was being offered as a template for governance. China, they argued, seeks to extend its technology-enhanced thought control beyond its own borders. Mr Pompeo pointed to Beijing’s overseas behaviour — treating treaties as “suggestions,” violating every possible economic norm, disrespecting territorial norms — as predatory and unprecedented. Friction between a rising power and a status quo power is basic international relations theory. The US argument is that China has become a major global player by working within an international order of which it is a primary beneficiary. Instead of seeking to embrace this order, Mr Xi has taken China down a darker path in which his own people have been the first victims and the rest of the world could be next. Mr Pompeo admits containment is no longer possible, but if “like-minded nations” push back concertedly, China can still be kept at bay. This will be music to New Delhi’s ears. Few governments have consistently had as unblinkered a view of China as New Delhi. Mr Pompeo now calls for others to practise this, but India has long insisted on reciprocity and transparency from China. In the past, India preferred not to raise its concerns in the international arena because its views of the Middle Kingdom were seen as petulance, including by Washington. But New Delhi should still wait to see if these speeches represent a new US consensus. Strikingly, the new “Trump doctrine” was laid out by everyone except the president. And the other candidate for the Oval Office, while agreeing China is a competitor, believes he can still do business with it. The US policy remains a work-in-progress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/washington-takes-on-beijing/story-FWmhhpTk10KjMWqszTxGaO.html
