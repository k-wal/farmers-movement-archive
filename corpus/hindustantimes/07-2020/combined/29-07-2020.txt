29-07-2020||News||India’s farm sector needs help to get back on its feet. Here are 5 ideas | Opinion||The agriculture sector is critical for India from a consistent growth and food security perspective as the sector and allied activities account for approximately 55% of India’s workforce and nearly 15% of India’s GDP. Today, India has come a long way from facing severe food shortages after Independence to becoming a net exporter of food. While the agricultural sector has made considerable progress, in India, we still have a long way to go when it comes to global benchmarks. The nation-wide lockdown due to the Covid-19 outbreak has further exposed the vulnerabilities in our agricultural supply chain and the prevalence of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee, or APMC, model that made farmers highly dependent on mandis. Never waste a good crisisIn many ways, a crisis like Covid-19 presents a good opportunity to re-examine underlying assumptions in the way we operate and take a fresh look at the art of the possible. To its credit, the government has been swift in announcing the Covid-19 stimulus package worth Rs 1.63 lakh crore aimed at boosting credit availability for farmers and improving supply chain infrastructure for agriculture and allied industries. The government also announced key reforms related to the deregulation of commodities in the Essential Commodities Act, promoting barrier-free inter-state trade of agricultural produce and legal framework for contract farming. Here are five recommendations that could help propel Indian agriculture on to a high performing trajectory.From fragmentation of production to planned productionIndian agriculture needs to move from the current fragmented production model, where each farmer produces what he thinks is right, to a planned production at a district level. This leads to a mismatch in supply-demand and price fluctuations. For instance, domestic onion prices rose by almost 700-800% between January 2019 and December 2019 (Delhi’s Azadpur Mandi). The government should focus on developing a robust sales and operation planning process to estimate the cultivated area under different crops and educate farmers on cropping patterns. This will not only stabilise price fluctuations but also improve farmer income and reduce waste.Soil health card-based nutrition enhancement programmeRampant use of urea, partly caused by Nutrient Based Subsidy, has led to worsening soil health, decline in crop response ratio and contamination of surface water. The NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium) usage ratio has widened from 4.7:2.3:1 in 2010-11 to 6.6:2.6:1 in 2018-19. Further, the crop response ratio to fertilisers has fallen from 12.1 kg grains/kg of fertiliser during 1960-69 to 5 kg grains/kg fertiliser during 2010-17. To address this, a Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme was launched by the government to recommend dosage of different nutrients based on soil health. However, the implementation has suffered due to poor infrastructure support and continued push on urea subsidy.Digital push to improve farming practicesDigital adoption will be key to improving the reach and delivery of services like agronomy advice (fertiliser, ag-chem usage, farming practices), enhance adoption of Precision Agriculture practices and improve price transparency through digital platforms.Informal credit dependence to institutional financial products supportWith farmer incomes highly dependent on external factors such as climate change and commodity price fluctuations, it is important to have robust risk management and financial solutions for the farmers. The availability of credit through Kisan Credit Card (KCC) and associated crop insurance is one such instrument. The government needs to strengthen the implementation through policy and infrastructural improvements such as digitisation of land records which will improve the timely disbursement of KCC loans by banks. Additionally, the development of the agricultural commodities futures market will help to ensure that farmers’ sowing, selling decisions are based on forward-looking prices vs. past prices today. Farmer participation can be encouraged through FPOs to procure, aggregate and ensure that quality standards required for futures trade are met.Go for end-to-end integrated supply chain for finished products The development of a robust supply chain infrastructure is critical to reduce high post-harvest losses estimated at between 10 and 18% in India. With many intermediaries, processors lose control over the quality of produce as well as traceability. By encouraging private sector investment in processing, exports, and retailing of agriculture produce, we can bring local communities together to achieve economies of scale, encourage standard practices to meet quality specifications for exports including niche products like organic produce.India’s production levels of agriculture and allied segments along with current productivity, infrastructure and processing rates, represent huge untapped opportunities for all players of the agriculture value chain. Backed by progressive policies, fiscal incentives and an effective regulatory environment, the Indian agricultural sector can provide a strong thrust to the economic growth momentum of the nation. These favourable shifts in the agriculture industry will also lead to a substantial increase in farmer incomes in the country, and safeguard food security for the country’s growing population.(Harsha Razdan is Partner and Head, Consumer Markets and Internet Business, KPMG in India and Manuj Ohri is Partner, KPMG in India)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-s-farm-sector-needs-help-to-get-back-on-its-feet-here-are-5-ideas-opinion/story-VLC2slyLC8k3tNaBWbqWwI.html
29-07-2020||News||Militarising Andamans: The costs and the benefits | Analysis||The Ladakh stand-off with China has catalysed India’s efforts to strengthen its military presence at the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (ANI). New Delhi recently moved to expedite plans for basing additional military forces, including facilities for additional warships, aircraft, missile batteries and infantry soldiers at the strategically-located Andaman Islands. Naval air stations INS Kohassa in Shibpur and INS Baaz in Campbell Bay are reportedly having their runways extended to support operations by large aircraft, even as a 10-year infrastructure development “roll-on” plan — pegged at Rs 5,000 crores — is on the fast-track. Indian strategic commentators are even urging New Delhi to permit friendly foreign navies access to the ANI’s military bases.The idea of militarising the Andaman Islands isn’t new. Since the 1980s, Indian commentators have advocated building strategic muscle at the ANI. What has often seemed like a straightforward choice for Indian policymakers, however, has never been an easy decision to make. On the matter of the strategic development of the Andamans, India’s defence and foreign policy establishments have not always been on the same page. A section of India’s diplomatic community has opposed militarising the ANI, arguing that turning the islands into a strategic-military garrison would militarise the littorals — an outcome that would not sit well with countries in South and Southeast Asia.When India first began developing the ANI in the mid-1980s, observers say Malaysia and Indonesia had been wary. Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur feared that India would use its military facilities in the ANI to dominate its region, and project power east of Malacca. In time, New Delhi’s willingness to keep its security presence at the strategic islands to a minimum assured many in Asia that its motives were benign. Today, amid growing threats from China, New Delhi seems open to the idea of militarising the islands. But, many say opening up the ANI’s military facilities to foreign navies could still spook regional states.There is also an ecological aspect to militarising the ANI. Since 2015, when the government had first announced its intention to transform the islands into a maritime hub — allocating Rs 10,000 crores for the purpose — efforts to promote tourism and port development have hugely expanded. To improve tourism and trade potential, Niti Aayog has a plan to construct hotels, resorts and a trans-shipment hub at Campbell Bay. The flurry of recent infrastructure projects, environmentalists warn, could devastate the fragile ecology of the Andaman. Already many islands are facing significant damage from the climate crisis. The proponents of the Andaman’s militarisation point to a different kind of asymmetry: The apparent lack of reciprocity in India’s bilateral logistics agreements. The Indian navy’s plans to offer logistical support to partner navies does not, ostensibly, include its ANI facilities. Four years after signing a logistics pact with the United States (US), its navy ships still have no access the ANI. France, Singapore and Australia — India’s other logistics partners — too haven’t had their warships repaired or replenished at Indian island facilities. With New Delhi unwilling to open up its island bases to foreign warships, observers say India’s logistics arrangements haven’t performed to potential. To counter China’s expanding footprint in India’s sphere of maritime interest, militarisation advocates aver New Delhi must permit Japan, Australia and France and the US to build strategic capabilities at the ANI.In the past, Indian policymakers have considered cooperative avenues with Indo-Pacific partners. In 2016, New Delhi and Tokyo discussed a joint project to upgrade infrastructure in the ANI, including a proposal to install a sound surveillance sensors (SOSUS) chain to improve India’s underwater domain awareness. The plan was to integrate India’s undersea sensor chain with the existing US-Japan “Fish Hook” SOSUS network meant specifically to monitor People’s Liberation Army-Navy(PLAN) submarine activity in the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean Rim.But, notwithstanding its utility in detecting Chinese submarines, a region-wide undersea chain of sensors has implications that call for a degree of caution. In particular, Delhi needs to consider the possibility that operating sensitive equipment with foreign partners might involve sharing of critical undersea’ data with foreign collaborators. The Japan-US SOSUS provides some useful pointers. While the Japanese Maritime Self -Defence Force (JMSDF) and US Navy personnel jointly manage the JMSDF Oceanographic Observation Centre in Okinawa, the information is available to the US Pacific Command, and the facility is controlled by the US Navy. Needless to say, an Indo-Japanese-US project in the Andaman Sea might require a level of informational access that the Indian Navy may not be comfortable with.While China’s presence in the Indian Ocean is growing, Beijing hasn’t so far militarised key Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) outposts in the Bay of Bengal (Hambantota, Chittagong and Kyaukpyu). In recent weeks, as Indian warships have held exercises with the US and Japanese navy in the Indian Ocean, New Delhi’s resolve to counter China in its maritime backyard has been amply evident. If New Delhi pushes for greater military presence in the ANI, Beijing could well seek military access in friendly Bay countries.This isn’t to suggest that inviting foreign navies to the ANI or joint military projects in the Andaman sea is a bad idea. Strengthening collaboration with Indo-Pacific partners at the ANI is very much an option for Indian decision-makers to consider. But New Delhi must also take into account the downsides of offering foreign navies access to its island facilities. The final decision should be based on a dispassionate weighing of costs and benefits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/militarising-andamans-the-costs-and-the-benefits/story-J3mGWFQS3NgLUiPYwIVb2N.html
29-07-2020||Chandigarh||15 more Tru NAAT machines installed in Punjab||The state government has procured 15 more Tru NAAT machines for testing so that covid-19 patients are detected, tested and isolated early to prevent the spread of the disease. Thirty machines are functional in government hospitals. Health and family welfare minister Balbir Singh Singh Sidhu said guidelines had been issued to all government health facilities in the state for Tru NAAT testing. “Suspected patients among covid-19 warriors like healthcare workers, doctors, police, administrative officials, Pregnant Women, SARI patients, and emergency surgery patients shall be prioritised for Tru NAAT testing in the state,” Sidhu said.He said that the district Amritsar, Mohali and Jalandhar have been allocated two machines each while three machines have been installed in Ludhiana. He said that the other districts have been given one machine each. One machine each has been given to three government medical colleges also.He said the turnaround time for results gets reduced in these machines. For instance, in four channel machines, four tests can be done at a time and four results can be retrieved in a mere one-and-a-half hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/15-more-tru-naat-machines-installed-in-punjab/story-meuIxGGeuIGdjJhWC78J5M.html
29-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s positivity rate shoots up to 9.6% in July as admn ramps up Covid testing||As the number of infections crossed the 500 mark in July with ramped up testing numbers in Chandigarh, the confirmation rate (also known as test positivity rate) has gone up to 7.3%, a surge of 1.3% from the onset of this month. Till June, out of every 100 people being tested, only around five were being confirmed positive, which has now increased to more than seven. It is mainly due to the confirmation rate of July being a record high at 9.6% with two days still to go. This trend is being witnessed amid the UT conducting around 40% of the total tests in just July and 50% of the total cases have also surfaced in the same period.Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of the department of community medicine and school of public health at the PGIMER, says this shows the pandemic is on the upswing. “Test, track, and treat is the only option. World Health Organisation suggests that test positivity rate should be below 5%. Thus, here the strategy should be to increase the testing numbers and surveillance for the symptomatic people. With more samples being tested, more people with the infection will be identified and sent to isolation and it will help in containing the outbreak,” he said.“With increase in testing numbers, more people are testing positive, pushing up the confirmation rate,” said UT health secretary Arun Gupta. “We have a targeted approach towards testing and the numbers are gradually going up. The testing for all non-family contacts was not very much desired earlier, as mostly they were isolated with the provision that they will check for symptoms and report to the department. Now, we have decided to test all contacts.”Dr G Dewan, director of the health and family welfare department, said: “ We have started door-to-door survey on the basis of mapping again. Moreover, we have started taking samples in all government hospitals. All patients reporting to flu clinics are tested and hospitalised if positive. Also, people are less afraid to come forward to get tested now, which has increased the testing numbers.”Dr RS Bedi, former president of Indian Medical Association’s Chandigarh chapter, said testing more number of people, even if they are not from the high-risk category, makes sense and the upward trend should continue. “Testing should be open to all to detect the infection,” he said. Meanwhile, the UT health department is planning to introduce rapid antigen testing to cover asymptomatic cases across government hospitals and further increase the testing numbers. At least 1,000 such testing kits are already being procured by the PGIMER to be used primarily for OPD patients to validate their usefulness.“The order for around 2,000 antigen test kits will be placed and they are expected to come in the first week of August. This will increase the testing numbers, even though the authenticity of the tests is low,” a senior UT health official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-positivity-rate-shoots-up-to-9-6-in-july-as-admn-ramps-up-covid-testing/story-ZxB7gt0cJaepKpFgOxq9GN.html

29-07-2020||City||PPCB, remote sensing centre join hands to curb stubble fires||Chandigarh To check burning of paddy stubble during the kharif harvest expected to begin from October 1, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) and the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre (PRSC) will coordinate to ensure the entire effort gets a common platform. The PRSC, based at Ludhiana, has developed an android-based mobile application to provide end-to-end solution for reporting and action taken for each fire incident captured through satellite. “Now the district administration including deputy commissioner, patwari, SDM, district police, nodal officers, PPCB staff, even officers up to the level chief secretary would also be involved in the monitoring system. In the previous years, synchronicity in operations to stop stubble burning was lacking,” said a PPCB officer. This year, the location of every incident will be visited within two days and environment compensation would be imposed on the farmer. In 2019 kharif, around 51,000 cases were reported. “It was desired by the state government that a mobile and web based application should be developed, in which role based login (village nodal, cluster, sub division/tehsil and district level) was possible,” said Brijendra Pateria, head, PRSC. He added that the ATR will be generated after the field officers visit the burning site. A semi automatic system is already in operation (SMS alert system). PPCB member secretary Krunesh Garg added the ATR information will be generated for each active fire point that the PRSC reported through satellite data analysis, using the mobile application. This information will be used as input to the dashboard for the ATR that PRSC has developed. The Centre, meanwhile, has sanctioned a sum of Rs. 250 crore for the Punjab government under the crop residue management scheme for subsidising the purchase of 23,000 machines for in situ management of paddy. Over the past two years, around 51,000 such machines have been given to farmers at subsidy ranging between 50% and 80%. In a video conference held with officials at the Centre, the Punjab government has asked for Rs 337 crore. “Over 2018 and 2019, we received Rs. 500 crore to get machines. This year too, we will start a process for empaneling companies to manufacture and sell machines for in situ management of paddy stubble,” said Punjab agriculture secretary, Kahan Singh Pannu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ppcb-remote-sensing-centre-join-hands-to-curb-stubble-fires/story-wR7HHCMP66lozZY38HDQdO.html
29-07-2020||City||Noida: President, members’ posts vacant since June 16 at district consumer forum||GREATER NOIDA: Though the daily Cause Lists are being put up online, the district consumer disputes’ redressal forum has not been not functioning as the forum has had no president or members since June 16. The advocates’ association has now demanded early posting of president and members.“I have been given only the Drawing-Disbursing Officer (DDO) powers of the Gautam Budh Nagar district consumer forum. I cannot hear cases. The lone member Nirmala Singh’s term period too expired on June 15. Presently at the district forum, there is no president and no member. Cause Lists were being displayed at the website. Staff then marks next the date for such cases,” said MP Singh, president, Ghaziabad district consumer forum on Wednesday.“At Ghaziabad, too, we are not able to function as member posts are lying vacant. A president and at least one member is a must to conduct hear complaints and issue orders. Normally, the district forum has one president and two members’ posts,” said Singh.“The process of recruitment of presidents and members at various forums in state districts has been initiated. By mid-August, we hope to get the posts at Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad filled,” said Singh.The advocates’ association has appealed to the state government to fill the consumer forum posts so that consumers’ complaints are resolved. “We have requested that the president and members be appointed immediately as consumers are suffering,” Rajinder Dhar, president, district consumer forum advocates’ association said on Wednesday.“The association has requested complainants and advocates not to visit the forum just to see their case in the Cause List. Forum staff automatically gives another date in the case file,” said Dhar.A total of 16 cases were listed for Wednesday. Gunjan Sharma, an advocate, said, “I had to come here for some other district court’s cases so it is not a problem for me to visit the forum. The next dates are being given without any signature or presence of complainant or respondent representative. Today, a few complainants came to the forum as they were not aware that the forum was non-functional.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-president-members-posts-vacant-since-june-16-at-district-consumer-forum/story-6wy05NtP053OnUautafRKM.html
29-07-2020||Chandigarh||Schools cry foul after Punjab School Education Board orders them to pay for its DTH lectures||Patiala The Punjab education department has ordered all 10,000-odd private schools, affiliated to the Punjab School Education Board (PSEB), to pay a one-time yearly ‘contributing amount’ to fund broadcast of online lectures that the state board prepares on Direct-to-Home (DTH) format on Doordarshan channel. The amount demanded from schools goes up to Rs 8,400 depending upon the level of education offered. Puneet Sehgal, programme head Doordarshan, said, “The education department is broadcasting lectures from 9am to 4pm. We charge Rs 2,800 for 30 minutes. As they are our major customers we give them one hour for free.” The order, in the regard, issued on Tuesday, reads, “Punjab is struggling with economic and social crisis due to covid-19 pandemic.The study of children is being affected due to closure of schools. Therefore, lectures related to syllabus of all classes of the PSEB will be broadcast by education department. So, the decision of taking contribution money in one go from these schools was taken in a meeting held on May 15 by board.”According to the order, senior secondary schools will have to deposit Rs 8,400; high schools Rs 6,000; middle schools; Rs 2400 and primary schools Rs 1,200. The money has to be deposited in one go. Last week, the government announced that government schools in the state will not charge any admission, re-admission and tuition fee from students for the 2020-21 academic session due to the covid-19 crisis. Punjab director general school education, Mohammad Tayyab, who is also the PSEB secretary, said, “The syllabus of affiliated schools is the same as government schools. We have, therefore, extended the service for them too. It’s just a minimal amount.” Jatinder Singh Narula, president, Affiliated Schools Welfare Association, Patiala, said, “We never asked the Punjab government to broadcast lectures on a DTH channel. State government has announced that it will not collect any fee from government school students. Now, to meet their expenses, they are forcing us to pay.”Ravinder Singh Mann, president, Recognised and Affiliated Schools Association, Punjab, said, “We are not ready to pay. We will try to reason with the government first. If this fails, we will move court. The government cannot take such major decisions without our participation.” Hardeep Todarpur, teacher, Government Senior Secondary School, Kakrala, said, “Practically it’s not possible to provide education to students via broadcasting lecture on DTH. The majority just stays away, only the few intelligent ones attend this lecture.”Patiala DEO Harinder Kaur said, “We are broadcasting lectures on DTH. Every student can avail this service whether he is studying in private or government schools.”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/schools-cry-foul-after-punjab-school-education-board-orders-them-to-pay-for-its-dth-lectures/story-egZgb8BCPtwyDPOMMLBaZJ.html

The high court bench of chief justice RS Jha said that the petition is disposed of in view of state’s undertaking that action will be taken within two weeks. The petitioner, a Jalandhar resident, had alleged that Members of Parliament (MPs), MLAs, mayors and other VIPs are using modified private gypsies which resemble to the government police gypsies by pasting stickers of Punjab police. It is being done to show off their high status in the society by going against the law and without any permission from the competent authority, the court was told adding that many of them are having more number of security personnel than sanctioned, and that these personnel were being used for their family members as well. It had demanded action against the owners of such gypsies, which have been modified as a government pilot gypsy fitted with a red blue beacon and siren. The petition had also alleged that many of them had black films on mirrors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/modified-gypsies-act-against-legislators-in-2-weeks-hc-to-punjab/story-awARy3zz5R7JZ4ObqfBmXP.html
29-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn faltered on demarcating Bapu Dham containment, buffer zone: WHO report||While appreciating the initiatives taken by the UT administration in the Bapu Dham Colony containment zones, the WHO, in a report submitted with administration also highlighted the lapses related to demarcation of containment zones, sampling, data analysis and screening.WHO consultant Dr Srinivasan Selvamani presented the Bapu Dham epidemiological study to Punjab governor and UT administrator VPS Badnore on Wednesday.WHERE UT LAPSEDThe report states, “Demarcation of containment and buffer zones in Bapu Dham Colony was not done as per the guidelines of Government of India hence there was no delineation of activities conducted in these zones.”Daily screening of population (part or complete) was not conducted to detect positive cases and no provision for on-site sampling was made by the UT administration, the report stated.The report also said there was no data analysis for action and feedback. “The administration did not carry out stratification of data of the positive cases and contacts for better understanding of the chain of transmission and guiding decision,” the report pointed out.WHERE UT GAINEDThe report appreciated the timely action of the administration in containing the spread of infection in the colony. The administration’s efforts for aggressive contact tracing and quarantine of contacts were cited as the best practice, which could be imitated by other states and UTs.The administration’s imposition of strict perimeter control, setting up of Rapid Response Teams and involvement of Civil Defence as a part of containment strategy was highlighted as ‘good work’.The report also appreciated the setting up a local dispensary and intensive sanitisation operation done by the municipal corporation.The report praised deputy commissioner Mandip Singh Brar for involving volunteers for counselling and motivating people. They acted as a link between the community and the administration, the report stated.The report appreciated the administration in ensuring regular supply of essential commodities, including milk and vegetables at doorsteps. “Another innovation was availability of mobile ATM vans and supply of medicines through Rogi Kalayan Samiti,” the report stated.RECOMMENDATIONSThe WHO representative advised, “As pockets of Bapu Dham continue to open and the threat of reemergence continues globally, nationally and in Chandigarh, surveillance will play an important role in identifying the early re-emergence of cases in the community. “Since active house-to-house screening is not a feasible option, there is a need to strengthen passive surveillance and reporting,” the report suggested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-faltered-on-demarcating-bapu-dham-containment-buffer-zone-who-report/story-XESGFSKriJWBPUealV8TVO.html
29-07-2020||City||Allottees to complete Jaypee’s Kalypso Court project in Greater Noida||The Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority (UP-Rera) has formed a committee to monitor Kalypso Court, a high-rise in Noida sector 128 that was formally handed over to its residents’ association for completion on WednesdayHT had reported on Monday that the association was offered the task last week by the UP-Rera in exercise of its powers under the UP-Rera Act. Jaiprakash Associate Limited (JAL) had launched the project in 2007 and was to deliver 1,140 residential unit by 2018, which it failed to do, forcing the homebuyers to approach the authority last year. Although the UP-Rera had made such an offer to associations of other projects too, this was the first time that an association had accepted.“Other developers refrained from investing in the project. The apartment owners’ association (AOA) too faced difficulty in hiring suitable developers. Now, we have involved the promoter and allottees to complete the project. If this experiment succeeds, the formula will be replicated in other such projects too,” said Balvinder Kumar, a member of the UP-Rera and now also the chairperson of the committee monitoring the Kalypso Court project.UP-Rera chairperson Rajive Kumar said, “Our aim is for completion of projects. Conciliation consultant RD Paliwal got the final proposal acceptable to allottees and promoter.”Kalypso Court is a multi-tower group housing project and comprises 15 towers, out of which 11 were handed over to allottees. The remaining towers are incomplete and have 304 units. Progressive Welfare Society, the association, has 152 members with units in the incomplete towers.The association said it had agreed to take up the project with JAL as contractor. Jayesh Patel, its president, had said they hoped to complete it within 12 months.The monitoring committee under Kumar will have the authority’s finance controller, technical advisor and a consultant from the project management division as members. The Noida Authority CEO, an auditor appointed by UP-Rera, the financial institution concerned and AOA members will also be part of the committee.The UP-Rera will review the progress of the project on a quarterly basis. The Authority will shift the project to the special category of projects, as per the provisions of section 8 of Rera Act. JAL will continue to update the details of the project, including the quarterly progress report.Funding UP-Rera secretary Abrar Ahmed said, “As per the promoter (JAL), the sum of remaining receivables from the sold units to the allottees of these towers is ₹90.09 crore and expected receivables from 19 unsold units is about ₹25.06 crore.

29-07-2020||City||Woman tries to set herself on fire outside Ghaziabad SSP’s office over land dispute||A 35-year-old woman from Loni allegedly tried to self-immolate outside the office of the district’s senior superintendent of police alleging inaction on part of the police in a land dispute case she had filed. Officers foiled the and also booked her under provisions of the CrPC, the police said. Bail was granted to her by an executive magistrate later.The woman, Shahna Parveen, is a resident of Jafrabad in Delhi and has a land dispute with two locals – Ali Jaan and Mohammad Haneef – who are residents of Loni. According to the police, the plot in question is in Loni’s Ashok Vihar of about 250 square metres while about 50 square metres of it is presently vacant. The two men are stated to be taking up some construction at the site to which the woman objected.“The woman says that she is the owner of the plot while the opposite party also claims ownership. Around 11am on Wednesday, she was spotted by police personnel on duty outside the SSP’s office with a can of inflammable substance. She was immediately nabbed and prevented from taking any drastic step. She was taken to the women’s police station where she was booked under Section 151 (preventive arrest) of Code of Criminal Procedure but later granted bail,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural). The police said the woman was not able to produce any document in support of her claim over the piece of land. “There was some altercation on July 14 after which the police booked the two men, Ali Jaan and Mohammad Haneef, under CrPC 151. After the self-immolation attempt on Wednesday, the woman was asked to go and meet the sub-divisional magistrate of Loni and the area’s circle officer was also asked to take up her complaint. However, she was not able to produce any documentary evidence to support her claim,” Jadaun added. The officials said that the SDM in his directions on Wednesday evening to the local police directed that both parties will approach the court for resolution of the matter as it is civil in nature. The SDM also directed the local police to maintain status quo at the site and not allow any construction activity, Jadaun added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/woman-tries-to-set-herself-on-fire-outside-ghaziabad-ssp-s-office-over-land-dispute/story-kXlnSqJ793C297HYHOXJUL.html

29-07-2020||City||Antigen kits help Ghaziabad to increase virus testing by five times||A month after Ghaziabad began deploying antigen testing kits, the district has increased testing by almost five times and reduced the positivity rate. Starting June 26, the district began using the kits at hot spots and containment zones and in time took it to other areas of the city, targeting high risk groups. Of all testing methods, 57.5% of samples were tested for antigens till July 28.According to the health department data till July 28, the district took 94208 samples for testing, out of which 92716 tested and reported --- 53,320 (57.5) were under antigen testing, 37,662 (40.6%) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and 1734 (1.9%) TrueNat tests. Prior to deploying antigen testing kits, the district relied only on RT-PCR tests. At the time, its positivity rate was about 6.94% out of the 16,810 samples tested. On July 28, this number read 5.07%. Antigen tests are inherently unreliable with very poor sensitivity, which means its ability to detect true positives is low and could result in many negative tests turning positive under an RT-PCR test. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) requires those testing negative and showing symptoms later to go for an RT-PCR test for confirmation.Despite this, its share is high because of two advantages: point of care testing and no need of taking it to a laboratory, and that it gives a result within 30 minutes, as compared to the two days it would take an RT-PCR test.“With more rapid kits now available we are testing more through it to find positive patients. Now, we have received a target of conducting 2000 rapid antigen tests and about 350 though RT-PCR per day,” said an officer from the health department who wished not to be named. According to the official records, positivity through the rapid kits is about 1.41% with 53320 tests resulting in 1316 positive cases till July 28. On the other hand, the positivity through RT-PCR is about 3.65% with 3392 positive cases resulting out of 39396 RT-PCR tests conducted since March. The experts said that positivity difference between the two tests is acceptable considering the advantages that antigen testing gives.“The RT-PCR is time consuming and we require trained staff. The antigen test’s positive result is true positive,” said Dr Ashutosh Rawat, microbiologist from Columbia Asia Hospital, Ghaziabad. “Sample collection techniques also affect the results. If the sample is not picked up properly it may turn negative in both the type of tests. Further, the asymptomatic patients who do not turn positive with rapid kits are not at risk. So we have to accept the rapid test with genuine difference in comparison to RT-PCR test. My opinion is that a difference of 1% to 1.5% between the two type of tests then results are acceptable.” In Ghaziabad, of the total samples tested using antigen tests, 18,293 tested negative and 16,279 were tested again under RT-PCR method, out of which 920 returned positive -- a positivity rate of 5.65%. The district administration officials on the other hand said that they have planned to conduct about 3000-3500 tests per day. “This will be achieved with majority of testing through rapid kits now available with us. The idea is to trace more positive patients and filter them out from the local population. So, this will help us in early detection and in faster treatment of such patients. The RT-PCR testing will also go on. Our RT-PCR testing will also get boost once our new laboratory (at MMG Hospital) which is already sanctioned by the government comes up,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/antigen-kits-help-ghaziabad-to-increase-virus-testing-by-five-times/story-lZDlyUMxkwd1k98cFFaPXN.html
29-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Norms released for biomedical waste collection patients in home isolation||As more and more Covid-19 patients opt for home isolation in Ghaziabad, the health department, along with the municipal corporation, has chalked out a plan for storage, collection and disposal of biomedical waste collected from these patients’ homes. According to official records, the administration till Wednesday afternoon granted permission for home isolation to 99 Covid-19 positive patients, while the screening process is on for 11 more patients. Since July 21, the control room teams have dialled 1,137 different patients for home isolation, while 396 persons, living in vicinities of the patients , were designated as ‘friendly watchers’ to update teams about their neighbours and who may also get in touch with the control room in case of any issues.“The municipal corporation will be providing a yellow-coloured bag to each patient who is in home isolation. The patient is required to dispose of their masks, gloves, head cap, tissues, used syringes or medicines, if any, in the bag. A special van from the corporation will visit the home of each patient and collect the yellow bag every Sunday. The staff of the vans will be provided addresses of each patient,” said Dr Mithlesh Kumar, the civic body’s city health officer, adding that each of the five zones in the city has been designated two vans.Meanwhile, biomedical waste of the family members of the patient will be collected by the usual solid waste collection vehicles of the corporation, albeit with some rules. “The family members of the patients are required to cut up the gloves, masks, head cap, etc into two parts and store them in a paper bag for 72 hours. After this, they can dispose of it off by handing over the bag to the normal solid waste collection vehicles which come daily in localities.”Utsav Sharma, regional officer from UP pollution control board said, “The process for disposal of biomedical waste is in accordance with the guidelines. The corporation has tied up with a biomedical waste collection agency which will collect the waste and dispose of it off in a scientific manner. The patient as well as their family members will have to abide by the health protocols.” The state government had allowed home isolation on July 20. Since July 21, there have been 810 new positive cases in the district out of which 99 have been permitted home isolation once they fulfilled conditions. The rate of patients in home isolation has been about 12.22% from July 21 to July 28. “The rate is low at present as there is delay in uploading patient’s data over the portal. If we analyse the data for July 28, the portal showed 83 patients. Out of these, 20 were found to be admitted to hospitals and 11 were discharged. Of the 83 patients, home isolation was allowed for 18 these while nine were those whose mobile phones were not reachable or found switched off,” said an officer from the health department who wished not to be named.“So, there has been some delay in uploading data at the end of the hospitals (private and government) and we are trying to fix it at the earliest. Once the issue is settled, the figures of patients in home isolation will also go up,” the official quoted above said. The conditions to be fulfilled for home isolation include an undertaking from the patient, a consulting doctor to declare the patient asymptomatic, round-the-clock availability of a caregiver for the patient, a minimum of two toilets at home, and a separate isolation room. Patients will also have to purchase medical kits equipped with a pulse oximeter, a thermometer, masks and gloves, among others.“We are trying to approach every patient in order to know if he/she wishes to opt for home isolation or not on the basis of laid down norms. There is some delay in uploading data on the portal and it will be expedited. With home isolation in place, there are only seven active patients lodged at Divya Jyoti Hospital, an L1 category facility. So, we are not closing it down but suspending operations for the time being. However, we have 800 L1 beds ready with us which can be made operational within a day if the need arises,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-norms-released-for-biomedical-waste-collection-patients-in-home-isolation/story-jW08zLGlBlFVMRAWUFAbjN.html

29-07-2020||City||Will protect integrity of Punjab, Sukhbir’s threats no deterrent: CM||Chandigarh A day after Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president cautioned Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh against indiscriminate use of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) by Punjab Police, the CM said he would do everything under the law, as needed, to protect the security and integrity of Punjab and of the nation.“The SAD president’s threats cannot deter me from ensuring the safety of my people. If there are any specific instances of wrongful arrest or registration of case by Punjab Police under UAPA, as Sukhbir claimed, he should send a list of the same, instead of making unnecessary noise,” the CM added. The CM said there was no question of falsely implicating anyone, urging the SAD chief to refrain from playing into the hands of the separatists by trying to incite the state’s youth, especially the Sikhs, against the police force.Amarinder added that the UAPA had been in existence for long and under the SAD-BJP regime, more than 60 cases under UAPA had been registered in Punjab, of which 19 were in 2010 alone and 12 in 2017 and of the 225 individuals arrested in these cases, 120 were acquitted or discharged, indicating that indiscriminate application of UAPA had in fact been done by the Akalis during their tenure.“It is shocking that Sukhbir, who is leading a party that claimed to be the custodians of Sikhism, is in fact protesting against the Punjab Police’s fight against separatist and terrorist activities,” he added. “There are forces bent on destabilising the nation by fomenting trouble and promoting the separatist ideology, such as the Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) and its Khalistani agenda. Sukhbir should know that SFJ has been declared as an unlawful organisation and its chief Gurpatwant Pannu had been designated a terrorist by the Indian government, and, as such, the police force of all states, including Punjab, were duty-bound to take all legal action to fight their attempts to subvert national security,” Amarinder added. At a time when the countries were rejecting the SFJ’s pro-Khalistan agenda, Sukhbir was virtually supporting it, the CM added. AMARINDER REPRODUCING INDIRA’s NARRATIVE: SUKHBIR Chandigarh SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal on Wednesday described CM Captain Amarinder Singh’s reaction on the issue of the misuse the UAPA as “an archival reproduction of the old Indira Gandhi narrative”.“Every Sikh can recall how Indira Gandhi had used exactly these words to justify the rolling of tanks into the holiest of the holy Sikh shrine Harmander Sahib leading to the destruction of the sacred Shri Akal Takht Sahib... the Congress mind-set that led to the 15-year-long tragedy of Punjab remains the same?,” said Sukhbir.Referring to Amarinder’s references to national security and integrity while defending use of UAPA, Badal said, “The brave and patriotic Sikh masses need no lessons in nationalism or patriotism from opportunistic Sikh Congress leaders. The only contribution of Congress leaders has been to paint every single member of this brave and patriotic community as anti-national. Amarinder has started singing the same tune again, and this is extremely dangerous.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-protect-integrity-of-punjab-sukhbir-s-threats-no-deterrent-cm/story-sjJTQous3uKtOy16pn0aOO.html
29-07-2020||Noida||Illegal liquor worth ₹2 crore seized, one arrested||Illegal liquor worth ₹2 crore was confiscated by the excise department from a godown in Noida, officials said on Wednesday. The imported beer was stored illegally without paying taxes or duty at a godown in Kasna. The owner who had the licence to store and sell the foreign liquor, was arrested and an FIR was registered against him. “We had confiscated a total of 1,375 cartons and 33,000 cans of different premium brands of foreign beer worth about ₹2 crore. It was stored illegally at a room near the godown, which was found during a raid on Monday night. The accused had L2 licence under which he can store and sell foreign liquor to anyone in bulk. The liquor was illegal because it was stored without duty and permit papers. We are taking strict action against him and his licence will be suspended,” said district excise officer, RB Singh. According to the officials, the illegal liquor was discovered during an ongoing drive ordered by the district administration. On paper, the accused had shown that he had procured only 240 bottles of foreign liquor in the current year, of which 36 bottles were yet to be sold. However, on inspection, it was discovered that hundreds of cartons of over six major foreign brands of beer were hidden on the roof of the godown and in a room behind it. Singh said the confiscated liquor will not be resold through auction but will be destroyed as per state excise rules. “On each bottle or can of beer, the state earns duty of at least ₹150. The accused has been arrested and an FIR was lodged under relevant sections of the excise act. His licence and security amount of ₹6 lakh will also be forfeited. The foreign liquor is procured through designated custom bonds. We are finding how and from where the accused procured the liquor,” Singh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/illegal-liquor-worth-2-crore-seized-one-arrested/story-iWpzDmbyLI7Itl4qYSyxQL.html
29-07-2020||City||Plasma bank for Covid-19 patients to start on Thursday||Gurugram: Gurugram’s first plasma bank to help the treatment of critical Covid-19 patients will become operational from Thursday at Rotary blood bank, Sector 10. Health officials said necessary arrangements for Covid-19 antibody testing and extraction of plasma have been made at the blood bank, where the coronavirus patients can procure convalescent plasma units for the therapy. Each plasma unit will cost around Rs 8,500, officials said. Dr Anuj Garg, deputy chief medical officer, who has been designated as the nodal officer for the plasma bank from the health department, said convalescent plasma for Covid-19 patients will be issued on a signed request of the authorised nodal officer of the hospital where the patient is undergoing treatment and the medical superintendent of the district health department. Plasma units can be availed of by patients admitted in both government and private hospitals.“The plasma unit will be given to those who require it only after approval from the hospital and health department. Though the price has been fixed at Rs 8,500 per unit, it will be free for BPL card holders and pregnant women,” Garg said. The bank will be open for blood donation from 9am to 9pm, while plasma will be available 24X7, he said. At least five people are expected to donate their blood for plasma therapy on Thursday. “Covid-19 patients, who are already cured, are being motivated to come forward for donation,” Garg said. The administration has been reaching out to recovered patients. As reported by HT earlier this week, a database of more than 4,000 recovered patients has been made, out of which only 50 have come forward to donate plasma.Gurugram’s Covid-19 tally stands at 8912, out of which 1019 are active cases and 7771 have recovered from the illness. The death toll stands at 122, out of which 84 had co-morbidity.In plasma therapy, blood is taken from a Covid-19 recovered person who has developed antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Through centrifugation, the liquid part of the blood called plasma is separated. It contains antibodies, which are transfused in the coronavirus-infected person, boosting the immune system to fight the deadly infection. It is still an experimental therapy approved by the central health ministry. The plasma therapy has previously been used during the SARS and MERS outbreaks (which were also caused by viruses from the same family as the coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19). Dr Mahima Kilhor, medical officer at Rotary blood bank, who is also the nodal in-charge of the plasma bank, said, “The blood bank already has one apheresis machine that separates blood components and plasma. After the plasma is extracted, the blood containing red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets is transfused back to the donor’s body. It takes almost 90 minutes to extract the plasma.”But before the extraction, the blood is tested for Covid-19 antibodies through antibody-detection kits. “Over 100 Covid-19 antibody-detection kits have been provided to the bank,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. Doctors said the concentration of antibodies in the blood plasma has to be checked before it is transfused in a patient. In this process, the blood taken from the recovered patients is diluted repeatedly. The highly diluted samples, which turn to be positive, are the ones with high antibody levels“A certain range of antibody has to be there in the plasma; if it is below that range, then the plasma won’t be beneficial,” said Kilhor. Currently, plasma bank facilities are operational at PGIMS, Rohtak and ESI Hospital in Faridabad. A private hospital is also conducting plasma therapy in Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/plasma-bank-for-covid-19-patients-to-start-on-thursday/story-UhYipqCp0t3kRVugfOzvzM.html
29-07-2020||Chandigarh||Parents for staggered reopening of schools for board classes, Punjab govt tells MHRD||Chandigarh Parents of schoolgoing children in Punjab will be comfortable with reopening of schools only when the Covid-19 situation improves but they are not averse to starting board classes in a staggered manner, according to feedback received by the state government. The state government gathered this feedback from the parents of schoolchildren, school heads and academic experts after the Union ministry of human resource development (MHRD) on July 17 asked all states and union territories to get the opinions regarding reopening dates of schools. The parents were asked by the state’s school education department about the likely period between August and October when they and their kids will be comfortable with reopening of schools and their expectations from schools as and when the classes resume. The school education department, on the basis of feedback received from parents, has informed the central ministry that the parents will be comfortable with reopening of the schools only when the situation improves and they are sure that there is no risk to the health of students. “However, there is feedback that at least the board classes can be started with 50% strength of students. Students may be called to the schools on alternate days or once in three days so that there is least loss of studies during this period,” secretary, school education, wrote to MHRD on Tuesday without specifying any timeframe. The official further said that this will enable the teachers to check the assignments of students and also give them homework. On expectations from schools whenever they open, it has informed the ministry that the parents expect that all safety measures will be ensured so that there is no risk to the health of their wards due to Covid-19. The feedback on physical classes has been received even as Covid-19 cases have seen a spike this month, going up from 5,568 on July 1 to 14,946 on July 29. The school education department had sent the communication received from the MHRD to schools with a request to get feedback from parents. Also, discussions were held with the district education officers and school principals through videoconferencing. The Punjab government had closed all schools, including government and private, on March 13 and later cancelled the board examinations as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The final decision on reopening of schools will be taken by MHRD in consultation with the Union ministry of home affairs and ministry of health and family welfare.MODALITIES FOR FREE PHONE DISTRIBUTION STILL NOT FINAL A day after chief minister Amarinder Singh announced to kick off the distribution of 50,000 free smartphones among girl students of classes 11 and 12, the Punjab government is still in the process of finalising the modalities for their identification. The government schools have approximately 1.88-lakh girl students in classes 11 and 12 whereas the state authorities had last year shortlisted ‘Lava’ after open bidding and placed an order for 1.60 lakh smartphones. “As priority is to be given to girl students who do not have phones, to facilitate online education, a survey will have to be carried out to identify them. The modalities are being finalised,” said two officials in the know of the matter. The department also plans to give priority to girl students of schools facing shortage of teachers. Another official said the first consignment of 50,000 smartphones was ready with the company but not handed over so far. “The delivery schedule will be decided only after the identification of beneficiaries,” he said. The sports and youth affairs department had notified the ‘Capt Smart Connect Scheme’ in December 2019, listing classes 11 and 12 girl students of government schools and students in final year of undergraduate courses in government ITIs and colleges in the first phase. The Congress had, in its manifesto for the 2017 state polls, promised 30 lakh smartphones with one-year of free data and calling to state’s youth, but has set several deadlines and missed them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/parents-for-staggered-reopening-of-schools-for-board-classes-punjab-govt-tells-mhrd/story-nk8nm0ZLEp5Nurf0YpuezO.html
29-07-2020||City||Kejriwal directs officials to scale up RT-PCR tests for Covid-19||New Delhi: Two days after being pulled up by the Delhi high court for making rapid antigen tests the primary form of testing in the national capital, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday directed officials to ramp up RT-PCR tests by adhering to guidelines laid down by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).The court had on Monday directed the Delhi government to “strictly” follow the Covid-19 testing guidelines issued by the apex health body, instead of interpreting the rules “on its own”. The court had also asked the Delhi government why it had conducted fewer than 6,000 RT-PCR tests a day between July 15 and July 23, despite having 54 laboratories that can conduct up to 11,000 tests per day.Following this, Kejriwal on Wednesday held a review meeting, during which he directed all districts to ramp up the RT-PCR tests by testing all symptomatic persons whose rapid antigen samples returned negative.Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are considered the gold standard to check for Covid-19.“Existing guidelines say that if any patient’s antigen test is negative but has symptoms, RT-PCR test must be done on him. I directed the officers today to ensure strict compliance of these guidelines,” Kejriwal tweeted after the meeting.In Monday’s order, the court also cited the results of the recent serological survey, which showed that a majority of the 22.86% people were exposed to the infectious disease without even realising it, as they were probably asymptomatic. It also sought to know from the Delhi government why it preferred the rapid antigen method as the primary test, despite a high rate of false negatives.On July 16, HT had first reported that between June 18 and July 15, 1,365 (0.5%) of the 262,075 persons who tested negative in the rapid antigen tests were further administered the RT-PCR confirmatory tests. At the time, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had said those cases were the only ones that were found to be symptomatic by the medical officers. In an interview to HT on July 18, Kejriwal had said, “We do not have the capacity to double check those many people with an RT-PCR test. If you see today’s data – 14,000 were antigen tests and 7,000 were RT-PCR tests. We are already using our RT-PCR testing infrastructure to its full capacity. It is not in terms of kits and machines, capacity is also seen in terms of manpower. Even antigen tests are being conducted to its full capacity.”According to Wednesday’s health bulletin, Delhi has conducted a total of 994,219 tests. On the day, 12,318 were rapid antigen tests, and 5,074 were RT-PCR, CBNAAT, TrueNAT tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-directs-officials-to-scale-up-rt-pcr-tests-for-covid-19/story-Qn6rygsl9KP5lQhdJHtyXN.html
29-07-2020||City||Kejriwal interacts with students online to promote entrepreneurship||New Delhi: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday for the first time joined government school students in an online interaction aimed at promoting entrepreneurship.Kejriwal was joined by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and Arjun Malhotra, who co-founded the HCL group. The CM told students how the 71-year-old entrepreneur and industrialist is a qualified engineer from IIT-Kharagpur, the institute from which Kejriwal had himself graduated in 1989.While the entrepreneurship interaction programme has been on since 2018, this was Kejriwal’s first experience, he said.“We believe the people of our country are very intelligent. We are full of ideas and have a brilliant entrepreneurship mindset. A rickshaw puller is an entrepreneur, so is a betel leaf seller. Every citizen of this country knows how to run a business. But there is some problem with our education system. The moment we graduate from our school, we start looking out for jobs. We want to change this mindset. We want that while being in school, our students should start thinking in a direction where they do not have to find a job after leaving school, rather they should start thinking about their business propositions,” Kejriwal told students during the interaction that was live-streamed on the party’s social media handles.Sisodia said, “After the Corona crisis subsides, a variety of new opportunities will arise in the field of entrepreneurship. Three years ago, CM Sir (referring to Kejriwal) and I interacted with a few IIT students. Most of them praised our work done in the field of science and thanked us for their improved science laboratories. But at the same time, they requested us to emphasise more on English. Learning any language is a skill, but our mother tongue Hindi is our pride. We should not feel shy to speak in our mother tongue.”Interacting with students of classes 9-12, Malhotra said, “Behind any successful person is his value system. It is his value system that takes that person to different levels. I wanted to go to NASA and become a researcher after IIT. But since I got a job in the Delhi Cloth Mills, I did not go. Later, we left our job to make computer microprocessors and formed our company.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-interacts-with-students-online-to-promote-entrepreneurship/story-0TjrZJPX64vNcFsrZBdm7I.html

29-07-2020||Delhi||Admin pushing for online exams, giving rise to confusion: JNU students||While officials of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Wednesday said they would allow students to pick their preferred mode of exam -- online or offline -- to complete the semester that has already stretched over by three months due to the Covid-19 pandemic, several students alleged that the administration was trying to “push” for online exams. Students said there was a lot of confusion with some schools and centres opting for the online mode while others are yet to take a call on it. In April, only five of the 13 schools in JNU and one of the five special centres had decided to conduct examinations online. However, with educational institutions across the country continuing to remain shut owing to the pandemic, two of the largest schools in JNU -- the School of Social Sciences and School of International Studies -- also decided to switch to the online mode of exams. According to the JNU administration, around five schools, including School of Computer and System Sciences, School of Environmental Sciences, School of Life Sciences and School of Management and Entrepreneurship, have already completed their exams online. However, JNU students’ union (JNUSU) members said many students from these schools and centres have not been able to take the exams. JNUSU vice-president Saket Moon said, “The administration should issue a notification clarifying that the exams will be held again for those who were unable to appear for the online tests. There is so much confusion even within schools now -- some are conducting online exams while some are not,” he said.Manisha, 23, a final-year MA student at the School of International Studies (SIS), said she won’t be able to take online exams as she doesn’t have a device or an internet connection. “With the school focussing on online exams, students like me will be left behind. They should promote all students on the basis of internal exam results. Why did the school earlier announce that it will conduct exams in the pen-and-paper mode? There is so much confusion at our school about the mode of exam,” she said. Aswini Mohapatra, dean of SIS, said, “The decision to hold exams in the pen-and-paper mode was taken in April --when we thought that the Covid-19 situation might improve by July. Now, we have given students the option to choose their mode of exam. They can take exams online or wait for the university to reopen to take them offline,” he said.A final-year MA student at the Centre for Media Studies, who wished not to be named, said he will also not be able to take exams online. “I do not know what will happen if I miss the exams. I might lose a year. The university should conduct exams for everyone together,” he said.JNU registrar Pramod Kumar said, “Students need not worry. The university will give another chance to those who are unable to take online exams. It’s important to conduct online exams to complete the semester for those who immediately need degrees for higher education or jobs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/admin-pushing-for-online-exams-giving-rise-to-confusion-jnu-students/story-ickvJ1zGq4fq7s9qjdC08J.html

It also directed the corporation to complete all paperwork in relation to the Delhi government’s fund disbursal.The Delhi government did not respond to requests for comment.The additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, Satyakam, told the court that the corporation has not given the utilisation certificates for the funds that had been released earlier.However, the court made it clear it was not going into the other issues between the Delhi government and the corporation with regard to payment of salaries of other employees of north Delhi corporation and the funds it claims it is yet to receive under various heads.The court was hearing a plea it had initiated itself based on news reports that doctors of Kasturba Hospital have threatened to resign because they have not been paid salaries since March this year.On Wednesday, advocate Akhil Mittal, the standing counsel of north Delhi corporation, told the court that it has paid resident doctors’ salaries till May. In an affidavit, he told the court that the salary up to April of all of its regular doctors has also been paid.The court also directed the corporation to place before the bench the utilisation certificates indicating that the amount of ₹8 crore released by the Delhi government earlier, on court orders, were used to pay the resident doctors,The matter will now be heard on August 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-asks-delhi-govt-to-release-8-cr-for-north-mcd-to-pay-resident-docs/story-Osz6mPKuggaMTrqzcab1GL.html
29-07-2020||City||AAP volunteers protest outside BJP office against SDMC’s professional tax move||New Delhi: Over 100 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) volunteers on Wednesday joined a protest outside the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) office against the South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s (SDMC) decision to levy a professional tax on self-employed persons, hike property transfer taxes, and nearly double taxes on rented commercial properties.All three municipal corporations in Delhi are ruled by the BJP. The SDMC House on Monday had passed a proposal to levy a professional tax on self-employed persons and professionals working in companies — a first in Delhi — and doubled the tax on rented commercial properties. The civic body also approved a 1% hike in tax on transfer of property, with an aim to ramp up revenue collection, which was affected by the national lockdown to contain spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).“The volunteers and leaders of AAP will continue opposing this decision at every level. AAP will fight against this decision inside the SDMC House and also on the streets. AAP has promised to the people of Delhi that it will force the BJP to withdraw this decision,” said Durgesh Pathak, member of the political affairs committee and in charge of MCD affairs of the AAP.Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta on Wednesday said, “I have urged the SDMC mayor to roll back the professional tax. We will not let the corporations take the professional tax. North corporation has already deferred the move. We did not approve increase in the electricity tax. The corporations are in bad financial shape because the state government is not giving the corporation their due funds. The government should help the civic bodies in these testing times and should not do politics on the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-volunteers-protest-outside-bjp-office-against-sdmc-s-professional-tax-move/story-At570GdYpstVOqO0lWYuVJ.html
29-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chaos at Nehru Rose Garden Covid-Care Centre, Ludhiana doctors flag issue||Government guidelines are adding to harassment of Covid-19 patients in Ludhiana. Instead of employing an effective mechanism to isolate and treat infected patients, the health department has asked them to report to the Covid-Care Centre (CCC) at Government Meritorious School near Nehru Rose Garden, say patients. The move is resulting in widespread chaos and has left patients and their caregivers fuming. It has also increased the risk of the virus spreading. The health department’s staff doctors at care centre have also complained about the chaos and have asked authorities to take measures to reduce the number of people visiting the area. Caregivers alleged that patients, most of whom were asymptomatic or with mild symptoms, were asked to stand in queue for medical check-up and to procure a certificate for home isolation. The ordeal does not end there as the caregivers and are then asked to wait for approval, which is signed by the agriculture development officer (ADO). Sometimes the approval takes over a day to come through. In such as case, the patient is kept at the Centre, patients’ relatives alleged. ‘CUMBERSOME PROCESS’A patient’s friend, who did not wish to be named, said, “My friend gave his samples for testing on Wednesday and the reports arrived on Friday. The reports were sent over WhatsApp, following which my friend started receiving calls to get registered at care centre at 5pm.” “The centre was crowded but he managed to get himself tested. However, he was told that till the time, the health department does not receive an approval from the ADO. He was asked to stay at the isolation ward of the hospital. My friend got scared and left in his car. The next day I went to the centre and was shocked to see the crowd. Both patients and caregivers were standing in the same queue and asymptotic patients were roaming in the hostel as if they were strolling in a park,” he said. A man whose father tested positive for Covid-19 said the cumbersome process of applying for home isolation was leading to the spread of infection. “My father tested positive on July 21. Since he is over 60 years old and had fever, our family decided to keep him under home isolation. However, at the centre, patients and caregivers were jostling to get themselves registered. Social distancing norms were not followed. Many old patients suffering from fever and weakness were helplessly waiting for their turn. We had to seek a local politicians help,” he said. On the other hand, Dr Govind Ram, senior medical officer (SMO) at the COVID-care centre said they had flagged the issue. “We are working under tremendous pressure. As per the protocol, positive patients are asked to report at the isolation ward for a medical check-up and care givers are told to stand separately. But caregivers also stand in the queue along with Covid-19 patients. This increases the risk of the virus spreading,” the SMO said. “We keep telling patients to maintain distance but our requests fall on deaf ears. We have brought the matter to the notice of authorities,” said Ram. PATIENTS ARRIVE IN AUTOSWhen asked why patient arrive in auto rickshaws and other modes of transport, the SMO said the rapid response ambulance can ferry one patient and till the time the formalities are not completed the ambulance cannot leave. “So in certain cases, patients were seen visiting the centre in public transport vehicles.” Civil surgeon (CS) Dr Rajesh Bagga said orders in this regards had already been issued. “The problem occurs while jotting down the online details of patients. We have observed that increasing the number of computers will not solve the purpose. So it has been decided to call the patient in different time slots to end the chaos at the centre,” Bagga said. THE PROTOCOL As per the protocol, a patient has to report for check- up at a Covid Care Centre with a care giver after testing positive. The patient can apply for home isolation or admission to a government or private facility. The process of home isolation is initiated after the patient is found asymptomatic during the medical check-up. For home admission, the patient has to fill a form wherein the patient mentions the name of a caregiver and the address of the house where he wishes to remain isolated. Thereafter, the form is forwarded to the agriculture development officer (ADO) concerned, who visits the location and following his/her approval the patient is allowed to stay at home. Besides the health department initiates the prophylactic treatment of rest of the family members and caregivers who have tested negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chaos-at-nehru-rose-garden-covid-care-centre-ludhiana-doctors-flag-issue/story-ZjvLwq6GkyyLCFuspKlCsO.html
29-07-2020||City||Sharjeel Imam summoned in sedition case||New Delhi: A Delhi court on Wednesday summoned Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Sharjeel Imam on September 1 in a sedition case, while taking cognisance of the offences under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) after the police had charge sheeted him for allegedly making instigating speeches at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) in January this year.Additional sessions judge Dharmendra Rana, however, did not take cognisance of the other sections, including sedition (124A) and 153 A (punishment for wanton vilification or attack upon religion, etc), after the investigating agency told the court that sanction to prosecute Imam was still awaited.Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, investigating agencies have to take the state government’s approval or sanction while filing charge sheets in sedition cases.On Wednesday, additional public prosecutor Irfan Ahmed told the court that while sanction for prosecution under UAPA had been granted, a request has been made to the competent authority for sanction in the sedition case.Noting this, the court said, “In view of the same, I take cognisance for commission of offence under section 13 of UAPA in the present matter. However, the issue of taking cognisance for the commission of offence under section 124A (sedition), 153A (punishment for sedition), 153B (Assertion prejudicial to national integration) and 505 (circulation of certain statement, rumours, etc) of the Indian Penal Code, is deferred for the time being for the want of requisite sanction,” the judge said in his order .The judge asked Imam to be produced from a Guwahati jail, where he is currently lodged in another case, on September 1.The court said a long date has been being given in the matter as the normal functioning of the courts is suspended, while noting that “even the accused is Covid-19 positive”. It said in case Imam could not be physically produced on the next date of hearing, he would be produced through video-conferencing. “We are yet to see the copy of the charge sheet. We would be able to comment only once we have gone through the document, “ Imam’s lawyer said, reacting to Wednesday’s development. The police’s crime branch had filed the charge sheet in the Patiala House Courts on Saturday against Imam in a case registered against him on January 25. The police said Imam had given a seditious speech at AMU in January.“In the garb of protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA), he (Imam) exhorted people of a particular community to block the highways leading to major cities and resort to ‘chakka jaam’, thereby disrupting normal life. Also, in the name of opposing CAA, he openly threatened to cut off Assam and other Northeastern states from the rest of the country,” police had said.In this case, Imam has been charged with delivering an ‘inflammatory and seditious’ speech. The officer said in this same case, police later added sections of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against Imam. Imam was arrested by Delhi police from Bihar’s Jehanabad on January 28. Earlier on April 18, police had filed the first charge sheet against Imam in connection with the riots outside Jamia Millia Islamia, during which protesters had clashed with police. In the first charge sheet, police had charged Imam with allegedly instigating riots at the campus during a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sharjeel-imam-summoned-in-sedition-case/story-cN67CQ5g3QK82XasW9aGoJ.html
29-07-2020||City||HC tells Delhi govt, civic bodies, DDA to submit action taken report against unsafe buildings||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Wednesday directed the Delhi government and the civic bodies among various agencies to submit what action has been taken against the owners of buildings that require seismic structure stability after a plea was filed alleging the lack of preparedness in case an earthquake hits the city.A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan also sought to know from the municipal bodies and the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) as to what steps they have taken after identifying and issuing notices to the high-risk buildings in need of seismic stability.The court also sought to know from the Delhi government whether any expert committee has been set up, as proposed by a notification of April last year, to look into seismic stability of the buildings in the city.The court’s order came on a plea by Arpit Bhargava, a lawyer, seeking setting up of a monitoring committee to ensure timely implementation of the action plan for strengthening buildings in Delhi.He said that between April 12 and July 3, 14 earthquakes struck the Delhi-National Capital Region.He also said that since the Centre has not filed any response or affidavit, there is no clarity whether buildings like Vigyan Bhawan, Shastri Bhawan and others where high ranking officials work are seismically compliant or not.The Delhi government on Wednesday launched an awareness programme aimed at ensuring residences, offices, schools, and other private and public spaces prepared to deal with earthquakes.“Considering the frequency of earthquakes in Delhi since April this year, the Delhi government has launched an awareness campaign on steps to be taken by people during and after an earthquake. The campaign aims at making homes, offices, schools, and other commercial and residential spaces fully prepared and efficiently deal with earthquakes… The campaign will also help people be well-prepared and take measures to minimise the damage and effects of the earthquakes,” said a statement issued by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office on Wednesday.Advocate Arjun Pant, representing DDA, told the court that letters have been issued to the owner of 19 high-rise buildings (height 15 metres or above), which were sanctioned before March 21, 2001, to initiate the process of structural safety audit and submit the first action taken report in 30 days.In separate affidavits, the civic bodies have listed the steps taken pursuant to the last order. “Visual survey is also being conducted and for buildings identified as structurally vulnerable, letters are being issued to the owner(s)/occupier(s) of all high rise buildings which were sanctioned after March 3, 2001, to initiate the process of structural safety audit and submit the first action taken report in 30 days,” the North body said in the affidavit. Other civic bodies also filed similar affidavits that between the three of them they have employed 144 structural engineers to audit the stability of buildings under their jurisdiction.The application was filed in Bhargava’s main petition filed in 2015 claiming that the seismic stability of buildings in Delhi was poor and in case of a major earthquake there could be large numbers of casualties.The petition is still pending before the high court which from time to time has directed the Delhi government and civic authorities to develop an action plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-tells-delhi-govt-civic-bodies-dda-to-submit-action-taken-report-against-unsafe-buildings/story-e0zQz63u4UuydnRefu47dM.html

Since April 2020, 18 very mild tremors have taken place in and around Delhi. Only two of these have registered above 4, or mild intensity, on the Richter Scale.”“However, as your chief minister, it is my firm belief that Delhi must always be prepared and aware of any crisis. My policy is simple: prepare today to save lives tomorrow. We have compiled useful information that will prepare homes, schools, and workplaces in Delhi, to react to an earthquake emergency with calm and efficiency.

29-07-2020||City||Convicted serial killer who jumped parole found to be living in Delhi||New Delhi: A 62-year-old convicted serial killer who had jumped parole after being released for 20 days from a jail in Jaipur was found to have remarried and living in west Delhi’s Baprola village, Delhi Police said on Wednesday after arresting the man. Devender Sharma, a doctor, had allegedly murdered about 50 taxi and truck drivers in the 1990s and early 2000s but was convicted in about a dozen kidnapping-cum-murder cases, Rakesh Paweriya, deputy commissioner of police (crime branch), said.Sharma was serving a life sentence in the Jaipur Central Jail for the last 16 years when he decided to jump a 20-day parole in January this year. The officer said Sharma had studied medicine in Bihar and had run a clinic in Jaipur for 11 years, even as he slowly entered the world of crime, including running a kidney racket, operating a fake gas agency, and then going on to murder a host of drivers and dumping their bodies in a canal infested with crocodiles in Uttar Pradesh. “His criminal career began in 1994 when he lost about Rs11 lakh after investing in a fake gas agency. To recover his losses, Sharma too began a fake gas agency with some partners. They would murder drivers of trucks carrying gas cylinders. The gas cylinders would be unloaded in his agency and sold to customers,” the DCP said. The alleged fraud was busted in 1996 and Sharma was arrested. After his release on bail, he allegedly went on to start another fake gas agency and then got involved in a kidney racket. “The kidney racket was operating out of Jaipur, Gurgaon and Ballabhagarh. He has told us he had arranged 125 illegal kidney transplants and received Rs5-7 lakh in each case. He was finally arrested in 2004 when the infamous Gurgaon kidney racket was exposed, a case that saw many doctors get arrested as well,” Paweriya said. Alongside, Sharma was also allegedly bumping off taxi drivers and selling their vehicles in the grey market, the DCP said. “He would hire a taxi from Jaipur to Aligarh, kill the driver in between and dump his body in a canal in UP’s Kasganj. The canal was infested with crocodiles and the retrieval of the bodies was difficult,” the DCP said. The officer said Sharma was allegedly involved in about 50 such killings but was booked in fewer cases and convicted in half-a-dozen of them. These murder cases were registered in Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, the officer said. “When he got parole, he decided never to return to jail. He first lived in Aligarh before moving to Uttam Nagar in West Delhi. It was during this time that he befriended a widowed woman and married her,” the officer said. Sharma’s first wife and children had deserted him after getting to know about his alleged murders, the officer said. In Delhi, Sharma had taken to property dealings and told the police that he was mediating the sale of a building in Connaught Place. The police are yet to ascertain that. The narcotics cell of Delhi Police’s crime branch arrested Sharma from his rented house in Baprola village on Monday after receiving a tip-off about his location.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/convicted-serial-killer-who-jumped-parole-found-to-be-living-in-delhi/story-aCl5PtqzbIb2PgBD2WaaeJ.html

29-07-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana MC for shifting dairy units out of city limits, owners demand infrastructure||Ahead of the meeting of the special task force (STF) constituted to facilitate the shifting of over 500 diary units outside city limits, municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal conducted a meeting with dairy owners of Haibowal and Tajpur road dairy complexes at Zone D office of the MC on Wednesday. The dairy owners have consented to the shifting, but they demanded that the government should establish complexes outside the MC limits with all facilities required to treat dairy waste and cow dung.As per the information, there are over 400 dairy units in Haibowal dairy complex and around 130 in Tajpur road dairy complex. The administration had been contemplating shifting of dairy units as their owners have been dumping dairy waste and cow dung in the Buddha Nullah. But, the project has been hanging fire for a long time. Earlier, the state government had also planned to establish effluent treatment plants (ETP) to deal with the waste generated under a Rs 650-crore project sanctioned by the state government. “The dairy owners have also given their consent to moving out of the city limit, but, they have put forward few demands, which will now be tabled in front of the government. A solution will also be found for scattered dairy units operational in the city,” Sabherwal said.As per MC officials, there are around 200 dairy units which are operational in different parts of the city including residential areas. Dumping of waste in the sewer lines chokes them, becoming an inconvenience for residents. Joginder Malhotra, general secretary of Tajpur road dairy owners association, said, “We were shifted to the dairy complexes for which the agreement was signed in 1973. If the administration wants us to move out, we are ready, but they should establish complexes for us at Tajpur road and Hambran road (outside MC limits). Also, arrangements should be made in those complexes to deal with dairy waste and cow dung. The plots should also be made available at reasonable prices.”Report on encroachments likely to be tabled in STF meetingThe MC, revenue and drainage departments had recently initiated an exercise to identify encroachments alongside the Buddha Nullah so that the nullah’s width can be increased. Officials said the report regarding this might be tabled in front of STF members during the meeting.Due to permanent encroachments alongside the nullah, the width of the nullah has decreased, due to which the nullah also overflows during monsoons. Also, the NGT monitoring committee had earlier directed the administration to work for beautification of the drain by taking up plantation drives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-mc-for-shifting-dairy-units-out-of-city-limits-owners-demand-infrastructure/story-HEv5FW2pGX1KxZgMpl5KuL.html
29-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh plans to demarcate micro-containment zones to control Covid pandemic||With a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases this month, the UT administration will start demarcating micro-containment zones in the city.The issue was discussed during the review meeting chaired by UT administrator VPS Badnore on Wednesday.UT adviser Manoj Parida said: “The administration will create micro-containment zones after mapping of new cases coming up in different areas. This will enable us to control the infection without causing much hardship to neighbouring areas.”During the meeting, Badnore directed Arun Kumar Gupta, principal secretary, health, to focus on micro-containment areas and enhance contact tracing, particularly focusing on source of infection.Under the policy, even three to four houses together within a sector or colony can be designated as micro-containment zone. Strict perimeter control will be imposed on these areas. As per discussions held on Wednesday, these measures will be deemed to be over if there is no positive case reported for 14 days in the zone. “However, the UT administration is awaiting fresh guidelines of the central government on containment zones. After examining them, the policy will be implemented in Chandigarh,” said a senior UT official, requesting anonymity.Significantly, as per the original central government guidelines on containment zones, perimeter restrictions could be removed after 28 days of the last positive case reported. In Punjab, whose micro-containment zone policy has helped shaped Chandigarh’s plan, containment operations are stopped after 10 days of no positive case.The demarcation and designation of an area as a micro-containment zone will be decided by the affected area committee, comprising deputy commissioner and representatives of the health department and municipal corporation. The committee, in addition to the number of cases being reported from an area, will take into consideration various other factors.MEASURES UNDER NEW POLICYThe administration decided to go in for a change in strategy after more than 500 cases were reported in July. Also, while in the initial stages, the spread of the disease was localised in a few pockets such as Bapu Dham Colony, now the cases are being reported from several areas.The strategy would be to contain the disease within a defined geographical area by early detection, breaking the chain of transmission, and thus, prevent its spread to new areas.“This will include geographical quarantine, social distancing measures, enhanced active surveillance, testing all suspected cases, isolation of cases and home quarantine,” said an official. “It will be ensured that there is no unchecked outward movement of population from micro-containment zone except for maintaining essential services. All vehicular movement and public transport will be restricted.”Under the policy, extensive contact tracing will be ensured in the zone. House-to-house screening will be carried out on daily basis. Random stratified sampling can also be undertaken, said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-plans-to-demarcate-micro-containment-zones-to-control-covid-pandemic/story-tfhOq1ZtIFs0yBU0b86buL.html

President of the Punjab Petrol Pump Dealers’ Association, Paramjit Singh Doaba, said that Chawla, 76, stated in his suicide note that he had gone bankrupt due to the disparity in VAT on fuel in Chandigarh and Punjab.“This happened due to the wrong policies of the state government as petrol prices are higher in Punjab than Chandigarh and other border states due to disparity in imposition of VAT,” Doaba said.President of the Ludhiana petrol pump dealers’ association, Ranjit Singh Gandhi, said, “There are around 350 petrol pumps in Ludhiana and all were closed during the protest on Wednesday. We have been demanding parity in VAT for a long time as customers purchase fuel from other states due to lower rates. But, the state government is not paying heed to the problem, due to which Chawla ended his life.”The pumps remained closed till 5pm, leaving residents a harried lot. A residents of Model town area, Chanpreet Singh said, “I had to reach Nakodar for work but I had to cancel due to non-availability of fuel. The petrol pump owners should not harass general public as their protest is against the government.”An executive with a food delivery company, Baljeet Singh, said, “I was not aware of the strike. While my colleagues got their tanks refilled on Tuesday night, my work was hit for around two hours after which I had to borrow my brother’s vehicle to deliver orders. The petrol pump owners should make proper announcements regarding the strike in advance so that the public doesn’t face problems.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/petrol-pump-dealers-in-ludhiana-up-in-arms-over-high-fuel-prices-in-punjab/story-PG2NfdJQVFjqstNlJ0VWHN.html

29-07-2020||City||Himachal cabinet expansion today||The state capital on Wednesday witnessed hectic political activity as chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, after completing his week-long home quarantine, met governor Bandaru Dattatreya to apprise him about cabinet expansion.The CM, who completed his 30 months in office, will undertake his first cabinet expansion.Three cabinet berths fell vacant after then food and civil supplies minister Kishan Kapoor was elected to the Lok Sabha from Kangra, while power minister Anil Sharma quit after the Congress nominated his son Ashray Sharma from the Mandi parliamentary seat against BJP’s sitting Lok Sabha member Ram Swaroop Sharma and health minister Bipin Singh Parmar was appointed speaker in place of Nahan legislator Rajeev Bindal who was named state unit chief in January.Jai Ram had planned to expand his cabinet after the Dharamshala and Pacchad Lok Sabha by-elections last year, but the exercise was deferred due to bickering in the state BJP. After that, the coronavirus pandemic stalled these plans.Nurpur legislator Rakesh Pathania will be inducted into the state cabinet on Thursday. He began his political career in 1991 and was the BJP Kisan Morcha’s Kangra president before becoming its state secretary and a member of the party’s state executive. He was elected to the assembly as a BJP nominee in 1998 and re-elected as an independent in 2007 before becoming MLA for the third time in December 2017. Pathania belongs to the Rajput community and has been vying for a cabinet berth since 2017. However, the party chose Bipin Singh Parmar, another Rajput leader.Paonta Sahib MLA Sukhram Chaudhary, the leader from other backward classes from Sirmaur, is also going to hold a spot in the cabinet. Chaudhary was a junior engineer in the electricity board before joining politics and was elected to the Vidhan Sabha in 2003, 2007 and 2017. He was parliamentary secretary from 2009 to 2012.The chief minister is also going to offer a cabinet berth to Rajinder Garg, a first-time MLA from Bilaspur. Garg is considered close to BJP national president JP Nadda.Jai Ram had planned the cabinet expansion last week, but it was put off after he went into a week-long self-quarantine after a deputy secretary in CMO tested positive for Covid19.Speculations about the cabinet expansion got credence after the administration had readied three rooms in the Ellerslie block of Himachal secretariat for the new ministers, while Raj Bhawan had changed sitting arrangements at Darbar Hall, which is used during ceremonies. The CM will hold a cabinet meeting on Thursday morning at the secretariat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-cabinet-expansion-today/story-4D6xkn0SaQRKsChtxFsKnN.html

On Wednesday, however, shops and markets were allowed to open in some areas.“Markets opened, but the buyers were mostly absent, even in the city’s business hub — Lal Chowk. It does not feel like Eid is just two days away. Even bakery shops are closed here,” said Abdul Majeed, a Srinagar resident.However, Goni Khan Market was an exception as shoppers, particularly women, showed up in large numbers to buy cosmetics, jewellery and apparels, which the bazaar is famous for.Javed Ahmad, who sells cosmetics in the market, said police vehicles were stationed in the market on Tuesday prompting everybody to shut shop. “Today, shops were allowed to open and there was some good sale after long. Since the situation is not normal, we can’t expect a heavy rush,” he said.In Old City, the Nowhatta Chowk market witnessed some footfall, prompting the authorities to vacate the street vendors.“There was heavy rush at street vendor stalls selling apparel and kitchen items but sensing the heavy crowds, the police forced many vendors to vacate and close shops,” said Noor Mohammad, a government employee who visited the market.Police vehicles kept roaming the streets to check for any violation of Covid-19 protocols.The divisional administration had decided to ease the lockdown from July 28 to 30 in Kashmir to allow people to purchase goods and essential commodities.No public transport was allowed except autos and personal cars. “There was a rush of private cars on the roads which caused some traffic snarls,” said Danish Ahmad, who had gone out with his family for shopping.Religious leaders this year have urged people to celebrate Eid with simplicity taking all necessary precautions.Sacrificial animals were also available at select places. Officials said the sale of sacrificial animals will not be allowed on July 31, a day ahead of the festival. They said all the mosques and shrines will remain closed for prayers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-usual-pre-eid-rush-as-shops-open-briefly-ahead-of-festival-in-kashmir/story-q6x3XqLJtsjrz0vnsiqacO.html

29-07-2020||Bangalore||Karnataka puts syllabus on hold that dropped Tipu Sultan chapter from Class 7||The Karnataka government which had come under fire by the opposition for dropping a chapter on Mysore ruler Tipu Sultan from a Class 7 textbook has decided to put the revised syllabus on hold. Opposition parties on Wednesday pointed out that it was not just the chapter on Tipu Sultan but also lessons on the life of Jesus Christ and Prophet Mohammed which had been dropped.While the opposition parties had alleged that it was a part of the creeping saffronisation of education, the Karnataka Textbook Society Director Made Gowda had defended the move on Tuesday. He said that it was just rationalisation as a part of a 30 percent reduction in syllabus. Gowda had also pointed out that since the number of academic days had been reduced from 220 days to a mere 120 days because of the ongoing pandemic, the syllabus had been reduced proportionately.State primary and secondary education minister Suresh Kumar on Wednesday, however, claimed that he had seen reports in the media about the revised syllabus and said that it (revised syllabus) had not been finalised. “We don’t even know how many days would be available for the current academic year, so how can we finalise the syllabus?” the minister said, adding that he had directed his department to withdraw the revised syllabus which had been uploaded on the Department of State Education Research and Training website.Asserting that there was no question of belittling any person or historical incident, the minister in a note said that the effort of the government would be to build and unite rather than divide the society. Earlier, the leader of opposition in the assembly, Siddaramiah, claimed that the official government was taking a backseat and the true Sangh government was coming to fore. “If they try to foist the secret agenda of the Sangh and destroy the aspirations of our constitution, the Congress won’t tolerate it. We will be forced to agitate,” said the Congress leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-puts-syllabus-on-hold-that-dropped-tipu-sultan-chapter-from-class-7/story-kblCkkNBetILqcbq4Rt4WM.html

The application mentioned that before the Covid-19 pandemic, his counsel visited him regularly and he could pass handwritten instructions and documents.“Since March 17, the visits of my counsel have been discontinued due to Covid -19 and as a result safe-keeping and proper organisation of the case-related documents has become difficult,” he stated. He has requested the court to pass instructions to the superintendent of Model Jail “to use the computer in the office of a jail officer for three hours a week under his watch” so that he can prepare his defence and related material.The application was rejected by the superintendent, as there is no such provision existing in the Punjab jail manual wherein undertrial prisoners can be allowed to access computers to prepare their own case.The jail superintendent said due to security reasons, no inmate is allowed to use a computer in the office. “He was advised to prepare handwritten notes, if he desires so. He can also discuss case via e-mulaqat, and can use telephone,” the superintendent mentioned.In the second application, Zaidi stated that he is a postgraduate and an income tax payer, hence, is entitled for better class facility that is “B” class status. The court has sought response from the CBI by July 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/kotkhai-custodial-death-zaidi-seeks-better-facility-computer-to-prepare-defence/story-sN8iWb4fPK9uZtlOJsLUlJ.html

Sources confirmed that Baljit was questioned for a few hours.The SIT probing the 2015 incidents had summoned Baljit on a couple of occasions in the first week of July, but he had failed to appear.

After inaugurating his party’s office in Amritsar, Brahmpura said, “The BJP wants to make itself powerful in Punjab. It is playing a game. It has ties with the Badal family as well as the Dhindsa group. The BJP is the boss of the Badals and Dhindsas. I am sure, in the coming days, the BJP will play a role in forging an alliance between the Dhindsa group and the Badals.” Brahmpura said his party will fight the upcoming Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) elections and the assembly polls in 2022. “We have already appealed to the Centre to conduct the SGPC elections as early as possible so that the religious body of the Sikhs can be liberated from the clutches of the Badal family.” Brahmpura said his party also rejects the three agriculture-related ordinances, which are not only anti-farmer, but also anti-Punjab and Haryana. “SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal and his wife Harsimrat Kaur have betrayed the farmers of Punjab by endorsing the three ordinances,” he said.

Dynaneshwar Molak, head of solid waste management, PMC, said, “The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had assigned the task to monitor these violations to some officials, but now due to the easing of restrictions, they have been assigned to different tasks. We do not have enough workforce to keep a check on the Covid-19 rules and norms. Therefore, there has been a fall in the registration of the cases in the last two months. Moreover, now 90% to 95% of people do wear masks and avoid spitting on the road.”Dr Rahul Doshi, a general physician, said, “Covid-19 cases are increasing rapidly and citizens and government authorities have to cooperate with each other to stop the spread of the virus. The government cannot keep a check on citizens all the time and they should think about their health first and should stop the spread of the disease by following all rules and regulations.”According to health experts, spitting in public places and not wearing a mask, both contribute to the spread of the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/do-not-have-enough-manpower-to-implement-all-covid-rules-says-official-as-violation-cases-in-june-july-dip/story-RzN5yygNr11REbFJPV62KK.html

29-07-2020||Patna||Medical interns on Covid duty in Bihar demand insurance cover, stipend hike||Doctors on internship and post graduate (PG) students, including those under the three-year residency scheme in state-run medical colleges of Bihar, have demanded insurance cover and indemnity, similar to the one provided by the state government for its employees on Covid-19 duty, besides hike in their stipend.The medicos also gave the government a seven-day ultimatum, failing which they may take “hard decisions”. The Bihar government had on July 27 announced that dependents of employees, who die in line of Covid-19 duty, will be offered either a government job or special family pension equivalent to the amount of the last drawn salary for the remaining period of the employee’s service till the time of superannuation, after which they will get normal family pension.The medicos have now demanded that all interns and PG students, including ad-hoc, regular, junior and senior PG residents, across all government-run medical colleges in Bihar, be also included under this cover.The demand was sent on Wednesday to Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar under the banner of the Bihar chapter of the United Resident & Doctors’ Association India (URDAI). Besides medicos of the nine state-run medical colleges, the forum also includes medicos of the AIIMS and the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), both in Patna.URDAI-Bihar president Dr Vinay Kumar held that the life of an intern or a resident had the same value as any other permanent employee. “If such benefits are not extended to them, they may be removed from Covid-19 duty. The duties for care of Covid-19 patients should be restricted to those who are covered under insurance and indemnity schemes of the state government,” said Dr Kumar.“We also want the government to provide a free treatment facility to frontline corona warriors if they get infected in the course of duty,” he added. Dr Kumar, in a separate letter to the director, AIIMS-Patna, under the banner of the Resident Doctors Association, said the earlier insurance scheme — Rs 50 lakh to the next of kin in event of death of healthcare workers involved in Covid care — announced by the Prime Minister, had expired in June, this year.“As of today, there is no information on the extension of the scheme. The AIIMS-Patna has not provided any insurance security cover to its resident doctors at the local administrative level,” he added, citing the Bihar government’s order for its employees.Dr Kumar demanded that the same benefit should be extended to the resident doctors of AIIMS-Patna as well since they were serving the people of Bihar. The letter said that beneficiaries should include ad hoc, regular, junior, senior as well as PG residents and MBBS interns of the institute. The resident doctors may be compelled to take “hard decisions” after seven days if their interests were overlooked, the letter said.The URDAI also demanded a revision in stipend of MBBS interns as well as PG students.The association is demanding a revision from Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000 in monthly MBBS internship, which is of one-year. Similarly, it is demanding Rs 80,000 in first year, Rs 85,000 in second year and Rs 90,000 during the three-year PG curriculum. At present, they get Rs 50,000, Rs 55,000 and Rs 60,000 in the first, second and third year, respectively. Their stipend was last revised four years back.They are also demanding Rs 1,05,000, Rs 1,10,000 and Rs 1,15,000 for senior residents in the first, second and third year, respectively.Bihar has around 950 MBBS interns, 600 PG students, 300 senior residents and 250 (approx) junior residents across its medical colleges, excluding those at AIIMS and IGIMS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/medical-interns-on-covid-duty-in-bihar-demand-insurance-cover-stipend-hike/story-8TZjB06ltbxzmc8lVsYDnI.html
29-07-2020||Chandigarh||To tackle drones from China, HP police panel advises positioning air defence assets at appropriate locations||Close on the heels of the Chinese intrusion in the Ladakh sector and subsequent violent clashes that claimed the lives of 20 soldiers, a high-level panel of the Himachal Pradesh Police has recommended the state government to strengthen the road and communication network in Kinnaur and Lahaul-Spiti along Chinese border and build new airstrips.The panel comprising five battalion superintendents of police (SP) visited 36 villages in the two tribal districts, which share a long border with the hostile neighbouring country. The director general of police had constituted a panel of the five Indian Police service officers, comprising commandants of different police battalions that included Sanjeev Gandhi (2nd IRB Sakoh), Soumya Sambasivan (3rd IRB Pandoh), Anupam Sharma (5th IRB Bassi),Sakshi Verma (1st IRB Bangarh) ,and Virender Singh (4th IRB Jangalberi). The director general of police had sent the panel to 36 villages close to the Chinese border in Kinnaur and Lahaul Spiti district. The panel was sent as part of confidence building measures post Chinese intrusion in Galwan valley in Ladakh, in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed in hand-to-hand combat between the Indian army and Chinese troops. “The report has been submitted to the government for consideration,” said director general of police Sanjay Kundu. Panel also made a presentation to the governor, Bandaru Dattatreya, recently and the report was kept in the state cabinet. The panel had recommended construction of two roads - Wangtu in Kinnaur to Mud in Spiti valley, which will shorten the distance between the strategic locations in the two districts by 120 kilometers. It recommended another road between Brua in Kinnaur to Harshil in Uttrakhand over the 17320-feet high Khaga pass.The panel has also recommended handing over the Karchham-Chhitkul road in Kinnaur to Border Roads Organisation (BRO). The road is maintained by Himachal Pradesh Public Works Department. Apart from the roads, the panel has suggested that dependable and round-the-clock communication system should be installed. DRONES FROM CHINA A MATTER OF CONCERN To tackle drones from China, the police panel has advised that air defence assets be positioned at appropriate locations to prevent violation of the Indian Air Space. New airstrips must be developed in the Spiti area in Lahaul-Spiti district for prompt deployment of forces in the border areas in case of need to act as advanced landing grounds. Helipads must also be developed in the forward areas, the panel advised. “The state CID must establish three counter espionage units in the border area in overall national security interests,” the panel said, adding that the presence of Central Intelligence Agencies, Indian Army and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) should be increased to improve people’s morale and confidence to meet with any unforeseen incident of intrusion.The panel further observed that the Atal Tunnel between Manali and Keylong is likely to be commissioned shortly and this will result in increase in traffic along the Manali–Leh axis.“As this axis will have strategic importance, adequate arrangements like intelligence, security and maintenance of the axis round the year should be made in advance,” the panel said. It also stresses on imparting basic Chinese and Tibetan language training to ITBP and State intelligence agencies.RAISE BATTALIONS OF KINNAUR, LAHAUL-SPITI SCOUTS The panel also recommended that on the pattern of Ladakh Scouts, Battalions of Kinnaur and Lahaul-Spiti scouts should be raised to be called Himachal Scouts. These Scouts can be used to dominate the 240-Km Indo-China border in Himachal, the panel said. Further the economic activities should be increased to repopulate the areas. Tribal tourism may be promoted and marketing of local flowers and produce may also be encouraged. Such measures will lead to re-population of the border areas, the panel said. The police panel observed that the people were patriotic and possess high morale and must be given guerrilla training by Central Para Military Forces. Prior to 2001 the SSB would give such trainings to the villagers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/to-tackle-drones-from-china-hp-police-panel-advises-positioning-air-defence-assets-at-appropriate-locations/story-pTLTmyvsKbxRKg9TU4G4eM.html
29-07-2020||Pune||PMC likely to allow restaurants, hotels to resume operations in August||The Pune Municipal Commissioner (PMC) is likely to allow hotels and lodges to resume operation as the civic body has scheduled a meeting with hoteliers to discuss a plan to restart businesses. While the state government allowed reopening of hotels with 33 per cent capacity on July 8, the PMC had not issued orders at the local level. Now with the government looking at another round of relaxations, the Pune civic body has scheduled meeting with representatives from the hotel industry to discuss modalities of restarting the business. According to PMC Municipal Commissioner Vikram Kumar, the civic body did not give permission till now as Pune has seen a surge in the number of Covid-19 positive cases and most of the hotels were in containment zones. “This prompted us to defer the decision until now. But we will be reviewing the details after a meeting with the hotelier association in the city and with the other authorities jointly on July 31, when we plan for August 2020,” said Kumar. Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad together have at least 400 to 500 hotels with most of them willing to reopen businesses, said Sharan Shetty, president, Pune Hoteliers Association (PHA). “The PHA is in talks with the authorities to try to get permission for the hotels to open up as early as possible. The 33 per cent occupancy condition in the state government directive is quite unreasonable considering the number of overheads and costs involved in running the operations of a hotel. However, given the circumstances, we would be willing to start operations,” said Shetty. While hotels with attached rooms are likely to be permitted to carry on their business, small restaurants and eateries in Pune hope that a similar decision will be taken for them as they report less than 30 per cent of the normal business through ‘take-home’ services. The shortage of the workforce after around 70 per cent staff working as cooks, waiters returned home to their home state during lockdown has only complicated the situation for these restaurants. The otherwise crowded restaurants on Fergusson college road, Camp and other areas are complaining that business has taken a major hit even as home delivery of food is allowed. “Just when we were looking to pick up business, another round of lockdown was announced. Our daily sale has now gone down by 80 per cent if you compare it with pre-lockdown sales. It has come down to only 20 per cent of the usual that is around Rs 70,000 per day on average,” said GB Joshi, an accountant at Hotel Vaishali on Fergusson college road. The shortage of workers, as Joshi noted, is making the “business unviable.” In Pune, most of those involved in cooking and serving food were from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Uttarakhand and Karnataka. This labour force, according to hoteliers, may take six more months to return. Kasim Irani, the owner of Goodluck café, said, “With business going down to 5 per cent of the usual and absence of our regular employees, we have downsized the menu and only 10 per cent from the entire list is available for takeaway. Even if our staff returns, I may not be able to recruit all till business comes to normal. I hope the government will allow the restaurant to open with 50 per cent of occupancy.” According to the Pune Restaurant and Hotelier Association (PRAHA), the city has over 8,000 restaurants of only 150 have restarted the business in full while many are operating with reduced hours. “The lockdown has claimed jobs of 2.5 lakh workers in our industry in Pune. After hotels are allowed to resume at 33 per cent occupancy, we expect the government to also allow us to reopen the dine-in facility without which the business is unviable,” said PRAHA president Ganesh Shetty. Initially in March and April, restaurant owners, unaware of how long the lockdown may be extended, paid the salaries of the staff but also provided them with accommodation. Later, when the staff returned to their hometown, the Maharashtra government began unlocking process and allowed many to reopen from June 9. “Many of our members are paying rent as well as electricity bills for their premises when business is much below normal. Many small and big restaurants, who are finding it difficult to keep business running may close down in the coming days,” said Shetty. With offices also not operating to full capacity, many small hotels with dependence on delivery business during day-time are finding it difficult. Prashant Shetty from Nimantran said, “The daily sale is around Rs 30,000 to 40,000 and if we are lucky on weekends then it exceeds Rs 45,000. On weekdays we get 40 to 50 orders per day and on weekends the number of orders received is around 80 to 100. There is a definite hike in takeaway orders as we do not receive so many orders for delivery before lockdown.” The concept of no contact delivery was introduced to assure safety by restaurants. However, many people do not prefer ordering food online choose to eat home-cooked instead, complained those involved in the food delivery business. Ravi Manik Kamble, a delivery executive, said, “We receive around 8 to 10 orders per day and we get Rs 15 to Rs 30 per order depending on the distance of the delivery. All my savings are over and the number of orders per day has reduced almost by 60 per cent. Swiggy and Zomato charge us an extra Rs 300 for a raincoat and hence it becomes difficult to take more orders. The traffic police click our picture post 10 pm when we wear raincoats and that creates a problem for us which eventually creates a barrier in delivering more orders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-likely-to-allow-restaurants-hotels-to-resume-operations-in-august/story-T6JEesoUfH2lPf2YBKLEWJ.html
29-07-2020||City||Strengthen healthcare services instead of imposing lockdown: CPI M to HP govt||Amid surge in Covid-19 infections in Himachal Pradesh, the Communist Party of Indian (Marxist) has demanded that the state government should strengthen health care services in the state. The CPI (M) has claimed that implementing a complete lockdown in the state will not be rational and practical as it will further damage the economy. The party suggested that the restrictions must be implemented only in containment zones.The CPI (M) has claimed that re-imposing the lockdown will increase financial burden on small businesses and daily wagers, leading to chaos and dissatisfaction among people. CPI(M) state secretary Onkar Shad said the lockdown will also have a bad effect on the apple season which has just started and that the state government should prepare a comprehensive action plan for it.He said the state government has not provided any financial relief or assessed the losses caused to vegetable and flower growers during the season and instead has increased the burden by hiking bus fare, LPG gas, petrol and diesel prices.He added that the state government has even failed to prevent arbitrary fees charged by private schools. The CPI (M) has asked the state government to immediately convene an all party meeting to seek suggestions to tackle the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/strengthen-healthcare-services-instead-of-imposing-lockdown-cpi-m-to-hp-govt/story-Ejvn32g4otw6fHXSrNIsQM.html

Officers say that this shows that no lessons have been learn from last year’s disaster, when 100 villages had been hit by the floods. Farmers were the worst-hit due to poor maintenance of embankments, with locals even blaming illegal mining for adding to their woes. A senior administration officer said last year, floods had affected 1 lakh persons, of which around 60% were farmers. He added that the government had provided compensation worth Rs 33 crore to locals, as the district administration estimated that 60,000 acre crop was damaged in Jalandhar. This year, officials had demanded Rs 16 crore for Jalandhar and the remaining for Nawanshahr. “Due to shortage of funds, repair has not been done properly and material needed not used for several years,” said a government officer on the request of anonymity. According to the proposed project, sensitive points along the river including Lasara, Meonwal, Mau Sahib, Ismailpur, Jania, Butta ke Shanna village, Shole village, Raipur Ghujja village were where embankments needed to be strengthened. “The department has spent Rs 80 lakh in Nawanshahr to strengthen some bandhs by sand and stones alongside the river near Tajowal village. The remaining money has been used in Phillaur, Shahkot and Nakodar sub-divisions,” Vijay Kumar Garg, executive engineer and Phagwara drainage division officer, said. Manjinder Singh, a farmer of Mau Sahib village, who lost his two-acre crop last year, claimed, “The state government must allocate proper money for strengthening of crops, or a common man like us suffers. Last year, the government proved it did not care.” Last year, water had taken the longest to recede in Shahkot villages. This area alone had seen 25,000 acre of paddy fields completely submerged, with substantial damage at Phillaur and Gidderpindi villages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jalandhar-nawanshahr-seek-rs-36-cr-for-flood-control-state-gives-only-rs-3-cr/story-3ye3vcgU9XWoS3ixRfMY1N.html

29-07-2020||Pune||Visually impaired thread path to self-sufficiency creating rakhis in Pune||For 12 visually impaired men and women and 70 others, inserting pearls in fancy threads to make rakhis is a prized skill they possess. For the last 10 years, the group has been making attractive rakhis for the Aastha rakhi centre in Chinchwad. All the rakhis at the centre are made by visually impaired and needy women. All products made in India are used for making rakhis and the shipment is transported across Maharashtra and major cities like Hyderabad. With the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic – the sales of rakhis are down by 50 per cent with the lockdown imposed for the past three months, however, the visually impaired have not stopped working. Raksha Bandhan that celebrates the brother-sister bond will be celebrated on August 3 this year. “We had given raw materials to make rakhis at their home to continue working in the lockdown. Our work was not disrupted in the lockdown since all these are handmade rakhis and all the visually impaired and domestic workers who work for our firm have a lot of creativity,” said Seema Kunkulol, managing director of Aastha rakhi centre, Chinchwad. The visually impaired begin by making boxes at the centre and slowly they have been taught how to make rakhis. “The visually impaired are blessed with sharp senses and memory, one needs to only teach them once on how a rakhi is made and after that they work with complete ease,” said Kunkulol. “The purpose of giving these people work was to give them job opportunities. For social causes, we run eye donation campaigns. Our motto is to promote eye donation,” Kunkulol added. Santosh Raut who has been working for seven years with Aastha rakhi centre is happy to handle the art and creativity for the rakhis, which are tied on a brother’s wrist on Raksha Bandhan. “In our group, few are college-going students while others are housewives who need to look after family work as well. Once we learn it, it is not difficult,” said Raut, who is also the general secretary of Maharashtra Drustihit Kalyani Sangh. All the visually impaired workers who are working with the rakhi centre are firm on earning money by working and not by charity. “We don’t want donations from people and instead we are looking for jobs. Visually impaired can excel in every sector if given proper opportunity,” added Raut. The 12 visually impaired began making rakhis in the month of November and their work schedule is 9am-9pm at the workshop. “Working at the rakhi centre supports us financially. I hope we can get more people who can support the visually impaired,” added Raut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/visually-impaired-thread-path-to-self-sufficiency-creating-rakhis-in-pune/story-bOHVd4dhm0vqTVG4C2RHYN.html

It’s a proud day for every Indian but even more special for Ambala residents as Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria received the fighter jets of the first Rafale squadron arriving from France via Abu Dhabi around 3pm. Once the five aircraft land in Ambala, the pilots led by 17 Golden Arrows Squadron commanding officer Group Captain Harkirat Singh, met the Air Chief and briefed him about their flying and training in France. The formal induction ceremony of the aircraft would be held later. VIGIL UP ON THE GROUNDMunish Sehgal, DSP (Traffic), Ambala, said the administration is on a high alert and the gathering of people on roofs and photography during landing has been strictly prohibited, particularly in Dhulkot, Baldev Nagar, Garnala and Panjkora villages adjoining the air base.DSP Ram Kumar said that the Ambala Cantt area has been made a ‘no-drone area’ as it is a sensitive zone.

Police made announcements and informed local residents not to gather on roofs or engage in photography between 10am and 5pm on Wednesday. Barricades were put up 3km from the air base and Section 144, which prohibits the assembly of four or more people, was imposed. The media was also kept at a distance. Residents organised a hawan (prayer) at a temple near the air base to welcome the Rafale combat aircraft in Ambala. “According to Hindu tradition, every holy task is initiated with a hawan, so we prayed for the successful landing of the aircraft,” Viresh Shandilya, a local resident, said.ONE OF THE OLDEST AIR BASES THAT WAS ATTACKED IN ‘65, ‘71 WARSThe Rafale fighter jets will be part of one of India’s oldest and strategic air bases in Ambala.

29-07-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The return of Pappu summary||He’s shining bright.Pappu is wearing trousers whose bright shade is difficult to determine—is it some sort of brown or mustard colour, or brownish-mustard, or something else entirely. Doesn’t matter. The pants are very attractive but they are outshone by his fluorescent orange shirt printed with the title of a Hindi film rap song—Apna time aayega (My time will come). The sleeves have “TikTok TikTok” running along their length.“These are new clothes, I bought them just yesterday,” he says, blushing. The only old thing he’s wearing is his checked gamchha, that he has stylishly knotted about his pants like a loose belt.Pappu is a daily-wage labourer and this morning he is walking through a central Delhi market, on his way to a building contractor who owes him ₹4,000.“And there’s another person in Gurgaon who has to pay me ₹5,000 for the work I did some months ago. I’ll have to go there later this week.”In the pre-corona days too, builders and contractors would occasionally delay paying their workforce, Pappu informs. “But this tendency has recently started to become more common.” He blames it on the extraordinary situation triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. “There is less money in the market, haalaat (conditions) are not good, and contractors don’t have much cash at hand.”Whatever, he is refusing to be patient any longer—“I’ll soon be leaving for home.” Pappu reveals his plan with a big smile, referring to his native place in Madhya Pradesh. In his late 20s, he has been in Delhi for about a decade “but it’s tough to find work these days... so I’m going back to my village.”Pappu’s family includes his father, and his brother and sister-in-law. “I got the new clothes because I want to look nice when I meet my people.”He shopped for them the day before in Sadar Bazaar. “The pants came for ₹200 and the shirt was more expensive, at ₹250.” The last time he had bought new pant-shirt was two months ago “but they are in tattered condition... I was using them as my work clothes.”Pappu doesn’t plan to spoil the new dress, and is putting it on just for today “for masti (fun)”. He will wear them next only for his journey home though he isn’t sure of the exact date of the return. “It will be as soon as I get all my dues.” He plans to stay in the village for the next few months, working in his family’s agricultural field. “We get enough produce from our land to feed ourselves well.”If so, why has he been living in smoggy Delhi, working as a labourer and sleeping on the pavement?Pappu’s face becomes sombre, maybe he is gathering his thoughts. “A family can live for generations in the same village, following the same line of work… but if even just one family member goes to a city for work, then other younger people in the family get the opportunity to do something else.”But now Pappu really has to hurry to meet the contractor. He excuses himself and merges into the street crowd ahead, his dress keeping him identifiable for a long time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-return-of-pappu-summary/story-rYh1KmATtXQUHr4WNIoUKP.html
29-07-2020||Chandigarh||Additional 25,000 MT waste to be dumped at Dadumajra site in Chandigarh||Even as waste processing at the Dadumajra dumping site is yet to pick up speed, the municipal corporation is now planning to dump an additional 25,000 metric tonnes (MT) of legacy waste here.Legacy wastes are the wastes that have been collected and kept for years at some barren land or a place dedicated for landfill (an area to dump solid waste).The MC took over the plant from Jaypee group on June 19 and has been running it since. The MC had signed an agreement with Jaypee in 2005 for setting up a garbage processing plant, but in February this year, the MC General House had ordered a takeover because it observed that the plant was not being operated to its optimum capacity.In the aftermath of that decision, the MC officials now say that 25,000 MT waste will be dumped at the plant. “The shifting of the dumped legacy waste has to be done so that the waste processing plant could be run properly. We will shift the legacy waste to the dumping site in phases so that it will not burden the removal process,” said a senior MC official. Nearly 5 lakh MT legacy waste is being processed at the dumping site.In addition to legacy waste, the MC is also planning to remove large quantities of compost and refuse-derived fuel (RDF) from the plant. “It is harming the processing of waste at the plant because of paucity of space,” the official said.The compost and RDF, for immediately clearing it, will be sold at the rates at which the company was earlier selling it. Meanwhile, revised rates will be decided and sold through e-auction. “There are also plans to sell compost generated at the plant itself and also at a counter at MC office in Sector 17. MC’s horticulture wing will also use it. MC is also exploring the option of home delivery,” added the official.The MC will also get repaired all the machinery at the plant for effective functioning. The plant was set up in 2008 to process 500 tonnes of garbage per day, but was only processing 100 MT per day.As per the recommendations made by the National Institute of Technical Teachers Training and Research (NITTTR), the municipal solid waste processing facility requires a complete replacement of the machinery with new technology for operating efficiently.The NITTTR report submitted with the MC commissioner blamed the poor maintenance of the plant for its present condition. The MC plans for improving the plant’s working will be taken up in the July 30 MC General House meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/additional-25-000-mt-waste-to-be-dumped-at-dadumajra-site-in-chandigarh/story-niXnXwF4y6QEe17lHWUvHK.html

Sabharal had sought inquiry into the construction of roads/streets in I-block of BRS Nagar; Mohalla Guru Gobind Singh Nagar and Basant Nagar main road; Bharat Nagar chowk to Session chowk; installation of interlocking tiles in Punjabi Bagh area; Satkar Nagar, Moti Bagh and New Ramesh Nagar in ward number 8; Kot Mangal Singh and Gurpal Nagar in ward number 71; overlock road in ward 51; Lodhi Enclave in ward 58; Madhopuri; streets of ward number 53; Mohalla New Subhash Nagar in ward number 5; and Prem Vihar in ward number 4. As per the MC officials, as many as 17 samples were collected to check the quality of recently carpeted roads. Seven samples collected from Amantran Colony, Guru Vihar, Chander Nagar, Bal Singh Nagar Road, Ashok Nagar, Daba Road and a road near GNE College (towards Dugri) failed the test.Earlier the samples collected from a stretch near RK Road, Circular Road near Daresi Ground and Baba Mukand Singh Nagar had also failed the test. Samples of interlocking tiles collected from Sewakpura area had also failed the test. In the month of June, too, VB had asked the local bodies department to act on a complaint filed by the RTI activist in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/vigilance-bureau-seeks-action-on-report-over-substandard-construction-of-roads-in-ludhiana/story-R16Fj7nArXTD40n4YqQGAP.html
29-07-2020||Chandigarh||Dera Baba Nanak ‘giant’ Princepal Singh makes it to NBA G-league||Five years back, Princepal Singh had no idea about basketball. His only exposure to the sporting world was confined to volleyball --- as it’s quite popular at his native place Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur --- and athletics. But it was his towering persona (six feet five inches) that changed his destiny at the age of 14. Now 19, and standing six feet 10 inches tall, he is the new poster boy of the Indian basketball. A product of Ludhiana Basketball Academy, Princepal has signed to play in the NBA G-league, the National Basketball Association’s official minor league in 2020-21. He will train and compete alongside the new G League team featuring elite youth prospects. “We are thrilled to be able to offer Princepal the opportunity to begin his professional basketball journey in the NBA G-league,” said Shareef Abdur-Rahim, league president, on Tuesday. “It’s a dream come true. For the last three years, I was really training hard for this day. My ultimate aim is to play in the main NBA league. G-league will serve as a platform for me to make it to the biggest league of the sport,” says Princepal. “The Ludhiana Basketball Academy groomed me as a player and later my selection at the NBA Global academy in Australia (in 2018) helped me to prepare for the bigger leagues,” he adds. Princepal was first spotted by Punjab politician Lakhbir Singh Lodhinangal, who got the boy enrolled into the Ludhiana Basketball Academy. “I had no clue about the game. Coach Jaipal took me under his wings and that changed everything,” says Princepal, whose father is a cashier in the power department. “I’m thankful to my family members as they extended all their support and motivated me to pursue my career in sports,” adds Princepal who passed the 12th board exams with 65 % marks this year. Princepal was first picked in the Under-16 Indian team in 2017. After Satnam Singh Bhamara and Amjyot Singh, Princepal is the third Indian to play in the NBA G-league. All three are the products of the Ludhiana Basketball Academy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dera-baba-nanak-giant-princepal-singh-makes-it-to-nba-g-league/story-NFmhrGLaJEUrfzVOd28chK.html
29-07-2020||Mumbai||Disclosing names of Covid-19 patients puts them at risk of victimisation: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday observed that there was a risk of ostracising Covid-19 patients if their names were disclosed, as demanded by two public interest litigants.“What purpose will be served by disclosing the names?” asked the bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Sarang Kotwal, during the course of hearing on the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by law student Vaishnavi Gholave and farmer Mahesh Gadekar.In the PIL filed through advocate Vinod Sangvikar, the two petitioners contended that on several occasions, Covid-19 patients are unable to recognise and give complete information about the people they had come in contact with. This, they said, makes contact tracing an arduous task, and many possible cases fall through the cracks.The litigants cited the example of a Covid-positive meat seller from Muraji Peth in Solapur who had come in contact with around 1,000 people.“However, the meat seller didn’t know all his customers’ names or their whereabouts,” the plea stated.It added that since there are about 25 meat sellers in Muraji Peth, and since the name of the infected meat seller was not disclosed, people did not know whether they had exposed themselves to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19.The plea expressed concerns about the growing risk of community transmission, and argued that it is necessary to disclose the names of Covid-19 patients in a bid to make contact tracing easier and improve the chances of early detection.The PIL cited that Maharashtra has been reporting a surge in Covid-19 positive cases even though the state government is maintaining that community transmission has not occurred yet.Arguing on behalf of the central government, additional solicitor general Anil Singh opposed the PIL. He pointed out that four high courts have already dismissed similar petitions, and therefore the HC should not entertain the PIL.The bench, however, posted the PIL for further hearing on Friday after Sangvikar sought time to go through the judgments. The court said that it was more important to practice personal safety. “Try to avoid congregations, wear face masks and head shields... This is what is advocated to stay safe from the infection,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/disclosing-names-of-covid-19-patients-puts-them-at-risk-of-victimisation-hc/story-LEzFfBLwi8voSXa7UOYeCP.html
29-07-2020||Mumbai||State differs monsoon session of Maharashtra legislature to September 7||The monsoon session of the Maharashtra legislature has been postponed once again for more than a month. It is now expected to start on September 7. The decision was taken in a meeting of the business advisory committee (BAC) of the state legislature on Tuesday.The session was supposed to start from August 3 as decided in the previous BAC meeting held on June 10.BAC, which comprises chairman of the legislative Council Ramraje Naik Nimbalkar, speaker of the Assembly Nana Patole, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and leaders of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis and Pravin Darekar, decided to postpone the session by five weeks.“Considering the Covid-19 situation, the committee decided to postpone the session until September 7. Other details such as the period of the session, etc, have not yet to be finalised,” said Anil Parab, state parliamentary affairs minister, following the meeting.Generally, the monsoon session is held for two to three weeks, but this time, it would depend on the pandemic situation in the state. “Other details will be decided in another BAC meeting likely to be called eight to 10 days before the session begins,” said an official from the state legislature.This is the second time the session has been postponed. It was scheduled to start on June 22 but was postponed to August 3 owing to the lockdown restrictions.As an alternative, the state also has plans to conduct the session online, for which demonstrations from firms such as Cisco, Google, Microsoft, Blue Jeans, and Alcatel that provide videoconference platforms, have been taken. With the facility in place, legislators will not have to participate physically and can attend the proceedings through their computers and smartphones.“The BAC is yet to decide on holding the session online,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-differs-monsoon-session-of-maharashtra-legislature-to-september-7/story-rySpdVTo0CxjUHKDOLFLqI.html
29-07-2020||Mumbai||57% from slums in 3 wards have Covid-19 antibodies, finds BMC’s sero survey||A total of 57% individuals from slums and 16% from other residential areas in three wards were exposed to Sars-CoV-2 and recovered silently owing to the antibodies produced, the sero survey conducted by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, as part of the national study to understand the spread, has found. Individuals in both these groups were asymptomatic. “Overall, we have observed that 40% of those surveyed, in both slums and residential areas, were infected with Covid-19, but recovered. None of those tested for sero survey had to undergo RT-PCR test, as they were asymptomatic,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. “The prevalence of the virus in slums is high due to densely populated areas. In non-slums (residential areas), better social distancing and maintenance of hygiene helped stop the spread to a large number of people,” said Kakani.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageOn July 3, the civic body, in collaboration with NITI-Aayog and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, started sero surveillance, in which a group of individuals undergo blood tests to detect the presence of Immunoglobulin-G (IgG) antibodies. IgG antibodies are produced by the body’s immune system on being exposed to a virus. A sero survey helps identify individuals who were previously infected with the virus and have now recovered. Although the estimated target was 10,000 blood samples, the ongoing monsoon restricted the collection process to 6,936 samples, said a health officer from BMC. The civic body has also run an antibody test on 1,000 health workers, results of which are pending. Also read | ‘Major relief after 3 months’: Aaditya Thackeray shares good news on Mumbai’s Covid-19 situationBMC officials believe the infection fatality rate (IFR) is likely to be low, between 0.05% and 0.10%. The civic body did not divulge the estimated prevalence of infection. IFR is the ratio of the number of deaths that occur from a disease in the total number of infected people. It is lower than CFR, which considers only confirmed cases (see box). “Results of the sero surveillance are promising because it shows that a large number of people have recovered from the virus with the help of their own immunity,” said Dr Om Srivastava, epidemiologist and member of the state’s Covid task force. The results will be re-evaluated later to learn about development of herd immunity, when a large portion of a community (the herd) becomes immune to a disease, controlling its transmission and spread. “Although it is still unclear what level of prevalence leads to herd immunity, our findings indicate that at least in slums, this could be attained sooner than later, if the immunity exists and persists in a significant proportion of the population,” read the interpretations of BMC. Dr Srivastava overruled the possibility, as the antibodies produced in the body are not permanent. “Antibodies stay in the body from four weeks to a few months depending on the infection. Depending on single data set, we can’t say that we have reached herd immunity. It is not a representative sample to come to any scientific conclusion,” he said. While 60% patients diagnosed with Covid-19 have been male, the survey revealed a greater number of women than men were exposed to the virus and recovered. The civic body did not share data on the proportion of male-female samples. “It is a known fact that women have stronger immunity than men. This helps them to fight the virus better. Most women don’t even develop symptoms to get identified with the virus,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer, BMC. BMC will conduct another sero surveillance next month in the same three wards for a comparative study to gauge the spread of Covid-19 infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/57-from-slums-in-3-wards-have-covid-antibodies-finds-bmc-s-sero-survey/story-sRkB0x9dJN4GkoMr0jDGaM.html
29-07-2020||Mumbai||Can’t shift control of Sarthi without Congress leader’s approval: Ashok Chavan||The Congress party in Maharashtra has raised objections over the government’s decision to divest control of Sarthi (Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research, Training and Human Development Institute) – the institute established for educational, social and financial development of the community – from the Bahujan Kalyan department which is headed by Congress leader Vijay Wadettiwar. After leaders from the Maratha community demanded increase in funding and autonomy for Sarthi, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had two weeks ago announced that the body would be under the planning department, headed by him. “The structure of power-sharing among the three parties was finalised while forming the government eight months ago. Accordingly, Sarthi’s administration is under the department headed by Vijay Wadettiwar. Divesting the power is the decision to be taken by the chief minister (CM) in consultation with the party involved. Though Wadettiwar had admitted the shift of control of Sarthi, we expect the issue to be discussed with Congress’s legislative party leader Balasaheb Thorat before any such decision is made,” said Congress leader Ashok Chavan.The party had earlier objected to the formation of an infrastructure board in Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), which is part of the public works department (PWD), headed by Chavan. Incidentally, the corporation is under the charge of Shiv Sena minister Eknath Shinde.Chavan had raised objections to the formation of a separate board for the implementation of infrastructure projects under MSRDC. “We had issues with officers moving proposals without knowledge of the minister of the department. Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) Chhagan Bhujbal too had raised dissent over such a move in the past. We have discussed these issues with the CM and with the change in guards in the chief secretary’s office, these issues will be sorted out now,” he said.These are not very big issues and the CM is capable of resolving them. There are instances when the CM had generously given a couple of portfolios from Sena’s quota to alliance partners during the formation of the government,” said a senior Sena functionary. Sanjay Tatkare, NCP spokesperson, said, “There is a coordination committee of senior leaders from all three ruling parties. Ashok Chavan is part of it. These issues are sorted out amicably by the committee.”Chavan, who addressed a press conference on Tuesday, said that state government has represented the Maratha community in the reservation case during hearings in the Supreme Court (SC) with full strength.Referring to the leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis’s criticism of the government’s submission before the Apex court, Chavan said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is spreading lies related to the Maratha reservation case, to mislead the community. “SC has asked us to maintain the status quo over the recruitments till further orders are passed. This does not mean that it is a stay on the reservation. The status quo on recruitment was maintained during the Fadanvis government too in Dec 2018, on the orders of the Bombay high court,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/can-t-shift-control-of-sarthi-without-congress-leader-s-approval-ashok-chavan/story-phexwjcXs9439R7j16LrTL.html
29-07-2020||Mumbai||Only statutory dues can be deducted from accident claims: Bombay HC||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) last week observed that no other amount except statutory dues are allowed to be deducted while computing the compensation for motor accident claims. “It is well-settled that except the statutory deduction to be made towards income tax, professional tax, no other deduction is permissible under law. The deduction from salary of the deceased towards insurance, pensionary benefits, gratuity or grant of employment to kin of deceased is not permissible,” said justice VL Achliya, while hearing an appeal filed by an Ahmednagar resident. The appellant had challenged an order passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ahmednagar, in December 2011, granting only ₹9-lakh compensation to her and her aged in-laws on the account of her husband’s death in an accident. The appellant claimed that the accident took place on June 2, 2007, barely three months after her marriage, while the couple was travelling from Pune to Ahmednagar. Her husband, a sepoy in Indian Army, was riding a bike, while she was seated pillion. When the couple reached near Kamargaon village, a state transport corporation bus hit their bike and the two-wheeler was thrown off the road. The woman’s husband died owing to a severe head injury, while she also sustained severe injuries. The woman later filed a motor accident claim, claiming compensation of ₹15.5 lakh from Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), which owned the bus. After the tribunal’s decision to compensate her with ₹9 lakh, she moved HC in 2012 seeking enhancement in compensation. Her counsel pointed out that the tribunal had wrongly deducted the amount of pension being received by the appellant from her claim, and this reduced the amount of compensation to be received by her. HC accepted the argument presented by the woman’s counsel. Justice Achliya found that the assessment of compensation made by the tribunal was against the settled position in law, and held that the woman was entitled to ₹23.52 lakh as compensation, of which 50% will be paid to her, while the remaining half to her parents-in-law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/only-statutory-dues-can-be-deducted-from-accident-claims-bombay-hc/story-rodX8LZAk5xyJhFDwqiw7I.html

Raj said that the bills issued by various power companies such as BEST (Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport) and Mahavitaran (Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited) as well as private entities have shocked the consumers, who are facing the brunt of the Covid-19 outbreak. “This tantamounts to looting of citizens. Due to the lockdown, commercial places were closed and yet the bills issued for them are exorbitant. As it is this lockdown has drained the economy and many businesses have shut down. Salaries are either not given or there are huge pay cuts. People have lost their jobs, and in such an atmosphere of turbulence, where there is no ray of hope in sight, these unreasonable bills are a further attack on the vulnerable citizens,” said Raj Thackeray in his letter to his cousin.The letter is seen as the warning as despite its depleted strength, the MNS still holds relevance in some urban pockets. Raj Thackeray is also seen to be raking in the issue to garner the support of citizens who are infuriated owing to the exorbitant bills.“The state should issue an order regarding this issue to Mahavitaran and BEST and other government undertakings. Also, private electric companies need to be firmly directed to stop this unjustified conduct, otherwise we will be compelled to deal with them,” he warned in the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/waive-off-unjustified-power-bills-or-mns-will-be-forced-to-intervene-raj-thackeray-tells-cousin-and-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray/story-XaflSlufU5oNJM1wjngUAP.html

Located opposite Brihanmumbai Municipal corporation (BMC) headquarters Cannon pav bhaji joint is popular among the tourists and foodies.In his complaint to Azad Maidan police, the owner PN Dandekar, a resident of Haj House area, said that three days ago he received a call from a person informing him about the theft at his store.When Dandekar visited the store, which has been shut since March due to lockdown, he found that someone had entered the store from a rare side of the store by breaking the grills. When HT contacted Dandekar, he did not respond to calls.According to the police, a preliminary probe revealed that two suspects had brought a tempo and stole 80kg, butter, 20kg cheese, sugar bags and utensils worth ₹1 lakh from the store.During an inquiry, names of two local pavement dwellers cropped up, following which Santosh Thapa, 20, and Karan Jadhav, 25, were arrested on Sunday.“The two are local footpath dwellers and sell scrap for a living. They told us that due to lockdown they had no work and food.

29-07-2020||Mumbai||200 PG seats in government medical, dental colleges may go vacant: Experts||After months of delay, the state common entrance test (CET) cell on Sunday night, released the second and final mop-up round seat allotment list for postgraduate (PG) medical and dental students. However, the educational experts are now worried that at least 200 seats in the state government colleges are likely to go vacant due to the delay.The experts believe that many applicants confirmed their seats in colleges in other states because of the delay in conducting admissions for PG seats in Maharashtra. “This year, of the total 1,170 seats in the government colleges, around 200 seats are likely to go vacant in the state. Every year, 50-60 seats in PG medical seats go vacant. While the private institutes can allot these seats after common admissions process ends, government colleges are left with vacant seats. At a time when we need doctors, the least CET cell could have done was tweak the rules, keeping Covid-19 situation in mind,” said Muzaffar Khan, a Thane-based medical education counsellor.Moreover, these students were not allowed to withdraw their applications through Maharashtra common admission rounds, therefore, names of many students that appeared in the final mop-up round, were of students whose admissions have already been confirmed elsewhere.“Registrations for PG medical and dental admissions in Maharashtra started in March, but the seat allotment started only in May. By then many students opted for seats through the all India quota (AIQ) or other quotas in different states and secured admissions. Now towards the end of the process, the CET cell has not allowed any student’s request to withdraw from the admissions process and our names have once again appeared on the list,” said an applicant on condition of anonymity. She added that several students had also approached the CET cell asking for an exception to be made considering the circumstances this year, but received no response in return.Registrations to postgraduate medical courses started in March, but with growing cases of Covid-19 and the eventual nation-wide lockdown, the Medical Council of India, in its circular in March had clarified that while online registrations have ended, aspirants could finish the form filling process online, till March 26. However, the first merit list which was originally scheduled to be released on April 4 could not be released until the May end.“This was an unnecessary round because most students have already confirmed admissions in other states. They have also informed the CET cell about the same. Now these students fear a fine from the government, and as per rule, if a student does not accept a seat allotted in CET rounds, s/he is liable to pay as much as ₹20 lakh to the government,” added Khan. State CET cell commissioner Sandeep Kadam told HT that even though students had approached the cell to remove their names from the admissions process, the same was not possible. “As per rules, applicants cannot withdraw their names from the admissions process before the mop-up round begins,” said Kadam. However, he refused to divulge any details on how many such names have been allotted seats on the final round.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/200-pg-seats-in-government-medical-dental-colleges-may-go-vacant-experts/story-gRzt1UDXvqXPfziOkbZeTN.html

The community, because of its visible identity, has had to face routine injustice and has been targeted for their distinct appearance,” United Sikh said in a statement.“These instances have especially been prevalent recently due to the racial animus and economic uncertainty which has gripped the nation,” it addedIn a recent incident, the United Sikh said that Singh was a “victim of hate language” sprayed across his car on July 25.“Alarmingly, he was targeted at his home as assailants vandalised his personal vehicle with a racist message in an effort to intimidate and ostracise him.

29-07-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC rejects GN Saibaba’s plea for temporary bail||The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court on Tuesday rejected application filed by Gokalkonda Naga Saibaba, former Delhi University professor, who is serving a life sentence for his links with Maoists, seeking temporary bail for 45 days. In March 2017, a special court has convicted Saibaba under sections 13 and 18 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 for his Maoists links, and sentenced him to life imprisonment.He had filed an application seeking temporary bail primarily in view of the spread of Covid-19 pandemic in Nagpur central prison where he is presently lodged, and mainly on the ground of his deteriorating health.It was argued on his behalf that the former DU professor suffers from various ailments which can be termed as co-morbidities and due to initiation of the lockdown the applicant was unable to receive various medicines which were being supplied by his family members and well-wishers.In the light of the fact that staff in the jail, as well as some inmates, had tested positive for Covid-19, there was every likelihood of Saibaba getting infected, his lawyer added and urged HC to grant him temporary bail considering his medical condition and also the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic in the jail.The application was opposed by a special prosecutor appearing for the state. He pointed out that all care and due precautions were being taken by the jail authorities in the light of the spread of Covid-19. He added that Saibaba has been placed in a high-security cell in a separate wing, the inmates of which are not allowed to mix with other inmates. Besides, he added that Saibaba was tested for COVID-19 infection and his test results were negative.The bench of justice AS Chandurkar and justice Amit Borkar accepted the prosecutor’s contention.“Though the applicant suffers from various ailments, in the light of the fact that he has been kept in a separate high security cell and there is no contact or communication between the inmates of the wing in which he is kept with the inmates of the other wings, we do not find any ground made out to release the applicant on temporary bail due to outbreak of the pandemic,” they said while rejecting the former DU professor’s plea for temporary bail.The bench said while arriving at the conclusion it also took into consideration the nature of accusations against Saibaba, his conviction by the sessions court and rejection of his application for suspension of sentence by HC in March 2019.As regards the claim of worsening condition of the convict, the bench said nothing was brought on record except listing the purported ailments which the former DU professor suffered from.HC has, however, directed the jail authorities to expeditiously decide his fresh application for parole leave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-rejects-gn-saibaba-s-plea-for-temporary-bail/story-ELdWAk7m4JyLfwUA3yQIIO.html

The incident came to light on July 23 after the 16-year-old survivor experienced stomach pain and was taken for a check-up. The doctor told her parents that the girl was pregnant. Her parents called the police and informed them that their daughter was sexually assaulted by an unknown person. “The girl told us that her uncle used to visit her house often. We then questioned the accused and he revealed the truth,” said an officer from Ghatkopar police station. The police again spoke to the girl and she said that her uncle sexually assaulted her between March 7 and 16, when her parents were not at home. He also threatened her, owing to which she did not tell anyone about the incident. Following the victim’s complaint, the police registered an offence for rape under Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sexual assault and sexual harassment of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/33-year-old-mumbai-man-arrested-for-sexually-assaulting-niece-impregnating-her/story-bIxj6nfUYTgbAvb7Cv8mQL.html
29-07-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai man sentenced to life imprisonment for killing wife||A 36-year-old man was sentenced to life imprisonment by a city civil and sessions court on Friday, for murdering his wife in January 2017. The convict Jayesh Mhadlekar, a resident of Mulund, was booked after his wife Shreya was found fatally injured inside their house. According to Mulund police, Mhadlekar had married Shreya in 2003, but because of his alcohol addiction, she chose to stay with her parents from 2015. On January 26, 2017, Mhadlekar went to Shreya’s house to bring her back but her family asked him to leave. He waited outside their building and when Shreya stepped out to go to work, Mhadlekar forcibly took her home. Shreya’s family was unable to contact her and when they called her office they were informed that she had not reported to work. Her mother then went to Mhadlekar’s house and found Shreya lying on the floor with head injuries. She was rushed to a nearby hospital where she was declared dead on arrival. A first information report (FIR) was registered at Mulund police station, and two days later, Mhadlekar was arrested. While contending the case, prosecutor Shulabha Joshi said that Mhadlekar used to beat his wife often. They pointed out that there were several criminal cases registered against him. The prosecution also contended that Mhadlekar used to suspect Shreya of having an affair and had threatened her former boss, alleging that he was involved with his wife.Mhadlekar, in his defence, claimed that he was not in the city, but had left for Hyderabad at the time of the murder. The court, however, rejected his defense as he failed to produce a ticket or proof of travel. Further, he was spotted outside Shreya’s house and another witness had also seen him with Shreya on his bike on the day of the murder.The court held Mhadlekar guilty for his wife’s murder based on circumstantial evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-man-sentenced-to-life-imprisonment-for-killing-wife/story-dNLTaMpCg1BVK8IpyaQnvI.html

29-07-2020||Mumbai||PMC Bank fraud case: Pre-arrest bail pleas of 2 directors rejected||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday dismissed the anticipatory bail applications filed by two directors of the Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank. After perusing investigation papers pertaining to the ₹7,457-crore PMC Bank fraud case, justice Sadhana Jadhav pronounced an operative order of rejecting the anticipatory bail pleas filed by Gurnam Singh Hothi and Daljit Singh Bal and observed that neither of the directors deserved the discretionary relief of pre-arrest bail. A detailed reasoning for the dismissal of the pleas is awaited.Hothi and Bal had moved HC after the sessions court rejected their anticipatory bail pleas. The sessions court granted them interim protection from arrest till June 15, which was extended by HC from time to time. But on Thursday, justice Jadhav also withdrew the interim protection, thus paving the way for the arrest of the two accused in the case.The economic offences wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police had on September 30 last year registered an offence in connection with the fraud at the multi-state scheduled cooperative bank, accusing many of its directors of illegally extending huge loans to realty firm Housing Development and Infrastructure Limited (HDIL) and its group companies.According to the Reserve Bank of India, PMC Bank had masked 44 problematic loan accounts involving advances worth ₹7,457.49 crore to some entities, including HDIL, by tampering with its core banking system and these accounts were accessible only to limited staff members.The bank had created 21,049 fictitious accounts in a bid to ensure that its master data tallies to the loan disbursals, the RBI stated in an affidavit filed in response to other PMC Bank-related petitions before HC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pmc-bank-fraud-case-pre-arrest-bail-pleas-of-2-directors-rejected/story-PEq1TEgJlHx4XHpIttoVOO.html
29-07-2020||Mumbai||University of Mumbai’s admission process for undergraduate courses is a nightmare: Students||The University of Mumbai’s (MU) online process for admissions to undergraduate (UG) courses is has become a nightmare for hundreds of aspirants, as the process is lengthy, time-consuming and expensive, students and parents have claimed. Over 2.25 lakh students had registered on the university portal until Tuesday evening.The university announced its schedule for the pre-admission online registration process on July 21. As per the earlier process, students had to take copies of pre-admission forms and submit them at colleges where they wanted to seek admissions, along with the admission forms. However, with the Covid-19 outbreak and the ensuing lockdown, the entire application process is being conducted online this year. While the move is aimed to benefit aspirants in the current situation, students and parents said that the move is far from achieving its goal. “The entire process is very tedious and not student-friendly. Students first have to fill a form for the university, which also includes filling individual college forms. Then the same process has to be repeated for every college on the college website. They then have to upload documents on the university portal for every college that they wish to apply in. All these steps involve taking prints, scanning them, uploading several documents and even after doing so much, there is still no clarity on several aspects,” said Vijay Patil, a parent from Thane. Several parents also complained about the ambiguity on programme names on the university’s website. “For an undergraduate commerce course, there are at least a dozen options, from autonomous to credit-based to specializations, which is very confusing for even educated parents, leave alone those whose children are first generation learners. Each college also has its own set of guidelines and documents and there is no uniformity. Students who are applying to multiple colleges take hours to fill each form,” said a parent from Goregaon. While the university has given a helpline number and an online chat-based option for queries, many students said they could not connect with either of the options. “I was constantly trying to call on the helpline number but it was busy throughout. When I tried writing my queries on the online chat box, I was asked to present my doubts between 10am and 6pm, though I had written to them during the stipulated time,” said Akash Gupta, an aspirant from Borivli. He added that many of his friends, who did not have a computer, are struggling to fill the forms as cyber cafes are shut in the city, owing to the lockdown. The university has not even provided previous years’ cut-offs, leaving students clueless about whether or not they can even get into a college of their choice. Ashok Wadia, the principal of Churchgate’s Jai Hind College, said the college received several queries from students about the admission process. “While we have given clear guidelines for our college form and made it simple, students did have some trouble with the university portal. Some college names were not appearing in the initial days and there was confusion about course names. Our staff has been helping students with the process,” he added. A senior official from MU said that the admission process might look tedious right now, but the purpose of uploading all the scanned documents with pre-admission registration, as well as at the form-filling process, is to ensure that the documents are easy to verify at the time of admission. “Since students will not be able to visit these colleges to submit documents, we are ensuring that every college the student applies to gets an easy access to the scanned documents,” said the official. Students can call on 020-66834821 or fill out a form on MU’s portal to get answers to their questions. THE PROCESS Students have to register themselves on MU’s portal and upload their documents, including photo, signature, certificates, mark sheets and proof of residence. After selecting a course from an exhaustive list, students have to mark the colleges in which they wish to apply. Then, an individual form for each of those colleges is generated and documents have to be uploaded for every application.Each of the forms have to be printed, signed by the student, scanned and then kept ready for uploading at the college-level forms.Students have to visit websites of individual colleges and repeat the whole process – fill information, upload documents including a university undertaking and then pay fees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/university-of-mumbai-s-admission-process-for-undergraduate-courses-is-a-nightmare-students/story-XqHTvGbHNLpgOewNnkUclK.html
29-07-2020||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: Sudha Bharadwaj getting access to proper health facilities in jail, NIA tells Bombay HC||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) opposed the interim bail plea of activist Sudha Bharadwaj, an accused in the Elgar Parishad case who is lodged at the Byculla women’s prison since 2018. Bharadwaj approached the Bombay high court (HC), appealing against the rejection of her interim bail plea by the special NIA court in May. Though she is booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act (UAPA), Bharadwaj sought interim bail on medical grounds in the light of the directions issued by the Supreme Court to decongest jails amid the Covid-19 outbreak. A division bench of justice RD Dhanuka and justice VG Bisht, while hearing Bharadwaj’s application, was informed by advocate Ragini Ahuja that though the application in HC was filed on June 11, it is not being heard. Ahuja further submitted that Bharadwaj suffered from some chronic ailments and was seeking a temporary bail owing to her comorbid condition and the fact that the Covid-19 infection had spread in some jails. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, who appeared on behalf of NIA, however, opposed the application and submitted that Bharadwaj was being provided proper health facilities in jail and that her condition was being monitored regularly. He also pointed out that the UAPA did not have a provision for bail. Singh further submitted that the jail authorities were complying with the court’s directions that were issued in other applications and said that he wished to place the judgments on record, which the court accepted. Singh said that he would submit the compilation by Thursday after which the court posted the matter for hearing on August 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-sudha-bharadwaj-getting-access-to-proper-health-facilities-in-jail-nia-tells-bombay-hc/story-5ftrIrQ2ftZzTBSSV2yIYI.html
29-07-2020||Mumbai||CM expected to travel across state, but Uddhav yet to start tours: Pawar||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday remarked that the chief minister (CM) is expected to tour different parts of the state and meet the people, but in the case of Uddhav Thackeray, he is yet to commence his visits. Pawar also said that as he keeps travelling, he is in fact more visible than the CM himself. The NCP leader made the statements during an interview with a Marathi news channel. “I don’t think that the CM is failing to take everyone into confidence. He speaks to everyone. But the only difference is that I’m more visible, as I keep travelling. He [Thackeray] doesn’t travel and works from one place,” Pawar replied when he was asked about the disputes within the three-party Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government based on claims of Thackeray not taking everyone into confidence. “Being head of the government, he [CM] is expected to monitor and function from one place, but it doesn’t mean that he should do so permanently. In between, he is also expected to tour the state after taking some time out from his schedule, meet people and take them into confidence, which [in this case] is yet to happen,” the veteran leader added. The remarks are opposite to the statement made by the former Union minister on Saturday, when he defended the CM for not visiting the other areas of the state amid the Covid-19 crisis. Pawar then said that the leaders urged the CM to oversee and monitor the functioning of his team from one place. He had also praised Thackeray and said that the CM is working day and night to tackle the Covid-19 outbreak as one-point agenda. Pawar has been visiting various districts and reviewing the preparations by local authorities, along with health minister Rajesh Tope, to contain the outbreak. On Saturday, he was in Aurangabad city to take stock of the situation and to launch the ‘Mission Zero—Aurangabad’ campaign to bring the death rate to zero in the city. On Friday, the 79-year old leader was at Nashik, while earlier that week on July 20, he was in Solapur district to review the measures taken to control the Covid-19 situation. Maharashtra has recorded the highest number of Covid-19 cases and deaths in the country. The surge in Covid-19 cases in the past few weeks in several cities and districts outside Mumbai has been a cause of concern for the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cm-expected-to-travel-across-state-but-uddhav-yet-to-start-tours-pawar/story-bK2hqugM4Nea7RfwymJQVK.html
29-07-2020||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: Vernon Gonsalves’s Covid report negative, yet to get Dr Anand Teltumbde’s result, Maharashtra government tells HC||The state has informed the Bombay high court (HC) that the Covid-19 report of Elgar Parishad accused, activist Vernon Gonsalves, has come negative, while the test result of another accused, Dr Anand Teltumbde, is awaited. Gonsalves had approached the court seeking for a test, as he had been in close contact with another accused in the case, P Varavara Rao, in Taloja jail. Rao was tested positive for the virus on July 16. Dr Teltumbde had sought the test as he was also lodged in the same jail hospital where Rao was undergoing treatment for other ailments before he was tested positive for Covid-19.A division bench of justice RD Dhanuka and justice VG Bisht, while hearing the application by Gonsalves and Dr Teltumbde, was informed by senior advocate Mihir Desai that though his clients had been tested for Covid-19, the jail authorities had not informed them or their families about the results. Desai said that it was only through media reports did they learn that Gonsalves was tested negative for Covid-19. Desai further submitted that though both the accused had been in touch with their families and lawyers through video-calling while at Taloja jail, they had not spoken to their families from the time their plea to be tested was complied with by the jail authorities. Hence, the authorities should be directed to facilitate the video calls.Responding to Desai, public prosecutor Deepak Thakare confirmed that Gonsalves had tested negative for Covid and his health was being monitored regularly, even as the authorities are yet to get Dr Teltumbde’s reports. The state has also assured the court that Gonsalves would be allowed to make video calls to his family. Thakare also sought time till Friday to know the outcome of Dr Teltumbde’s test results, which the court allowed and posted the matter for hearing after that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-vernon-gonsalves-s-covid-report-negative-yet-to-get-dr-anand-teltumbde-s-result-maharashtra-government-tells-hc/story-feVU4HqQVu9C8QDFHiUBAN.html
29-07-2020||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: Submit report on Varavara Rao’s health in 3 days, Bombay HC tells Nanavati Hospital||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday directed Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital to submit within three days a report on the health of 81-year-old Telugu poet P Varavara Rao, accused in the Elgar Parishad case and who was recently admitted to the hospital for Covid-19 treatment. Rao was shifted from Taloja Jail to a hospital earlier this month owing to his deteriorating health and he has been undergoing treatment in Mumbai hospitals since July 16 after testing positive for coronavirus. The court order was prompted after Rao’s family expressed concerns, as according to them, Rao was admitted to hospital in a critical condition and neither the jail nor hospital authorities were forthcoming on any information. The court has asked the hospital to submit the report in court itself and posted the matter for hearing on August 7. A division bench of justice R D Dhanuka and justice VG Bisht, while hearing the petition filed by Rao’s advocate, was informed by senior counsel Sudeep Pasbola that ever since Rao was shifted from Sir JJ Hospital to GT Hospital and finally to Nanavati Hospital at Vile Parle, the family was in the dark regarding his health condition. Rao had been shifted to Sir JJ Hospital from Taloja Jail after his health had deteriorated. After the Covid test on him at Sir JJ Hospital turned positive, he was shifted to GT Hospital, which is a Covid dedicated hospital. Though Rao’s Covid report said that he was asymptomatic, but due to other comorbidities when he suffered a head injury after falling off the hospital cot, he was rushed to Nanavati Hospital. Pasbola informed the court that since then the family was in the dark on his condition and hence the court should direct jail authorities to allow his family to see him. On behalf of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), additional solicitor general Anil Singh opposed the plea of Rao’s family, stating that as per ICMR guidelines, no one could go near a Covid patient, except the doctors and hospital staff treating him, hence the question of the family being able to meet Rao at Nanavati Hospital was not possible. Singh further submitted that as per the ICMR guidelines no information about the patient could be revealed to anyone till the patient fully recovered and hence the demand of the family to know the status could not be complied with. The jail authorities and the state, through public prosecutor Deepak Thakare, concurred with Singh and said that even personnel from the jail were not allowed to see Rao. Thakare, however, submitted that authorities did not have any problem if the hospital was asked to submit a report on the health condition of Rao and the line of treatment adopted by them after Rao was admitted there. Thakare suggested that the hospital could submit the report to the court and the court could then disclose it to the family. After hearing the submissions, the bench directed the hospital to submit a report on the two parameters within three days and said that after perusing the report, it would decide on whether the information could be shared with the family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-submit-report-on-varavara-rao-s-health-in-3-days-bombay-hc-tells-nanavati-hospital/story-NNQo9M8M3FxscFKTFq0eSO.html

The cut is admissible to state government employees of all groups.The decision, however, has invited flak from the employees, who have termed it a financial attack on them during the Covid-19 pandemic.The new mobile phone allowance package will be implemented from August 1, stated a notification issued by finance department deputy secretary Sangita.As per the amendment, the said monthly allowance has been fixed at ₹250 for group A employees, ₹175 for group B, ₹150 for groups C and D staff.Earlier, group A employees were entitled to ₹500, group B to ₹300, groups C and D to ₹250 per month.Democratic employees’ federation district president Parween Sharma said, “This is a financial attack by the state government on employees’ pockets. We are already spending large amounts on mobile bills from our own pockets to upload data entries.”“The finance department is seeing our cellphone allowance as a burden, but no such cuts have been announced for MLAs or ministers,” said Vikram Dev, a government teachers’ union leader.Meanwhile, SAD treasurer and spokesperson NK Sharma criticised the government for reducing the mobile phone allowance of its employees, terming it an attempt to fill the state’s empty coffers. The SAD-BJP government had started the allowance in 2011, but the Congress reduced it for all categories of employees, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-cuts-cellphone-allowance-by-50-faces-flak-from-staff/story-T0wfVmkt4lmKRRN81ZNfIK.html

Police have also booked the owner of a hotel who had organised tests for 59 foreign nationals but kept the civic authority in the dark about the escape of the Covid-positive patient.Police on Monday registered a first information report (FIR) based on the complaint of Dharamprakash Satish Kumar Kori, 31, a civic doctor from Tardeo.According to Kori’s complaint, on July 23, Rahim Turk, owner of Hotel Aga Begh in Apollo Port, called 59 foreign nationals to his hotel. The foreigners wanted to get themselves tested, and Turk helped them by calling the staff from a private lab to the hotel to conduct the tests. “The report of one Sudanese national Ahmed Hamid Ahmed Almeen, who was staying at Colaba’s Kishan Hotel, came positive following which he fled from the hotel,” said an officer from Colaba police station.Turk called a large number of people together for the tests without getting the requisite permission.

The state police are misusing the Act which needs to be stopped immediately,” he claimed.Sukhbir said the DGP was under the misapprehension that indoctrination turned youths into terrorists during a one-day visit to Kartarpur Sahib as stated earlier by him, urging the CM to give clear directions to the DGP that no Sikh youth should be picked up simply for seeing or forwarding some matter on social media. He said targeting Sikh youths in this manner would not only scar them for life but also have far-reaching consequences, including the propensity to spoil peace and harmony in the state.“We should be mindful of taking any step which can take Punjab back to the dark era,” he cautioned, announcing that SAD would fight all such cases of Sikh youths who were being falsely implicated. He said Punjabis were a patriotic community and there was no support whatsoever for Referendum 2020 or any other divisive agenda in the state.AAP TO MEET BADNORE ON ISSUEAam Aadmi Party (AAP) said on Tuesday that a delegation will meet Punjab governor VP Singh Badnore to highlight the “blatant violations of human rights” under the UAPA and the deteriorating law and order machinery in the state.In a statement here, AAP spokesperson and Kotkapura MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan said leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema has sought an audience with the governor. He said the AAP is against anti-social activities or any anti-social elements taking the law into their hands, but would not be a mute spectator to human rights violations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sukhbir-warns-cm-against-misuse-of-uapa-by-punjab-police/story-rKJvU0mCYXJNK8TOIgN8GP.html

Previously, the highest number of tests was on July 25 at 8,494, followed by 7,609 on July 24. Mumbai’s doubling rate is now 68 days.Mumbai’s municipal commissioner IS Chahal confirmed the development to Hindustan Times on Tuesday morning. He said, “Our testing figures have gone up to 8,776 tests in a single day on Monday, the highest so far.”Aaditya Thackeray, Maharashtra environment minister, on Tuesday tweeted, “The good news: Only 700 cases today in Mumbai & that too with highest testing till date in Mumbai in a single day (8776).This is chase the virus in full capacity. A major relief after 3 months. Caution: don’t let the guard down! Don’t let your mask down! Only get numbers down!”Thackeray also tweeted, “Mumbai will see more testing with chase the virus initiative of the @mybmc . It is also the only city to have liberalised testing and allowed citizens to “test at will”.”Mumbai liberalised its testing policy on July 7, permitting anyone to approach a laboratory and opt for a test, without a doctor’s prescription. Up to July 27, Mumbai has conducted 494,339 tests. This amounts to 38,004 tests per million. However, this is far less than Delhi, which has conducted 958,265 tests so far (according to BMC’s Covid-19 war room dashboard), amounting to 50,435 tests per million. Mumbai’s positivity percentage is 22.28%, a slight drop from the earlier 23.08%, recorded until last week. Mumbai has a recovery rate of 73%, case growth rate of 1.03% and a case fatality rate (CFR) of 5.5%.Dr Gautam Bhansali, senior city-based doctor, and chief co-ordinator of private hospitals of BMC said, “This is a very good trend for Mumbai. It looks like the curve has already flattened. For the past month if we see, [number of] daily cases have been similar, between 1,000 and 1,200. Now cases have further come down to 700. By August 1st week, curve will drop further. “Dharavi, once a Covid-19 hotspot, recorded three new cases, taking the total number of cases to 2,543. There are presently only 88 active cases in Dharavi. It’s doubling rate is now 258 and growth rate average of seven days is 0.37%. In Dharavi, in the past seven days, an average of nine cases per day was recorded. Since June 1, Dharavi’s Covid-19 situation has been on the road to recovery, with the curve flattening in June itself. On Monday, it recorded nine new cases, on Sunday, it recorded two, on Saturday 10, on Friday six and on Thursday, too, six cases were reported.

29-07-2020||City||₹1.65 lakh refunded to 33 patients after TMC sends notice to 4 hospitals||The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has sent notices to four privately-run hospitals for overcharging Covid-19 patients. A total of ₹1.65 lakh was refunded to 33 patients. Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner of TMC, said, “Four hospitals have collectively refunded ₹1.65 lakh to 33 patients over the last couple of days. One hospital has refunded ₹1,20,625 to nine patients, followed by ₹23, 250 refunded by another hospital.” Last week, TMC cancelled the registration and Covid license of one private hospital for overcharging. The civic body also sent notices to around 15 hospitals, also for overcharging, and demanded refunds for patients. On May 21, the Maharashtra government had passed a notification that capped treatment costs for Covid-19. TMC set up an audit committee on July 18 to look into complaints of overcharging. “In our audit we found that 40% to 48% of bills from each private hospital was more than the rates fixed by the government. From July 10-20, an additional amount of ₹27 lakh was overcharged from patients in various hospitals while ₹30 lakh was overcharged between July 20-25,” said an officer from the committee. Complaints of overcharging have also been filed to the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC), which on June 25 set up a flying squad. So far, it has received six complaints, of which one has been resolved with the complainant receiving a refund. The remaining cases are under investigation. As of July 23, KDMC has also appointed auditors at each privately-run Covid hospital. However, the Alert Citizens Forum (Jagruk Nagrik Manch) of Kalyan has asked KDMC to audit hospital bills from May 21 onwards. “The civic body has recently initiated the audit of bills from private hospitals although the notification was passed on May 21. We have come across several patients’ bills which are not as per the rates mentioned by the state. The civic body should do an audit of all the hospitals from May 21,” said Sreeniwas Ghanekar, founder of the forum. KDMC commissioner Vijay Suryavanshi said, “We have already appointed auditors for the 24 hospitals that treat Covid-19 patients. They will keep checking bills and helping patients. We cannot take up the audit for previous bills altogether now. What we can do is if there is a complaint on previous bills, we can get it audited.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1-65-lakh-refunded-to-33-patients-after-tmc-sends-notice-to-4-hospitals/story-jO6ZZqRcTlJH2R0T7fymIK.html
29-07-2020||Chandigarh||HC eases adoption norms for Hindu, Sikh NRIs||In a judgment which paves way for child adoption by Indian diaspora from the country, Punjab and Haryana high court has held that NRIs applying under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (HAMA)-1956 don’t have to undergo the rigorous process set under Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA).The high court bench of justice Jaishree Thakur also held that for adoption covered under the personal law — applicable to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains — within the country, the adoptee won’t even need the CARA certification. There is no personal law for adoption by Muslims.CARA is a statutory body for adoption of Indian children and is mandated to monitor and regulate in-country and inter-country adoptions. CARA was established under the Juvenile Justice Act (JJA)-2015 after the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. Under CARA, adoption can be made by person of any belief.The ruling was delivered in a plea wherein a two-year-old girl adopted by an NRI couple was denied passport. Born as one of the twins to a Jalandhar couple in 2017, she was adopted by her natural mother’s NRI sister as per Sikh rites performed at a local gurdwara for which a certificate was also issued. In November 2018, they signed an adoption deed under HAMA, following which the adoptive parents applied for the girl’s passport, but it was rejected by authorities stating that a no-objection certificate (NOC) from CARA was mandatory, said the family’s lawyer Sukhwinder Singh Nara.The court said Section 56 (3) of the JJA stipulates that the provisions of the law shall not apply to adoption of children under HAMA. The said adoption cannot be challenged on the ground that the same should have been made under JJA, which itself states that a valid adoption of a minor child under HAMA is irreversible and cannot be revoked, the bench said.The bench observed that JJA was formulated for protection of such children who are found to be in conflict with law or require rehabilitation and that its provisions can’t be invoked for adoption directly given by natural parents.The bench said the passport authorities could not have questioned the validity of the registered adoption deed in the application. To meet the requirement of passport authorities, CARA is simply required to issue an NOC, taking note of the fact that the adoption has been done under HAMA.The court has also directed CARA to issue an NOC within two weeks and the external affairs ministry to grant passport in another two weeks.“Adoption under the Hague convention is a tedious process and takes years. An applicant has to apply in their country and then after studies and various evaluations, matches are found. It takes almost two years and lakhs of rupees. This judgment helps those NRIs who have relatives in India and want to adopt from here,” said Anil Malhotra, who was amicus curiae in this case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-eases-adoption-norms-for-hindu-sikh-nris/story-x7u6UB2vSoz3FOSbmkRWaJ.html

29-07-2020||Chandigarh||Covid effect: Govt to switch gears, double ‘Apni Gaddi’ scheme subsidy||The Punjab government has decided to rejig its ‘Apni Gaddi Apna Rozgar’ scheme to create self-employment opportunities for jobless youth in the changed post-coronavirus market scenario in the state. The department of employment generation and training has set in motion the process to double the subsidy support and facilitate finance for two-wheelers and light commercial vehicles (LCVs) under the self-employment programme. A proposal has been sent to the finance department to increase the subsidy given to unemployed persons on purchase of vehicles from the existing 15% to 30%. The scheme was launched by the state government in January 2020. As per the scheme, the department of employment generation and training contributes 15% of the on-road price of the vehicle or Rs 75,000, whichever is less, for four-wheelers. In case of three-wheelers, the maximum subsidy was capped at Rs 50,000. The beneficiary is required to make a matching contribution of 15% and the balance 70% is funded by the Punjab State Cooperative Bank through a collateral-free loan. The department has also collaborated with leading ride-hailing companies Uber and Ola to help them get on the road quickly. Harpreet Singh Sudan, director, employment generation and training, said the scheme was started to help jobless persons purchase three-wheelers or four wheelers and collaborate with cab aggregators but the market scenario has changed due to the Covid-19 outbreak. “As the business of cab aggregators has been hit and new opportunities are emerging, the scope of the scheme is being expanded to provide subsidy on purchase of two-wheelers, LCVs and utility vehicles,” he said. The scheme was started in six districts, including Amritsar, Mohali, Ludhiana, Ropar and Patiala, on a pilot basis with an initial provision for subsidy of Rs 5 crore for 600 vehicles. However, it did not get the desired response and only 353 applications were received till June-end. “The Covid-19 pandemic was not the only dampener. There have been requests from several applicants, who belong to economically weaker families, for additional support because they find it difficult to contribute their share,” another official of the department said. The scheme was among a slew of job-oriented programmes – Harra (Green) Tractor Scheme and Yaari Enterprises being the other ones, announced by the Congress in its poll manifesto. The party had promised to provide 1 lakh taxis and light commercial vehicles per annum to jobless youth at subsidised rates without any collateral with the state government standing guarantee under it. The state government initially drew a plan to set aside a hefty sum of money and enter into an agreement with cab aggregators to help unemployed youth get taxis and LCVs on hire-purchase basis, but then abandoned for want for funds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-effect-govt-to-switch-gears-double-apni-gaddi-scheme-subsidy/story-zwsiHnwHv5PtJjzrpUIqRJ.html
29-07-2020||Gurugram||SOPs to restart medical tourism in Gurugram sent for approval||Several rounds of testing and strict isolation are some of the new rules that are likely to become operational for medical tourists seeking treatment in the city, if a new set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) are approved by the Central government. The medical value travel (MVT) companies, which promote medical tourism in Gurugram, along with Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), have submitted a set of comprehensive SOPs to the union ministries of commerce, civil aviation and health and family welfare that are supposed be followed by international patients, who come to India for surgeries and cancer treatments, which are offered at relatively cheaper prices. As international flights become incrementally operational, medical tourism companies are now working on the protocols to reopen the sector, which generates nearly Rs400 crore monthly in Delhi-NCR region, as per industry experts. “A set of SOPs have been prepared in consultation with the MVT companies and hospitals. The safety of people is of utmost importance in a pandemic situation but at the same time economic activity has to be resumed. FICCI has come out with the policy recommendations for medical tourism as many countries have started opening up their air services. However, the Central government will have to take the final call on the resumption of international flights and entry of foreign medical patients into the country,” said a senior representative of FICCI, privy to the matter.TESTING AND ISOLATIONAccording to the SOPs, hospitals will have to carefully select patients, especially avoiding those with serious co-morbidity issues. Both patients and the attendants will have to take the RT-PCR tests 48 hours prior to their scheduled flight. Only Covid-19 negative patients will be allowed to enter the country.On arrival, the patient will be reviewed for influenza-like illness (ILI) and respiratory infections at the airport. They will have to undergo RT-PCR and Covid-19 antibody tests, following which they will be quarantined. If found symptomatic, the patient will be directly shifted to the isolation ward of the hospital where he/she had to be admitted for the surgery or treatment. Hospitals will conduct the RT-PCR and if found negative then the patient will still have to wait for five to seven days, after which the antibody test will be conducted. If both the tests are negative by day 10, then the patient will be taken up for the planned health procedure, as per the SOPs. In case the patient is Covid-19 positive but asymptomatic, then they will have to be shifted to isolation units set up by hospitals in nearby hotels/guest houses. The final planned treatment of the patient can start once 14 days from the date of arrival is complete. Considering the international patient can be in a ‘carrier state’ even after being tested Covid-19 negative during the course of treatment, a final antibody test upon discharge would be conducted.THE COST FACTORTesting and isolation facilities will add up to the overall costs of medical treatment for such patients, said Amit Sharma, founder and CEO, Expedise Healthcare, an MVT company. “There is over 30% hike in the price package for surgeries and oncology treatment for foreign patients. The testing and isolation bed costs have also been added to the overall cost of the treatment. It is being communicated to the patients that the cost would go up due to pandemic,” said Sharma, who has got queries from 36 patients in Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates. Sharma is hopeful that by September, at least 100 international patients can fly down to Gurugram, if the Central government approves.Vidit Bahri, managing director, Sukoon Health — a part of Fortis Healthcare that deals with medical tourists requiring psychiatric treatment — said that there is still an uncertainty till international flights are fully operational. “In Delhi-NCR medical tourism generates almost ₹400 crore per month. It is important to gain the confidence and trust of the patients that they can be safely treated. Before Covid-19, 15-20 patients approached the centre per month but now there is a dip of at least 70%. Of late, we have received the request of only five to six patients. Approximately, two-and-a-half to three months are needed build up the demand,” said Bahri.Agreeing with Bahri, Dilip Chopra, president, Foundation for Health and Wellness Promotion, an association of MVT companies, said, “There is a lack of clarity, as many states are still under lockdown. In these states, how will the patients be transferred, how different hospitals will handle the patients are still unknown. Some of these questions will have to be addressed before the sector can open up,” said Chopra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/sops-to-restart-medical-tourism-in-gurugram-sent-for-approval/story-vKqUU3a4fv2CC3k0UzSDjN.html
29-07-2020||Delhi||Man hacks retired diplomat’s email, extorts his contacts for money, held||A 40-year-old man from Delhi hacked the email account of a retired senior diplomat and used it to dupe his contacts by sending them requests for financial help, said the police on Tuesday after arresting the man and uncovering an elaborate fraud in which he had allegedly made more than ₹1 crore.The suspect, Akram Ali, had also used a similar modus operandi to pose as an income tax and excise department officer to blackmail and extort other people for money, said Atul Kumar Thakur, the deputy commissioner of police (south).The police said Ali, who lives in south Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, has only studied till Class 10 but allegedly came up with an idea that involved hacking the email accounts of prominent people and then either emotionally blackmailing their contacts into transferring money as financial help or extorting them for money. He used to work for a newspaper agency as part of the distribution team.The cyber team of the south Delhi district police were alerted of this modus operandi when the consulate general of a Latin American country approached the police with a complaint late last month.“The diplomat’s email contacts had received requests for financial help from his email ID. Two of his contacts had even helped with contributions of about ₹1.4 lakh. When he later interacted with one of them, he found that his email account was used fraudulently to send those requests,” said the DCP.When the police began probing the alleged fraud, they traced the IP addresses and the bank accounts in which the money had been deposited. “But we found that the accounts had been created using Aadhaar cards that had addresses in which the account holders did not live currently, and SIM cards using the same fake addresses,” said the DCP.The police connected one of the Aadhaar numbers to a labourer in Delhi. They said the labourer was living in a new place.When the labourer allegedly identified Ali as the man who had got his address on the Aadhaar card changed, arranged for his stay in a rented home and opened multiple bank accounts in his name, the police realised they had stumbled upon a well-planned fraud.“To receive the extortion money in bank accounts without being traced, Ali had approached about a dozen labourers who had Aadhaar cards, but they couldn’t be traced back to the address recorded on them,” said the DCP.The process would begin with Ali promising ₹10,000-₹20,000 to the labourers if they did as he said.“Ali would first rent rooms for these labourers. He would then change their addresses in the Aadhaar cards. Using the new address, he would open four-five bank accounts in each of their names. He would also procure SIM cards in their names and keep them,” said the DCP.Ali would then allegedly guide his potential victims to a web link which could be used to make the payments — which would land in the bank accounts of the labourers. Ali would then withdraw the money from ATMs.The police said that after Ali was arrested from his home on Sunday, he confessed to cheating many more people using similar techniques. “But it is unlikely that this man is operating alone. It required multiple skills and he could be working with more people. He has named one other person and we are ascertaining that person’s involvement and trying to nab him,” said another police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-hacks-retired-diplomat-s-email-extorts-his-contacts-for-money-held/story-Vrr9yjIjwTFyBgteD3qe4J.html
29-07-2020||Delhi||AAP to protest against south civic body’s new tax on professionals, other hikes||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will organise a protest outside the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) office on Wednesday against the decision of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to levy a professional tax on self-employed persons, hike tax on transfer of property, and almost double the taxes on rented commercial properties. All three municipal corporations in Delhi are ruled by the BJP.The SDMC House on Monday passed the proposal to levy a professional tax on self-employed persons and professionals working in companies — a first in Delhi — and doubled the tax on rented commercial properties. The civic body also approved a 1% hike in tax on transfer of property, with an aim to ramp up revenue collection which has been hit by the national lockdown to contain spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The AAP’s political affairs committee member and in-charge of municipal corporation affairs Durgesh Pathak on Tuesday also criticised the Congress and said its councillors did not oppose the move in the SDMC House when it was passed on Monday.“The BJP should be ashamed of implementing these taxes at a time when people are struggling because of the Covid-19 pandemic… We shall be protesting against the move outside the BJP office tomorrow (Wednesday)… While the BJP is the party behind the taxes, the Congress worked in connivance with it by remaining silent in the House while the taxes were passed. Also, since 2017, when the BJP came to power in the three municipal corporations, Congress has not organised a single protest against the irregularities in the civic bodies. Is it because they are participants in the same corruption?” Pathak said during a press conference on Tuesday.Delhi Congress chief Chaudhary Anil Kumar said, “Congress councillors in the House had openly and vehemently opposed the passing of the new taxes, which at a time like this is inhuman and an additional burden on the common man. Both the AAP and the BJP are fooling people the same way. Even the AAP government had hiked the VAT on diesel and petrol, which is not warranted at this time. The Congress is also going to hold a press meet on the issue tomorrow (Wednesday).” In response to AAP’s allegations, BJP leader and SDMC mayor Anamika Mithilesh said due to the pandemic, the income of the civic body has been hit and its financial condition has worsened, leaving them with no option but to levy taxes. “In the past, we refrained from imposing any new tax or increasing rates of existing taxes but the Covid-19 has changed the scenario. As per the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission, Delhi government has to give us ₹1,300 crore but it is yet to do so. Hence, we had to levy taxes. We have designed tax slabs in such a way that it does not impact the common man,” she said.For self-employed professionals such as doctors, lawyers, chartered accountants and architects, etc.,earning between ₹50,000-75,000 per month, the professional tax will be ₹100 per month. For those earning between ₹75,000-1 lakh, it will be ₹150 a month, while it will be ₹200 a month for those earning above ₹1 lakh. Those earning less than ₹50,000 a month won’t be taxed.The SDMC House also doubled the tax on rented commercial property. The tax amount will depend on the location of the property. “Under the SDMC jurisdiction, there are around 9,000 to 10,000 commercial properties. So we hope to generate an additional revenue of ₹90-100 crore per annum. The move will not impact residential and commercial properties that are being run by the owners,” said Narendra Chawla, leader of the House, SDMC.For instance, the current commercial tax payable by a 83.6-square metre shop in a locality such as Defence Colony or South Extension is ₹25,333 per annum. But if the shop is a rented property, then the owner will now have to pay ₹50,666 as tax.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-to-protest-against-south-civic-body-s-new-tax-on-professionals-other-hikes/story-aMY8DsmURGQKtGlijUPskN.html
29-07-2020||City||Amity varsity students devise Covid-19 kit, with ‘smart’ gloves, wearables||To protect people from Covid-19, students of Amity University have come up with a handy low-cost and low-powered battery operated kit that contains an electronic smart device for maintaining social distancing, smart gloves with a self-sanitising system, and an electronic device to keep one’s hands away from the face. VK Jain, professor of Amity Institute of Advanced Research and Studies (materials and devices), who led the project, said the kit would cost about Rs 500. He said a few companies have approached the lab for manufacturing these kits commercially. “The talks are in the final stage. Within a month, they would be available in the market,” Jain said. Explaining the uses of each item in the kit, Jain said, “The electronic smart device helps the user maintain a social distance of six feet from others. It has a buzzer and a light alarm and it warns the user if the six feet distance is breached. The radio frequency based device can be worn as a wrist band and has chargeable batteries.” Jain said the gloves in the kit will not only protect the wearer, but also prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease owing to its special design. “The inner layer is the same as that of a normal glove followed by second layer consisting of a special material loaded with antiviral agents, sanitiser and disinfectant. The topmost layer is perforated to release the antiviral agent to the surface which will kill the virus and prevent its spread. The sanitiser is released automatically by the movement of fingers when they hold an object,” Jain said. Suman Nagpal, a member of this team, said to prevent the most common habit of touching one’s face, they have also created an automatic alarm device. “This wearable low-cost and low-powered battery operated device will support individuals in building positive habits. It would emit an alarm each time a user tries to touch their face. This gadget is very affordable, lightweight and can be worn around the neck like a pendant. It has a buzzer alarm, a LED light and vibrator and the alert that will become stronger as the hand gets closer to the face,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/amity-varsity-students-devise-covid-19-kit-with-smart-gloves-wearables-to-maintain-social-distancing-hygiene/story-jCOM88KsX5076c2UJakydO.html

A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan said water and electricity concessions were being given by the Delhi government as per its policy decision which was based upon complex facts and situations prevailing in the society. It said the policy is based on the desire of the people and “how to rule a state has to be best left to the people doing so”. The bench further said that unless an illegality in a policy is pointed out, the court was not inclined to alter it or interfere with it. “The court cannot impose even a better policy,” it said, adding “we see no reason to entertain the petition”. “Petition is dismissed with cost of Rs 25,000 to be deposited with the legal services authority.” Delhi government’s additional standing counsel Sanjoy Ghose and advocate Urvi Mohan had opposed the plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-dismisses-plea-against-power-water-subsidy-imposes-cost-on-petitioner/story-CC390q3jpzCdwmFissCzkK.html
29-07-2020||City||No death reported on Monday at Delhi’s biggest Covid hospital, Lok Nayak||For the first time in nearly four months, Delhi’s biggest treatment facility for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) – the 2,000-bed Lok Nayak hospital – did not report a death on Monday. “No death in our biggest COVID hospital LNJP yesterday,” tweeted chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe hospital has been recording a couple of deaths daily since it started treating Covid-19 patients in March. The number of deaths had shot up to 10 to 15 a day in June when Delhi had seen a surge in the number of cases. Delhi reported 28 Covid deaths on Tuesday, taking the toll due to the viral disease to 3,881, according to Delhi government’s daily bulletin.According to data shared by the chief minister’s office earlier this month, the daily death toll due to Covid-19 in Delhi had reached 101 in June. In comparison, Delhi recorded 27 deaths on average every day during the last week. “We have been recording one or two deaths every day at the hospital as we get the critical patients here – many referred from other centre and in need of ventilation. Even on Sunday, two deaths had been recorded at the hospital. Monday was the first day since the hospital started treating Covid-19 patients that no deaths were reported. The figures were reported to the government today morning,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, director, Lok Nayak hospital. To be sure, the fewer deaths could be a result of fewer admissions at the hospital – only 412 of the 2,000 beds in the hospital were occupied as on Tuesday evening, according to the Delhi corona app. The availability of ICU beds, newer treatments, and plasma therapy for the patients has helped in bringing down the fatalities, Dr Kumar said. The hospital currently has 255 ICU beds – with and without ventilator. “In June, there were fewer ICU beds in the hospital and a large number of patients. Now, we are admitting anyone whose disease is likely to deteriorate in the ICU, ensuring close monitoring. All my doctors have also been working very hard to monitor the patients,” said Dr Kumar. He added that the hospital has also started using the experimental drug Remdesivir, aiding the recovery of the patients. “Our plasma bank has also ensured that anyone in need of plasma therapy is able to get it improving the clinical outcomes of the patients,” he said. Lok Nayak was the second hospital to set up a convalescent plasma bank, after the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences. However, its bank unlike the one in ILBS, does not provide plasma to patients admitted to other hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-death-reported-on-monday-at-delhi-s-biggest-covid-hospital-lok-nayak/story-Qpx0bTlIEoZCt6yMaxt5NI.html
29-07-2020||Delhi||Amid financial crises, admission withdrawals in many low-cost private schools, fewer enrolments in entry-level classes||Several private schools in the national capital have witnessed fewer enrolments in entry-level classes this year amid the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the school managements, many parents have even dis-enrolled their children, citing financial constraints triggered by a nationwide lockdown to contain the pandemic.A majority of these private schools are low-cost ones charging monthly tuition fees between ₹600 and ₹1,300 per student and catering to the children of lower-middle-class families. Hari Prakash Sharma, the chairperson of New Happy Public School in Narela Mandi, said they have 80 seats in entry-level classes—nursery, kindergarten and Class 1. “We have received only six or seven admissions this year as of now. It’s never happened before. Parents of at least 80 students have withdrawn their wards’ admissions in the last two months, citing financial issues. We do not know how we will survive this year since we are not even receiving fees from all students. We cannot even pay our staff,” he said. The school offers education up to Class 8 and charges ₹1,100 tuition fees per student per month.There is a similar situation in several other schools. Dharampal Sehrawat, the chairperson of Shiva Model School in Bawana that offers classes up to Class 10, said that they have received no admission to nursery and kindergarten this year. “We do not have a nursery class this year. A majority of students who were promoted from nursery to kindergarten have left. At least 10-15 students have applied for transfer certificates (TCs) in every class. We are in terrible shape now. The overall enrolment has drastically reduced this year,” he said. The school charges ₹800 tuition fees per student per month.Priyanka Gulati, the principal of Evergreen Public School that has primary branches in both Mayur Vihar-1 and Acharya Niketan, said that both the branches have received very few admissions this year. “Every year, all our sections are usually full by this time. But this year, we only have a handful of admissions in both branches. It will be a major challenge to run two branches with such a thin strength this year. We do not know how we will retain our staff,” she said.In some schools in rural areas of Delhi, parents of as many as 20%-30% students have withdrawn their admissions. Pradeep Vats, the chairperson of Marigold Public School in north-west Delhi’s Katewara, said that 30% of the 1,400 students enrolled in their school have left. The school offers education from nursery to Class 12 and charges between ₹1,300 and ₹2,500 in tuition fees per student per month. “Many parents have said that they won’t be able to pay the fees this year citing financial crises. They have said they will enrol them in government schools,” he said.Anuradha Mehta, the principal of Red Roses Public School in Saket, said, “Many parents of students in junior classes have applied for a TC and a few have already left without it. We also have seats vacant in nursery, which is unprecedented.”Among the parents, who have withdrawn their children from private schools, is Mahesh Kumar who was working in a factory in Gandhi Nagar till March. Kumar has lost his job due to the economic slowdown caused by the Covid-enforced lockdown. His two children—a son (10) and a daughter (9)—were studying in a private school till March. “I am not in a position to pay the school fees this year. I am waiting for government school admissions to begin. I will enrol y children in a government school this year,” he said.While government schools are yet to begin non-planned admissions, the three civic bodies—north, east and south—started the admission process in their schools on July 20. Students who migrate from MCD to Delhi government schools in Class 6 are called ‘planned admissions’, those who migrate from any other school to any class are called ‘non-planned admissions’. An advisor to Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia, who requested anonymity, said that the government will soon start the admission process in its schools. “The migration of Class 6 students from MCD schools to Delhi government schools is already completed. We will soon start admission to other classes as well. There is a huge possibility of private schools students moving to government schools in large numbers this year. Also, parents now know that government schools in Delhi are equally good or even better than several private schools,” the advisor said.Principles of several municipal schools said that this year they have admitted several students who were earlier studying at private schools in the neighbourhood. Lalit Ahuja, the principal of the south civic body school in Aya Nagar, said, “We admitted a few students from private schools in almost every class within a week of the commencement of admissions. We are also getting calls from parents who want to shift their children from private schools. We will get a clear picture by the end of August.”Meanwhile, some parents are also switching from expensive private schools to affordable private schools. Simple Bedi, a single mother of a Class 4 student, has been out of work since March. The resident of Ashram was working as a trainer in a gym. She has moved her son from a prominent south Delhi school to another private school this year. “I was not able to afford the fees in the previous school. There is a difference of ₹6,000 in the monthly fees of both the schools,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/amid-financial-crises-admission-withdrawals-in-many-low-cost-private-schools-fewer-enrolments-in-entry-level-classes/story-krThOWHQni0DQrGVxQFESO.html

To discuss the matter and take a decision in this regard, Kejriwal is scheduled to chair a meeting with the health and revenue departments on Wednesday.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageOn June 12, when Covid cases in the Capital were surging, the Delhi government released a list of 77 banquet halls and 40 hotels that were to be converted into Covid facilities to quickly make up for the lack of hospital beds. A total of over 15,800 beds were planned to be provided in the listed hotels (4,628 beds) and banquet halls (11,229 beds). The plan was approved by the Delhi government on May 29, when it had identified five hotels to be converted into extended Covid hospitals. These hotels included Crowne Plaza which was attached to Batra Hospital; Hotel Surya (Apollo); Hotel Siddharth (BL Kapur Memorial Hospital); Hotel Jivitesh (Sir Gangaram Hospital); and Sheraton Saket (Max Super Speciality Hospital).Of these, only Sheraton hotel in Saket operated as an extended hospital for the longest time, the rest of the hotels did not receive any patients.“We have 16,038 Covid beds in various hospitals and 12,996 are vacant even now. Since we have beds available in hospitals, we were getting a lot of requests from different hotels and banquet hall owners to delink or relieve their facilities from Covid duty. Now that the situation seems to have stabilised a bit, a meeting has been called to decide exactly how it is to be done and from when,” said an official in the chief minister’s office on condition of anonymity. The official, however, said that the delinking will happen only in a phased manner as the situation may worsen any time.The government has also consistently warned against complacency and the need to adhere to safety and distancing norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-to-take-a-call-on-continuation-of-hotels-as-covid-facilities/story-aQQLbXCrsRWyE4dnt34zcO.html
29-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi police head constable shoots himself in the head, dies||A 34-year-old Delhi police head constable died after allegedly shooting himself in his head inside his car at an isolated spot on Tuesday morning, the police said. Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (south), said that the head constable was battling depression, most likely due to his elder brother’s liver ailment. “He hasn’t left behind a suicide note, but we suspect that his brother’s ailment left him depressed because of which he took the extreme step,” said the DCP, adding that inquest proceedings in the death have been initiated. The policeman was originally from Rajasthan, where his wife and two children live. In Delhi, the head constable lived in the police barracks. He was posted at a south Delhi police station. “On Tuesday morning, he left the barracks in his WagonR car and reached his beat area. There, we suspect, he shot himself in his car using his service revolver,” said the DCP. The police were alerted of the death by a passerby who saw a bleeding man lying in the driver’s seat of the car that was parked at an isolated spot in the area around 11 am. “ So far, there is no evidence of involvement of foul play by anyone,” said the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-police-head-constable-shoots-himself-in-the-head-dies/story-85uaClvFKQpgOr5Oxw9quK.html

The deadline for the pilot-run of the project which includes tree plantation, pavements, bicycle tracks, pedestrian lanes, and creating parking space for vehicles along the roads has now been pushed to from December 2020 to August 2021 in view of the delays due to the Covid pandemic.Delhi, according to officials of the Public Works Department (PWD), has around 500km of road stretches that are more than 100 feet wide. All of these stretches are part of the renovation and redesign project, for which architects have taken inspiration from cities in Europe. “The chief minister today asked for a detailed plan on redesigning of 500 km of roads from PWD within three weeks. The roads will be redesigned on Build–Operate–Transfer (BOT) model, under which the construction company will have the responsibility to maintain the road for 15 years. Deadline of the pilot project for seven roads has been extended to August 2021 due to Covid. Earlier, December 2020 was the deadline,” said a statement issued by the chief minister’s office.Seven road stretches selected for the pilot run of the project include the stretches between AIIMS to Ashram Chowk and Mayapuri to Moti Bagh intersection on the inner Ring Road, part of Vikas Marg, the stretch between Wazirabad depot to Rithala metro station, Ambedkar Nagar to Defence Colony flyover on the BRT stretch and from Britannia Chowk to West Enclave on the Outer Ring Road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-reviews-road-redesign-project-deadline-for-pilot-run-extended/story-oRjE6JucpZLMxRFPP1GkSO.html
29-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Homeless man rapes woman in Red Fort area, held||A man allegedly raped a 23-year-old woman inside a park near Red Fort on Saturday night and kidnapped her two-year-old daughter, who was later found. The police said the woman and the man are homeless and live in different city parks and shelter homes. The woman told the police that the man had hit her head with a stone when she tried to resist the assault and also kidnapped her daughter. The police said they were passing by the park on Saturday night when they heard the woman’s screams. The 30-year-old alleged rapist, also homeless, was arrested on Monday. The police said that on Saturday night, the team reached the spot and took the woman to the hospital. The woman had alleged at the hospital that the man had kidnapped her two-year-old daughter after assaulting her. “She said the man injured her by hitting her with a stone when she resisted the attempt and kidnapped. Based on her statement and following a detailed medical examination, a case of rape and assault and kidnapping was registered under the Indian Penal Code,” an officer said, wishing not to be named. “However, the woman’s daughter was found the same night close to the area where the woman lives. Some locals found her and brought her home. The man has been booked for kidnapping as well but we are probing if he tried to kidnap the girl,” added the officer, who requested anonymity. The officer said the Red Fort is part of the high-security zone of the capital and preparations for Independence Day on August 15 have already started. “Every day, the area is checked by security personnel, including paramilitary forces. This is how the woman and the man were spotted by them and she was rescued,” he added.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Monika Bhardwaj said a police team was deployed to search for the suspect who fled the spot. “Our teams checked CCTV camera footage and spoke to other vagabonds living in that area and identified the man. He was arrested on Monday,” Bhardwaj said. The DCP said the man has no previous criminal involvement. Five days ago, last Friday, an eight-year-old girl sleeping next to her grandmother outside their home in North Delhi was kidnapped and raped. The police managed to arrest the suspect two days later on Sunday using the survivor’s description. He was identified as a street vendor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/homeless-man-rapes-woman-in-red-fort-area-held/story-NViPBa4L5uFxMVonraHKTP.html
29-07-2020||Pune||With men yet to return from hometowns, women hit working floor in PCMC||Pune: Women employed in small scale industries located at Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) Bhosari are enjoying a bigger role in handling machines as men labourers are yet to return from their hometowns in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. “Women were employed in small scale industries even before the lockdown period. Now, many companies are training them for machine work and giving them more responsibilities which is a good initiative,” said Sandeep Belsare, president, Pimpri-Chinchwad small-scale industries association. The absence of men on work floor is also benefitting women, who were earlier given the task of cleaning and sweeping works, financially. “I am getting higher wages now and given additional work like welding these days,” said Sharada Kadgale, who works at Hansraj Industries. Kartik Gowardhan, owner of Hansraj Industries that is into manufacturing of silver contracts, copper flexible links, carbon brushes and holders , insulators, industrial fabrication and import substitute, said, “We have employed eight women and they are learning works that was earlier done by men.” According to a Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA) survey on economic activity, there are 48 per cent of employees working in small scale industries since the resumption of economic activities. “In Bhosari, around 38 women are working on machines. Some will undergo three-month training to run Computer Numerical Control machines (CNC). Many are also learning wielding work,” said Abhay Bhor, president, Forum of Small Scale Industries Association. Few women are learning vehicle repair work to support their family. “I used to drive E-auto before the coronavirus situation hit my earnings. I am now learning mechanical work at Avant Auto Care and Services under Durga Bhor. I plan to start an automobile repair shop,” said Savita Vairahi, who was an autorickshaw driver. “As not many women are working in vehicle repair sector, it is a good sign that they are showing interest,” said Durga. “Around eight women trained to operating CNC machines at my place and one is my employee now,” said Vaibhav Jagtap, proprietor of Shree Sai Enterprises who are manufacturers of moulds, press tools, jigs, fixture and precision works. Plan to start business Many women who plan to start their businesses are provided assistance by Forum of Small Scale Industries Association. “We help them in completing the government formalities before starting their business. The state government provides 50 per cent subsidy to women who want to start their business,” said Abhay Bhor, president, Forum of Small Scale Industries Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-men-yet-to-return-from-hometowns-women-hit-working-floor-in-pcmc/story-pZWPEXZ9Y9UugzVsmahlXP.html
29-07-2020||Pune||Covid waste a health hazard in Pune in the absence of guidelines||Pune: Lack of awareness on Covid waste segregation by those advised home quarantine is posing a risk of infection to waste pickers in the city, said health activists and citizen groups. The activists cite lack of policy or standard operating procedure (SOP) for households and residential societies as one of the main reasons for spreading virus fears among those who collect waste. Dhairyashil Vandekar, president, Vithalrao Vandekar Foundation, has petitioned Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar to issue SOP on handling Covid waste for households and residential societies at the earliest. “Patients with mild symptoms or no symptoms are being home quarantined for various reasons, including shortage of hospital beds. However, it is seen that many of those under home isolation are unaware that Covid waste is to be treated as biomedical waste and PMC has put in a place a separate mechanism to handle the waste. This lack of knowledge may result in such biomedical waste being handled by waste pickers, and along with their contacts, being susceptible to the deadly virus,” stated Vandekar in his petition. Vivek Velankar, a health and civic activist, said that in the absence of specific guidelines, cases of non-segregation of Covid waste are being reported. “PMC must educate housing societies, waste pickers and fine violators as public health is at stake due to the spread of the contagion,” he said. The activists cite cases where masks and gloves of Covid patients are being dumped with regular dry waste in the absence of guidelines. Dnyaneshwar Molak, Pune Municipal Corporation’s solid waste management head and joint commissioner, said his department is handling the additional load of Covid waste being generated by home quarantined patients. He said a designated team with 15 vehicles at its disposal is collecting this waste. “We are addressing the complaints regarding non-segregation of waste in residential societies,” said Molak. Citizen activist Sonali Patil of Katraj Citizens Committee said, “PMC must collect Covid waste from residential societies on a daily basis, which is not happening in some areas. Residents should also act responsibility and segregate waste.” Activists bat for awareness Briefing of isolation protocol of home quarantined patients and other house members by PMC within 6 hours of the patient being home quarantined The patient be provided with waste disposal kit, including colour coded double layered waste bags Detailed specific SOP/guidelines by PMC with regard to disinfecting, handling and management of Covid waste by households, residential societies in coordination with PMC Chairperson, secretary and members of societies should be made responsible for strict adherence of SOPs Display of information by societies about a home-quarantined patient staying in the building to forewarn delivery boys, SWaCH waste pickers, milk and newspaper delivery agents and visitors. Name and contact numbers of ward officials along with other officers responsible for collection of Covid waste must be displayed on society’s notice board||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-waste-becomes-a-health-hazard-in-pune-as-hsg-societies-mix-it-with-regular-waste-in-absence-of-guidelines/story-vEWl4puWEiwilksSTxtE8I.html

29-07-2020||World||UK again extends visa of stranded Indians until August 31||The Boris Johnson government on Wednesday granted another visa extension until August 31 to Indian and other non-EU citizens currently in the UK who are unable to travel to their destinations in India and elsewhere due to travel bans in various countries.The extension comes as some relief to Indians whose visas were about to expire on July 31. Regular commercial flights between India and the UK have not yet resumed. Many have returned on special repatriation flights but several others remain stranded.Addressing those affected, the Home Office said: “To allow time to make the necessary arrangements to leave the UK, if you have a visa or leave that was due to expire between the 24 January 2020 and 31 July 2020, you will be given an extra month’s grace period within the UK to 31 August 2020”.“During the grace period the conditions of your stay in the UK will be the same as the conditions of your leave…You do not need to contact the Home Office to tell us you are able to leave the UK during the grace period up until the 31 August”.“If you intend to leave the UK but are not able to do so by 31 August 2020, you may request additional time to stay, also known as ‘exceptional indemnity’, by contacting the coronavirus immigration team (CIT)”, it added.Officials said a dedicated Covid-19 immigration team has been set up in the Home Office for the purpose, and asked anyone with expired or expiring visas to contact it, via email CIH@homeoffice.gov.uk. They will then be issued with the extension, it added.Home secretary Priti Patel said: “The UK continues to put the health and well-being of people first and nobody will be punished for circumstances outside of their control. By extending people’s visas, we are giving people peace of mind and also ensuring that those in vital services can continue their work”.Those who contact the Home Office for the visa extensions will be expected to return to their home countries as soon as possible once flight and border restrictions are lifted. No action will be taken during this time for those who email the Home Office for the extension.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-again-extends-visa-of-stranded-indians-until-august-31/story-nuOEA7k5uZCam6FmjJ0jCK.html
29-07-2020||World||Moderna’s vaccine protects monkeys against Covid-19, study finds||US biotechnology company Moderna’s experimental vaccine to prevent Covid-19 induced robust immune response and rapidly controlled the novel coronavirus in the upper and lower airways of monkeys exposed to SARS-CoV-2, according to a study published on Tuesday. The candidate vaccine, mRNA-1273, was co-developed by scientists at Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in the US. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, complements recently reported interim results from an NIAID-sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial of mRNA-1273. On Monday clinics around the US began a Phase 3 trial of the vaccine candidate, with the aim of enrolling 30,000 people to test for safety and effectiveness. In the latest study, three groups of eight rhesus macaques received two injections of 10 or 100 microgrammes (μg) of mRNA-1273 or a placebo. Injections were spaced 28 days apart. Vaccinated macaques produced high levels of neutralising antibodies directed at the surface spike protein used by SARS-CoV-2 to attach to and enter cells, the researchers said. Animals receiving the 10-μg or 100-μg dose vaccine candidate produced neutralising antibodies in the blood at levels well above those found in people who recovered from Covid-19, they said. The researchers said the experimental vaccine also induced Th1 T-cell responses but not Th2 responses. Induction of Th2 responses has been associated with a phenomenon called vaccine-associated enhancement of respiratory disease (VAERD), they said. According to the researchers, vaccine-induced Th1 responses have not been associated with VAERD or other respiratory diseases. The experimental vaccine also induced T follicular helper T-cell responses that may have contributed to the robust antibody response, they said. Four weeks after the second injection, all the macaques were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 via both the nose and the lungs, according to the study. It found that after two days, no replicating virus was detectable in the lungs of seven out of eight of the macaques in both vaccinated groups, while all eight placebo-injected animals continued to have replicating virus in the lung. None of the eight macaques vaccinated with 100 μg of mRNA-1273 had detectable virus in their noses two days after virus exposure, the researchers said. This is the first time an experimental Covid-19 vaccine tested in nonhuman primates has been shown to produce such rapid viral control in the upper airway, the researchers noted. A COVID-19 vaccine that reduces viral replication in the lungs would limit disease in the individual, while reducing shedding in the upper airway would potentially lessen transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and consequently reduce the spread of disease, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-s-vaccine-protects-monkeys-against-covid-19-study-finds/story-9Lnet3y19nghQUnOYRenMK.html

Its connect prompted Johnson to consider White House-style daily briefings.According to former journalist Johnson, the popularity of the coronavirus briefings showed that the public wanted more “direct engagement” with decision-makers. He would not appear every day, but would be “popping up from time to time”.The advert says the new spokesperson expected to draw a six-figure salary will have the “unique opportunity to work at the centre of government, and communicate with the nation on behalf of the Prime Minister…(and) become a trusted political adviser to the Prime Minister”.“You will represent the government and the Prime Minister to an audience of millions on a daily basis, across the main broadcast channels and social media, and have the chance to influence and shape public opinion. You will speak directly to the public on the issues they care most about”, it informs prospective candidates.The role involves regularly giving on-the-record televised briefings and providing trusted media advice to Johnson and his political team. The candidates are told that working in the Prime Minister’s communications team involves working under pressure and to immovable deadlines.“The demands of the post are high and it will appeal to an experienced and confident media operator who would enjoy working on camera and with senior ministers, political advisers, officials and journalists; who would relish the challenge and pace of televised briefing; and who has a strong grasp of foreign and domestic policy issues”, the advert says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wanted-a-tv-friendly-spokesperson-for-pm-boris-johnson-in-white-house-style-briefings/story-lXTU8dUCq73DTBzJSC9QcM.html
29-07-2020||World||Pakistani Muslim accused of insulting Islam killed in court||A young Pakistani Muslim walked into a courtroom in the northwestern city of Peshawar on Wednesday and shot and killed a fellow Muslim who was on trial for blasphemy, a police officer said.It was not immediately clear how the assailant, identified as Khalid Khan, managed to get into the court amid tight security. The attacker was subsequently arrested.The man on trial, Tahir Shamim Ahmad, had claimed he was Islam’s prophet and was arrested two years ago on blasphemy charges, according to Azmat Khan, the police officer. Ahmad died before he could be transported to hospital.Blasphemy is an extremely controversial issue in Pakistan, where people convicted of the crime can be sentenced to life in prison or the death penalty. But crowds and individuals in Pakistan often take the law into their own hands.While authorities have yet to carry out a death sentence for blasphemy, even the mere accusation can cause riots. Domestic and international human rights groups say blasphemy allegations have often been used to intimidate religious minorities and settle personal scores.A Punjab governor was killed by his own guard in 2011 after he defended a Christian woman, Asia Bibi, who was accused of blasphemy. She was acquitted after spending eight years on death row in a case that drew international media attention. Faced with death threats from Islamic extremists upon her release, she flew to Canada to join her daughters last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-muslim-accused-of-insulting-islam-killed-in-court/story-Hi4wIzHMTN5wvdWurMUX5L.html

Revenue fell 85%. Heathrow, though, said its finances remained robust.It said it had enough cash to last until at least June 2021 with no revenue.“We have agreed a waiver on financial covenants until the end of 2021 and maintained our Investment Grade credit rating status,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heathrow-tells-uk-do-passenger-testing-or-lose-quarantine-roulette/story-rGtMbnJncHstbb9E12NWHK.html

Sanofi and GSK, which had first teamed up in April, confirmed in a statement that regulatory approval for their vaccine could be won by the first half of 2021 if clinical data was positive.Britain has moved early in striking vaccine supply deals, and ministers have stressed the importance of securing supplies of a range of candidates. “The fact remains that there are no guarantees,” said business minister Alok Sharma.“In the meantime, it is important that we secure early access to a diverse range of promising vaccine candidates, like GSK and Sanofi, to increase our chances of finding one that works.” Last week Britain struck deals for 30 million doses of the experimental BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, and a deal in principle for 60 million doses of the Valneva vaccine.That followed a previously announced pact with AstraZeneca for production of 100 million doses of its potential vaccine, being developed in partnership with Oxford university.With no working vaccine against Covid-19 yet developed, Britain now has 250 million doses potentially available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-signs-supply-deal-for-60-million-doses-of-sanofi-gsk-covid-19-vaccine/story-pFnzkNAjtKKjEdv47YvbsK.html

Pilgrims will get sterilized pebbles to throw at pillars symbolizing the devil. And instead of jostling shoulder to shoulder, worshipers will circle Mecca’s grand mosque with 1.5 meters of space between them.This year, Islam’s annual hajj pilgrimage — which starts on Wednesday — will be unlike any other.Saudi Arabia has dramatically downsized the ritual because of the coronavirus pandemic, with authorities testing pilgrims and cutting their numbers from the usual 2 million to around 1,000. As a result, this year’s pilgrims will be among a lucky few, selected through an online vetting system open only to residents of the kingdom.“It’s such beautiful moment for me,” said Faridah Binti Bakti Yahra, a 39-year-old Indonesian mother of three, who was so surprised by the call telling her she’d been chosen that she thought it was a scam. “I couldn’t believe it was true.”Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, obligatory once in a lifetime for all who are able. Pilgrims often save money for years and apply repeatedly for a spot.Normally, religious tourism -- of which hajj is only a part -- brings in revenue equivalent to about 2.7% of Saudi Arabia’s gross domestic product. But the crowds of people from all over the world are also potential incubators of disease, so the government halted them at the start of the pandemic. Saudi Arabia’s coronavirus cases topped 270,000 this week, with daily new cases falling below 2,000 for the first time since early June.“The main goal is that the pilgrims not be infected,” hajj minister Mohammad Benten said in an interview with Saudi television channel Al-Arabiya.The hajj will be the first large-scale gathering in Mecca’s grand mosque in months. Only pilgrims between the age of 20 and 50 without chronic diseases were considered. Before traveling to Mecca, they observed a week-long home quarantine, followed by a four-day quarantine in a Mecca hotel -- receiving meals through room service and communicating with their neighbors over Whatsapp.When they leave their rooms on Wednesday, they’ll be transported on half-empty buses, their possessions packed in identical navy blue suitcases. Usually, as part of the ritual, they would gather rocks to throw at three stone pillars -- a symbolic repelling of evil -- but this year, each pilgrim will be given a packet of sterilized pebbles.They’re also wearing movement-tracking bracelets that connect to their phones via Bluetooth. Yahra laughed as she showed the white band on her wrist during a video call arranged by Saudi authorities; this year, pilgrims are only allowed to communicate with international media through government intermediaries.Online Mass and Suspended Pilgrimages—How the Faithful ManageMore than 160 nationalities will be represented this year, with 30% Saudi and 70% foreign. Their costs are covered by the government.Other pilgrims interviewed by Bloomberg asked not to be identified by their full names because of the rules about speaking to media.Alfayik, a 26-year-old student from the Central African Republic, was so shocked he’d been chosen that he started “jumping and screaming.” He’d been applying for five years.Saudi Arabia’s Post-Oil Plan Faces Cuts as Crude Plummets (1)For Yahra, it’s particularly bittersweet. After spending a year and a half in Saudi Arabia, her family will return to Indonesia as soon as she finishes the hajj. Like many others during the economic downturn that’s accompanied the pandemic, her husband lost his job at an oilfield services company. The movers have already come to gather their belongings.In addition to supplications she’ll make on behalf of friends and family, she has prayers of her own: for the pandemic to end, for her daughters to have a good future, for her husband to find work again.“I feel like it’s a blessing for me before I leave Saudi for good,” she said of the pilgrimage. “It’s difficult for us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hajj-pilgrimage-in-the-age-of-coronavirus-is-unlike-any-before/story-PO21qqmIep9x3WYbDwDmtI.html
29-07-2020||World||Bezos, Zuckerberg and Musk have made $115 billion this year||The message from Jeff Bezos: Big Tech’s not so powerful.The message from is his personal fortune: Oh yes it is.As Bezos and three other technology magnates prepare to defend their businesses at a Congressional hearing on antitrust worries Wednesday, their fast-growing wealth provides a breathtaking measure of their companies’ economic might. The Amazon.com Inc. founder has seen his net worth soar by $63.6 billion this year. On one day this month, it leaped an unprecedented $13 billion. The world’s richest man is now on the cusp of another record: a fortune exceeding $200 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Another chief executive officer set to testify, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook Inc., has grown $9.1 billion richer this year, placing his fortune within reach of the centibillionaire status already held by Bezos and Bill Gates.The mind-boggling accumulation of money underway in technology is unrivaled in speed and scale. No other group of executives has prospered to such a degree. Indeed, the world’s richest people are growing even richer, even faster, as the coronavirus pandemic upends the global economy and drives ever more activity online.Online Economy“We moved the brick-and-mortar economy to an online economy dramatically,” said Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. “Probably the same thing would have happened in a longer period of time. Now it’s happening in weeks instead of years.”The hearing will be held by video conference and also features Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, the CEOs of Apple Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. It’s poised to be a combative affair as lawmakers express heightened frustration with how the industry wields its clout.Bezos’s stance will be that his company is an American success story that achieved its position through risk-taking and a relentless focus on customers, according to his prepared testimony. He will tell his personal story and that of his parents, who invested in what would become the world’s largest online retailer.The collective wealth of tech billionaires in Bloomberg’s index, a ranking of the world’s 500 richest people, has nearly doubled since 2016, from $751 billion to $1.4 trillion today. That’s faster than in every other sector.Seven of the world’s 10 richest people derive the bulk of their fortune from technology holdings, with a combined net worth of $666 billion, up $147 billion this year.Big winners so far in 2020 include Elon Musk, whose net worth has more than doubled to $69.7 billion on the back of surging Tesla Inc shares.Microsoft Corp. co-founder Gates and former CEO Steve Ballmer have also soared, long after they left the company. Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, whose fortune is tied up in the world’s largest oil refinery -- has also profited from the shift online. Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd., the conglomerate he controls, have risen 45% this year as the company has expanded into digital and retail businesses, making him the fifth richest person in the world.Among the top 10, only two have seen their wealth decline in 2020: luxury mogul Bernard Arnault and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s Warren Buffett. While tech has surged, more than 200 of the 500 billionaires tracked by Bloomberg have lost money this year.Giant tech companies control the infrastructure of the digital economy in a similar vein to how Gilded Age trusts monopolized America’s industrial economy at the turn of the 20th century. Yet in 1900, the five largest U.S. companies had combined market values that equaled less than 6% of the nation’s economy, according to estimates by Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Daron Acemoglu.Currently, five of the largest American tech companies -- Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft -- have market valuations equivalent to about 30% of U.S. gross domestic product. That’s almost double what they were at the end of 2018.The economic power of the Robber Barons created a fiery counter-reaction, in violent labor unrest and the adoption of reforms that once seemed radical, like the Sherman Antitrust Act and a federal income tax. Compared to the political difficulties faced by John D. Rockefeller and other early 20th-century industrial magnates, government moves against Big Tech have been relatively mild. At least so far.On the left, politicians including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders have delivered blistering attacks on widening inequality and the growing wealth of billionaires. Protesters have gathered outside Bezos’s Manhattan penthouse, demanding a wealth tax. Facebook employees have spoken out about their employer’s role in spreading disinformation and hate speech.New Gilded AgeMonopolists like Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie helped repair their public images with large-scale philanthropy, a move echoed in this new Gilded Age.The Giving Pledge, a commitment to give away the majority of your wealth in your lifetime, was founded by Gates and Buffett. Zuckerberg also has stepped into the realm of philanthropy, establishing the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, or CZI, in 2015 with a goal to “advance human potential and promote equality.”But even these acts have sparked criticism.“The modern ultra-billionaire is someone who feels a right, in many cases, to privately govern the people of the United States,” said Anand Giridharadas, author of “Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World,” an influential critique of billionaire philanthropy.Gates’s generosity and activism during the pandemic has earned him widespread praise, but it’s also attracted conspiracy theorists suspicious of his motives. A YouGov and Yahoo News poll found that 44% of Republicans and 19% of Democrats believed Gates wanted to use vaccinations to give people tracking implants.The criticism of Bezos also hasn’t let up, even as his giving increased recently with a $10 billion commitment in February to fight climate change and a $100 million donation in April to the nonprofit Feeding America. When he made the announcements, his wealth had already grown by significantly more than those amounts this year. He hasn’t signed the Giving Pledge.Signed PledgeMacKenzie Scott, Bezos’s ex-wife, signed the pledge not long after the two announced their split. Scott said Tuesday that she has since donated $1.7 billion to several causes including racial equity, climate change and public health.“There’s no question in my mind that anyone’s personal wealth is the product of a collective effort, and of social structures which present opportunities to some people, and obstacles to countless others,” she said.Big Tech companies have earned some grudging respect, even from critics, during the pandemic.“We have been fortunate to have these digital technologies,” said MIT’s Acemoglu. “Without them, the fallout from the lockdowns and social distancing would have been worse.”That may come with a cost: “This is going to make the domination of tech companies over the economy and our social lives much worse, and it’s going to significantly accelerate the trend toward greater automation,” Acemoglu said. He warns that tech’s rapid ascent may deepen inequality, shrink the number of good jobs, and weaken democracy.Such concerns could help shift Big Tech and its billionaires into the crosshairs of governments whose finances have been devastated by the pandemic. Heading into this year’s U.S. presidential race, Elizabeth Warren and Sanders proposed wealth taxes on billionaires, an idea that polled well with voters.Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, hasn’t embraced the wealth tax, but he’s campaigning on higher rates on the rich and corporations, as well as the closing of estate-tax loopholes.Absent a wealth tax or some other innovative new kind of levies, it will be difficult to tax the fortunes of Zuckerberg, Bezos and other tech billionaires. Much of their fortune is in the form of rising stock, which isn’t taxed until it’s sold.“Billionaires are accumulating a huge amount of unrealized capital gains, on which they’re not paying much –- if any -- tax,” said University of California at Berkeley economics professor Gabriel Zucman, who helped Sanders and Warren develop their wealth-tax proposals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bezos-zuckerberg-and-musk-have-made-115-billion-this-year/story-XEHRErICQ9NMZ9eaJGjQpN.html

Three of the 101 cases were imported, the NHC said.One case was recorded in Beijing on Tuesday following two cases, including one imported case reported on Monday, breaking the 20-day run of zero infections in the city, which had seen a new cluster breakout in June.A new outbreak in the northeastern city of Dalian, capital of the Liaoning province, has spilt over to at least nine cities across China including Beijing.Also read: Moderna vaccine protects 16 monkeys from coronavirus; 30,000 humans awaitAt least eight other cities in four provinces - including Tieling, Liaoning; Changchun, Jilin; Hegang, Heilongjiang; and Fuzhou, Fujian - had reported confirmed or asymptomatic cases transmitted from Dalian as of Tuesday, officials said.Until Tuesday, Dalian had reported more than 50 cases, all linked to a seafood processing centre.China has intensified Covid-19 testing and contact tracing at all the new outbreak points, health officials have said. Communities have been locked down for testing in some areas.More than 2.96 million samples for nucleic acid tests of Covid-19 had been collected by Monday in Dalian city in northeast China after new cases began emerging last week, local authorities said on Tuesday.Beijing, for example, locked down the community where a new Dalian-related Covid-19 patient was reported on Tuesday.According to official media, the community lifted its epidemic response from Level-III to Level-II and rolled out full testing for all 7,000 households, starting 5 am on Tuesday.The Tiantongyuan West No.3 community, located in Beijing’s Changping district, where the patient had stayed, has been put under strict restriction with no visitors, food or package delivery allowed.As of Tuesday, the overall confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland had reached 84,060, including 482 patients who were still being treated, with 25 in severe condition.Altogether, 78,944 people had been discharged after recovery and 4,634 had died of the disease in the mainland, the commission said.Two new imported cases were reported in Guangdong Province on Tuesday, while Shanghai saw one new imported case.By the end of Tuesday, a total of 2,056 imported cases had been reported in the mainland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-records-over-100-covid-19-cases-for-the-first-time-since-april/story-N9JOrSTbBoDl7C7gHm7NzK.html
29-07-2020||World||Trump administration won’t accept new DACA applications||The Trump administration said Tuesday that it will reject new applications and shorten renewal periods for an Obama-era program that shields young people from deportation, taking a defiant stance after the US Supreme Court refused to let it be scrapped completely. The move, detailed in a memo from Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, ended a month of uncertainty about how the administration would respond to its Supreme Court defeat in an election year that has President Donald Trump looking for ways to energize his base. Wolf said the administration may try to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program again, casting it as a law enforcement issue that could contribute to illegal immigration. He said the federal government needs more time to consider next steps, presenting the measures as a temporary change. “DACA makes clear that, for certain large classes of individuals, DHS will at least tolerate, if not affirmatively sanction, their ongoing violation of the immigration laws,” Wolf wrote in the memo. About 650,000 people are part of DACA, which allows young immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children to work and shields them from deportation. Roughly 66,000 people meet age requirements to apply, according to the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. The government will deny all new applications, limit renewals to one year instead of two, and deny requests by DACA recipients to visit their home countries unless there are “exceptional circumstances.” Recipients may seek permission to return home for family events, such as funerals or weddings, and other reasons, though the Trump administration has generally denied them. The Supreme Court ruled last month that Trump failed to follow rule-making procedures when he tried to end the program, but the justices kept a window open for him to try again. The White House has been devising plans to make another push to end DACA, though it was not immediately clear whether he would make the politically sensitive move before November’s election. Democratic rival Joe Biden wants to keep DACA unconditionally. A federal judge in Maryland ruled earlier this month that the program should be restored to its original form, but the administration was mum until Tuesday on whether it would start accepting new applications. The White House anticipates legal challenges. The administration’s monthlong silence had unnerved many DACA recipients and those who wanted to join. U.S. District Judge Paul Grimm of Maryland, an appointee of President Barack Obama, has given the administration until the end of Friday to update the US Citizenship and Immigration Services’ website and start adequately explaining why applications are rejected. Legal experts were sceptical of the Trump administration’s authority to roll back parts of the program. “This is a move that is in defiance of the US Supreme Court ruling and a federal court ruling,” said Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia, an immigration law professor at Penn State Law in University Park, Pennsylvania. “It’s a lawless landscape that we are in.” Immigrant rights advocates blasted the move as cruel. The Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition accused the administration of further marginalizing immigrants. The American Business Immigration Coalition called it economically harmful. And the American Civil Liberties Union vowed to continue its yearslong fight to prevent the program’s demise. Laura Mendoza, a program manager at The Resurrection Project in Chicago, joined DACA in 2013 and will have to renew next year. She said the USD 495 annual renewal fee would be difficult for many to pay. “It’s infuriating that we continue to be the punching bag for the administration,” she said of fellow DACA recipients. “The administration is slowly dismantling the program.” Wolf, the Homeland Security chief, acknowledged that the USD 495 renewal fee will be a burden on DACA recipients who will have to apply annually instead of every other year, effectively doubling the cost. He said the department would consider lowering the fee. Trump has tried unsuccessfully to work with Congress on a broader immigration package that would couple DACA with tougher enforcement measures. He has said lately that he would announce sweeping new steps on immigration, a promise he reiterated Tuesday. “We’re going to work with a lot of people on DACA,” Trump told reporters. “And we’re also working on an immigration bill, a merit-based system, which is what I’ve wanted for a long time.” Trump said he would make DACA recipients “happy” without saying how. Top Democrats urged for a legislative solution that would allow for a pathway to US citizenship. “With the presidential election just three months away, it’s clear the president will do everything possible to rally his supporters at the expense of Dreamers,” according to a statement from US Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, referring to the name often used for DACA recipients. “They shouldn’t have to live under the constant fear that DACA protections will be ripped away at any moment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-won-t-accept-new-daca-applications/story-Hu0johbXZuDh4STcdeylVM.html

29-07-2020||World||Canadian parliament plans to launch virtual voting for MPs||Virtual voting to pass legislation may become a reality in Canada this September, if recommendations from a Parliamentary panel are accepted.The House of Commons Procedure and House Affairs Committee has asked the chamber’s administration to develop a secure platform that can be used by MPs to vote remotely, even as Canada’s Parliament is expected to return to regular sittings in the third week of September.Canada has been holding sessions after the coronavirus outbreak but these have bene restricted to emergency measures related to the Covid-19 pandemic. It saw hybrid sittings, which allowed for a handful of members to be present in person while others joined in virtually.The panel, chaired by Indo-Canadian MP Ruby Sahota, now wants this to be applied when the House returns to regular business. The panels report stated that “a remote voting solution be built by the House of Commons administration for before September for legislative voting during the Covid-19 pandemic” and that “during virtual or hybrid sittings, members of the House of Commons can automatically avail themselves of remote voting by electronic means.”The panel said this ”dedicated secure” mechanism could be in the form of an app on the mobile devices used by MPs, and that it be integrated into the vote management system currently in use, feature end-to-end encryption and various methods of authentication and validation.The panel recommended that this “secure virtual voting system include when members of the House of Commons should vote, what they are voting on, how much time they have to vote, how they can check their vote, and how they could correct a vote cast in error.”While some Members of Parliament have been able to attend the limited sittings of Parliament during the crisis as they lived within the vicinity of the Canadian capital of Ottawa, the report noted that there may be “an increased health risk” to some MPs or their immediate family members who may be vulnerable to the disease, especially if members had to attend sittings in person and had to travel between the capital and their ridings, the term for constituencies in Canada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-parliament-plans-to-launch-virtual-voting-for-mps/story-V5eVF0uvglD3nrgorQ7c3L.html

The primates didn’t show any sign of creating enhanced disease, a problem that has occasionally been associated with vaccines.The results, if they hold up in humans, suggest that the vaccine may be able to protect against Covid-19 in both the upper and lower airways. In all the monkeys who got the high doses of the vaccine, no viral replication was detectable in their noses two days after being challenged with the virus, according to the study results. And no viral replication was seen in the lung fluid of 7 of 8 animals in both dose groups after being challenged with the virus. All 16 monkeys showed at least some sign of protection, with limited lung inflammation seen in the lungs of both groups.While the data is encouraging, a far bigger test is under way for Moderna, involving 30,000 humans. The phase 3 trial to determine the safety and efficacy of the vaccine will begin producing data in November or December. The vaccine uses messenger RNA, a synthetic form of genetic material from the virus designed to nudge the body’s immune system into attack mode. The U.S. government is providing $955 million to help fund the vaccine’s development.Moderna shares rose 2% to $81.49 at the close in New York.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-vaccine-protects-16-monkeys-from-coronavirus-30-000-humans-await/story-fYxykbod4znyRbJjUZ77OK.html
29-07-2020||World||Intel ousts its chief engineer Murthy Renduchintala||Intel Corp’s Chief Engineering Officer Murthy Renduchintala is departing, part of a move in which a key technology unit will be separated into five teams, the chipmaker said on Monday.Intel said it is reorganizing its technology, systems architecture and client group. Its new leaders will report directly to Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan.Ann Kelleher, a 24-year Intel veteran, will lead development of 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer chip technology processes. Last week, the company had said the smaller, faster 7-nanometer chipmaking technology was six months behind schedule and it would have to rely more on outside chipmakers to keep its products competitive.Renduchintala, who was president of the wide-ranging group before its reorganization and widely seen as a No. 2 to Swan, joined Intel in 2015. He was executive vice president of Qualcomm Inc , and has been on Accenture’s board since April 2018.Renduchintala was one of several key hires from outside Intel, which had been famous in Silicon Valley for developing and promoting talent from within. He was hired as part of a strategy to go after broader markets than the central processing units, or CPUs, the company became known for in the PC era. One major effort, creating modem chips to connect smart phones to mobile data networks, ended last year. Intel sold the business to Apple for $1 billion, a fraction of what it had invested in the effort.Renduchintala eventually took responsibly for turning around Intel’s process technology, which struggled with years of delay for its current 10-nanometer process. CEO Swan told investors in November that Intel was set start catching up to rivals with its 7-nanometer process in early 2021, but was forced to reverse himself last week because of the delays.Intel said Renduchintala will depart Aug. 3.

29-07-2020||World||Masked mourners brave heat, Covid-19 fears to honour John Lewis||Mourners braved both coronavirus fears and brutal heat on Tuesday to pay their respects to the late Representative John Lewis, the first Black lawmaker to lie in state at the Capitol Rotunda. The crowds were thin and lines nonexistent, partially because of high temperatures. But those who came said it was important to personally honour a civil rights icon who died just as America was confronting another national reckoning over entrenched racial iniquities. “He was worth the virus risk and worth every drop of sweat,” said Alicia Patterson, 66, who came from Maryland with three generations of her family to observe Lewis’ flag-draped casket. “He worked hard for all of us, and he deserved this and more.” Lewis died July 17 of cancer at the age of 80. The long-serving Georgia congressman took part in Martin Luther King’s 1963 March on Washington. He was awarded the Medal of Freedom in 2011 by Barack Obama and is the first Black lawmaker to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda. With almost no lines Tuesday afternoon, dozens of visitors were able to linger and take pictures outside the Capitol. Many brought umbrellas to block the summer sun. The spectre of the Covid-19 pandemic hung over all aspects of the mourning. In addition to face coverings, which were declared mandatory outdoors by Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, yellow dots on the grounds reminded mourners to stand 6 feet (1.8 metres) apart. Instead of a guest book to write in, mourners could scan a code on their phones and write messages in a virtual condolence book. The casket itself was at the top of the steps on the east side of the Capitol building, while mourners were restricted to the bottom of the steps. “I just felt I had to come and pay my respects,” said Phillip Estes, a 53-year old urban planner and DC resident. “It’s a generational passing, and it feels really important now with the country’s renewed interest in advancing racial equality and social justice.” Born near Troy, Alabama, Lewis was among the original Freedom Riders, a group of young activists who boarded commercial passenger buses and travelled through the segregated Jim Crow South. They were assaulted and battered at many stops along the way, by citizens and authorities alike. Lewis was the youngest and last-living of those who spoke on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial at the March on Washington. “He was there for the beginning of it all,” said Jay Stegall, a 33-year old American University graduate student and Atlanta native who came with his two sisters and his 4-year-old daughter. “I thought it was important for them to see this.” One of Lewis’ final public appearances was a June 7 visit to the corner of 16th and H streets in front of the White House. The intersection, which was the epicentre of several days of clashes and protests over police brutality and systemic racism, had just been renamed Black Lives Matter Plaza by Bowser. “That was a really amazing and poetic moment,” Stegall said. “I think it was important that he lived to see a resurgence of what he started. Now it’s time to finish it.” When Lewis’ casket arrived Monday at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, the motorcade stopped at Black Lives Matter Plaza as it wound through Washington before arriving at the Capitol. Notably absent was President Donald Trump, who also skipped Monday’s emotional ceremony honouring Lewis. Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, paid their respects on Monday, but Trump said he would not attend. The pair had an openly adversarial relationship: Trump called Lewis’ Atlanta congressional district “crime-infested” while Lewis frequently criticized Trump’s racially divisive tactics, and once questioned his legitimacy as president. Several mourners said Trump was not missed. “It wouldn’t have been authentic. It would just have been another photo op for him,” Stegall said. “He definitely wouldn’t have understood the meaning of the moment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/masked-mourners-brave-heat-virus-fears-to-honour-john-lewis/story-BTeQ5jnoZXvFUL37DustxL.html

He said that’s “reasonable” because Maxwell and her legal team will know the names of all the women to prepare for her trial even if the public doesn’t.In an indictment unsealed July 2, Maxwell is accused of engaging in a sex-trafficking scheme with Epstein by luring three underage girls so the financier could sexually abuse them. The three victims are identified in the indictment only as “Jane Does.”At least 16 women came forward last year at a hearing held before the federal judge presiding over Epstein’s sex-trafficking case dismissed the indictment after he committed suicide while awaiting trial.Maxwell, 58, who has pleaded not guilty, is being held at a federal jail in Brooklyn, New York, and is scheduled to go to trial next July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ghislaine-maxwell-wants-epstein-s-accusers-names-to-be-made-in-public/story-HUN8NK1fjWizbP7H4IY35N.html
29-07-2020||World||Trump tweets in defense of disproved Covid-19 treatment||President Donald Trump issued a stout defense Tuesday of a disproved use of a malaria drug as a treatment for the coronavirus, hours after social media companies moved to take down videos promoting its use as potentially harmful misinformation.The president, in a marked shift from the more measured approach he’s taken toward the virus in recent days, took to Twitter to promote hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, and to amplify criticism of Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert. In a White House briefing, Trump defended his decision to promote a viral video of a group of doctors promoting the use of the drug Monday, even though his own administration withdrew emergency authorization for its use against the coronavirus. “I think they’re very respected doctors,” Trump said, adding they believed in the drug. “There was a woman who was spectacular in her statements about it.” The doctors, members of a group called America’s Frontline Doctors, took part in an event organized by Tea Party Patriots Action, a dark money group that has helped fund a pro-Trump political action committee.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage Scientific studies have shown hydroxychloroquine can do more harm than good when used to treat symptoms of Covid-19. Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr, and others shared video of the event on Facebook and Twitter, prompting both companies to step in and remove the content as part of an aggressive push to keep the sites free of potentially harmful information about the virus — though not before more than 17 million people had seen one version of the video circulating on the web. The decision to remove the videos sparked conservative claims of “censorship,” with Simone Gold, one of the doctors, tweeting that “there are always opposing views in medicine.” “Treatment options for Covid-19 should be debated, and spoken about among our colleagues in the medical field,” she wrote. “They should never, however, be censored and silenced.” Others stressed the differences between medical opinion and peer-reviewed scientific studies. Many high-quality studies have found no evidence that hydroxychloroquine, when used with or without the antibiotic azithromycin, as touted many times by Trump, helps treat coronavirus infection or prevent serious disease from it. They include studies commissioned by the US National Institutes of Health, the World Health Organization and universities in the US and around the world. Because of the lack of benefit and the risks of serious side effects such as heart rhythm problems, the US Food and Drug Administration recently revoked its brief authorization of emergency use of the drug for Covid-19. NIH treatment guidelines also specifically recommend against hydroxychloroquine’s use, except in formal studies. In addition to sharing the video, Trump retweeted several tweets that attacked the credibility of Fauci, a leading member of the White House coronavirus task force. Later, Trump appeared to back away from his criticism of Fauci, saying, “I get along with him very well” and even appearing envious of his widespread approval rating. “He’s got a very good approval rating, and I like that,” Trump said, adding that Fauci and White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx work for him, “And yet they’re highly thought of but nobody likes me.” Fauci has become an off-and-on target of Trump and some of his White House aides and outside allies, who disagreed with the doctor’s early recommendation to shut down the economy as a way to slow the virus, which is surging again in parts of the country, mostly in the South and West. Trump, in recent interviews, has described Fauci as “a bit of an alarmist” and accused him of making “mistakes” in his coronavirus guidance. But Trump also says he gets along with the longtime head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci said Tuesday that he’ll deal with the attacks by keeping his head down and doing his job. He also backed the conclusions of the FDA and others about hydroxychloroquine and Covid-19. Asked if he can do his job while Trump publicly questions his credibility, Fauci said the stakes are too high not to stay involved. “We’re in the middle of a crisis with regard to an epidemic, a pandemic. This is what I do,” Fauci said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” “This is what I’ve been trained for my entire professional life and I’ll continue to do it.” Facebook, Twitter and YouTube began scrubbing their sites of the video of the doctors on Monday. Conservative news outlets, groups and internet personalities shared it. Facebook said the video is “sharing false information about cures and treatments for Covid-19,” according to spokesman Andy Stone. Twitter also said it was working to remove the video. The company also took down a tweet from Donald Trump Jr. describing one version of the video as a “must watch!!!” and temporarily halted him from tweeting. In the video, Dr. Stella Immanuel, a physician from Houston whom Trump described as spectacular, promotes hydroxychloroquine as a sure-fire cure for the coronavirus. She claims to have successfully treated 350 people “and counting,” including older patients and some with underlying medical conditions. “You don’t need masks, there is a cure,” Immanuel says in the video. But in videos posted to her Facebook page, Immanuel regularly wears masks while preaching during religious events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-tweets-in-defense-of-disproved-covid-19-treatment/story-d9ubuD5EsP7tweuCGoBY7O.html
29-07-2020||World||Moderna aims to price coronavirus vaccine at $50-$60 per course: Report||Moderna Inc is planning to price its coronavirus vaccine at $50 to $60 per course, at least $11 more than another vaccine from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing unnamed sources.Moderna’s proposed price for a two-dose course sold to governments compares with $39 for two doses under a deal that Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech struck with the US government.Industry analysts said Pfizer and BioNTech’s $2 billion deal to cover 50 million patients, which is contingent on an approvable product, would likely pressure other manufacturers to set similar prices.Moderna’s proposed price would apply to the United States and other high-income countries, according to the report.A Moderna spokesperson said the company was in discussions with governments about potential supply of the vaccine, called mRNA-1273, but did not provide any details on pricing “given the confidential nature of the discussions and contracts.”The final price for Moderna’s Covid vaccine has yet to be determined, a person familiar with the discussions told Reuters.Pfizer, Moderna and Merck & Co have said they plan to sell their vaccines at a profit, while some drugmakers, including Johnson & Johnson have announced plans to price their vaccines on a not-for-profit basis.AstraZeneca Plc agreed to provide the United States 300 million doses of its potential vaccine in exchange for $1.2 billion in upfront funding, which works out to $4 per dose.The U.S. government has provided Moderna with nearly $1 billion in funding to support its research and development efforts for its potential Covid-19 vaccine.The funding is part of “Operation Warp Speed,” an initiative by the Trump administration to hasten the production of an inoculation for Covid-19, which has so far killed around 650,000 people worldwide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-aims-to-price-coronavirus-vaccine-at-50-60-per-course-report/story-bOZGvHNHAKSFUVDNjRajUK.html
29-07-2020||World||‘Nobody likes me’: Trump on Fauci’s high approval ratings||President Donald Trump groused on Tuesday about medical expert Anthony Fauci’s high approval ratings and joked that “nobody likes me” as he struggles to improve his standing with voters for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.“It can only be my personality,” said Trump.Fauci, an infectious disease expert who is on Trump’s coronavirus task force, is one of the most trusted people in government and many Americans listen to his advice diligently on how to protect themselves from infection.Trump, on the other hand, has drawn criticism over his handling of the pandemic, putting him in jeopardy of losing the Nov. 3 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden.The subject of Fauci came up at a news conference where Trump defended his support for malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a hedge against the virus. Trump said he felt the drug worked “in the early stages.”Most public health experts say hydroxychloroquine should not be used to treat the coronavirus because it could lead to heart and other problems.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last month revoked its emergency-use authorization for hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 after several studies cast doubt on its effectiveness.Trump said he and others in his administration deserved plaudits for their handling of the virus, not just Fauci and another prominent member of the task force, Deborah Birx.“He’s working with our administration and for the most part we have done pretty much what he and others, Dr. Birx and others, who are terrific, recommended. And he’s got this high approval rating. So why don’t I have a high approval rating and the administration with respect to the virus? We should have a very high (approval rating),” Trump said.“So it sort of is curious, a man works for us, and yet they’re highly thought of and nobody likes me. It can only be my personality,” he said.The recent rise in U.S. deaths and infections has dampened early hopes that the country was past the worst of a crisis that has decimated businesses and put millions of Americans out of work. Four U.S. states in the South and West reported one-day records of coronavirus deaths on Tuesday. The national death toll is almost 150,000.Fauci has been a subject of debate within the White House for months because he is quite frank in saying where he agrees and disagrees with the president.Trump has said repeatedly that Fauci advised him he did not have to close down travel with China, where the outbreak originated, early this year when the scope of the pandemic was not yet clear, and that he did not accept the advice.White House chief of staff Mark Meadows publicly chided Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro for writing an opinion article attacking Fauci.(Reporting by Steve Holland; Writing by Alexandra Alper; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Peter Cooney)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobody-likes-me-trump-on-fauci-s-high-approval-ratings/story-Xmm6HcKeeiLakl1vueGpFI.html
29-07-2020||World||Scientists get closer to blood test for Alzheimer’s disease||An experimental blood test was highly accurate at distinguishing people with Alzheimer’s disease from those without it in several studies, boosting hopes that there soon may be a simple way to help diagnose this most common form of dementia. Developing such a test has been a long-sought goal, and scientists warn that the new approach still needs more validation and is not yet ready for wide use. But Tuesday’s results suggest they’re on the right track. The testing identified people with Alzheimer’s vs. no dementia or other types of it with accuracy ranging from 89 per cent to 98 per cent. “That’s pretty good. We’ve never seen that” much precision in previous efforts, said Maria Carrillo, the Alzheimer’s Association’s chief science officer. Dr Eliezer Masliah, neuroscience chief at the US National Institute on Aging, agreed. “The data looks very encouraging,” he said. The new testing “appears to be even more sensitive and more reliable” than earlier methods, but it needs to be tried in larger, more diverse populations, he said. The institute had no role in these studies but financed earlier, basic research toward blood test development. Results were discussed at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference taking place online because of the coronavirus pandemic. Some results also were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. More than 5 million people in the United States and many more worldwide have Alzheimer’s. Current drugs only temporarily ease symptoms and do not slow mental decline. The disease is usually diagnosed through tests of memory and thinking skills, but that’s very imprecise and usually involves a referral to a neurologist. More reliable methods such as spinal fluid tests and brain scans are invasive or expensive, so a simple blood test that could be done in a family doctor’s office would be a big advance. Last year, scientists reported encouraging results from experimental blood tests that measure abnormal versions of amyloid, one of two proteins that build up and damage Alzheimer’s patients’ brains. The new work focuses on the other protein — tau — and finds that one form of it called p-tau217 is a more reliable indicator. Several companies and universities have developed experimental p-tau217 tests. Dr Oskar Hansson of Lund University in Sweden led a study of Eli Lilly’s test on more than 1,400 people already enrolled in dementia studies in Sweden, Arizona and Colombia. They included people with no impairment, mild impairment, Alzheimer’s and other neurological diseases. The p-tau217 test outperformed a host of other measures for indicating which patients had Alzheimer’s as verified by brain scans. It also was comparable to the brain scans and some spinal tests in accuracy. The Arizona portion of the study included 81 people who had donated their brains upon death, so researchers were able to show that blood testing while they were alive closely matched evidence of disease later. The Colombia part of the study included people with a rare gene that virtually destines them to develop Alzheimer’s at a young age, typically in their 40s. In those with the gene, p-tau217 blood levels started to rise “around 20 years before symptoms,” Hansson said. The study’s sponsors include the US National Institutes of Health, Swedish government health groups, the Alzheimer’s Association, many foundations and several companies. Some study leaders work for Lilly or consult for the company. Two other research groups independently reported evidence for p-tau217 testing at the conference. Scientists at the University of California, San Francisco, found it helped distinguish people with Alzheimer’s from those with another neurological disease — frontotemporal lobar degeneration — with 96 per cent accuracy in a study of 617 people. Dr Suzanne Schindler of Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, also found p-tau217 better than some other indicators for revealing which patients had plaques in the brain — the hallmark of Alzheimer’s. “When patients come to me with changes in their memory and thinking, one of the major questions is, what’s the cause? Is it Alzheimer’s disease or is it something else?” she said. If tau testing bears out, “it would help us diagnose people earlier and more accurately.” Schindler has already launched a larger study in a diverse population in St. Louis. Researchers have done the same in Sweden. If benefits are confirmed, Masliah, Carrillo and others say they hope a commercial test would be ready for wide use in about two years.

29-07-2020||World||US officials say Russia is spreading virus disinformation||Russian intelligence operatives are using a trio of English-language websites to spread disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic, seeking to exploit a crisis that America is struggling to contain ahead of the presidential election in November, US officials said Tuesday. Two Russians who have held senior roles in Moscow’s military intelligence service known as the GRU have been identified as responsible for a disinformation effort directed at American and Western audiences, US government officials said. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The information had previously been classified, but officials said it had been downgraded so they could more freely discuss it. Officials said they were doing so now to sound the alarm about the particular websites and to expose a connection between the sites and Russian intelligence. Between late May and early July, one of the officials said, a trio of websites published about 150 articles about the pandemic response, including coverage aimed at propping up Russia and denigrating the US. Among the headlines that caught the attention of US officials are “Russia’s Counter COVID-19 Aid to America Advances Case for Détente,” which suggested that Russia had given urgent and substantial aid to the US to fight the pandemic, and “Beijing Believes COVID-19 is a Biological Weapon.” The disclosure comes as the spread of disinformation, including by Russia, is an urgent concern heading into November’s presidential election as US officials look to avoid a repeat of the 2016 contest, when Russia launched a covert social media campaign to divide American public opinion to favor then-candidate Donald Trump. The country’s chief counterintelligence official warned in a public statement Friday about Russia’s continued use of internet trolls to advance their goals. Even apart from politics, the twin crises buffeting the country and much of the world — the pandemic and race relations and protests — have offered fertile territory for misinformation or outfight falsehoods. Officials described the disinformation as part of an ongoing and persistent Russian effort to cause confusion. They did not say whether the effort was directly related to the November election, though some of the coverage on the websites appeared to denigrate Trump’s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden. The stories call to mind Russian efforts from 2016 to exacerbate race relations in America and drive corruption allegations against US political figures.

29-07-2020||World||China freezes Hong Kong’s extradition treaties with UK, Australia, Canada||China on Tuesday announced the suspension of Hong Kong’s extradition treaties with Canada, Australia and Britain in a tit-for-tat move following similar decisions by them over a controversial national security law.“China has decided to suspend extradition treaties between Hong Kong and Canada, Australia and UK, as well as criminal justice cooperation agreements,” said foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin. “The wrong action of Canada, Australia and the UK in politicising judicial cooperation with Hong Kong has seriously hurt the basis of judicial cooperation.” Later, China’s foreign minister Wang Yi slammed the US for “reckless provocation of confrontation” after both sides ordered tit-for-tat closures of each other’s consulates, but called for “rational communication” between the two powers.Earlier, New Zealand said it will suspend its extradition treaty with Hong Kong. Foreign minister Winston Peters said the new law went against commitments China had made to the international community.The US and Australia on Monday opened top-level talks in which they are expected to seek a common front against China.US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and defence secretary Mark Esper welcomed to Washington their Australian counterparts, Marise Payne and Linda Reynolds, for discussions.A Hong Kong pro-democracy activist said he has been fired by his university after he served jail time for taking part in protests.Law professor Benny Tai, 56, decried his sacking by the University of Hong Kong and accused education chiefs of bowing to political pressure from Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-freezes-hong-kong-s-extradition-treaties-with-uk-australia-canada/story-yMOiLYpH8TWUIXz8RPDW0N.html
29-07-2020||World||Joe Biden vows to fight racial inequalities with economic agenda||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden promised Tuesday that his economic agenda would combat long-standing racial inequalities in US society as he sought to draw another sharp contrast with President Donald Trump.Biden said the Republican president is exacerbating social discord across the country, including by sending federal authorities into major cities under the pretense of addressing crime, and has little interest in addressing the racism that Biden said has been laid bare by the Covid-19 pandemic and an election-year reckoning with police violence against Black men.“He’s shown that he can’t beat the pandemic and keep you safe,” Biden said, speaking in a community center gymnasium in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. “He can’t turn the economy around. He’s determined to stoke division and chaos. It’s not good for the country, but Donald Trump doesn’t care. His campaign is failing and he’s looking for a lifeline.”Biden countered with a litany of proposals to steer more federal money and tax credits to various small business and economic development programs for minority-owned firms and disadvantaged neighborhoods. Biden also said he’d encourage home ownership to help close wealth gaps among minority communities.Many of his proposals — and the billions in federal spending needed to pay for it — had already been promised as part of previous, larger Biden plans to jump-start the economy when the coronavirus outbreak begins to recede. But as protests against institutional racism and police brutality have swept the country in recent months, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee is attempting to show voters that he’s committed to implementing specific remedies that can promote racial and economic equality should he win the White House in November.It’s also another way for Biden to lambaste Trump, who has spent weeks vowing to restore “law and order” and ordering federal authorities to intervene against ongoing protests in places like Portland, Oregon, and Chicago, while small businesses around the country continue to struggle or shut down under economic struggles from the coronavirus.Biden accused Trump of distracting the country and trying to scare voters by dispatching federal authorities to cities. The former vice president said most demonstrators are “peaceful protesters” who aren’t a threat to be met by federal power. “Arsonists and anarchists should be prosecuted,” Biden said, but added that “local law enforcement can do that.”Still, Biden said “this election is not just about voting against Donald Trump. It’s about rising to this moment of crisis, understanding people’s struggle and building a future worthy of their courage and ambition to overcome.”And he said that means thinking about every policy debate in terms of structural inequalities.The former vice president wants to take $30 billion, or 10% of federal investment he’s already promised as part of larger economic plans, and funnel it into a “Small Business Opportunity Fund” designed to leverage $5 of private investment for minority owned enterprises for each $1 in public funds allocated. He also plans to spend $50 billion to provide startup capital that can help entrepreneurs of color start businesses in disadvantaged areas.To encourage home ownership, the plan would create a $15,000 federal tax credit to help low-and middle-income families cover down payments on their first homes. It also pledges to build 1.5 million new homes and public housing units in hopes of addressing the affordable housing crisis that has hit many of the nation’s marquee cities and disproportionately hurt people of color.Biden also said the Federal Reserve’s mission should be revised to specifically charge the central bank with addressing “persistent racial gaps” in economic opportunities and wealth, rather than a more general focus on maximum employment and stable pricing.Biden similarly vowed to undo Trump administration regulatory changes that the Democratic presidential nominee says “gutted” Obama administration rules preventing housing discrimination and unfair lending practices.Asked about the possibility of a congressional study on the feasibility of federal reparations to descendants of enslaved Black people in the United States, senior Biden officials said their candidate wouldn’t oppose such a study. But they defended Tuesday’s proposal as doing more to benefit Black Americans in the short term, saying, “He is not going to wait on a study to create change.”Biden’s plan also doesn’t endorse legalizing marijuana, though it seeks to clear logistical court hurdles so that states can better identify nonviolent offenders whose records they might opt to expunge. Black and Hispanic Americans often face far harsher penalties for crimes involving marijuana possession than their white counterparts.The Democratic National Committee’s convention platform committee voted by a wide margin on Monday to keep language calling for legalization of marijuana nationwide out of the party’s platform.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-vows-to-fight-racial-inequalities-with-economic-agenda/story-zqwlyTOsR2NYtkdUQuzyxK.html
29-07-2020||World||US protests: Attorney General William Barr defends aggressive federal response||Attorney General William Barr defended the aggressive federal law enforcement response to civil unrest in America as he testified for the first time before the House Judiciary Committee, pushing back against angry, skeptical Democrats who said President Donald Trump’s administration is unconstitutionally suppressing dissent.The hearing, held Tuesday as the late civil rights icon John Lewis laid in state steps away outside the Capitol, highlighted the wide election-year gulf between the two parties on police brutality and systemic racism in law enforcement. Massive protests have sparked unrest across the nation following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, and calls for police reform are growing louder.But Barr said “violent rioters and anarchists have hijacked legitimate protests” and argued the violence taking place in Portland, Oregon, and other cities is disconnected from Floyd’s killing, which he called a “horrible” event that prompted a necessary national reckoning on the relationship between the Black community and law enforcement. But he also said there was no systemic racism in law enforcement.“Largely absent from these scenes of destruction are even superficial attempts by the rioters to connect their actions to George Floyd’s death or any legitimate call for reform,” Barr said of the Portland protests.The hearing marks Barr’s first appearance before the committee after 18 months in office, bringing him face-to-face with the panel that voted last year to hold him in contempt and is holding hearings on what Democrats say is politicization of the Justice Department under his watch. But little new ground was uncovered; fuming Democrats often used their five minutes to lay out their frustrations and cut Barr off as he attempted to answer questions.The hearing comes during a tumultuous stretch in which Barr has taken actions cheered by President Donald Trump but condemned by Democrats and other critics. Among them: the Justice Department’s decision to drop the prosecution of former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn and Barr’s urging for a more lenient sentence for Trump ally Roger Stone, a move that prompted the entire trial team’s departure. Trump later commuted the sentence entirely.Republicans were ready to back Barr up, with the top Republican on the panel, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, using his opening statement to show an eight-minute video that spliced together images of violence by protesters around the country.Democrats retorted with a video of their own of more peaceful protesters, shown by Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline.“We fought for democracy, for the right to speak freely and you are attempting to take that away,” Cicilline told Barr. “What’s worse, you’re doing it for the sole purpose of furthering the president’s political agenda and generating footage for Trump campaign commercials.”Opening the hearing, committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said the Trump administration had “twisted the Department of Justice into a shadow of its former self,” serving the powerful before average Americans. He said the committee has a responsibility to protect Americans “from that kind of corruption.”Nadler said Barr had “aided and abetted” Trump’s worst impulses and excoriated him and the Justice Department for turning a blind eye to necessary reforms to police departments, for dismissing Black Lives Matter protests and for flooding streets with federal agents to stop protesters.Under combative questioning, Barr acerbically defended himself but revealed little new information about his motivations or the Justice Department’s recent actions on policing or otherwise.“Many of the Democrats on this Committee have attempted to discredit me by conjuring up a narrative that I am simply the President’s factotum who disposes of criminal cases according to his instructions,” Barr said in his opening statement. “Judging from the letter inviting me to this hearing, that appears to be your agenda today.”On policing, Barr’s testimony underscored his department’s ongoing effort to differentiate between increasing violence in some cities and Floyd’s death, which has led to state charges against four officers and is under investigation by federal authorities. Massive but peaceful demonstrations followed Floyd’s death in May.The attorney general acknowledged to lawmakers Floyd’s death struck a chord in the Black community because it reinforced concerns Black people are treated differently by police. But he condemned Americans who he says have responded inappropriately to Floyd’s death through what he said was rioting and anarchy.“As elected officials of the federal government, every member of this committee — regardless of your political views or your feelings about the Trump administration — should condemn violence against federal officers and destruction of federal property,” Barr said. “So should state and local leaders who have a responsibility to keep their communities safe.”Civil unrest escalated in Portland after federal agents were accused of whisking people away in unmarked cars without probable cause; the people were detained and later released. And in Washington, D.C., peaceful protesters were violently cleared from the streets by federal officers using smoke bombs and pepper balls last month before a photo op by Trump in front of St. John’s church, where Barr had accompanied him.He defended the broad use of law enforcement power to deal with the situation, noting that protesters had earlier set fire to the church and “it was total consensus that you couldn’t allow that to happen so close to the White House.” The department’s internal watchdog has opened investigations into use of force and other tactics by agents in Washington and Portland.He also said the force was used because the protesters would not disperse from the area when law enforcement officials were trying to move back the security perimeter, a decision made the night before. When pressed on details, he pointed to the investigations.The use of pepper spray was warranted, even if peaceful protesters were also harmed, he said.Beyond the federal response to the demonstrations, Barr was pressed in detail about his intervention in the Flynn and Stone cases, both of which arose from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. Democrats criticized him for partly taking into account Stone’s health and age, 67, and said those standards haven’t been used in other similar cases.Barr said he told the acting U.S. attorney that “we are going to leave it up to the judge” and that he ordered the revised recommendation to be filed when the line prosecutors submitted an initial recommendation calling for a sentence of seven to nine years.“And even though I knew I would get a lot of criticism for doing that, I think at the end of the day my obligation is to be fair to the individual,” Barr said.Republicans and Democrats also repeatedly revisited Mueller’s probe, with Democrats arguing he downplayed the report to the public before it was released and Republicans pressing him on the origins of the probe. Justice officials are now investigating the previous Justice Department’s decisions as it started investigating Trump’s ties to Russia during the Obama administration and Barr has been sharply critical of his predecessors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/attorney-general-william-barr-defends-aggressive-federal-response-to-protests/story-rUvB2ZN8xaBR5XUW7OGU1J.html
29-07-2020||India||Supreme Court slams IIT-B for backing out of smog tower project||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday took strong exception to Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay backing out of the proposal to construct smog towers in Delhi on an experimental basis to combat air pollution. A three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra warned contempt of court action against IIT officials after solicitor general Tushar Mehta informed the court that IIT Bombay had expressed unwillingness to take responsibility for the project and was proposing to back out.“How can they back out from a central government project after this court passed orders? Is it a child’s game? We will not tolerate this nonsense. We will draw contempt against them,” a livid justice Mishra remarked during the hearing of a case concerning air pollution in the national capital.The court during the last hearing, on July 21, had asked the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with IIT Bombay and Tata Projects Limited within seven days for installation of smog tower in Delhi.Tushar Mehta, however, told the court on Wednesday that the centre was exploring new options with National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and IIT Delhi since IIT Bombay had backed out but the court found the suggestion unacceptable.“We will proceed against IIT Bombay. I cannot tolerate this nonsense,” he said.The bench, which also comprised justices Vineet Saran and MR Shah, insisted Mehta talk to IIT officials and get back to the court with instructions within 15 minutes. Mehta, however, expressed his inability to obtain instructions at such a short notice and requested the court to grant time till Thursday.“How can I take instructions within 15 minutes? I don’t know anyone there (IIT Bombay),” Mehta replied.“We are not happy with IIT Bombay for violation of order of this court and for backing out,” the court said posting the case for Thursday, when IIT Bombay is expected to respond to the court.Calls to IIT Bombay’s public relations office went unanswered. Rising pollution levels in the national capital, despite various orders by the Supreme Court had incensed the apex court during a hearing on November 25, 2019. The court had then asked the CPCB and the states of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to take a concrete decision on installation and operation of smog towers to control pollution. It had also asked the Centre to constitute a high-level committee to study the use and feasibility of various technologies.The Centre constituted a high-level committee two days after that to examine and implement various technological options to arrest air pollution in the capital.The Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) had then proposed installation of smog towers as a pilot project in collaboration with IIT Bombay. Subsequently, the top court had on January 13 given green signal for the proposal and asked CPCB to install smog tower at Anand Vihar in east Delhi within three months. Another order was passed on February 28 to start work on smog towers and intimate the court about its status by March 6.The CPCB initiated various rounds of talks with IIT Bombay regarding the project and three versions of MoU were exchanged between CPCB and IIT. However, the talks bore no fruition, as IIT was not ready to take overall responsibility for the project including verification of works carried out by Tata Projects Limited (which was involved by IIT for construction, operation and maintenance of smog tower).The MoEF and the CPCB then filed an affidavit before the apex court on July 20 stating that the work on smog tower could not commence due to a deadlock with IIT regarding the finalization of the terms and conditions of the proposed MoU.The IIT was not willing to take up overall responsibility for the installation of the tower even though the project itself was conceptualised and developed by IIT in co-ordination with various other partners/ agencies, the CPCB said in its affidavit.Due to the same, the MoU has not been signed so far and ground work for installation of tower could not commence, it was submitted. The Supreme Court, however, refused to accept the stance by CPCB during the hearing on July 21 and ordered signing of MoU with IIT Bombay within seven days.Non-compliance with this order of July 21 on Wednesday incensed the bench, which said that if IIT Bombay had any issues, it should have informed the bench in January of the same and not after six months.“We will punish IIT Bombay. How can they back out after 6 months?” justice Mishra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-slams-iit-b-for-backing-out-of-smog-tower-project/story-LuHxkKJPpOWY8HNrIyFPPJ.html
29-07-2020||India||Woman in MP’s Betul plotted murder of judge and family, arrested with 5 others: Police||Police in Betul district of Madhya Pradesh arrested six people including a woman on Wednesday for allegedly killing an additional district and sessions judge (ADJ) and his 33-year-old son and also attempting to kill the judge’s wife and another son by mixing poison in flour. The woman Sandhya Singh (45), who runs an NGO in Chhindwara district was the brain behind the crime and wanted to eliminate the judge and his entire family, police said. Besides Sandhya Singh, a resident of Rewa district, the others with whom she hatched the conspiracy for committing the crime include her driver Sanju Chandrawanshi, Devilal Chandrawanshi, Mubeen Khan, Kamal Singh and Baba alias Ramdayal who claims to be a sorcerer. All of them are residents of Chhindawara and have been arrested under sections 302, 328, 307 and 120-B of Indian Penal Code, said police. ADJ Mahendra Kumar Tripathi (56) and his two sons Abhiyanraj Tripathi (33) and Ashishraj (25) fell ill at his official residence at Betul, 175 kilometres south of Bhopal, on July 20 after eating dinner. They got some medical treatment for two days but when their condition deteriorated they were admitted to a local private hospital in Betul on July 23 where Ashishraj recovered while the condition of his father and brother deteriorated, police said. The judge and his elder son were referred to a private hospital in Nagpur on Saturday (July 25). Abhiyanraj was declared brought dead at Nagpur hospital the same day while Mahendra Tripathi died on Sunday morning, according to police. Betul police had already started an investigation after the judge and his sons were moved to hospital. The judge had told the police that their condition deteriorated after having chapaatis (bread). Since his wife Bhagya Tripathi did not eat the chapaatis she did not fall ill.Superintendent of police Simala Prasad said, “Sandhya Singh runs an NGO and came in contact with Mahendra Tripathi during his posting in Chhindwara 10 years ago. Later, ADJ Tripathi was transferred to Betul and Tripathi’s two sons- Abhiyan Raj, 33, and Ashish Raj, 25, and his wife Bhagya also shifted to Betul four months ago. When the judge’s family shifted to Betul, Sandhya was not able to meet Tripathi which led to altercations between the two. She also had a fight with Tripathi over investing some money.”“Due to continuous altercations, Sandhya decided to kill Tripathi and his whole family. Sandhya told Tripathi 15 days ago that Ramdayal Baba, the sorcerer from Chhindwara, would end all the problems he was facing in his personal life. On July 20, she gave wheat flour to Tripath and said it had a solution to all his problems so he and other members of his family should eat it together,” said Prasad. The SP said Ashishraj informed police on July 26 that while going to Nagpur his father had told him that Sandhya Singh had mixed something in the flour. “On July 27, we took a sample of the flour for a test which detected poison. When police arrested Sandhya, she confessed to having committed the crime and said Ramdayal had told her that he would mix poison in the flour and nobody would ever come to know about it,” Prasad said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-in-mp-s-betul-plotted-murder-of-judge-and-family-arrested-with-5-others-police/story-Pgwvcl0wEVY5eWb7zTszeN.html
29-07-2020||India||As an actor, one should open to all genres: Aparna Dixit||Actor Aparna Dixit , who resumed shooting of the show after three-month long lockdown in Mumbai recently, talked about her achievement, new opportunities and experience of working amid pandemic with safety and new normal. “I am thrilled to be part of a show that has reached its first milestone. It is an amazing feeling to see all your hard work being paid off. Completing hundred episodes and still going strong is an absolutely an achievement,” said Aparna over the phone. Sharing her feelings about working amid the Covid crisis, the young actor says, “Starting shooting for the show at a time when work in the industry is badly hit due to Covid-19 is a big relief for all of us associated with the show.” “When the corona started spreading none of us had any idea how shoots will be like. We are the first ones to go on floor for our show ‘Pyaar Ki Luka Chhupi,’ that completed hundred episode milestone, recently. When we went back for the shoot it was perplexing situation as we were apprehensive to go on the sets and at the same time happy to be back on work. Today, after over a month, it seems fine because each and every person around us is very cautious about health and hygiene. Also, we all follow guidelines of our channel, production team and staff are putting all efforts to make safety a topmost priority. Slowly, all production people and crews are settling down with this new normal.” Talking about her initial days, Aparna said, “I belong to Agra, and for college I went to Delhi University. It was in that phase when I was into a lot extracurricular activities like plays, dance performances and more. It was there someone spotted me and asked me to come for an audition in Delhi itself. I was a bit unconvincing that how is it possible, but it was too good to be true. Then I went to the place for auditions with my friends and gave it a try without much effort. Then I got a call back that I have been selected and it was an audition for the Balaji Productions. I reached Mumbai with my mother for the next round. Thankfully my parents were very supportive and asked me to give it a try. I strongly feel that god has carved my path.”Known for shows like ‘Mahabharata’ ‘Pavitra Rishta,’ ‘Kalash,’ ‘Porus,’ ‘Yeh Dil Sun Raha Hai,’ Aparna feels playing modern character is a bit difficult in comparison to others. She say, “I feel that as an actor one should be open to all genres because you cannot understand what it is that you are comfortable in until you try. Personally, I feel, in mythological as well as historical shows the characters are already set and we just have to get into it. But with contemporary serials you have to add a lot of emotions and experiences to the role.” Born and brought up in UP, Aparna, says the web platform has provided a lot of opportunities to all the actors be it big or small, “Actors who used to sit at home, with no work, have got more opportunities with web and OTT platforms. Also, it provides every one another way to display their talent. I think it’s a great thing that we are living in an era where we have a choice of mediums to work as performers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/as-an-actor-one-should-open-to-all-genres-aparna-dixit/story-Ezfffd0VUrynLMNnuqDc0K.html
29-07-2020||India||Rajasthan governor accepts Ashok Gehlot’s 4th proposal, assembly to meet from August 14||Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra on Wednesday evening agreed to a new proposal sent by chief minister Ashok Gehlot government to convene the assembly session from August 14, ending the back-and-forth with the state cabinet over the session. The governor’s order came after the Gehlot government adapted its stand to reflect the governor’s views who had insisted on 21-day notice to legislators for the session.Governor Mishra had earlier in the day sent back the proposal to call the session from July 31, asking for concrete reasons to call a session on short notice at a time the coronavirus pandemic is raging across the country.Soon after the governor’s response, chief minister Ashok Gehlot – who is locked in a power tussle in the state with 19 Congress legislators including his former deputy Sachin Pilot -- met the governor for the second time in three days and called a cabinet meeting later in the evening.The governor said if the state government was not stating the reason for holding a short-notice session, it could call a regular session at 21 day’s notice.He asked the state cabinet to resubmit its proposal.Also Read: Speaker moves top court against HC on Sachin Pilot case, says it is judicial indisciplineThe Rajasthan cabinet had re-sent a proposal to hold a fresh assembly session to the governor on Tuesday, sticking to its July 31 date to convene the assembly. The proposal, however, did not detail any plan to hold a trust vote – which Congress strategists believe is the best move for the Gehlot-led government to prove majority and end political impasse in the state while the CM has the numbers. The Rajasthan crisis has seen an open tussle between Gehlot, who claims to have a majority in the house, and his now-dismissed deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and a set of rebel Congress legislators, who allege that Gehlot’s government is in a minority. Also Read: Convene the Rajasthan Assembly | HT EditorialWhile returning the earlier version of the proposal the Governor had suggested that the session can be called at short notice if the government says seeking a confidence vote is on the agenda.He repeated this on Wednesday, saying that under those circumstances calling a brief session at short notice was possible while maintaining social distance. “This can be a reasonable ground for calling a session at short notice,” Mishra said in the statement.Otherwise, he said, it would be better that the state government calls a regular session, like the monsoon session, at a 21-day notice. Before this, the governor had also advised live-streaming of the floor test, in case it was held, and asked about Covid-19-related precautions in the assembly.In the three-page press note from the Raj Bhawan, the Governor had earlier in the day said the government had not given clear replies to his previous queries.The Gehlot-led cabinet, which met on Tuesday, had said that governor Mishra did not have any locus standi in stipulating conditions to hold the session. The cabinet asked Mishra to abide by its proposal and claimed the failure to do so would be unconstitutional.The governor has now asked the Gehlot government to resubmit the proposal giving a “solid reason” to call a session at short notice. The cabinet should also make it clear why the sitting is being summoned without much notice under the present adverse circumstances, Mishra said in a reference to the Covid-19 pandemic.Addressing Congress workers at the party office in Jaipur before heading to Raj Bhavan on Wednesday, the chief minister said: “The love letter has already come. Now, I am only going to have tea with him.”The CM then assured party workers there is nothing to worry and that “the high command is with you all”.“For the first time in history, sit-in protests were staged across the country outside Raj Bhavans. The Speak Up Democracy campaign was successful and it will continue. After the campaign the workers are enthused and a message conveyed in the public,” he said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-governor-accepts-4th-gehlot-proposal-approves-assembly-session-from-august-14/story-Vr7F8MuduFNbkhTDa9yiFI.html

Kollam medical college superintendent Dr Habeeb Naseem said the woman had tested positive on July 20 and was admitted to the hospital with breathing difficulties and persistent cough. A medical board was constituted and it monitored her health parameters regularly, he said.“A pillar of strength, she followed all our directives in letter and spirit. Within one week she tested negative. We did another test on Wednesday before discharging her. People who resort to extreme steps after testing positive will have to learn a lot from her,” said the superintendent. He said she was administered a symptomatic treatment. She was given a warm send off at the hospital. State health minister K K Shailaja congratulated the medical team which treated her back to life. “It is another example of our hard work and dedication.

29-07-2020||India||Railways puts freeze on new projects this year to rationalise costs||In a bid to rationalise its expenses in the wake of the economic slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, Indian Railways plans to put on hold infrastructure projects sanctioned in the current financial year other than those related to safety work, according to a Railway Board order.The railway ministry has clarified that the order, which has been reviewed by HT, will not affect any ongoing vital infrastructure projects of the railways.In a communication sent to all zones and public sector undertakings (PSU) on Tuesday, the board said projects that were previously approved but have made insignificant progress “shall be kept frozen till further orders except those which are essentially required for safe running of trains”.The national carrier has estimated a financial loss of around Rs 40,000 crore in its passenger segment due to suspension of regular passenger trains since March 22.“In pursuance of Ministry of Finance’s Office Memorandum No.42(02)/PFC-1/2014 dated 04.06.2020 on the subject and in view of the circumstances prevailing in the current financial year, following decisions have been taken by Board: New works/ Umbrella works included in Pink Book 2020-21 shall be kept in abeyance. However, those works which impact the safe running of trains and are considered essential and inescapable may be considered for sanction,” the board’s order said.Unutilized projects identified as ‘umbrella works’ of 2018-19 and 2019-20, if any, may be suspended, the order added. Umbrella works refer to projects that have been sanctioned combining similar work at different locations.The board has instructed zonal railways to review all projects already approved by them.“Exemption for sanction of works which are considered essential and inescapable will be obtained from the ministry of finance,” the order added.The order issued by the railway board refers to a directive issued by the finance ministry in June on government spending in the year.“It may be appreciated that in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, there is an unprecedented demand on public financial resources, and a need to use resources prudently in accordance with emerging and changing priorities. However, many new proposals for in-principle approval are being received from ministries/departments,” the directive said.“No new proposal for a scheme/ sub-scheme, whether under delegated powers to Administrative Ministry including Standing Finance Committee proposals or through Expenditure Finance Committee should be initiated this year (FY 2020-21)except the proposals announced under the Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Package, Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan package and any other special package announcement,” it said, adding that in-principle approval for such schemes will not be given in this financial year.The initiation of new schemes already approved in FY 2020-21 will remain suspended for one year till 31 March 2021 or till further orders, it added.“This means all new and existing works across railway units are basically halted as they don’t come under safety of train operations and are neither essential nor inescapable,” a railway official explained.When contacted by HT, a spokesperson for the railways ministry said it has to abide by the instructions of the finance ministry, adding sufficient resources exist and have been provisioned for to ensure that wheels of progress and modernisation continue to move at rapid speed. “The order is not going to impact any of any vital infrastructure projects of Railways. It is not going to impact our mission of 100% electrification of routes, doubling tracks , any of railway high speed corridors or DFCCIL, vital signalling projects , projects to launch new modern trains / locomotives, passenger amenities or any project to enhance safety. It may be noted that there is no capital expenditure reduction for infra works and full capex will be utilised,” he said.Railways, earlier this month, sent detailed orders announcing several cost-cutting measures. The Railway Board had all zones to review contracts and manpower requirements to curtail expenditure.“It is understandable. As it is, Indian railways had one of the most alarming operating ratios. So with Covid happening, they ended up incurring massive losses. Also, they incurred losses while transporting people to their home states during lockdown. However, Rs 40,000 crore loss is very large by any standard. So it is prudent to start cutting on expenditure that can be reduced,” said Jaijit Bhattacharya, president of the Centre for Digital Economy Policy Research (CDEP), a think tank.Railway Board chairman VK Yadav on Tuesday said the railway ministry aims to make up for the losses in the passenger segment through freight revenue. Freight traffic on July 27 was marginally more than that on the same day last year “in spite of Covid-19 related challenges,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-puts-freeze-on-new-projects-this-year-to-rationalise-costs/story-khomScQluj7IrcelcWadcN.html
29-07-2020||India||Delete ‘secular’, ‘socialist’ words from the Constitution: Plea in Supreme Court||A petition in the Supreme Court (SC) has triggered a legal debate on whether citizens of India can be compelled to be secular, when the Constitution permits them the right to practice, profess and propagate their own religion under Article 25. The petition has sought deletion of the words “secular” and “socialist” from the Preamble of the Constitution, inserted in 1976 by the 42nd Constitution Amendment passed by Parliament. The three petitioners – two advocates and a social worker – who moved a common petition claimed that they intend to launch a political party. One of the conditions to register a political party with the Election Commission of India (ECI) requires them to compulsorily follow principles of socialism and secularism. This was added to Section 29-A (5) of the Representation of People Act, 1951, by an amendment in 1989. The petitioners – Balram Singh, Karunesh Kumar Shukla, Pravesh Kumar – have challenged the validity of this law and have also sought ECI and the Central government to respond to their petition. Advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain, who filed the petition, told HT, “In a democratic setup, the citizens cannot be bound to accept a particular ideology and the application of the ideology depends on the will of the people to be reflected through votes from time to time. In this case, the petitioners have said that ‘socialist’ and ‘secular’ concepts are political thoughts and seen in the light of right to practice religion (Article 25), right to free speech (Article 19(1)(a)), and these principles are against the principle of democracy.” The petition further argues that the original Constitution makers deliberately chose to keep these concepts out of the Preamble. On November 15, 1948, Professor KT Shah had proposed adding the words “Secular, Federal and Socialist Nation”, but the Constituent Assembly (CA) had rejected it after a lengthy discussion. Again, on November 25, 1948, a second amendment was introduced and discussed on incorporating the word ‘secular’ in the draft Constitution. That, too, was rejected. On December 3 that same year, a third attempt was made to include ‘secular’ in the Article 18 of the Constitution, which was also dismissed by the CA. The petition demanded the top court to examine that given this position, how could Parliament go against the solemn declaration by the CA, and modify or add ‘secular’ and ‘socialist’ words to the text of the Preamble by way of an amendment in 1976. The plea tries to examine the roots of secularism and socialism as a concept prevailing across the globe and dubs them as a “political thought” which has little relevance for the country. It states that the historical and cultural theme of Bharat is based on the concept of “Dharma”, which is different from the concept of religion and the communist theory of state cannot be applied to the Indian context. Going by the prevailing foreign concept of secularism, where state/government has no religion, the petition cited examples of how in India, state grants aid to minority religious institutions, enacts law relation to pilgrimages outside the country, has power to make laws related to charitable and religious endowment and religious institutions falling in Item 28 of the Concurrent List and has power under Article 25(2) to make law regulating or restricting any economic, financial, political or other secular activity associated with religious practice. “In view of the fact that states have power to indulge in religious matters, though in limited sense, and can give grant to religious minorities, the state as a political entity cannot be a secular republic in strict sense,” the petition stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delete-secular-socialist-words-from-the-constitution-plea-in-supreme-court/story-5JXAm1ml4eYKlYjCZRFJNM.html

He was found hanging from a tree around 3 pm , police said. Even though BJP leaders alleged that Purnachandra Das, 44, was murdered by the ruling Trinamool Congress, TMC has refuted such allegations saying that he died by suicide. “There was a feud going on with our neighbours. He went out today to attend a meeting which was scheduled around 4 pm to find a solution to the problem. Around 3 pm his body was found hanging from a tree a few hundred metres away from the house,” said Subimal Das, the victim’s brother. Anup Chakraborty, a local BJP leader alleged that Das was murdered by the TMC who are hand in glove with his neighbours. “We are sure the TMC is associated with this. He was murdered and then his body was hanged to pass it off as a suicide,” Chakraborty added. Akhil Giri, TMC lawmaker from Ramnagar said: “Our party is not involved in this. He seems to have committed suicide because of depression. A legal tussle was going on between Das and his neighbour. The BJP is just trying to politicize it.” Police said that they are waiting for the post mortem report and investigation is on. Earlier this month, Debendra Nath Roy, a BJP legislator from north Dinajpur district in north Bengal was found dead near his house. His body was found hanging. Even though the BJP and his family members had alleged he was murdered and demanded a CBI enquiry, police said that he committed suicide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/local-bjp-leader-found-dead-in-bengal-second-in-a-month/story-n02cKNgt1ODP4KZO50nLwN.html

That one went ahead to claim credit for zeroing in on the Rafale fighter in 2012. It has finally borne fruit, the Congress had tweeted before going on to accuse the government of buying the jets in an overpriced deal.Also read: Moments after Rafale fighter jets land, Rajnath Singh’s veiled warning to ChinaThe Congress claimed that the deal that was struck by the Manmohan Singh government was in power would have ensured that the Indian Air Force receives 126 fighter jets instead of 36 aircraft.

Meanwhile, can GOI answer: 1) Why each aircraft costs Rs 1670 Crores instead of Rs 526 Crores? 2) Why 36 aircraft were bought instead of 126? 3) Why was bankrupt Anil given a Rs 30,000 Crores contract instead of HAL?” Gandhi said in a tweet, reiterating the allegations that had formed the crux of his campaign against PM Modi’s re-election in 2019.Congratulations to IAF for Rafale.Meanwhile, can GOI answer:1) Why each aircraft costs ₹1670 Crores instead of ₹526 Crores?2) Why 36 aircraft were bought instead of 126?3) Why was bankrupt Anil given a ₹30,000 Crores contract instead of HAL?Also read | ‘Rafale deal still hurting BJP’: Rahul Gandhi during Maharashtra poll rallyBut his campaign themed around these allegations of irregularities and his “chowkidar chor hai” slogan directed at PM Modi had backfired in 2019. Gandhi, 50, had resigned from the leadership role of the Congress soon after the election results were announced and since then, rarely spoken of the Rafale deal.Wednesday was an exception, possibly given the hype around the first batch of the planes that reached Ambala air base. Gandhi’s congratulatory note to the IAF, however, is also designed to underscore that he did not question the decision of buying the Rafale jets - it was a Congress government which has selected it - but only the terms of the deal.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had earlier in the evening alluded to the political campaign around the deal to praise Prime Minister Narendra Modi for going ahead with the deal. “The Rafale jets were purchased when they fully met the operational requirements of the IAF. The baseless allegations against this procurement have already been answered and settled,” Rajnath Singh tweeted.The NDA government’s decision to buy 36 Rafales was announced in April 2015, with the deal signed a little more than a year later. This replaced the previous United Progressive Alliance’s decision to buy 126 Rafale aircraft, 108 of which were to be made in India by state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited using parts imported from France. A Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) audit tabled in February last year concluded that the new deal was 2.86% cheaper than the price negotiated by the UPA government. It did not disclose pricing details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congrats-for-rafale-tweets-rahul-gandhi-to-iaf-fires-3-questions-at-centre/story-XCoYlUVeOPqnUZadNNGkuO.html

The development comes a day after the Central government told the Supreme Court that it will verify media reports that claimed Jammu & Kashmir’s lieutenant governor, G C Murmu, is in favour of restoration of high-speed 4G internet services in the Union Territory.Internet access across the Union Territory of J&K shall be made available; however, internet speed shall be restricted to 2G only and post-paid sim card holders shall be provided with access to internet: Jammu & Kashmir Government pic.twitter.com/5Oy55DeF4sThe internet restrictions are in place in the union territory since last year in August, when the erstwhile state’s special status was revoked through abrogation of Article 370 and its bifurcation into two union territories. Since then, centre has allowed some relaxations but has refused to restore 4G services saying the situation was not conducive. Orders were passed by the J&K authorities on March 4, 17 and 26 restricting internet speed for mobile data services to 2G.Earlier this month, the union government had told Supreme Court that a special committee constituted as per the Court’s order to review internet restrictions in Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) has decided against any further relaxation for the time being.Centre had filed an affidavit referring to the committee considering all aspects of the matter, including terrorist related incidents in J&K, in its meeting held on June 10 before deciding to continue with the restrictions on 4G mobile internet. “Ultimately, based on wide-ranging assessment of the prevailing situation in this sensitive region, the committee arrived at a decision that no further relaxation on restrictions on internet services, including 4G services, could be carried out at present. It was also decided that the next review of the committee would be carried out in two months”, the affidavit had said. The top court has been petitioned by NGOs and media professionals, who have alleged that the Centre is not following the apex court’s directions to periodically review restrictions on internet in the union territory.The petitioners have claimed that patients, doctors, and general public of J&K were unable to access latest information, guidelines, advisories and restrictions about Covid- 19 because of the restrictions on mobile internet speed. They also argue that slow internet speed makes accessing of telemedicine (diagnosis and treatment of patients by means of telecommunication) or online video consultation impossible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/restrict-internet-speed-to-2g-orders-j-k-govt-day-after-media-reports-said-l-g-pushed-for-4g-services/story-3Q7CNUvl1hXCTSFFzrxovL.html

The Karnataka Congress’s official Twitter handle attacked Kumaraswamy for his remarks on the Rajasthan crisis saying “Have you become so innocent that you don’ t know the difference between a party’s MLA’s voluntarily joining another party and them being pressurized using constitutional bodies under operation Kamala?”Operation Kamala refers to an alleged BJP plan under which opposition party MLAs were lured to join the party.The remarks came a day after Kumaraswamy commenting on the Rajasthan crisis where the Congress has accused the BJP of trying to topple its government, said that his erstwhile partner was the progenitor of horse-trading and it had tried to break the JD(S) in the past.The Karnataka Congress also went onto attack Kumaraswamy asking “When you formed a coalition with us and sat on the CM’s chair using our support, was Congress’s morals alright? When you don’t have power you have suddenly remembered all of this. When the state is facing difficulties, a party which is both invisible and irrelevant, what moral right do you have to comment on us.”Kumaraswamy too hit back with a series of ten tweets. Hinting at Siddaramiah, he accused senior leaders of Congress unable to respond directly to him were using the party’s handle to fire at him. Asserting that it was Congress that came to him desperately seeking an alliance, he said he accepted it only to work for the welfare of farmers.“You have accused me of being invisible and irrelevant. In how many states of the country is Congress visible and relevant? There is only a fine line in the so-called ‘voluntary’ joining of MLAs to Congress and Operation Kamala. Congress sadly has fallen to such a low level. This is the reason for the current pathetic condition of Congress,” he said in one of his tweets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hd-kumaraswamy-s-rajasthan-comment-sparks-twitter-war-with-congress/story-VRpkuT0ynLzp0Mk1ZmsIeP.html
29-07-2020||India||Rajasthan Speaker moves SC on high court hearing Sachin Pilot camp’s plea, says it is judicial indiscipline||Rajasthan Joshi’s petition argued that the high court, which agreed to examine the constitutional validity of a provision in the anti-defection law, amounted to “gross judicial indiscipline and judicial impropriety” since a Constitution Bench of the top court had already given its ruling way back in 1992. The high court, Joshi argued, could not act as a appellate court over the correctness of the decision by the top court.Joshi also cited verdicts by the top court to argue that there was “no question” of the high court entertaining the joint petition filed by 19 Congress lawmakers led by Sachin Pilot because only the “final decision of the speaker is amenable to judicial review on limited grounds”.The high court had, however, stopped speaker CP Joshi from taking any action on the disqualification notices that he had issued to the 19 lawmakers on a complaint from the Congress. The Congress had invoked the anti-defection law to question the conduct of the rebel lawmakers and asked the speaker to disqualify them. The rebels, who were given three days to respond, however, rushed to the high court which stayed proceedings.The legal battle in Jaipur and national capital Delhi is the fallout of a rebellion by about 18 lawmakers led by Pilot against chief minister Ashok Gehlot. The Congress appeared to have outsmarted the rebels about a fortnight back when it moved for their disqualification. If speaker CP Joshi concurs with the ruling Congress in Rajasthan, the strength of the assembly would have declined, lowering the majority mark. This move, however, didn’t succeed due to the high court’s intervention.Ashok Gehlot, who has a tenuous majority in the 200-member assembly with about 101-102 lawmakers on his side, had gone ahead to ask governor Kalraj Mishra to convene the assembly so that he could prove his majority. But Kalraj Mishra has been holding off for now, insisting that the government should give a 21-day notice for the assembly to be convened.At one point, Mishra said he was fine with exempting the provision that requires 21-day advance notice to be given provided the Gehlot government declares in writing that he intends to face the trust vote. The Gehlot government has been reluctant to spell out the agenda of the assembly session, accusing Raj Bhavan of violating constitutional norms and not issuing the formal orders as requested by the state cabinet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-speaker-moves-sc-on-high-court-hearing-sachin-pilot-camp-s-plea-says-it-is-judicial-indiscipline/story-ZhNbFAXCmAQ8Y8QXINGTRL.html

29-07-2020||India||CM Gehlot proposes House session from Aug 14, meets Guv’s 21-day condition||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, after yet another cabinet meeting, proposed convening an assembly session from July 14, from the earlier demand of July 31, in deference to the governor’s 21-day notice period condition for calling such a session. The first proposal for an assembly session was sent on July 23 but it did not have the cabinet’s approval and no date was mentioned. Counting from that date onwards, the new date proposed meets the 21-day criterion.Earlier today, governor Kalraj Mishra returned for the third time a proposal from the state government to convene the assembly, saying the cabinet had refused to state the reason why it wanted a session at short notice.As the deadlock over calling a session deepened, CM Gehlot went up to meet the governor at the Raj Bhawan. The state cabinet met later.The governor said if the government was not stating the reason for holding a short-notice session, it could call a regular session after giving a 21-day notice.He asked the Gehlot cabinet to resubmit its proposal, giving a “solid reason” for calling a session at short notice.“The love letter has already come. Now, I am only going to have tea with him,” Gehlot told party workers at the state Congress office before heading for the Raj Bhawan.The Gehlot-led cabinet, which met on Tuesday, had claimed governor Mishra did not have any locus standi in stipulating conditions to hold the session. The cabinet asked Mishra to abide by its proposal and claimed the failure to do so would be unconstitutional.It also asserted that the agenda of the session will be determined by the business advisory committee of the house. It was the speaker’s domain to decide on social distancing norms in the assembly.Ashok Gehlot, who is battling a rebellion from his former Number 2 in the government - Sachin Pilot, claims the support of over 100 MLAs. Sachin Pilot, along with 18 MLAs, says he is only protesting the CM’s way of functioning. He has maintained that he is not joining the opposition BJP. The BJP with 72 MLAs has been watching the drama from the sidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cm-proposes-house-session-from-aug-14-meets-guv-s-21-day-condition/story-k1wRkcDQL9FRDfsQb7kU1N.html

However, education institutes, cinema halls, swimming pools, entertainment parks, theatres, bars, auditoriums and assembly halls will continue to remain closed till August 31.Yoga institutes and gymnasiums were shut down since March 25, when the first phase of nationwide lockdown was announced. The centre has been ordering a phased wise reopening of economy after two months of hard lockdown ended in May. “Yoga institutes and gymnasiums will be allowed to function from August 5, 2020 for which Standard Operating Procedure (SoPs) will be issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare ,” the order states.The first two phase of Unlock- a term coined to represent the various stages of unlocking the economy-- has led to resumption of most commercial activities including restricted domestic aviation and train operations apart from restaurants, hotels, saloons, malls etc. However, the government has been wary of other activities that are likely to result in mass congregation at one place including metro operations, entertainment parks and cinema halls. It has allowed religious activities but with SOPs restricting the number of attendees at such gatherings.The order released by the Union home secretary also says that every other activity that has been permitted outside of designated containment zones will continue without any restriction.The guidelines also do not permit resumption of metro train services in any part of the country. Delhi government under Kejriwal has been seeking resumption of Delhi Metro services citing the improved Covid 19 situation in the capital.Shopping mall operators had also presented a case for reopening of cinema halls in their premises citing it as the next logical step after reopening of malls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-unlock-3-yoga-institutes-and-gyms-allowed-to-operate-from-august-5/story-JX4NBVAOVrcbJGXxR4be3K.html
29-07-2020||India||Restriction on artists above 65 likely to be reviewed on August 1, State informs HC||Maharashtra government on Wednesday informed the Bombay high court (HC) that the guidelines imposing restrictions on cast or crew members above 65 years of age from attending film and TV serial shootings was a temporary measure, and, it may be reviewed, when the current lockdown restrictions, which was imposed since end-March to contain the spread of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, end on Friday (July 31). Government lawyer Purnima Kantharia informed the two-member HC division bench, comprising Justice SJ Kathawalla and Riyaz Chagla, that the guidelines were issued in the interests of senior citizen artistes in a bid to protect them from Covid-19 and cannot be termed arbitrary. She added that the restrictions were imposed because ageing persons are more vulnerable of contracting SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease. Kantharia said the guidelines issued by the Maharashtra government for shooting of films and TV serials is expected to be reviewed on August 1 (Saturday) after the current lockdown restrictions are lifted. She added that changes are expected to be made in the guidelines but as of now it can’t be said as to what those changes would be. She was responding to a petition filed by Pramod Pandey (70), who has been earning his livelihood by performing bit roles in films and TV serials for the past four decades. He has challenged a clause contained in the guidelines issued by the state government on May 30 regarding shooting for films and TV serials. Pandey contended that he might be aged, but he is physically fit. He argued that the government rule deprived him of the only source of his livelihood, as it prohibited the entry of cast and crew members above 65 years of age to film studios and outdoor shooting sites. He claimed that a perusal of available data made it clear that majority of the persons affected by Covid-19 are below the age of 65 years. He stated that he would face grave hardship because of the prejudice, as he would not be able to survive with dignity and self-respect, if prevented from acting. Amicus curiae, senior advocate Sharon Jagtiani, termed the restrictions imposed on aged artistes as discriminatory, as they have been singled out and similar restrictions were not imposed on senior citizens in other walks of life. He argued that the guidelines were not based on valid grounds. The Indian Motion Pictures Producers’ Association (IMPPA) has filed a similar petition challenging the same clause.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/restriction-on-artists-above-65-likely-to-be-reviewed-on-august-1-state-informs-hc/story-rcc0utUb2NHTDmvu3LCa4L.html

29-07-2020||India||Nirav Modi’s son moves HC, challenges confiscation of trust properties||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the Central government to file an affidavit in reply to a petition filed by Rohin Modi, the son of diamond trader Nirav Modi, a prime accused in Rs.13,500 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud, challenging the confiscation of the properties purportedly belonging to a trust named after him. On June 8, the special court for trying offenders under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, had ordered the confiscation of Nirav Modi’s movable and immovable properties that are estimated to be worth about Rs 1,396 crore. The order was passed in accordance with section 12 of the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2019, on an application filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which is probing money-laundering aspects of the multi-crore fraud at the state-run PNB. The special court had in December 2019 declared Nirav Modi a “fugitive economic offender” as contemplated under the 2019 Act. The properties ordered to be confiscated include bank balances in India and the United Kingdom (UK), residential and commercial properties in India, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the UK, allegedly purchased by the diamond trader from the proceeds of the crime. Rohin Modi moved HC contending that the confiscated properties also include properties owned by Rohin Trust. He has challenged confiscation of the trust properties primarily on the ground of breach of principles of natural justice, which implied that the order was passed by the special court behind his back, without making him party and without issuing him notice. The petition came up for hearing on Tuesday before a two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices RD Dhanuka and VG Bisht, who directed the Central government to reply to the petition in one week.The court has fixed August 7, as the next date of hearing. On January 31, 2018, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had registered an offence under various sections of the Prevention of the Corruption Act, 1988, and the relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against Nirav Modi and several others, including two officers of the PNB. According to the complaint lodged by PNB, between February and May 2017, Nirav Modi and his partnership firms namely, M/s Diamond R US, M/s Solar Exports and M/s Stellar Diamond, got fraudulently issued 150 Letters of Undertaking (LoUs) from Brady House branch of PNB in south Mumbai and duped the public sector bank to the tune of $1015.35 million, whihc is equivalent to around Rs.6498.20 crore. A similar offence is registered against Nirav Modi’s maternal uncle Mehul Choksi for duping PNB of crores of rupees by using the same modus operandi and fleeing to Antigua in the Carribbean islands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirav-modi-s-son-moves-hc-challenges-confiscation-of-trust-properties/story-dl8wQ4oU6z947e8UwdSaHN.html
29-07-2020||India||US, Australia see key role for India in Indo-Pacific security||India will have a key role in defence cooperation and post-Covid-19 recovery efforts in the Indo-Pacific by the US and Australia, which plan to strengthen partnerships in the region to ensure it remains secure, inclusive and rules-based. The matter figured in a meeting between US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and defence secretary Mark Esper and their Australian counterparts Marise Payne and Linda Reynolds in Washington on Tuesday, with a joint statement issued by the two sides making several references to India’s role in the Indo-Pacific. The US and Australia also expressed serious concerns about China’s “recent coercive and destabilising actions across the Indo-Pacific”, and the two countries said the Covid-19 pandemic has “created incentives for some actors to pursue strategic gains in ways that undermine the rules-based international order and regional stability”. The development comes at a time when India is set to include Australia in the Malabar naval exercise that it conducts with the US and Japan, and against the backdrop of the months-old border standoff with China. The US-Australia joint statement said the Indo-Pacific remains the focus of their alliance and that two countries are “working side-by-side, including with Asean, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Five Eyes partners, to strengthen our networked structure of alliances and partnerships to maintain a region that is secure, prosperous, inclusive, and rules-based”. On the issue of regional coordination, the two countries said they are committed to “trilateral dialogues with Japan and Quad consultations with Japan and India”, and were looking forward to further ministerial meetings of these forums. The Quadrilateral security dialogue or Quad, which includes India, Australia, Japan and the US, was upgraded to the ministerial level last September. China has often expressed its opposition to the group, though India has said it is not aimed at any country. The US and Australia also referred to bilateral defence cooperation such as the joint naval activity by their warships in the South China Sea, and said they are committed to “pursue increased and regularised maritime cooperation in the region, as well as the Indian Ocean, bilaterally and in concert with other likeminded and regional partners”. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, described India as the “most natural partner” for security-related initiatives by the US and Australia both in the Indian Ocean and the wider Indo-Pacific region. “Though China is its biggest trade partner, Australia has growing concerns about what it perceives as China’s interference in domestic politics and issues such as cyber security. Australia also has concerns about China’s growing influence in the South Pacific, which it sees as its strategic backyard and which has been the focus of attention from Prime Minister Scott Morrison,” he said. “These concerns and similar worries for the US are areas of convergence with India. Australia certainly feels that if the Quad can get its act together, the four countries can counter the rising Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific,” Patil added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-australia-see-key-role-for-india-in-indo-pacific-security/story-pXqw6AEIVlw9bnlIeOWnPO.html

However, a greater number of patients—1,126-- were discharged on Wednesday after they were declared to have been cured by the authorities. This means that the total number of active coronavirus patients in the city is declining consistently to reach 10,779 as on Wednesday since 1,18,633 patients have been discharged so far.The number of fresh cases registered on Wednesday is a fraction less than Tuesday’s 1,056 new cases.The improving situation has prompted the Delhi government led by Arvind Kejriwal to delink 77 banquet halls and 40 hotels that were to be converted into Coved medical facilities. As Kejriwal has stated, the city has currently over 18,000 vacant beds in three type of designated Covid treatment facilities, hence the decision to delink the hotels and banquet halls.The decision was taken after the chief minister reviewed the Covid-19 situation in the city.“Some hotels were attached to hospitals to increase the number of Covid beds. In view of the improving situation and all hotel beds lying vacant for the last many days, these hotels are now being released,” Kejriwal tweeted.The hotels and banquet halls were attached to increase the capacity for treating coronavirus patients as an emergency measure in June, when new cases were witnessing an upward spiral putting pressure on the existing health infrastructure.24 deaths were recorded over the last 24 hours taking the toll to 3,907. On Tuesday, 28 Covid deaths were reported. However, Monday marked another important landmark in Delhi’s continuous recovery from the disease with Delhi’s biggest coronavirus treatment facility of Lok Nayak hospital not reporting even a single death. The hospital has been recording a couple of deaths daily since it started treating Covid-19 patients in March. The number of deaths had shot up to 10 to 15 a day in June when the disease was at its peak in Delhi.According to data shared by the chief minister’s office earlier this month, the daily death toll due to Covid-19 in Delhi had reached 101 in June. In comparison, Delhi recorded 27 deaths on average every day during the last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-s-recovery-rate-reaches-88-9-as-discharges-outscore-fresh-cases-yet-again/story-Jv0BnZW15ofn5asd47ETgN.html

Personnel of Cachar forest division in Silchar district of Assam intercepted a truck which was coming from Mizoram at the Lailapur forest sub beat around 11:30 pm on Tuesday. A search of the truck led to recovery of the exotic wild animals. Interrogation of the two persons in the truck, Narsimha Reddy and Navnath Tukaram Daigude revealed that the consignment was on its way to Guwahati. “The forest officials were carrying out a routine check of vehicles to detect smuggling of illegal timber when they noticed foul smell coming from the back of the truck. On being questioned, the two persons said that it was some rotten fruits. When the forest personnel investigated further, they found the animals,” said Sunnydeo Choudhary, DFO, Cachar forest division. The animals, a red kangaroo from Australia, six hyacinth macaws, two capuchin monkeys from South America, three Aldabra giant tortoises, were found packed in plastic and cartons. The two arrested persons told investigators that they had got the animals in Mizoram and were to hand the consignment to someone in Guwahati. The animals are being sent to the state zoo at Guwahati where they will be kept and health monitored. Investigations are on to find out how the exotic animals reached India. “Against the backdrop of Covid-19 pandemic and its connection to wet markets, it’s high time we put an end to practice of keeping these exotic species as pets, refrain from illegal wildlife trade and let these animals live in their natural habitat,” said D. Deori, forest range officer of Hawaithang range near the Mizoram border.In its first global report on illegal wildlife trade released a week ago, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) had described wildlife trade as a global threat which has links with organized crimes like modern slavery, drug trafficking and arms trade. The illegal trade is estimated to generate revenue of up to $23 billion a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-forest-officials-seize-kangaroo-exotic-wildlife-from-smugglers-near-mizoram-border/story-RZKCMGOrMeDrpfRiEoot3K.html
29-07-2020||India||Despite pandemic, flesh trade thriving as demand persists, say social workers||Goa’s flesh trade rackets appear to be immune to the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, if the recent raids conducted by the state police are any pointer to the thriving illicit trade that appears to flourish because of the economic hardships triggered by the pandemic. Goa Police has conducted three raids in eight days – between July 20 and 28 -- to bust flesh trade rackets and mushrooming human trafficking networks.Four women commercial sex workers were rescued and five pimps were arrested during these raids. Organisations working for the rehabilitation of sex workers have warned that the Covid-19-triggered economic downturn would push more victims into the sordid trade. “We have been tracking around 300 women, who were rescued in Goa and sent back to their respective native places. These were women, who were rehabilitated and had started a new life as sales girls in shopping malls or similar kinds of jobs. However, many of them became unemployed because of the pandemic and a majority of them have said that they have been approached by the traffickers, who are keen to lure them back into the trade,” said Arun Pandey, director of Anyay Rahit Zindagi, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) that exclusively works for the rehabilitation of sex-trafficking victims. “Some enter the trade because of an acute fund crunch and mounting debts. Besides, the pandemic hasn’t deterred customers, who are willing to pay for sex,” Pandey added. He said the Covid-19 pandemic hasn’t ebbed the sex trade much like two decades ago, when the world was in the grip of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) outbreak. Goa Police is cracking the whip against the errant human traffickers. “We have zero tolerance for human trafficking in any form. We take strict legal action in any instance pertaining to trafficking. The law does not make any distinction on the basis of tourism or otherwise,” said Shobit Saksena, spokesperson, Goa Police. The authorities have conducted three separate raids against human trafficking over the past eight days. On Tuesday, a joint raid was conducted by the crime branch and the women police station in Calangute, where a victim (33), a resident of Assagao, a village in Bardez, was rescued and a pimp, Nandini Pawar (26), a native of Jalana in Maharashtra, was arrested for running a prostitution racket, On July 26, another pimp, Anita Karapurkar (30), was apprehended and two women were rescued from a hotel at Mapusa, North Goa. While on July 24, three pimps -- Deepak Kumar (25) and Anil Kumar (42) from Uttar Pradesh and Dinesh Sakes (41) from Maharashtra --- were arrested and a commercial sex worker was rescued. “A concerted effort needs to be launched to crack down on the customers, who create a demand for the illicit sex trade. The demand fuels the traffickers to lure the unsuspecting victims in the trade. Such is the demand that traffickers are willing to arrange flight tickets for commercial sex workers and even prepared to wait it out for them to undergo mandatory quarantine protocols,” Pandey said. ‘It’s a social trend that comes to the fore, especially during natural calamities such as droughts and famines. The Covid-19 outbreak is no exception because the contagion has battered the economy beyond imagination pushing many to enter sex trade to make both ends meet,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-despite-pandemic-flesh-trade-thriving-as-demand-persists-say-social-workers/story-1Fe4QTxdkWL7O1KzKPgiCN.html

29-07-2020||India||Maharashtra CM Thackeray to start travelling in the state to review Covid-19 crisis||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will start with a day-long trip to Pune on Thursday in his mission to assess the ground realities about the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak in the state. The CM will visit Pune, where he will review the pandemic situation and the preventive measures that have been undertaken to contain the viral disease in the western Maharashtra region that comprises five districts such as Pune, Kolhapur, Solapur, Satara and Sangli. The move comes following trenchant criticism from the main opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). ‘The CM will cover all the six regions in a phase-wise manner. He will start with Pune, which is the headquarters of western Maharashtra. It will be a day-long trip. While the schedule for the other regions is yet to be firmed up,” said an official from the CM’s office (CMO). Though Thackeray has been regularly reviewing the Covid-19 outbreak by holding virtual meetings, he hasn’t ventured out yet, except for a few hotspots in Mumbai, the epicentre of the contagion in the country as well as Maharashtra. Last Saturday, state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil had taken a dig at the CM for digging his heels in Mumbai. “Even a school student can say that our Uddhavji is not going anywhere,” Patil had told a Marathi news channel. Pawar, who was defending Thackeray till last week, on Tuesday, spoke out and urged the CM to tour the state and meet the public, who are reeling under the impact of the viral outbreak. On Tuesday, Sharad Pawar (79), who heads the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which is a part of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government, along with Thackeray-led Shiv Sena and the Congress, made a comment in passing about the CM is expected to tour the state to assess the pandemic situation on the ground that hasn’t happened to date. Pawar said he travels more than the CM. “He (Thackeray) is expected to monitor from the state capital as the head of the government, but that doesn’t prevent him from travelling. He must make it a point to tour the state by taking out some time from his busy schedule, meet the public and take them into confidence, which is yet to happen,” the veteran leader told a Marathi news channel. He was, however, quick to put his observation into perspective. “I don’t think that the CM is not taking everyone into confidence. He also speaks to everyone. The only difference is, I’m more visible as I keep travelling. He (Thackeray) doesn’t travel, and work from one place,” Pawar clarified when he was asked about the disputes within the MVA’s ranks based on the swirling allegations that the CM not taking the allies into confidence. Last Saturday, while defending the CM, Pawar had said Thackeray was urged to oversee and monitor the functioning of his team from Mumbai, as he is the head of the government. He had also singled out Thackeray for fulsome praise, as the latter was working round-the-clock in a bid to flatten the Covid-19 curve with single-minded devotion. Contrary to the CM, Pawar visited across parts of Covid-19-hit Maharashtra and reviewed preparations made by the local authorities along with the state health minister Rajesh Tope to contain the pandemic outbreak. Last Saturday, he was in Aurangabad city where he took stock of the situation. He also launched a campaign, “Mission Zero -- Aurangabad” that aims to bring down the Covid-19-related-death toll to zero in the city. The previous day he was in Nashik. While on July 20, he was in Solapur district. Leader of Opposition in the legislative assembly and former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis also recently travelled around the state to review the Covid-19 situation. Leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra legislative council Pravin Darekar, too, had visited various Covid Care Centres and hospitals in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-cm-thackeray-to-start-travelling-in-the-state-to-review-covid-19-crisis/story-XsLZoTVeIdbpg6u10IxdCL.html

The incident didn’t come to light immediately as her parents assumed she might have ended her life fearing she might fail the examination. Later, police accepted a complaint from the deceased’s brother but didn’t lodge an FIR, as per family members. “Police registered an FIR on the complaint of the girl’s brother on Tuesday and are investigating the matter. No arrest has been made so far,” said Yogesh Tomar, town inspector (TI), Chandan Nagar police station said on Wednesday. “The 19-year-old girl, a resident of a locality in Indore, allegedly died by suicide early morning on Monday by hanging herself from the ceiling in her room. The girl’s father, who is a labourer, said he felt initially that she had done so out of fear of failure in the exam, the result for which was announced on Monday afternoon.

29-07-2020||India||India, Bangladesh to use Sundarbans-waterways carefully so as not to disturb movement of tigers: Report||India and Bangladesh should carefully use the water-channels in the Sundarbans in a bid not to disturb the free movement of tigers between the two countries, which may ultimately affect their gene flow, a new report released by the Union government has warned. “In our rush to use waterways for economic transportation we have to be careful that these do not become barriers to tiger (and other wildlife) dispersal,” said the report titled, Status of Tigers, Co-predators and Prey in India (2018), which was released by the Union government on Tuesday. The Sundarbans is the world’s largest mangrove delta that is spread over 10,200 square kilometres (sq km). While 4,200 sq km lies in West Bengal in India, the remaining 6,000 sq km falls in neighbouring Bangladesh. Around 200 tigers have adapted to this mangrove delta as their natural habitat, lending global importance to the Sundarbans. The Big Cats swim freely across rivers and creeks from one island to another between the two countries. “Barges and ships carrying cargo often use these channels for transporting goods. This was particularly seen in Bangladesh. This has to be done carefully so that the tigers’ corridors are not disturbed. The Sundarbans is totally cut off from any other nearby tiger population and gene pool. As a result, it is important to maintain this as large single transboundary population,” said YV Jhala, a tiger expert and senior scientist at the Wildlife Institute of India (WWI). The report calls for regulation of transboundary collaboration and regulation of cargo in the waterways, suggesting that increased continuous use of these water channels inside the forest as a conduit for commercial boat traffic can transform the rivers to barriers to tiger movement. Despite efforts by forest departments of both the countries, joint patrolling and joint management activities remain a non-starter. Forest officials in West Bengal, however, said that cargo movement through the Sundarbans has long stopped on the Indian side. On the Bangladesh side, though, cargo ships and barges still use the water channels through the mangrove forests. “Even though cargo used to move through the Indian part of the Sundarbans, it has stopped since 2011. Now, the ships and barges take alternate water routes, avoiding the Sundarbans, to reach Bangladesh,” said Ravi Kant Sinha, chief wildlife warden, West Bengal. The report has cited that wildlife experts have got the first photographic evidence of Golden Jackals, as a co-predator of tigers that inhabit the world’s largest mangrove delta. “Golden jackal was captured for the first time in Sundarbans and seems to be a recent coloniser restricted to the mangrove forest edges of Sajnekhali Wildlife Sanctuary and islands of the biosphere reserve adjacent to the human-inhabited islands,” the report says. Forest officials said even though the animal had been spotted by foresters and locals this is for the first time that it has been captured on camera and documented. Earlier in 2017, the picture of a wolf was captured in the Sundarbans taking wildlife experts by surprise. A total of 14 species of ungulates, carnivores, and omnivores such as tiger, chital, estuarine crocodile, fishing cat, jungle cat, leopard, and otter, among others, were captured on camera and documented in the Sundarbans. Wild pig and chital were apparently the most common species.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-bangladesh-to-use-sundarbans-waterways-carefully-so-as-not-to-disturb-movement-of-tigers-report/story-dFY8bseoRxvGvu38rUFDzL.html

The Centre will suggest a way out to settle the disputes over water sharing,” an official in the state irrigation department familiar with the development said.The apex council was constituted as part of the AP Reorganisation Act in 2014 to sort out the inter-state disputes, since both the states, which were part of a combined Andhra Pradesh till June 2014, have common projects like Srisailam, Nagarjunasagar and Pulichintala on Krishna river.Meanwhile, the Andhra Pradesh government on Monday issued a notification inviting tenders for the construction of the Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Project (RLIP), aimed at lifting 34,722 cusecs of water per day from Srisailam Reservoir on Krishna river from a depth of 800 feet.The tenders worth Rs 3,278.18 crore were called for the construction of the project under Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) basis within 30 months. The last date for filing of tenders is August 10 and the technical and commercial bids would be opened on August 12 and 13. “With the lowest bid taken as the benchmark, a reverse tendering process would be conducted on August 17 and the successful bidder would be finalised by August 19,” the notification said.However, the commencement of the RLIP would depend on the final judgment of the National Green Tribunal, which is hearing a petition filed by a Telangana activist G Srinivas, opposing the project stating that it was detrimental to the interests of Telangana. The NGT will take up the hearing on August 11.The Telangana government, too, lodged a complaint with the Krishna River Management Board opposing the Andhra Pradesh government’s decision to construct the RLIP and also expansion of the existing discharge capacity of Pothireddypadu head regulator constructed on Srisailam reservoir.Both the projects, worth around Rs 7,000 crore, are aimed at drawing an additional quantity of six to eight tmc (thousand million cubic feet) of water per day from Krishna river, which the Telangana government described as illegal, unilateral and against the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014.The Andhra Pradesh government defended the same stating that the new schemes were well within the state’s rights. What is more, the AP government accused the Telangana government of constructing projects - like Palamuru-Ranga Reddy lift scheme which was in violation of the Krishna Water Dispute Tribunal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-calls-jagan-reddy-kcr-for-meet-over-water-dispute-between-states/story-6E0kj5F5cq8j2tNemxlLtN.html

However, since May 6, international charter flights have been operated by Air India under the Vande Bharat Mission to help stranded people reach their destinations. Private carriers have also operated a certain number of flights under this mission.“Passengers booking tickets for #VBM flights through travel agents, may please note that they should not pay more than the fares mentioned on the Air India website. Passengers facing issues of overcharging by travel agents may write to gmsm@airindia.in,” the ministry said on Twitter.India had on July 16 formed bilateral air bubbles with countries like the US, Germany and France that allows airlines of both the countries in the pact to operate special international charter flights. The aviation sector has been significantly impacted due to the travel restrictions imposed in India and other countries in view of the coronavirus pandemic. All airlines in India have taken cost-cutting measures such as pay cuts, leave without pay and firing of employees in order to conserve cash. India resumed domestic passenger flights from May 25 after a gap of two months due to the coronavirus pandemic. The airlines have been allowed to operate only a maximum of 45 per cent of their pre-COVID domestic flights.However, occupancy rate in Indian domestic flights has been around just 50-60 per cent since May 25.

29-07-2020||India||Third minister in Shivraj Singh Chouhan cabinet tests positive for Covid-19||A third minister in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan cabinet tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday, almost within 12 hours of another minister making it public late Tuesday night that he and his wife had tested positive for Covid-19.The chief minister is also being treated for Covid-19 at a private medical college’s hospital in Bhopal since Saturday. Chouhan and the three ministers have tested positive for the virus in the span of a week.The third minister who tested positive for the virus on Wednesday happens to be a minister of state hailing from Vindhya region. Responding to messages from the chief minister, his ministerial colleagues and several other BJP leaders on Wednesday, who wished him speedy recovery from the disease the minister said, “With wishes of you all I will be fully healthy after defeating coronavirus.” A senior state BJP leader too tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday, the party’s functionaries said. The senior BJP leader had accompanied the chief minister, state BJP president VD Sharma and a minister on a state government’s plane to Lucknow on July 21 to attend the funeral of Madhya Pradesh governor Lalji Tandon who had passed the same day after being hospitalised for more than a month. The minister who accompanied the CM to Lucknow was the first minister in the state cabinet to test positive for Covid-19 on July 22, the day he attended the state cabinet meeting along with other ministers. The meeting was chaired by the CM who tested positive for the virus on July 24. Chouhan and the minister are being treated at a private medical college’s hospital in Bhopal. Meanwhile, senior BJP leader and MLA from Jabalpur Ajay Vishnoi sought to know from the CM as to why all the VIPs have been compelled to get treatment in a private hospital. “I wish chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan ji who is being treated in Chirayu hospital a speedy recovery. At the same time, my request to him is that while staying in the hospital he should see as to what is there in Chirayu which we couldn’t do in a single government medical college of the state in the past four months. Why are all the VIPs of the state compelled to take shelter at Chirayu?” he tweeted.The opposition Congress was quick to react. State Congress president’s media coordinator Narendra Saluja said, “The chief minister must reply to the question from the senior BJP leader Ajay Vishnoi. But this is not a question of just four months. The CM must tell people why the BJP government in its 15 years rule could not update a single government medical college of the state where VIPs could be treated for Covid-19. The health services in the state are in shambles. We see almost daily how people are suffering in various parts of the state because of want of health facilities.” State BJP leader Dr Hitesh Bajpai said, “I have not seen the BJP MLA’s tweet. However, if there is a question it applies more to the Congress as it’s Congress which was in power when coronavirus spread in the state and the then Kamal Nath government absolutely did nothing to upgrade a single government hospital in the state where corona patients could be treated well. Instead he was busy in IIFA award function meetings for the sake of entertainment of the ruling party leaders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/third-minister-in-shivraj-singh-chouhan-cabinet-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-JBIwf3bdueH2yHGCOddUNJ.html

Singh, who had travelled to France last year to formally receive the first fighter jet, showered praises on the multi-role aircraft for its capabilities, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the decision to buy 36 fighter jets.Singh also packed in a sharp, even if veiled, message to China’s military.ALSO WATCH | Touchdown of Rafale jets in Ambala; IAF gives water saluteDefence minister Rajnath Singh didn’t name China. He didn’t have to. China’s People’s Liberation Army has parked troops near the Line of Actual Control where it had been in a standoff with Indian defence forces since May this year. It agreed to withdraw its troops from the standoff points after a bloody clash in Ladakh’s Galwan area following PLA’s attempts to erect structures on the Indian side led to the death of 20 Indian soldiers and an unspecified number of casualties on the Chinese side.Also Read: Indian Air Force with Rafale has plan to take the fight to ChinaBut Beijing has been slow to carry out a complete disengagement of troops as agreed between the two sides in several rounds of military and diplomatic talks. Besides, the army has also reported that the PLA, which thinned out its troops in the forward areas, had mobilised nearly 50,000 troops in the depth areas.“I would like to add, if it is anyone who should be worried about or critical about this new capability of the Indian Air Force, it should be those who want to threaten our territorial integrity,” Rajnath tweeted and posted a video clip of the Rafale jets landing at the Ambala base of the Indian Air Force.The fighter jets are widely seen as a game changer for India’s strategic capabilities who underline that it will significantly enhance the offensive capabilities of the Indian Air Force (IAF) with their advanced weaponry. The jet is capable of carrying out a variety of missions — ground and sea attack, air defence and air superiority, reconnaissance and nuclear strike deterrence, they say.

The government, however, fought it out, defending the deal in the Supreme Court and campaigning for the Lok Sabha elections. It won.Singh credited the prime minister’s courage for going ahead with the deal.“The Rafale jets were purchased only because PM Shri @narendramodi took the right decision to get these aircrafts through an Inter-Governmental Agreement with France, after the long pending procurement case for them could not progress.

Welcome,” a rough translation of his tweet says.राष्ट्ररक्षासमं पुण्यं,राष्ट्ररक्षासमं व्रतम्,राष्ट्ररक्षासमं यज्ञो,दृष्टो नैव च नैव च।।नभः स्पृशं दीप्तम्...स्वागतम्! #RafaleInIndia pic.twitter.com/lSrNoJYqZOPrime Minister Narendra Modi’s tweet also carries a reference to the motto carved on Indian Air Force insignia which says ‘Nav sparsham deeptam’ in Sanskrit or ‘touch the sky with glory’Prime Minister Narendra Modi is believed to have personally advocated for entering a government to government agreement with France for the procurement of 36 Rafale jets.The new Rafale fighters jets will significantly enhance the offensive capabilities of the Indian Air Force (IAF) and prove to be a game-changer with their advanced weaponry, defence experts have said.After the Rafale jets touched down in Ambala, defence minister Rajnath Singh delivered a veiled warning to adversaries looking to challenge India’s territorial integrity without naming China, which has been locked in a protracted border conflict with India in eastern Ladakh, where a deadly clash between the armies of the two sides resulted in deaths of 20 Indian soldiers and an unspecified number of casualties on the Chinese side. India has accused the Chinese Army of attempting to alter the status quo on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control.“I would like to add, if it is anyone who should be worried about or critical about this new capability of the Indian Air Force, it should be those who want to threaten our territorial integrity,” Rajnath tweeted and posted a video clip of the Rafale jets landing at the Ambala base of the Indian Air Force.Rajnath also credited the Prime Minister with taking a timely decision for the purchase of the aircraft.“The Rafale jets were purchased only because PM Shri @narendramodi took the right decision to get these aircrafts through an Inter-Governmental Agreement with France, after the long pending procurement case for them could not progress. I thank him for his courage & decisiveness,” he said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the subject of a sustained political attack over the Rafale deal with France by the Congress-- led by its former president Rahul Gandhi in the run up to 2019 Lok Sabha polls—alleging irregularities in the government to government deal. However, the Supreme Court rejected the contention and the NDA led by PM Modi stormed back into power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-vision-with-a-tweet-in-sanskrit-prime-minister-narendra-modi-welcomes-rafale-fighter-jets-in-india/story-FvZnFFXHg7al5XxnVLvv4L.html

He suggested calling a regular monsoon session on a 21-day notice. Soon after, CM Gehlot called for a cabinet meeting.The Rajasthan government wants to have an assembly session from July 31. The cabinet note sent earlier to the governor did not specify if the chief minister will seek a trust vote during the session. The opposition BJP has not called for a trust vote, neither have rebel leader Sachin Pilot and the MLAs supporting him. Earlier, Gehlot had said he wanted to seek a trust vote to end the political uncertainty in the state. In his last message on Monday, the governor said only a written request on the trust vote as an agenda of the session could form the basis for calling the House on a short notice. Before that, the governor had suggested a 21-day notice period to convene the House, sought clarity on the session’s agenda and advised live-streaming of the floor test, in case it was held and also asked about Covid-19 related precautions in the assembly.The Gehlot-led cabinet, which met on Tuesday, had claimed Governor Mishra did not have any locus standi in stipulating conditions to hold the session. The cabinet asked Mishra to abide by its proposal and claimed the failure to do so would be unconstitutional.It also asserted that the agenda of the session will be determined by the business advisory committee of the house. It was the speaker’s domain to decide on social distancing norms in the assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-governor-spurns-cm-gehlot-for-3rd-time-over-house-session-request/story-UFAZXKAS2qWvw8xLNhzoII.html

The deceased was identified as Shiva Kumar (40), working as a clerk in State Bank of India, Nandyal branch and a native of Rythunagaram village. The accident happened near Chapireruvla toll plaza on the outskirts of Nandyal town. Nandyal sub-inspector of police Sudhakar Reddy said Shiva Kumar, along with his three friends – K Kasaiah, G S Kumar and C Surendra, was returning to Nandyal from Hyderabad in a car via Nandyal, after attending some personal work. “As the car was approaching Nandyal, one of them who was driving the vehicle lost control over the steering and rammed the car into a container truck from behind at a high speed. The front portion of the car was mangled badly and got stuck under the container,” the SI said. The truck driver, who apparently had not noticed the car stuck under the vehicle on the rear side, continued to drive for nearly three kilometres. “It was only after the car exploded in flames that the truck came to a halt,” the police official said. While the three friends managed to save their lives by quickly jumping out of the car, Shiva Kumar could not come out quickly because of his disability in the lower limbs. As the flames engulfed the entire car, he was charred to death, the SI said. Police officials from Nandyal rushed a fire tender to the spot and brought the flames under control. While the car was completely gutted, the container truck was partially damaged in the fire. “We have registered a case and are inquiring into the cause of the accident,” Sudhakar Reddy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/physically-challenged-man-charred-to-death-as-car-explodes-after-hitting-truck-in-ap/story-tf6yra3UaANR0BHfbFMsBN.html
29-07-2020||India||Hany Babu sent to NIA custody till August 4||A special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on Wednesday remanded Hany Babu Musaliyarveettil Tharayil (54), an associate professor in the Department of English of Delhi University (DU), to the central agency’s custody under August 4. Tharayil, who was arrested by the NIA on Tuesday in connection with the Elgar Parishad/Bhima Koregaon case, was produced before the special NIA court on Wednesday morning. The special public prosecutor Prakash Shetty demanded his custody with NIA for 10 days for his custodial interrogation. The prosecution, while seeking his custody, argued that Tharayil had links with the outlawed Communist Party of India (CPI) (Maoist) and was one of the key conspirators in the case. The prosecution also pointed out that there were letters exchanged between the accused, which were recovered by Pune Police that initially investigated the Elgar Parishad/Bhima Koregaon case, and later NIA took over it on January 24. The investigating agency allegedly found the mention of his name and role in those letters. The plea was opposed by his lawyer R. Sathyanarayan claiming that Tharayil was being interrogated for the last four-five days and as a result, his further custody is not needed. The court after hearing both the side, observed, “looking at the nature of the offence and the allegations levelled against the accused, the demand for his custody for 10 days is well-founded”.Later, the court remanded him to NIA custody until August 4. Earlier on April 14, the central agency had arrested academic and civil rights activists Dr. Anand Teltumbde and Gautam Navlakha for their alleged involvement in the same case. Tharayil is the third person, who has been arrested by NIA.The agency claimed that during further investigation, it was revealed that Tharayil was propagating Maoist ideology and was a “co-conspirator” with the other arrested accused in the Elgar Parishad/Bhima Koregaon case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hany-babu-send-to-nia-custody-till-august-4/story-HMbbeJL9tu1lQD7xJLn8fL.html
29-07-2020||India||Assembly polls in Bihar unlikely amid Covid-19, says Prashant Kishor||Poll strategist Prashant Kishor has scaled down the activities of I-PAC (Indian Political Action Committee) in Patna and has said that the prospects of assembly elections in Bihar have dimmed.Amid speculation that he could wind up from Bihar due to lack of takers, unlike 2015 elections when he was much in demand in the Grand Alliance (GA) and worked closely with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Kishor said he was not in Bihar with any short-term goal of fighting election and there was no question of winding up activities here, though it had been scaled down due to pandemic. “But yes, I do see a fast diminishing prospect of a timely assembly election in Bihar. I am of firm opinion that elections will not be held due to the worsening situation in the state. It should not be held and it would not be held, as the situation in Bihar mandates the entire focus to be on Covid-19 management and control,” he said. Kishor said it was just not feasible to ask seven crore voters to move out of their homes and vote when the Covid-19 situation would be at its peak in the state. The elections are scheduled in October-November.Bihar’s Covid-19 tally stands at 45,919. In the last 24 hours, the state reported 2,328 fresh cases. The state is also battling floods at many places.Kishor warned that the Covid pandemic could get worse in the days to come. “I have nothing to do with elections in Bihar this time, as I will not be participating in it, but any attempt to hold elections in the midst of a pandemic would have catastrophic consequences. Political parties have seen the result of virtual rallies,” he added. He said that when the Election Commission (EC) was finding it difficult even to hold by-elections for a few seats, expecting an assembly election involving the entire state was highly unlikely. “Since March, no election has been held in the country. The theory of postal ballot was also floated, but the EC has rejected that also,” he added. Kishor said that the I-PAC had enough work across the country and in Bihar it has a long-term vision. “We are engaged in the making of CMs in six states, but in Bihar we are with no political party or alliance. We have our set up of I-PAC in Patna and that will continue. The response of ‘Baat Bihar Ki’ is for anyone to see, but this is not the time to take the risk of virtual campaigning as BJP and JD-U risked,” he added. In February during his first interaction with the media in Patna after his expulsion from the JD-U, Kishor had said that he was not there to get any alliance win or lose elections. “I will work to prepare youth who could take Bihar forward, those who had dreamt to change it to be among the top-10 states in the next 10 years. I have a long-term and medium-term plan, starting with ‘Baat Bihar ki’ on February 20, a programme to involve 1,000 committed youth from across the state,” he had added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assembly-polls-in-bihar-unlikely-amid-covid-19-says-prashant-kishor/story-XooW8MfdZsXGPbV8dlucEL.html

The PIL has not been listed for hearing yet. ​The petition stated that the Council of Ministers had requested Governor Mishra thrice to convene the assembly session, but the plea was turned down on one pretext or the other. “As per the settled law by the Supreme Court (SC) in the matter of Nabam Rebia and Bamang Felix versus Deputy Speaker case, it has been held by the apex court’s Constitution Bench that the Governor is under obligation as provided in the Constitution of India to accept the advice of the Council of the Ministers,” it said. The petitioner further stated that it cannot be contended that the Governor has the freedom to determine when and under what circumstances he should exercise his discretionary powers without aid and advice of Chief Minister and his Council of Ministers that is enshrined in Article 163(2) of the Constitution. The Governor is entitled to exercise discretionary powers under Article 163(1) of the Constitution., it added. The petitioner has moved HC, seeking direction be given to Governor Mishra to convene the assembly session and Speaker CP Joshi be directed to follow the due procedure for legislative proceedings in a bid to end the prevailing constitutional deadlock.Rajasthan has plunged into a political turmoil following an internal rebellion of 19 Congress lawmakers, headed by sacked deputy CM Sachin Pilot, against the Ashok Gehlot-led government, which started over two weeks ago.

29-07-2020||India||Covid-19: Rajasthan governor cancels ‘at home’ event on Independence Day||Jaipur: Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra on Wednesday cancelled the customary Independence Day “At Home” programme at the Raj Bhavan because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak in the state. The Governor also used pandemic as one of the reasons not to convene the assembly session, despite the Ashok Gehlot-led government’s insistence and three proposals sent to him. The Raj Bhavan hosts the “At Home” programme on the occasion of the Republic Day and the Independence Day on January 26 and February 15, respectively, every year. “The Governor has expressed deep concern about the severe Covid-19 outbreak in the state. The rising number of active Covid-19 cases in the state is a worrisome cause,” stated a communiqué from the Raj Bhavan. It quoted Governor Mishra, who said that when the Rajasthan assembly was adjourned sine die on March 13, there only two active Covid-19 cases in the state. “There were 3,381 active cases in Rajasthan on July 1, which has breached the 10,000-mark on July 28. The state needs to make serious efforts to check the spread of the viral infection,” it added. Rajasthan reported 38,964 Covid-19 cases until Wednesday morning, including 10,745 are active cases. In a separate move, Governor Mishra, who has been rebuffing the Gehlot government’s move to convene the assembly session, has returned its proposal for the third time, even though the reasons ascribed to it are not clear as of now.Chief minister Ashok Gehlot reached the Congress office in Jaipur with party legislators from the hotel, who have been holed up there along the Jaipur-Hotel highway since a bitter internal power struggle started over two weeks.The Congress infighting has been fuelled by sacked deputy CM Sachin Pilot and backed by another 18 dissident party lawmakers. Though Gehlot had come to meet the new Rajasthan Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra, who has replaced a rebellious Pilot, he immediately drove to the Raj Bhawan, when he heard that Governor Mishra has returned the proposal for the third time to convene the crucial assembly session. Gehlot has been eager to prove his government’s majority on the floor of the 200-member House amid the Pilot faction’s bid to pull the rug beneath the ruling Congress dispensation’s feet that is allegedly being aided and abetted by the main opposition, Bharatiya Janata Party. The ongoing Rajasthan political drama appears to be an echo of what had unfolded in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh (MP) in March and had triggered Kamal Nath-led government’s collapse, paving the way for Shivraj Singh Chouhan taking oath as the MP CM for the fourth time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-rajasthan-governor-cancels-at-home-event-on-independence-day/story-1J8GycXiXNB4LUXURP5QoM.html

They have also raised complaints against the poor lodging arrangements for them. “Complaining about worms in food has been done several times both by resident doctors and the non-clinical staff. Sometimes not even fan works in the place given to resident doctors to rest after working hours,” said Dr Neeraj Mishra, president of the Uttar Pradesh chapter of the Resident Doctors’ Welfare Association (RDWA).The pictures of worms in food at the King George’s Medical University (KGMU) were also shared on social media by doctors.

I wish to bring this to your notice,” Jangi Lal wrote to the in charge of the quarantine centre.President of nurses association, KGMU, Yadunandini Singh said, “Insects in food packets show carelessness and also pose a threat to the health of staff who after eating it may suffer illness.

The staff circulated photographs of the food served on social media. “Food is significant.

I pray for his good health and long life,” tweeted the rebel leader on Wednesday.  राजस्थान विधानसभा अध्यक्ष @drcpjoshi जी को जन्मदिवस की हार्दिक बधाई एवं शुभकामनाएं।मैं ईश्वर से आपके उत्तम स्वास्थ्य एवं दीर्घायु जीवन की कामना करता हूँ।Speaker Joshi is yet to respond or acknowledge the greeting.Pilot, who was sacked as deputy chief minister and as head of pradesh Congress unit, and his 18 MLA are awaiting the high court’s decision on their challenge to the speaker’s disqualification notice. The court has ordered status quo to be maintained on the notices issued to the Pilot camp, essentially meaning that team Pilot does not have to appear before the speaker or answer the notices. The court has also ordered that no action will be taken against in the interim period. The speaker had served the notices on July 15, asking the rebels why they should not be disqualified after they skipped two consecutive Congress legislature party meetings defying the party whip. Team Pilot has argued that a party whip applies when the House is in session, not outside it. Also, mere disagreement does not amount to defection, they added. Additionally, the team argued that notices were a violation of their freedom of speech right. Sachin Pilot has categorically denied that he joining the BJP.Speaker Joshi took the matter to the Supreme Court, arguing that the state court cannot interfere in the legislative business. Also, the court cannot intervene before a decision is made by the speaker. The apex court, refusing the speaker’s plea to stop the state court from deciding, said the “voice of dissent cannot be suppressed”.“Can a person elected by people not express his dissent? Voice of dissent cannot be suppressed. In a democracy, can somebody be shut down like this?” the court asked.The Speaker has thereafter dropped his case in the top court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachin-pilot-tweets-birthday-wish-for-rajasthan-speaker-amid-fight-in-court/story-x5cxTB1Cp3JuaF25n5WD2H.html

29-07-2020||India||HC restrains Godfrey Philips from infringing ITC’s FLAKE trademark||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday restrained Godfrey Philips (India) Limited from infringing copyright of ITC Limited in the rival cigarette manufacturers’ FLAKE packs and also from using any imitations of the artworks appearing on the latter’s best-selling tobacco products’ pack in West Bengal and north-east India. Justice BP Colabawalla issued the pro-tem order after coming to the prima facie conclusion that Godfrey Philips had substantially copied the patterns and colour scheme appearing on FLAKE REFINED TASTE pack of ITC on its (Godfrey’s) SELECT pack being sold in the same market --- West Bengal and north-east India. ITC moved HC after Godfrey Phillips adopted new design on its SELECT pack in December 2019. It alleged that the rival had infringed its trademark and sought an injunction, contending that Godfrey Philips had tried to encash the goodwill enjoyed by its FLAKE brand in West Bengal and north-eastern parts of the country. ITC argued that the trademark enjoyed a considerable reputation in these markets and pointed out that it had garnered Rs 50,475 crore in gross sales of the FLAKE brand since 1994. In 2018-19, the FLAEK’s gross sales stood at Rs 6,603.64 crore, including Rs. 3,675 crore earned from the sales of the FLAKE REFINED TASTE brand. Justice Colabawalla accepted the submissions made on behalf of ITC that the trademark adopted by Godfrey Philips on its SELECT pack was a substantial copy of the complainant’s FLAKE brand. “Prima facie, it appears that launch of the defendant’s (Godfrey Philips’) impugned (SELECT) pack in the same market with a strikingly similar artistic label is itself indicative of the defendant’s ill-intent,” said the judge. “Looking at the popularity of the FLAKE REFINED TASTE pack of the plaintiff in these markets (West Bengal and north-east India), where the defendant has also launched the impugned pack, prima facie, it appears that it wants to boost its sales by coming as close as possible to the FLAKE REFINED TASTE brand of the plaintiff,” he added. HC noted that the pack of the Godfrey Philips used boomerang-shaped devices comprising of concentric arcs in gold and red colour scheme on its SELECT pack, which, prima facie, appeared to be a substantial replication of the boomerang that appears on FLAKE REFINED TASTE pack. “It has the same white gold and red colour scheme as that of the plaintiff’s FLAKE REFINED TASTE pack,” said the judge. “It cannot be a matter of coincidence that the stylised “S” adopted (by Godfrey Philips) in the present case is a substantial copy of the boomerang appearing on the plaintiff’s (ITC’s) pack.” The judge also said that the colour combination and the brand name is written in red bold font against a white background, which follows the pattern on FLAKE REFINED TASTE pack, and even the adoption of the five-spiked crest device by Godfrey Philips, prima facie, appears to be a substantial copy of the five-spiked crest device used by ITC on its packs. “Looking at all this material, prima facie, I am of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to an injunction in terms of prayer for restraining the defendant from infringing the plaintiff’s copyright in its FLAKE REFINED TASTE pack,” the judge added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-restrains-godfrey-philips-from-infringing-itc-s-flake-trademark/story-niwC1RZocYblzcS3jA5MSL.html
29-07-2020||India||Gehlot meets governor after he sends back proposal on assembly session again||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot met Governor Kalraj Mishra on Wednesday after Raj Bhavan returned his proposal to convene the session of the state assembly for the third time, officials said. Gehlot, while addressing a programme at Congress’ state unit office, said a “prem patra” or love letter has come from the Rajasthan governor. This was the second time he referred to the governor’s rejection as a love letter. “The love letter has already come. Now, I am only going to have tea with him. You have sent the letter a third time. What do you want? Tell us, so that we work in that manner,” Gehlot said in his address at the Pradesh Congress Committee office, where Govind Singh Dotasra formally took over as the new chief of the state unit. Addressing the Congress workers, the chief minister asked them not to be worried and assured them that “the high command is with you all”.“For the first time in history, sit-in protests were staged across the country outside Raj Bhavans. The Speak Up Democracy campaign was successful and it will continue. After the campaign the workers are enthused and a message conveyed in the public,” he said. Gehlot said there will be a new turning point when victory will be achieved in Rajasthan. “We will win and those who have betrayed will be back after apologising the high command and their decision will be followed. People’s trust should not be broken by anyone,” he said. The state government had sent its third proposal to Mishra to reiterate its demand to convene an assembly session from July 31 without mentioning whether it will seek a trust vote in the House. Before that, the governor had suggested a 21-day notice period to convene the House, sought clarity on the session’s agenda and advised live-streaming of the floor test, in case it was held and also asked about Covid-19 related precautions in the assembly. The Gehlot-led cabinet, which met on Tuesday, had claimed Governor Mishra did not have any locus standi in stipulating conditions to hold the session. The cabinet asked Mishra to abide by its proposal and claimed the failure to do so would be unconstitutional. It also asserted that the agenda of the session will be determined by the business advisory committee of the house. It was the speaker’s domain to decide on social distancing norms in the assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cm-gehlot-to-meet-governor-after-proposal-for-assembly-session-rejected-for-the-third-time-say-sources/story-1vXOEO8tN6kDv0LFKgc5zL.html

The soldiers fought off numerically superior Chinese troops in the remote sector amid a border standoff that has been marked by several skirmishes. Col B Santosh Babu, the commanding officer of 16 Bihar, was among the 20 soldiers killed in the seven-hour clash near Patrolling Point 14 in Galwan Valley, where outnumbered Indian troops inflicted heavy casualties on the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA). The names of all battle casualties are inscribed on the memorial, the officials said. During a recent visit to Ladakh, defence minister Rajnath Singh met and acknowledged the bravery of soldiers from 16 Bihar in the presence of the military’s top brass. Beijing has not disclosed the number of fatalities it suffered in the Galwan Valley clash but according to India’s assessment the PLA suffered twice as many casualties. Apart from 16 Bihar, soldiers from 3 Punjab, 3 Medium Regiment and 81 Field Regiment were involved in the first deadly clash between Indian and Chinese troops along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in more than five decades. The Indian soldiers confronted the Chinese troops, who refused to remove their installations and vacate the area, triggering a violent clash that involved more than 600 rival soldiers at its peak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/names-of-20-galwan-valley-martyrs-to-be-inscribed-at-national-war-memorial-as-tribute/story-FRmZtWW2DMQOJiMxKNX86H.html
29-07-2020||India||Indian Air Force with Rafale has plan to take the fight to China||While the Indian Air Force (IAF) plan against the threat of Chinese Air Force remains classified, the basic strategy against People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was put to test very successfully during 2018 Gagan Shakti pan-India air exercises. The strategy is simple: Disperse, Absorb, Recoup and Retaliate.Air warriors like Air Chief Marshal (Retd) Birender Singh Dhanoa know that the Chinese will launch a barrage of early long range missile strikes against Indian air bases to incapacitate them. However, according to a March 2020 Belfer Center Study of Harvard Kennedy School, this is easier said than done.Also read: Chinese bunkers at Lhasa airport, just 1,350 km from Delhi, worry IndiaThe study quotes a senior IAF officer saying that the Chinese need 220 ballistic missiles to keep one airfield shut for 24 hours.“This will not make any difference to IAF operations in the east or the west since the Force has a large number of other airfields (from Leh to Pasighat) to operate from. If the PLA air force attacks just three air bases, it will require 660 ballistic missiles per day for attacking the runway and taxi track alone. China’s stock of 1,000-1,200 medium range ballistic missiles or short range ballistic missiles will be over in three days with no other major target system like command and communication centres or air defence units being addressed,” the study says.While recognising the rocket threat from China, the IAF strategy has been fine tuned to an art form and put to practice through more than 6,000 sorties alone on the eastern front during Exercise Gagan Shakti. “The moment the red flag is up, we will disperse the aircraft from the designated fields to all along the border with China with sufficient ammunition in those bases to take care of the air operations,” said a serving Air Force commander.The next step in the Indian counter strategy is to absorb the attack at the air bases and quickly repair the runway and the taxiway. It is understood that the IAF has the capacity to repair the runway and get the air base operational within four to six hours. “We don’t have either the US Patriot anti missile system or the Israeli Iron Dome system. But have a proven capacity, tested under Gagan Shakti to repair the runways within six hours maximum,” said the IAF officer.Former Air Chief Dhanoa explains it by saying that even if Chabua, Tezpur, Leh, Adampur air bases are down, the dispersed aircraft will start operating from other bases like Bareilly, Dimapur, Kanpur and Gorakhpur and a dozen of other airfields. “The next steps are to recoup and then retaliate,” he said.During the 2018 Gagan Shakti exercise, then defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman and then air chief Dhanoa landed at Pasighat advanced landing ground with a Su-30 taking off from the new air strip.While the Chinese rocket attack will damage the Indian air bases, the inherent problem of rocket attack is that it is a one-time attack and there is a limitation on the warhead load.“Just as the Chinese have the missile ranges to reach any corner of India, the reverse is equally true with the Agni V missile ready and operational. To add to this the Indian manned fighters like Rafale and Sukhoi carry over 30 tons of ordnance to be delivered with pin-pointed accuracy. Compare this to a 100 kg warhead on a missile and you get an answer to what is more lethal,” said a senior IAF officer.Even though the Chinese military propaganda is on a full swing with so called use of powerful ammunition, the fact is that IAF has both the capacity and capability to bring the fight to Han China, way beyond occupied Tibet and Xinjiang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-air-force-with-rafale-has-plan-to-take-the-fight-to-china/story-LO180PXKHS3YyRO4vDYrpO.html

Mishra also informed them about the various measures taken by the state government to tackle the Covid-19 crisis.

The six BSP members of Rajasthan legislative assembly (MLAs,) who had merged with the Ashok Gehlot–led government, are Sandeep Yadav, Tijara MLA, Wajib Ali (Nagar), Deepchand Kheria (Kishangarh Bas), LakhanMeena (Karauli), and Rajendra Gudha (Udaipurwati). “The merger of these six MLAs is unconstitutional. The BSP didn’t merge with theCongress, either at the national level or the state level. As per law, parties merge, but not legislators. Besides, these MLAs didn’t submit their resignations and as a result, the BSP’s national secretary had issued a whip. They are liable to be disqualified under the 10th Schedule of the Constitution of India, which deals with anti-defection,” said Dinesh Garg, the BSP counsel. The BSP whip directed its party MLAs to vote against the Ashok Gehlot-led government in any assembly proceedings, including the no-confidence motion, amid the rebellion within the ruling Congress’s ranks led by sacked deputy CM Sachin Pilot and supported by 18 other dissident lawmakers. On Tuesday, Madan Dilawar, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator, had also filed two petitions in the HC, seeking disqualification of the six BSP lawmakers, who had merged with the Gehlot-led government on September 18, 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsp-moves-rajasthan-hc-challenges-merger-of-party-mlas-with-congress/story-ru7ZJIQh4oybL0xUqYh0uM.html

Rajput was found dead in his Bandra flat in Mumbai on June 14.Here are some of the allegations made by Rajput’s father:* The case has been lodged under various sections of IPC including 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), 380 (theft in dwelling house), 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 306 (abetment of suicide) and 120(B).* “Sushant’s father has made a serious charge against Rhea and her family. He has alleged that she had kept Sushant away from his family and completely in her possession. She was also handling his bank account. It was also reported that crores of rupees were withdrawn from his bank account,” Sanjay Singh, inspector general of police (Patna Central Zone).* Rajput’s father has said in his FIR that on June 8 when Rhea Chakraborty found that his son’s bank balance was going down, she left with cash, jewellery, laptop, credit card, its PIN number and password and important documents and doctors’ receipts.* “Sushant called his sister and told her that Rhea had threatened him to show doctor receipts to the media and would prove him mad. Thereafter, no person would give him work,” Singh said in the FIR.* “On June 8 night, Sushant’s secretary Disha committed suicide. Rhea had appointed her as Sushant’s secretary. Later, Rhea blocked Sushant’s number on her cell. Sushant was afraid that Rhea could have made him responsible for his manager’s suicide as she had threatened to frame him in the secretary’s suicide case.”* In his complaint, Rajput’s father has also sought to invoke the provisions of the Mental Health Care Act, alleging that the “machinations” of Chakraborty and her family members had caused his son to crack up, despite a successful career in films, and ultimately drove him to suicide.* KK Singh has accused Chakraborty of having befriended Rajput in May 2019 with a clear intent to use his good contacts for the advancement of her own career.* He has also alleged that the actress was aided by her family members, including her parents, since they all were looking to “purloin the assets of my son worth crores of rupees and started interfering in all aspects of his life.”* KK Singh also wants a police investigation to ascertain where the Rs 15 crore deposited in a bank account held by Rajput was transferred.* The complaint said Chakraborty and her family convinced Rajput to leave his own residence and stay at a resort in the vicinity of Mumbai claiming his house was “haunted”.* KK Singh has alleged that Chakraborty got Rajput treated by some “conniving” doctors for mental illness while keeping his family in the dark.* “At one point of time, my son decided to give up films, settle down in Coorg and pursue farming. He was blackmailed by Chakraborty who threatened him that she would make his medical history public and let the world know that he was mentally unstable, putting his career in jeopardy,” he alleged in the FIR.(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.

Specially tailored for the IAF, the Rafale jets have cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases including Leh, radar warning receivers, flight data recorders with storage for 10 hours of data, infrared search and track systems, low-band jammers, Israeli helmet-mounted displays and towed decoys to ward off incoming missiles.These Rafale jets will be armed with Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, MICA multi-mission air-to-air missiles and Scalp deep-strike cruise missiles — weapons that will allow fighter pilots to attack air and ground targets from standoff ranges and fill a significant capability gap.The Meteor’s no-escape zone is touted to be three times greater than that of current medium-range air-to-air missiles. The Meteor, with a range estimated to be well above 120 kilometres, outranges any other missile in aerial combat.The Meteor is the next generation of BVR air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) designed to revolutionise air-to-air combat. The weapon has been developed by MBDA to combat common threats facing the UK, Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Sweden. Also read: With Rafales’ induction, IAF will have an edge over neighbours. Here’s howIt is powered by a unique rocket-ramjet motor that gives it far more engine power for much longer than any other missile, said an official.The Scalp is a deep-strike cruise missile known for having pinpoint terminal accuracy through its highly accurate seeker and target recognition system.The twin-engine fighter jet’s ‘payload fraction’ or its maximum take-off weight vis-a-vis its overall empty weight is unmatched in aircraft of the same class. It can carry almost 10 tonnes of weapons and five tonnes of fuel. Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha (retd), a former IAF chief, said the active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar on the Rafale and its weapons package make it a formidable platform.India is also looking at arming the Rafale fighter jets with an all-weather smart weapon of French origin that will allow combat pilots to engage ground targets from a standoff range of up to 60km. The IAF is likely to initiate the purchase of HAMMER (Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range) using the emergency financial powers granted to the military by the government at a time of border tensions with China.HAMMER is a precision-guided missile developed by French defence major Safran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/missile-systems-cold-engine-start-make-multi-role-rafales-all-the-more-deadly/story-ljTLNh5wnvgqkdklfbFhSP.html
29-07-2020||India||Wildlife conservationists blame poaching for lack of rise in tiger numbers in Odisha||While several states, including Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Karnataka, have shown a considerable surge in tiger numbers in the All India Tiger Census 2018, wildlife conservationists in Odisha have slammed lack of growth of tigers in Odisha. The conservationists have demanded the government explain spending crores of Rupees in the name of tiger conservation in the state.The final reports of the 2018 census conducted by the National Tiger Conservation Authority showed Odisha’s tigers numbers at 28, same as it was in the 2014 census. Tiger population in Similipal-Satkosia block is severely depressed, the report said, adding that only one tiger was recorded in the north part of the Satkosia tiger reserve while in Similipal reserve, the presence of 8 adult tigers (7 female and only one 2 male) could be identified.Also read: One in three tigers live outside reserves - ReportWildlife conservationist Biswajit Mohanty there were 28 tigers in 2014 in Odisha. He said the census counts tiger cubs that are more than 1-year-old and they should have been part of the final count too. “Tigers are good breeders. The state should have added at least 12 to 15 more tigers during the last four years if not more. The reason it did not happen is only due to rampant poaching which is taking a heavy toll in tigers of Odisha,” said Mohanty.Mohanty said, as per the state government’s own statistics, Odisha had reported 192 wild tigers including 60 cubs in 2002. “If the cubs are discounted then there were 132 wild tigers which has now fallen to only 28. Thus in 16 years, Odisha has lost 104 adult tigers in though at least Rs 60 crores has been spent on their protection and management by the state. Simlipal Tiger Reserve lost 75 wild tigers as per the state government census figures of 2006 and 2016. No accountability was fixed on the forest officials though we had spent crores on tiger protection till mid-2020,” Mohanty said.Dismissing the state government’s earlier claims of at least 100 tigers in Similipal, wildlife activist Aditya Panda said there is no point living in a dream. “No one is going to be fooled by the claims of government experts that Similipal had more than 100 tigers. The state needs to come clean. It should now set a target for the next 10 years so that the numbers can be revived,” said Panda.Commenting on the failed exercise of India’s first inter-state relocation to Satkosia that was abandoned in 2018 after the death of a relocated tiger from Madhya Pradesh, the tiger census report said the failure was due to the hostility among local communities and their intensive use of the tiger reserve resources for livelihoods. The tiger relocation exercise was suspended in November 2018 after a three-year-old tiger, that was shifted from Madhya Pradesh to Satkosia tiger reserve, died of the wounds it received from the snares laid by poachers earlier that year.“As parts of the tiger reserve and corridors are shared with people, it is also important to strengthen the social carrying capacity. Community participation, alternative livelihoods, and law enforcement are required before tigers can be supplemented in Satkosia,” it said.On Similipal tiger reserve, the census report said as it has a reasonably high prey base, it has the potential to sustain higher tiger densities. “However, consistently low density of tigers in the reserve over the years calls for active management intervention. The management has done a good job of relocating several human settlements from the Tiger Reserve and with good protection from poaching, the tiger population should recover in the near future,” the report said.It, however, said that the current strength of the tiger population in the reserve was facing extinction and it may be prudent to supplement a few tigers from Bandhavgarh tiger reserve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wildlife-conservationists-blame-poaching-for-lack-of-rise-in-tiger-numbers-in-odisha/story-PIM74DhhOLYbzvMpBXnaFJ.html

S Dhanoa. Five Rafale fighters will land at Ambala air base today from France for induction into IAF today .Talking to Hindustan Times, Dhanoa, the chief architect of February 26, 2019 air strikes on Balakot, said that Rafale with its top of the line electronic warfare suite, Meteor beyond visual range missile and SCALP air to ground weapon with its terrain following capability outguns any threat that the Chinese Air Force produces. Painting a wartime scenario, former top gun said : “ If the IAF is successful in destruction of enemy air defences and suppression of enemy air defences, then the Chinese fighters out in the open at Hotan air base and at Gonggar air base at Lhasa airport are fair targets. Some 70 Chinese aircraft are without protection at Hotan and some 26 aircraft may be parked inside a tunnel which the PLA were building at Lhasa air base,” the former air chief said.ALSO WATCH | Touchdown of Rafale jets in Ambala; IAF gives water saluteAlso Read: In China’s troop movements in Ladakh’s depth areas, a hint about its real planWhile Air Chief Marshal (Retd) Dhanoa recognises the threat presented by Chinese J-20 fifth generation fighter, he is very confident that the IAF with its latest Rafale and Su-30 MKI will be able to counter the best the Chinese throw at India in the worst case scenario. “Chinese Air Threat is mainly from their Surface to Air Missile Systems.”Also Read: Four sub-killer P-8I craft coming to India next year, then talks for six more“ If Chinese equipment was so good, then why did the Pakistanis only use F-16 aircraft to attack Nangi Tekri brigade in Rajouri sector on February 27, 2019 with Chinese JF-17 merely giving air defence cover to Mirage 3/5 bombers. The Mirage 3/5 dropped the H 2/4 bombs from a safe distance with the JF 17 in a supportive role providing Air Defence to these aircraft! Why does Pakistan use Swedish early air warning platforms up north and keep Chinese AWACS in the south? Why is Pakistan mounting European radar (Selex Gallelio) and Turkish targeting pod on Chinese JF-17 ? The answer is quite evident,” the former Chief said.Also Read: Twin naval exercises with US supercarriers signal QUAD has arrivedHowever, the brilliant air tactician recognizes the Chinese threat in form of surface to air missile batteries and artillery guns, which the PLA has packed in occupied Aksai Chin. But he also makes it very clear that with no tree line cover available to the Chinese platforms, they would be sitting ducks if the air defence cover is blown over. “ The Rafale with its advanced terrain following weapons and level II of Digital Terrain Elevation Data available to the Indian pilot, the error probability of the weapon is reduced to mere 10 metres. As I have said in the past, Rafale is a game changer,” former Air Chief Dhanoa said.Also Read: US UAV, Israeli loitering bombs as Indian infantry gets lethalWhile Dhanoa appreciates the enemy threat, his serving IAF officers make it very clear that the Chinese equipment is not only inferior to the US equipment but also the Russian equipment. “ Why does Chinese Air Force use Russian Su-30 and Su-35 fighters while facing the US threat in South China Sea? The fact is that the Chinese fighters are no match for the American equipment Majority of Chinese equipment is reverse engineering of Russian equipment and fighters have designs of either Su-27 or Su 30 platform. They are even powered by Russian AL 31 F (Su-30) and RD 33 (MiG-29) engines,” a serving air commander told Hindustan Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rafale-is-a-game-changer-chinese-j-20-does-not-even-come-close-says-former-air-chief-dhanoa/story-3UJINQ1r8cuGputdMeQpOJ.html

Ajay Kumar Bassi, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) with the CBI was ordered by the agency to go to Port Blair on January 11, 2019. However, he refused to go claiming that the transfer order was illegal. His lawyer, senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, claimed that the first order transferring him to Andaman and Nicobar Island was passed by the CBI on October 24, 2018. Against this decision, he had approached the apex court complaining that the decision to transfer him was part of a conspiracy to influence the course of an investigation conducted by him against another senior officer of the CBI. Also read: Babri mosque case - Special CBI court completes recording of statementsOn January 9, Bassi’s transfer order was withdrawn after Alok Kumar Verma won the case in the Supreme Court and got reinstated as the CBI director. Two days later, M Nageshwar Rao took over as the acting director of the agency and gave effect to Bassi’s earlier transfer order. Since then, Bassi moved an application challenging his transfer in the Supreme Court, citing “personal domestic exigencies” to his employer. He has since then not being given any salary. The bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde said, “How can you not join your place of posting… Even if an order is illegal, you cannot disobey it. You have to get it set aside by the Court.” Dhavan sought protection for one month citing that the agency had brought out a charge sheet against him, blaming him for approaching the Court without seeking permission from the CBI. Bassi planned to approach the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) against his transfer order. The bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said, “We can’t help you… Unless the order of transfer has been set aside or modified by this court, that order stands.” The Court allowed Bassi to withdraw the petition and pursue his legal remedies before any other appropriate forum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-cold-shoulders-top-cbi-officer-for-defying-18-month-old-transfer-order/story-TaIR6raNNiquu88HOzE3YN.html

29-07-2020||India||With Rafales’ induction, IAF will have an edge over neighbours. Here’s how||Five Rafale fighter jets of the 36 ordered by the Indian Air Force (IAF) from France will land at their home base in Haryana’s Ambala on Wednesday.The new aircraft will significantly enhance the offensive capabilities of IAF, which has for long-planned to update its fighter jet force. Defence experts have said the induction of the controversial Rafale fighter jets will be a “game-changer” for India in regional politics of South Asia.France has expedited the deliveries of Rafale fighters to India and five jets are coming to Ambala instead of four that were originally planned to be delivered in the first batch.Here’s how the Rafale fighter aircraft will add to IAF power:* Rafale, categorised as a 4.5 generation aircraft for its radar-evading stealth profile, is important for IAF since most of the aircraft in its fleet, including the Mirage 2000 and the Su-30 MkI, are classified as either third or fourth-generation fighters.* The Rafale is a twin-jet fighter aircraft able to operate from both an aircraft carrier and a shore base. The manufacturers describe it as a fully versatile aircraft which can carry out all combat aviation missions to achieve air superiority and air defence, in-depth strikes, reconnaissance, anti-ship strikes and nuclear deterrence.* The first Rafale combat aircraft manufactured for India bears the tail number RB-01, the initials of IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria. The IAF chief had played a crucial role in the signing of India’s biggest-ever defence deal worth about Rs 60,000 crore.* India had ordered 36 Rafale fighter jets from France in a deal worth about Rs 60,000 crore in September 2016. Out of the 36 Rafale aircraft, 30 will be fighter jets and six will be trainers. The trainer jets will be twin-seater and they will have almost all the features of the fighter jets.* The Rafale jets will be a crucial enhancement to India’s Medium Multi-role Combat Aircraft fleet.* The Rafale fighter jets have been tailor-made for the Indian Air Force. India-specific enhancements include helmet-mounted sight, radar warning receivers, flight data recorders with enough storage for 10 hours of data, infrared search and track systems, jammers, cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases and towed decoys to lure incoming missiles away.* They will be the first imported fighter jet to be inducted into the IAF in 22 years after the Russian Sukhoi-30 fighters. The first Su-30 entered IAF service in June 1997.* The Rafales will be a part of the IAF’s No 17 Squadron, which is also known as the “Golden Arrows”. The first squadron of the aircraft will be stationed at Ambala air force station, considered one of the most strategically located bases of the IAF. The second squadron of Rafale will be stationed at Hasimara base in West Bengal. * The IAF spent around Rs 400 crore to develop infrastructure like shelters, hangars and maintenance facilities at the two bases.* India will be the fourth country, after France, Egypt and Qatar, to fly the Rafale.* The Rafale fighter jet, however, cannot be compared with the J-20, an indigenously developed fifth-generation aircraft of China. The J-20 is soon set to be inducted in large numbers into the People’s Liberation Army Air Force of China after it was successfully developed and displayed.* The 2016 Rafale deal was an emergency purchase to arrest the worrying slide in the IAF’s combat capabilities. The count of the IAF’s fighter squadrons had been reduced to 31 compared to an optimum strength of 42-plus units required to fight a two-front war with China and Pakistan.* The first 18 jets, including the four in the first batch, were to be delivered to the IAF by February 2021, with the rest expected by April-May 2022, according to the original delivery schedule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-rafales-induction-iaf-will-have-an-edge-over-neighbours-here-s-how/story-DmZfI3d2MAV6wwQuzoxfjN.html

India also announced the implementation of nine “high impact community development projects” (HICDP) in the Maldives on Tuesday. Indian envoy Sunjay Sudhir handed over a symbolic cheque to mark the implementation of projects worth $5.6 million during a ceremony at the foreign ministry in Male, which was attended by foreign minister Abdulla Shahid and members of Parliament. New Delhi has taken several steps in recent days to revive economic activity amid the Covid-19 crisis and to shore up relations with key neighbours amid the border standoff with China. On Monday, India handed over 10 railway locomotives to Bangladesh. Over the weekend, India announced a $400-million currency swap facility under the SAARC framework for Sri Lanka. Another $400 million was provided through an extended currency swap arrangement to the Maldives and India will soon “announce another substantial financial assistance package” to help post-Covid-19 economic recovery. The inauguration of the new Supreme Court building in Port Louis will be done via video conference in the presence of senior members of the judiciary of Mauritius and other dignitaries. The building was completed within schedule and below the expected cost, the external affairs ministry said in a statement. The building, spread over more than 4700 sq m with 10 floors and a built-up area of 25,000 sq m, has green features and high energy efficiency. It will house all divisions and offices of the Supreme Court. In October 2019, Modi and Jugnauth inaugurated the first phase of the Metro Express project and a new 100-bed ENT hospital in Mauritius, also built under the special economic package. Construction of 12 km of the metro line was completed till last September, and work on a 14-km line in the second phase is underway. “The successful and timely completion of India-assisted high quality infrastructure projects in Mauritius shall also create greater opportunities for Indian companies in Mauritius and in the region,” the statement said. India and the Maldives signed a MoU on HICDPs during the visit of late former external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj in March 2019. A grant of $5.6 million was announced for these projects and there was another cash grant of $7 million for small projects. These projects, chosen by the Maldives, are meant to have a high level of community impact and participation in areas such as income generation, healthcare, education and sustainable development. The HICDPs include three fish processing plants in Addu city, the Addu Tourism Zone and a bottled water plant in Hoarafushi, which are being steered by local authorities. Contracts for building the fish processing plants were awarded on July 22 and contracts for five eco-tourism projects are expected to be awarded soon. Sudhir said India’s strategy for development cooperation with the Maldives includes big projects under a $800-million line of credit and a large number of smaller grant projects. He noted these projects are transparent and demand-driven, with full ownership for the Maldives government. Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said the standoff with China had clearly triggered a policy reappraisal by South Block. “India remains committed to its ‘neighbourhood first’ policy, which has led to many successes. South Asia is of immense importance to India’s national interests and it has to keep pursuing these goals,” he said. “Recent developments pertaining to Iran and Nepal underline the need to pursue the ‘neighbourhood first’ policy with greater commitment and perhaps greater generosity. We can expect more such initiatives, perhaps even for Myanmar,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-mauritius-pm-to-inaugurate-port-louis-sc-built-with-indian-aid/story-umE40MdQKDTLtccAQAiVuJ.html

People have been asked not to go to their terraces for taking videos or photographs of the aircraft.The violators will face an immediate arrest and an FIR against them, the police said. Section 144 of the Indian Penal Code, which prohibits congregation of four or more people in an area, has been imposed near the Ambala Air Force Station in Haryana and in adjoining areas like Dhulkot, Baldev Nagar, Garnala and Panjkhora.The jets took off from France on Monday and will arrive at the Ambala Air Force station after covering a distance of 7,000 kilometres with air-to-air refuelling and a single stop in the United Arab Emirates. The fleet comprises three single-seater and two twin-seater aircraft, an IAF official said. Also read: With Rafales’ induction, IAF will have an edge over neighbours. Here’s howAir Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria would be visiting Ambala to receive the Rafale combat aircraft. The planes are expected to take off from Al Dhafra in UAE at around 11 am IST and reach Ambala by 2 pm, news agency ANI reported citing sources. A team of pilots led by Group Captain Harkirat Singh would meet the Air Chief and brief him about their flying and training in France after which the formal induction ceremony of the aircraft would take place. The agreement for the biggest-ever defence deal by India was signed in 2016 for acquiring 36 Rafale jets for over Rs 60,000 crore.

29-07-2020||India||BJP workers told to scale up Covid relief, efforts on flood in Bihar||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has asked its functionaries in poll-bound Bihar to redouble efforts to offer relief to Covid-19 and flood-hit people as the party has begun preparations for the assembly elections in the country’s third most populous state, people aware of the matter said.The elections are crucial for the BJP, which is in alliance with the Janata Dal United (JDU) in Bihar, since it lost power in Maharashtra and Jharkhand last year. They are due later this year as the state needs to have a new assembly in place before November 26.The elections in the flood-hit state would be the first since the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted lives and triggered an exodus of migrant workers to their home states including Bihar.The BJP has also carried out a survey among the migrant workforce forced to return to the state after the lockdown imposed to check the pandemic left them jobless. The survey assessed the response to the aid offered by the state government. “Between July 1 and 10, a survey was conducted across districts to find out the response of the workers and there were no complaints,” said a person aware of the details.The BJP lost the last assembly elections in the state when JDU formed the government with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Congress. JDU returned to BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA)’s fold in Bihar in 2017.The BJP suffered electoral setbacks after retaining power at the Centre with a bigger majority in 2019. It was unable to form the government in Maharashtra despite emerging as the single largest party following disagreements with its oldest ally, Shiv Sena, over power-sharing. In Haryana too, it could form the government only after Jannayak Janata Party’s support. The BJP was voted out of power in Jharkhand in December 2019.At a recent meeting between state BJP and national leadership, the issue of reaching out to people with aid was underlined, said the people. Leaders of both the BJP and JDU maintain their response to the pandemic has been adequate even as it has had a severe impact on the economy and jobs. They insist it will not have any adverse impact on the electoral outcome.But the BJP is looking at ways to mitigate public anger. In recent weeks, there has been a spurt in the number of Covid-19 cases in the state. On Sunday, the state’s count stood at 234 deaths and 36,604 active cases. Floods have also hit tens of thousands of people.“There were some complaints of medical negligence in some hospitals, but the government has stepped up efforts. State unit president Sanjay Jaiswal, who was himself infected with the virus recently, took the lead and went for inspections to hospitals to ensure proper treatment for all,” said the person quoted above.A second functionary said BJP chief JP Nadda interacted with the state unit functionaries this week and instructed them to scale up relief measures and ensure people in the flood-affected area are not left without food, shelter, and medical care. “Since the outbreak of the pandemic, we were distributing food parcels and other essentials but with the flooding now in several areas of the state, we will scale up our efforts,” said the functionary, requesting anonymity.Jaiswal rejected allegations that the state’s medical infrastructure is crumbling. “We have ensured that there are medical supplies such as oxygen concentrators and other equipment at all hospitals at the sub-division level. This has also helped ease the burden on AIIMS [All India Institute of Medical Sciences] and a few other hospitals. Medical colleges have also been equipped to handle the patient load and monitoring of the situation is being done on a real-time basis,” he said.Opposition RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has attacked the BJP and JDU for being preoccupied with poll preparations. He has said chief minister Nitish Kumar is wary of the President’s Rule if elections are not held as per schedule.BJP spokesman Shahnawaz Hussain rejected the opposition’s criticism as baseless and added the party or the government have no role in deciding the election schedule.Milind Awad, a professor at New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University, said the Bihar poll will be focused on Prime Minister Narendra Modi rather than NDA or Nitish Kumar. “It is important to understand that it is for the first time when most of the Bihari working class is home due to pandemic... [under] this situation, failure in handling workers crisis may have a negative impact on the NDA alliance. Also, it is important to understand the dominant agrarian castes sentiment about [RJD leader] Lalu Prasad Yadav; he is in jail. This fact may create insecurity and agony among OBC [other backward class] and most of the lower caste, which may... damage NDA.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-workers-told-to-scale-up-covid-relief-efforts-on-flood-in-bihar/story-J3dn2opWqU6CGtOIP3Z8gJ.html

The video clip of the woman crying and asking for help has gone viral on social media eliciting tremendous support for her. The woman introduces herself as Sakshi Sharma in the video and alleges that “local goons” have been threatening her. “They abuse me in an intoxicated state and also attack my dogs, who are like my children. I take care of about 40 street dogs on my own expenses,” she is heard saying in the video. “These goons take drugs near my house and terrorise me. They even killed some of my dogs. I lodged a complaint with Tilak Nagar police station but the police are not ready to take action against them,” she says.Dinesh Verma, Tilak Nagar police station in-charge, said the woman’s real name is Samreen Bano and not Sakshi Sharma. “In March, she had lodged an FIR against a 70-year-old herder when some dogs attacked her goat and later the herder hit the dogs with a stick. She alleged the herder had attacked her too and broken her mobile phone,” Verma said.“Later, she lodged another FIR against some local residents accusing them of drinking liquor in the open. We are investigating the matter. After she posted the video recently a police team approached her to know about her complaint. Then she said she was talking about the old complaints,” he added. Harinarayan Chari Mishra, the deputy inspector general (DIG) of police (Indore range) said they are looking into her complaints.“During the inquiry, it has come to be known that she used to live earlier on Aerodrum Road in Indore calling herself as Samreen Bano, where she fought with many people. An FIR was lodged against her by local people,” Mishra said.“We also found that she lived in Hyderabad and Delhi too with different names. She is also facing some criminal cases too in the two cities. Prima facie, she looks like a habitual offender. We are probing why she keeps changing her name,” he said. The woman has refuted all charges by the police. “A political leader, who is a woman and runs a social organisation, is after me. At her instance police are harassing me by calling me mentally unstable and criminal and not taking action against the goons who are harassing me,” she said.“That’s why I posted the video on social media for help. But the video has offended the police and they have started maligning my image. I changed my religion and that’s why I have two names,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indore-dog-rescuer-seeks-protection-on-video-police-say-her-credentials-are-dubious/story-dFwWEHjgrMZWqTPZ0nKN4I.html
29-07-2020||India||Flood situation remains grim in Assam and Bihar||Utpal Parashar/ Subhash PathakThe flood situation in Assam improved marginally on Tuesday with rainfall easing even as it threatened to worsen in Bihar with many rivers continuing to flow about the danger level. According to a bulletin by Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), the number of districts affected by floods dropped from 28 two weeks ago to 21. There has also been a significant drop in the number of people affected by floods in the state; the number, which had risen to 40 lakh ten days ago, is down to nearly 20 lakh people now. Meanwhile, one more death due to drowning was reported during the day, taking the season’s tally to 104. Over 42,000 people displaced by floods are taking shelter in 236 relief camps in 16 of the affected districts. Nearly 1 lakh hectare crop area continues to be inundated, said the ASDMA bulletin. Also read: With more rain forecast, Bihar’s flood situation set to worsenAccording to a bulletin by Central Water Commission (CWC), Brahmaputra, Dhansiri, Jia Bharali and Kopili rivers continued to flow above the danger level at several places. The flood situation in Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR) has also eased a bit with the submerged area coming down to nearly 75% of the park -- till a few days ago, 90% area of the park was submerged. A total of 137 park animals, including 14 rhinos, have died this season while 163 of them have been rescued, said a bulletin issued by the park.“Rainfall has eased in the past few days and flood waters are drying in most places. The situation is likely to improve further in the next few days as there is no prediction of heavy rainfall,” said Pankaj Chakraborty, state project coordinator, ASDMA.Bihar’s Darbhanga has been ravaged by Khiro and Bagmati rivers for the past week in the wake of rains in the foothills of the Himalayas in Nepal and a swollen Adhwara set a new highest flood level (HFL) of 48.5 metre after 35 years. The water resources department (WRD) has alerted the officials of Kishanganj, Purnia and Katihar districts after the river Mahananda witnessed an upsurge of almost two metres at Taiyabpur in Kishangan on Tuesday forenoon. “The spurt in water level of Mahananda was attributed to heavy rains in Nepal,” said WRD secretary Sanjiv Hans. Burhi Gandak has already flooded parts of Muzaffarpur, Khagaria and Samastipur and Kosi is also flowing above the danger mark. Flood situation in North Bihar region may deteriorate further as the meteorological department has forecast moderate to heavy rains in Nepal and the catchment areas of different rivers. The state has received 706.4 mm rain against normal rain of 484.6 mm between June 1 and July 28 which is 46% above the normal. Darbhanga has received 127 % surplus rain followed by east Champaran with 103% during the same time period. Meanwhile, floodwaters from Gandak, which had breached its embankment at three places in East Champaran and Gopalganj, have entered fresh areas.The disaster management department claimed that about 29.62 lakh people have been affected by the floods in 837 panchayats of 101 blocks of 12 districts across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flood-situation-remains-grim-in-assam-and-bihar/story-NPeYp49CfxSHmGhqjfw3FK.html
29-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||When we do not know the answer to something we look to Google, so much so that the proper noun has become a verb (actually, it became one officially in 2006 when the Oxford English Dictionary included it).All of us, individuals, organisations, even administrations, should do that (look to Google) now — when planning for our uncertain short-term (the next one year) future.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAfter all, a vaccine won’t be available before the end of the year, and chances are the first vaccines will either not be very effective, or will require multiple booster shots. It is also clear that not everyone is going to get the vaccine immediately. And Google, perhaps aware of all of this (it should be; all the information is available on, er, Google) has decided that its 200,000 employees are not going to return to office before July 2021. This applies to those who work for Google around the world — at its head office in Mountain View, California, but also in countries such the US, UK, India, and Brazil, The Wall Street Journal, which broke the story, reported. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google and its holding company Alphabet, subsequently sent out a message to employees on the decision. “I hope this will offer the flexibility you need to balance work with taking care of yourselves and your loved ones over the next 12 months,” WSJ reported him as saying in his message.I am not suggesting that everyone and every company move to WFH (work from home). My views on that are known to regular readers of this column — it is a luxury (a sub-optimal one) that takes away more than it gives, although in the current context, the scales are tilted strongly in terms of the latter. Commuting by public transport — many of the journalists in the HT newsroom in Delhi, for instance, prefer the Metro, just like many of them in Mumbai depend on the suburban rail network; most of them are working from home currently — is unsafe. As are air-conditioning systems that do not have the right kind of filters or recommended air-circulation cycles. And the social act of sharing the workspace may well be life-threatening.The big takeaway for me from Google and Pichai’s decision is that it is actually more about stability than flexibility — and a gentle reminder to actually plan for the next year. We have all unconsciously moved to two default planning cycles during the pandemic: the now, and the when-this-is-over. The first helps us survive, get by; the second helps us put things off (and which of us doesn’t like to?). This, despite most of us being aware that the crisis isn’t going to pass anytime soon, perhaps not till a vaccine is discovered and most people have been administered it. And so, to repeat myself, all of us should plan for the next year.Also read: Working from home? Here are some tips to keep the lockdown pounds offAt one level, for instance, Google’s decision makes it clear to employees that they will not be returning to office for the next year (at the least). So, for the next 12 months, they can plan around the certainty that they will be working from home. That’s a big certainty at a time when nothing is really certain. WSJ reports that Pichai’s decision was made, in part, by “sympathy for employees with families to plan for uncertain school years” and by the desire to make it easier for employees to decide where they are going to live for the next year.It’s probably time for companies in India to also start thinking along these lines — provided they are in businesses that are conducive to remote working, however sub-optimal it may be (at least in the current context, safety is more important than efficiency). And it is definitely time for individuals whose plans for 2020 (and longer) were disrupted by the coronavirus disease to pick up the threads and move on and move ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-1jETlwFbDWMMyoKObwg2OL.html
29-07-2020||India||Maharashtra raises claim of ₹15,178 crore for lockdown losses||Although the last instalment of ₹1,644.16 crore towards the GST compensation for the losses in 2019-20 was released by the Centre to Maharashtra on Monday, the compensation of ₹15, 178 crore for the losses in April and May is still pending. The losses are expected to mount to ₹24,000 crore by the end of July. The Centre pays compensation to the state towards their losses in GST collection as part of the agreement between Centre and states when the regime was rolled out in July 2017. With the release of the last instalment accrued in February and March, the Maharashtra’s share in the compensation paid by the Centre in the last financial year touched ₹19,233.65 crore. Maharashtra tops the chart in GST compensation paid by the Centre in 2019-20, followed by Karnataka (which has received ₹18,628 crore) and Gujarat (₹14,801 crore). In the wake of Covid-19 lockdown, the state has sustained heavy losses in the new financial year. “Our targeted monthly collection from GST is ₹9,708 crore. In four months, till July 20, we have received ₹12,907 crore. The losses in GST collection are expected to mount to around ₹24,000 crore till July 31. We have raised the claim of ₹15,178 crore for April and May, as part of the process,” said an official from the finance department. Manoj Saunik, additional chief secretary, finance department, said, “What we have received from the Centre is the compensation meant for the previous financial year. The demand for compensation is raised every two months.” Another official from the state government said that as the Centre too was facing a drop in collection, the compensation instalments are released late. “The compensation is given to all states from a separate corpus generated from the taxes on six commodities, including tobacco, motor vehicles and toll taxes. As the corpus fund has dried up owing to the lockdown, the release of funds is delayed. As the claims in new financial year are high due to the lockdown, they are likely to take longer,” said the official. The state had criticised the Modi government for the delay in the release of GST compensation and share in the central tax. Leader of opposition in the legislative Assembly Devendra Fadnavis said on Tuesday the Centre has made special provision to pay the compensation to states. He said the leaders (from the state government) who were blaming the Modi government should now thank the Centre. The state has sustained a heavy drop in tax revenue collection from various sources, including GST, over the past four months. The accumulated losses between March and July are estimated to be ₹55,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-raises-claim-of-15-178-crore-for-lockdown-losses/story-8PzjQ97WIZ7PLISoJRL9VP.html
29-07-2020||India||Rajasthan impasse continues as Ashok Gehlot pushes for session||In a sign of the deepening rift between constitutional institutions in Rajasthan, the state government, in its third proposal to state governor Kalraj Mishra, has reiterated its demand to convene an assembly session from July 31 — but did not mention whether it will seek a trust vote in the house. The Ashok Gehlot-led cabinet, which met on Tuesday, also claimed that the governor did not have any locus stand in stipulating conditions to hold the session, asked him to abide by the proposal of the cabinet, claimed that the failure to do so would be unconstitutional, asserted that the agenda of the session will be determined by the business advisory committee of the house, and said that it was the Speaker’s domain to decide on social distancing norms in the assembly. Also read: ED summons Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot’s brother, asks him to appear within 24 hoursSeparately, the Congress accused the governor of acting under pressure of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), while leaders privately said they would wait for the governor’s response before determining their next step. The cabinet meeting followed Mishra’s response to an earlier request by Gehlot to convene the assembly session. The governor had suggested a 21-day notice period to convene the house; sought clarity on the agenda of the session and advised live-streaming of the floor test, if such a test was to be held; and asked about Covid-19 related precautions in the assembly.A senior official at the governor’s office, on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the government’s proposal has been received. The BJP has rejected the allegation and claimed that the entire crisis was purely a result of an internal clash within the Congress.The Rajasthan crisis has seen an open tussle between Gehlot, who claims to have a majority in the house, and his now-dismissed deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and a set of rebel Congress legislators, who allege that Gehlot’s government is in a minority. Gehlot, in recent days, has sought a quick assembly session based on the assessment that he has the numbers in the house, according to Congress strategists. In response to the governor’s queries, laying out the government’s position, state transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said, “He has no right to be raising queries. Yet we are giving a reply.”On the 21-day requirement — the first point mentioned by the governor — Khachariyawas said that 10 days had already passed since the government had asked for a session, and asked why the governor had not given a date himself. “The governor is the head of our family. Under Article 163 of the Constitution, it is clearly written that no governor of the country can reject the proposal by the cabinet.” Khachariyawas alleged that if the governor did not approve it, it would be a sign that there was “no Constitution”. The minister also asked what would happen if the central government sought to hold a session of Parliament and wrote to the President, who rejected the proposal. “The BJP is doing politics to weaken the Lok Sabha and state assembly.”A Congress functionary involved in political management in the state said that the Rajasthan government, in its reply, has also conveyed to the governor that the Supreme Court judgements Mishra had quoted in his letters restrict his role in convening the assembly sessions. “These judgements clearly state that he has to go by the aid and advice of the council of ministers and that he has no authority to set the agenda or decide the timing and the venue of the assembly sessions,” the functionary added. When asked about the agenda of the session — a point raised by the governor — Khachariyawas said that it was for the Business Advisory Committee of the assembly to decide the agenda. Regarding the social distancing norms in the assembly — the third point raised by the governor — the minister said that the speaker would decide the seating arrangements.Mahesh Menon who teaches law at Daksha Fellowship Programme said, “I do not subscribe to the view that the Governor can exercise his discretion when it comes to calling an assembly session. Even if the Governor can use his discretion, it should not be exercised whimsically.” The Congress, separately, also alleged that Mishra was acting “under pressure” from the BJP government at the Centre. Party general secretary in charge of Rajasthan, Avinash Pande, in a series of tweets, questioned the Governor for not calling the assembly session and said, “..In the context of the crisis in Rajasthan, the Governor of Rajasthan is adopting a biased approach to fulfil the interests of a particular party, which is violation of the rules mentioned in our Constitution.”BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said the post of governor is constitutional, and BJP does not interfere in the work of the constitutional bodies. Claiming that the entire political struggle was an internal fight of the Congress, he said that BJP‘s politics was based on serving people and asked if any party lost its government because of its infighting, how could the BJP be held responsible for it. The Congress functionary quoted above said that the party will decide on its next course of action only after receiving the governor’s response. “We will go step by step and wait for the governor’s reply to decide our future strategy. We don’t want to pre-empt things,” the functionary quoted above said. Asked if the party will take the matter to the courts, he said, “All options are open. We want to make it political fight first and the legal option is always there.” A second Congress leader said there were two opinions in the party on accepting the governor’s conditions for convening the assembly session. One section was of the view that the state government should insist on a short session and stick to the July 31 date, he said. “Some of our leaders say that the state cabinet should clearly mention that it wants a floor test immediately since it had not done so in its earlier communications. The state government will decide its future strategy after the governor responds to its fresh proposals,” the leader added. He said the second view was that the Congress should accept all the governor’s conditions, including giving the 21-day notice for calling the session, and not rush to the court to get the floor test done. The leader further said the Congress will fight the Rajasthan battle politically by taking to streets and keeping its flock (legislators) together.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-impasse-continues-as-ashok-gehlot-pushes-for-session/story-7kZ2XpDVjZvIvs28RYsL4I.html
29-07-2020||India||Reports about time capsule being placed underground at Ram temple site baseless: Champat Rai||Reports circulating in the media about a time capsule being placed beneath the site of the Ram temple, Ayodhya are baseless, said General Secretary, Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, Champat Rai on Tuesday.“All reports about placing of a time capsule under the ground at Ram Temple construction site on August 5 are false. Do not believe in any such rumour,” Rai said.His statement, however, comes after the trust president, Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, on Monday had said that it is true and it will be done. But, he also said that he does not have much information about the time capsule.“It is 100 per cent correct that a time capsule, enlisting the history and facts related to the Ram Janmabhoomi, will be placed thousands of feet below the construction site. It will be done in order to ensure that there are no disputes in the future. A grand Ram Temple will be built here and all arrangements are in place for Bhoomi Pujan,” he said.“I do not have much information about time capsule, but it will be placed below the construction site,” he added.This comes after Trust member Kameshwar Chaupal on Sunday said that a time capsule, enlisting the history and facts related to the Ram Janmabhoomi, will be placed thousands of feet below the construction site to ensure that there are no disputes in the future.Chaupal, who is the lone Dalit member of the Trust, also said that soil from various teerths (pilgrimages) across the country and water from the sacred rivers is being brought to Ayodhya for ‘Abhisheka’ during the ‘bhoomi-pujan’ which is scheduled to be conducted on August 5 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.PM Modi is scheduled to lay the foundation stone of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya on August 5, according to Mahant Nritya Gopal Das.The construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya will begin after the ceremony to lay the foundation stone (bhoomi poojan) in which chief ministers of many states, ministers from the union cabinet and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat are also likely to participate.According to sources, the ‘bhoomi poojan’ of the temple is to be celebrated on the lines of the festival of light -- Diwali -- with all temples and houses across the country to be lit up with diyas and candles.The Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust, set up in accordance with the Supreme Court verdict, held its second meeting last week.In March this year, the ‘Ram Lalla’ idol was shifted to a temporary structure.The SC on November 9 last year had directed the central government to hand over the site at Ayodhya for the construction of a Ram temple.

29-07-2020||India||Indian Navy deepens watch to check China ambitions||The Indian Navy has stepped up surveillance and activities in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), which, it believes, China will “inevitably” try to enter in its quest to become a global power, just as it has laid claim to large portions of the disputed South China Sea, according to a top officer aware of the developments.It is to deal with this scenario that India reached out to neighbours in IOR — Maldives, Mauritius, Seychelles and Madagascar, to prevent China from expanding its footprint in the region by creating more bases — and like-minded navies, such as those of the United States and Japan, over the last two months, he added.“It is inevitable that the Chinese People’s Liberation Army-Navy (PLAN) will come to IOR if China wants to become a global power. They are opening multiple routes to the Indian Ocean to overcome the Malacca Dilemma (China’s strategic weakness),” the officer said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The comments come at a time when there are heightened military tensions in eastern Ladakh — where Indian and Chinese forces are locked in a tense border confrontation and disengagement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) has turned out to be a challenging process — and China is militarising the South China Sea. Also read: How the cold will alter the India-China power equation next month in LadakhThe Malacca Dilemma refers to China’s apprehension of major naval powers controlling the Malacca Strait between Malaysia and Indonesia and interdicting vital supply lines. A significant volume (more than 80%) of China’s oil imports pass through the strait connecting the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. The multiple routes that China could be looking at to enter the Indian Ocean are further south of Malacca and include the Sunda, Lombok, Ombai and Wetar straits, said a second Indian Navy officer who asked not to be named.“It’s a reality that the PLAN will deploy in the Indian Ocean once its power crosses a certain threshold. Right now, it’s good enough for the South China Sea,” said Admiral Arun Prakash (retd), a former navy chief. India is keeping tabs on China’s aggressive moves in the South China Sea and taking steps to ensure that the Chinese navy doesn’t muscle its way into the Indian Ocean where combat-ready Indian warships are carrying out round-the-clock surveillance for any unusual activity, said the first officer. Over the last one month, the navy has conducted joint drills with a US Navy carrier strike group, led by USS Nimitz, and Indian and Japanese warships have carried out exercises in the Indian Ocean, against the backdrop of the India-China border standoff in Ladakh. The India-US exercise involving eight Indian and US warships took place a week ago at a time when tensions have mounted over China’s activities in South China Sea, where the US Navy recently conducted a major exercise that involved two carrier strike groups. From carrying out naval drills with like-minded countries to reaching out to states in the Indian Ocean region, the Indian Navy is focusing on checking China’s rising ambitions in the region and sending out a strong message that Beijing’s power play in South China Sea cannot be replicated in the Indian Ocean. “China is claiming almost 90% of the South China Sea. We don’t want that scenario unfolding in the Indian Ocean. We will not allow China to have it easy coming here,” said the second officer. China’s step-by-step inroads into “territorialising” the South China Sea find echoes in some parts of IOR, not by trumped up claims because that would be blatant neo-colonialism but with more sophistication, said naval affairs expert Rear Admiral Sudarshan Shrikhande (retd) “Its (China’s) diplomacy and economic influence when combined with port investments, logistics bases, all of which could be for dual-use and their sustained deployments in the IOR, are of serious concern,” Shrikhande said. The stage is also set for Australia to be part of the next Malabar naval exercise conducted by India with the US and Japan, as reported by Hindustan Times on July 17. The next edition of Malabar, already delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, is set to be held by the end of the year. China has also been wary of the Quadrilateral security dialogue, or Quad, that was revived in late 2017 by India, the US, Australia and Japan, and these suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level last year. “We are already operating with these navies. We don’t need time to put the Quad into effect if the government gives us the go-ahead… It’s not that we are aligning with the US. Our actions are guided by national interest and what you see unfolding is issue-based convergence of interests,” said the first officer. China began deploying troops to its first overseas naval base at Djibouti in the Horn of Africa in July 2017, in what some global experts said was the outcome of Beijing’s ‘debt-trap diplomacy’. Mounting debts have led countries such as Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Pakistan to give control of territories, which are of strategic significance, to China. The base in Djibouti has shored up China’s capabilities to sustain naval units in the Indian Ocean. “In recent months, with much of the world preoccupied with the Covid-19 pandemic, China has sharply escalated its coercive activities. In early April, a Chinese Coast Guard vessel sank a Vietnamese fishing boat close to islands claimed by both China and Vietnam. A Chinese marine survey vessel harassed a Malaysian oil exploration vessel off Borneo. This month, the [US] department of defense voiced concern about the Chinese navy’s decision to seal off an area around the Paracel Islands to conduct naval exercises. In response, the United States increased its own naval activities, including joint exercises by two aircraft carrier groups,” the New York Times said in an editorial on Monday.The Indian Navy has been on an operational alert in the Indian Ocean where scores of warships are ready for any task in the aftermath of the border row. It has positioned warships along critical sea lanes of communications and choke points and the vessels could be diverted for any mission. Indian warships are deployed from as far as the Persian Gulf to the Malacca Strait and northern Bay of Bengal to the southeast coast of Africa.While the Indian Navy is keeping a sharp eye on the Indian Ocean, it is also playing a key role in the Ladakh sector. The navy’s P-8I maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft, imported from the US, are being used for surveillance of the Ladakh sector and gathering intelligence on Chinese deployments across the contested LAC. The primary role of the P-8Is encompasses carrying out anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance of the oceans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navy-deepens-watch-to-check-china-ambitions/story-ZfnCd24w0qR4nRY8XzRyjM.html
29-07-2020||India||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 case tally reaches 391,440, toll is 14,165||Maharashtra on Tuesday recorded 7,717 new Covid-19 cases pushing the state’s tally to 391,440. The state could cross another grim landmark of 4 lakh cases on Wednesday, based on the current trend of the daily caseload increase. Mumbai reported its lowest tally in three months, with 700 new cases on Tuesday, which took the city’s tally to 110,882. For the second day in a row, the number of discharged/recovered patients in Maharashtra is more than the new cases reported. The state’s active case tally stood at 144,694, with 10,333 patients being discharged on Tuesday. So far, 232,277 people have recovered in the state. The active case count in Mumbai now stands at 19,990. Maharashtra also recorded 282 fatalities taking the toll to 14,165. Mumbai recorded 55 new fatalities, which pushed the toll to 6,187. Maharashtra, which has the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases and fatalities in the country, could become the state with the highest CFR, as the gap between CFR of Gujarat and Maharashtra – the top two states – is narrowing. As per the data of state Medical Education and Drugs Department (MEDD) released on Tuesday, CFR of the state is 3.62%, while Gujarat’s CFR is 4.13%. On June 28, Gujarat’s CFR was 5.83%, while Maharashtra’s was 4.57%. On May 28, CFR in Maharashtra was 3.33%, while it was 6.17% in its bordering state. Till July 27, Gujarat has reported 2,348 fatalities and 56,874 cases. State health minister Rajesh Tope dismissed the comparison and said the Maharashtra government has been transparent in its data and dealing. “Gujarat must not be testing aggressively and therefore the numbers are low there. The Maharashtra government has always been transparent in its data. We have equipped districts with infrastructure, including ventilators, anti-viral drugs, and guidance from the task force, to bring down the fatality rate,” he said. The silver lining, according to state officials, is the CFR in Maharashtra is dropping. A health department official said the two states should not be compared as the protocol and processes followed in the two states would be different. The official, requesting anonymity, said, “There is a task force in each district and a uniform treatment protocol has been prepared. There are a few districts and semi-rural areas which have a higher death rate. For instance, Solapur city has a CFR of nearly 8%. It has reduced than a few days ago. Timely detection and hospitalisation is the key, which has been drilled into districts and city administration. Besides, coordination between the state task force and the district task force has been increased.” Tope said they are looking at measures to reduce fatalities. “The task at hand is to reduce CFR in the state. The chief minister also earlier has given his directions on the matter. We have given funds to the district administration to procure the anti-viral drugs, remdesivir and tocilizumab, based on their requirement. The companies will provide adequate stock and delivery,” Tope said. An official from the MEDD said, “On an average, a patient is hospitalised after five to six days of developing symptoms. This ratio needs to come down so that doctors get enough time to treat the patient.” As per latest MEDD data, 70% of the deaths that occurred are of people with co-morbidities, while the remaining 30% of victims did not have any co-morbidities. Meanwhile, the contribution of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, excluding Mumbai, to the daily caseload in the state reduced to 19.73% on Tuesday. MMR contributed to 40% of the total cases in June and during the first week of July. The lockdown in most of the municipal corporation areas in the MMR is showing results, officials said. The stabilising of figures from MMR would have a bearing on the restrictions for Mumbai as a lot of floating population comes from the adjoining areas of Mumbai. Thane city recorded 191 new cases, while Thane district that comprises of rural areas recorded 147 new cases on Tuesday. Kalyan-Dombvli saw 219 new cases, while Navi Mumbai recorded 335 new cases. Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad recorded 1,182 and 673 cases, respectively. Pune city recorded 23 fatalities taking the city’s tally to 1,318. Aurangabad city recorded 576 new Covid-19 taking the city’s tally to 9,635. Jalgaon district recorded 312 new infections, while Pune district recorded 340 new infections. In the past 24 hours, Maharashtra conducted 43,160 tests and recorded 7,717 cases. The overall positivity rate in Maharashtra stood at 19.88%, with 19,68,559 samples so far. Currently, 885,545 people are in home quarantine and 42,733 people are in institutional quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-s-covid-19-case-tally-reaches-391-440-toll-is-14-165/story-Cqnbw4pj2XjjisOFSwCflI.html
29-07-2020||India||Bhagirathi expert panel didn’t agree on zonal plan, reveal documents||Expert members of a National Green Tribunal (NGT) committee constituted to prepare the Bhagirathi eco-sensitive zone’s zonal master plan (ZMP) disagreed with its final draft finalised by the Uttarakhand government, citing concerns over issues such as cutting into the slopes for roads and change in land-use norms. The concerns have been highlighted in the annexures to ZMP published on the Union environment ministry’s website. A separate scrutiny committee constituted by the Union water resources ministry following a 2018 Supreme Court order also did not approve ZMP, the committee members noted.The eco-sensitive zone stretches from Gaumukh to Uttarkashi and covers an area of 4179.56 sq km across 88 villages.Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar on July 17 said his ministry has approved ZMP, which will help expedite the Chaar Dhaam road project for four pilgrimage sites in Uttarakhand.ZMP allows for land-use change for civic amenities and other infrastructure development in “larger public interest and national security” paving the way for the road project.In a statement on July 17, the environment ministry said ZMP emphasises governance in the areas of forest and wildlife, watershed management, irrigation, energy, tourism, public health and sanitation, road infrastructure, etc. It added ZMP’s approval will boost conservation, the ecology of the area, and permitted developmental activities.Activists and experts have said the approval of ZMP could make the entire Bhagirathi region vulnerable to natural disasters.Professor Vinod Tare, an Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur professor who has been member of both committees, said no meeting was ever called of the NGT panel members. “We were asked to give our comments over email. When meetings were called, they were with Uttarakhand government officials, who were focused on presenting government schemes and projects. So, it is obvious that our comments have not been incorporated.”NGT constituted the committee in 2017 following activist Keshar Singh Panwar’s petition against a ZMP drafted for the eco-sensitive zone in 2016 because it was lax on protecting the region. The panel included geologists, engineers, hydrologists, and environmental experts, who were asked to prepare a fresh ZMP.As per the minutes of the NGT committee meetings, the members highlighted slope cutting as inappropriate as this could trigger landslides, soil erosion, and generate debris. They also cited a lack of clarity on initiatives like “Winter Chaar Dham” for winter tourism and noted road widening could lead to loss of deodar trees and a lack of livelihood opportunities for the local people.Ravi Chopra, an NGT committee member, in his submission on June 11, 2018, called the final ZMP draft a missed opportunity. “…the final draft thus deviates substantially from the letter and spirit of the guidelines given in the December 2012 Bhagirathi eco-sensitive zone Gazette Notification (and amended in April 2018). It remains largely faithful to the rejected ZMP of October 2016. Based on the foregoing, it is not possible to accept the draft ZMP...”In 2018, Tare wrote to the Uttarakhand government, saying the most important suggestions could not be seriously considered. “…much of the committee time was used for the presentation of material prepared by various departments… I once again request that a meeting of only committee members be arranged and the present version of ZMP be reviewed and modified. Otherwise, it is not in order to state that the ZMP is endorsed by the committee,” Tare wrote, as per the annexures.“A final view on the draft ZMP was taken by the Uttarakhand government after seeking comments of the NGT committee. It was only then that the ZMP was forwarded to MoEFCC for approval,” said Arvind Singh Hyanki, who as secretary forests, Uttarakhand, sent the draft ZMP to the Union environment ministry for its approval in September 2018. Hyanki is presently Kumaon’s commissioner.Panwar moved the Supreme Court in 2017 asking that the NGT committee be changed because it is headed by the additional chief secretary, Uttarakhand, who has been involved in granting clearances to hydroelectric projects. Responding to the appeal, the court in July 2018 directed the Union water resources ministry to get the ZMP scrutinised by an 11-member independent committee before approving it.But there is no mention of the water resources ministry’s committee in the ZMP approved by the environment ministry. “We had shared the draft ZMP with all 11 expert members and received their comments on email. The summary of these comments [is] with the environment ministry but I am not sure if they have been incorporated. We did not participate in the meeting where the ZMP was approved,” said U P Singh, secretary, water resources.RP Singh, secretary, environment ministry, said the water ministry’s comments were also considered while approving ZMP.“The water ministry had mailed me ZMP and sought my comments. ZMP is a very good idea. It should be implemented for the entire Himalayas not just Bhagirathi. I sent the water ministry a number of comments on issues I had noticed because the zone is geologically very sensitive. But I was never communicated what happened to those comments, and how they are being used,” said Navin Juyal, a geologist at CSIR’s National Physical Laboratory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhagirathi-expert-panel-didn-t-agree-on-zonal-plan-reveal-documents/story-VHirqpdrlshdJqJfMoHw0N.html
29-07-2020||India||ED summons Gehlot’s brother||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) issued summons to Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s brother Agrasain Gehlot to appear at its headquarters in Delhi on Wednesday in connection with its probe into alleged money laundering in the export of fertilizers meant for Indian farmers, officials familiar with the development said on Tuesday. According to an official who asked not to be named, the agency is required to question Agrasain Gehlot since he, through his company, played a key role in the alleged violations. The official did not give details of what the allegations were about. ED’s probe is based on an investigation carried out by the customs department and the Directorate of Revenue and Intelligence (DRI) in 2009 in the export of Muriate of Potash or MOP, which is a restricted commodity for export under the foreign trade policy. According to the probe, it is suspected that Gehlot’s company diverted about 35,000 metric tonnes of MOP valued at Rs 130 crore in international market. The anti-money laundering probe agency had, on July 22, conducted raids at his premises apart from several companies and individuals in Rajasthan, Delhi and West Bengal. A Customs’ department investigation report, reviewed by HT, alleges that Agrasain Gehlot’s company – M/s Anupam Krishi –played a key role in the export of MOP to companies in Malaysia and Singapore. It added that Agrasain Gehlot “knowingly opted to become a part of the syndicate in the entire chain of conspiracy by facilitating the said consortium (of private companies) by supplying subsidized MOP, which was meant for sale to farmers only and forged documents for which he admittedly gained certain amount as his commission”. The Congress had, on July 22, termed the ED action against Ashok Gehlot’s brother a “raid raj” created by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership in Delhi. The party added that the Centre was using federal agencies to arm-twist lawmakers to bring down the Ashok Gehlot government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-summons-gehlot-s-brother/story-lpzBgFIyFpqBOwbvUpuJBI.html
29-07-2020||India||Elgar Parishad case: NIA arrests DU professor Hany Babu||New Delhi: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday arrested Delhi University professor Hany Babu Musaliyarveettil Tharayil in connection with the Elgar Parishad case, in which 11 other activists and intellectuals are accused of conspiring with Maoists to foment violence in Maharashtra’s Bhima Koregaon village two years ago. Two NIA officials, who didn’t wish to be named, said Babu, a 54-year-old associate professor of English, was arrested in Mumbai after four consecutive days of questioning. One of the officers said he was suspected to have close links with Maoist leaders and co-conspirators in the case -- including activist Gautam Navlakha, scholar Anand Teltumbde and poet-activist Varavara Rao -- and that the agency had irrefutable evidence in the matter. The NIA spokesperson said investigation revealed that senior leaders of CPI (Maoist), an organisation banned under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, were in contact with the organizers of Elgar Parishad -- an event held in Pune on December 31, 2017 and attended by hundreds of activists -- and Babu to “spread the ideology of Maoism“ and encourage “unlawful activities”. Babu will be produced before NIA special court in Mumbai on Wednesday. Investigators say that speeches made at the Elgar Parishad event, which was allegedly funded by Maoists, aggravated caste clashes that broke out near Bhima Koregaon village on January 1, 2018 during the bicentennial celebration of a British-era war commemorated by Dalits. One person died in the clashes that also sparked widespread protests by Dalit groups that shut down Maharashtra later that month. Pune (city) police have filed two charge sheets, the first in November 2018 against several activists for their alleged Maoist links and a supplementary charge sheet in February last year. Apart from Rao, Navlakha, Babu and Teltumbde, those accused of helping Maoists include activist Sudha Bhardwaj, activist Arun Ferriera, lawyers Vernon Gonsalves and Surendra Gadling, activist Rona Wilson, former professor Shoma Sen, social entrepreneur Mahesh Raut and activist Sudhir Dhavale. Maoist leaders including Ganpathy, Kishan Da alias Prashant Bose and Prakash alias Rituparn Goswami are also named as accused in the charge sheets. On September 11 last year, Babu’s house in Noida was searched by Pune Police and material recovered from his laptop, phone and hard drives was shared with NIA when the latter took over the case in January this year. Babu’s Jenny Rowena, a professor at Miranda House college in Delhi, said she intended to approach the courts against the arrest. She said Babu was summoned by NIA earlier this month. “He wrote to the agency asking for an extension since he would not be able to travel during a pandemic. The extension was granted for one week and he went to Mumbai on July 24,” she said. Rowena added that the investigating agency was “just talking to him and asking questions” before his arrest on Monday. “They said that they have found a folder on his computer which has incriminating material against him. Other than that, they don’t have anything. These are letters written by some other people saying he is a Naxal leader etc. Why would somebody keep such a folder on his own laptop? These were not his documents but were shown as his. He said that he didn’t know about the documents and had nothing to do with him,” she said. Delhi University refused to officially comment. “University cannot interfere because this is a matter of national security and it is being investigated by the NIA,” said a senior DU official on condition of anonymity. A second official added, “Since we have not received any official information on this matter, we cannot comment on it for now.”DU teachers’ association president Rajib Ray, said, “We have known him as a fantastic teacher. He has been a great voice for the oppressed and he should not be harassed like this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elgar-parishad-case-nia-arrests-du-professor-hany-babu/story-OoNmpP7x6LiCinioZbi8dK.html
29-07-2020||India||Will move HC over defection of 6 BSP MLAs to Congress, says Mayawati||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Tuesday hit out at Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot for the defection of her party’s six lawmakers in the state to the ruling Congress in 2019, saying they could have moved court against it earlier but were looking for the “right time” to teach them a lesson.In a statement, she called the merger of the six with Congress unconstitutional” as BSP announced it will move the Rajasthan high court against it. Mayawati said BSP supported the Congress to keep “communal forces” at bay after the 2018 assembly elections.BSP’s Rajasthan chief, Bhagwan Singh Baba, called the merger unconstitutional. “We are preparing a petition and will file it soon,” said Baba.The announcement came on the day Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker Madan Dilawar filed two petitions in the high court seeking the disqualification of the six. The petitions were filed a day after speaker C P Joshi upheld the merger and the high court dismissed Dilawar plea that questioned it.“Joshi dismissed our plea without hearing our line of argument. This prompted us to move the high court against the speaker’s decision. We have prayed before the court to disqualify the six BSP MLAs and pass an order that upholds justice and equality,” said Ashish Sharma, Dilawar’s lawyer.The six are crucial to Gehlot, who commands a narrow majority in the 200-member assembly. He has the support of 101 legislators, excluding the speaker, amid the crisis he faces with the rebellion former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot has 18 other Congress members. The BJP and has 72 members while another lawmaker, Bhanwarlal Meghal, is indisposed and considered close to Pilot. Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said Mayawati was taking these steps due to “certain compulsions”. “If some leaders become helpless, they also tend to leave their ideology and also change their old stance. But nobody takes these helpless leaders seriously rather no one should,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-move-hc-over-defection-of-6-bsp-mlas-to-congress-says-mayawati/story-JFTZaTAZHcYLi3dciifO1M.html

Everest last year has now started a 10-year mountaineering project for women from across the country who do not get a platform to showcase their mountaineering skills. Sheetal Raj, who scaled Mt. Everest last year to become the youngest in the state to achieve the feat, said that after achieving her goal, she wanted to do something to bring more women in the field of mountaineering which is mostly a male dominated field. “After I had scaled Mt. Everest, my only wish was to see more women to come into this field. Many women have the potential to reach great heights but do not get a platform where they can be given training or the financial support. With this project, I aspire to train girls and women in mountaineering and help them go for expeditions in future,” said Raj. For the first year of training, around 30 women have been selected who have been trained in Darma Valley in Pithoragarh district at a height of 3000m under an organisation named ‘Climbing Beyond the Summit’ (CBTS). Raj and her coach Yogesh Garbiyal founded this organisation to promote mountaineering among women. She said that first these women are being given basic training and then they will be enrolled with Nehru Institute of Mountaineering for certification course before the final expedition. Girls and women from the age group 13-40 have been selected for the first expedition. Garbiyal, co-founder of CBTS said that the project not just aims to bring women into the field of mountaineering but also give exposure to women from local areas and train them with basic mountaineering skills which they can use to become trek and tour guides. “There are many places in the remote areas of Uttarakhand which have potential for tourism but not many people know about them. We are taking these women for training in the three valleys, Darma, Vyans and Chaudans. The women can use the exposure learnt from these training sessions to connect it to livelihood opportunities in tourism sector,” said Garbiyal. He further said that women selected from other areas like Mumbai and Pune have been selected from their online platform and those with basic certification in mountaineering were selected so that they can get a platform “to further polish their skills and join the expedition in future.” The selected women were supposed to go on their first expedition in September this year, but due to Covid-19 epidemic they have postponed it by a year and plan to take the women on expedition next year with better practice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-s-youngest-girl-to-scale-mt-everest-now-starts-10-year-mountaineering-project-for-women-from-across-country/story-ldyKGMS5ODtjKvbruA5lIJ.html
29-07-2020||India||Support, sympathy for Sachin Pilot waning within the Congress||Sympathy for former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot within the Congress appears to be waning as he continues to lead the rebellion against chief minister Ashok Gehlot. Soon after Pilot rushed to Delhi along with 18 other legislators on July 11, a host of Congress leaders, including Kapil Sibal and Vivek Tankha, expressed concern over the developments in the grand old party. “Worried for our party. Will we wake up only after the horses have bolted from our stables?” Sibal tweeted on July 12. His views were echoed by Tankha. “Kapil ji your worry is every party member’s concern. It’s time to strengthen the party to fight forces, who have only 1 agenda -- weaken Congress and our democratic values and institutions,” he responded on Twitter. The sympathy factor increased after Pilot was removed as Rajasthan’s deputy chief minister and the state Congress chief for twice skipping the legislature party meetings in Jaipur with several party leaders calling it unfortunate and sad. Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, senior spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi, former union minister Salman Khurshid, Shashi Tharoor Jitin Prasada and Priya Dutt, all hoped that the situation would be salvaged and that a reconciliation was possible. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra spoke to Pilot as did former union finance minister P Chidambaram who advised Pilot to seize the opportunity and meet the party leadership to discuss and resolve all the issues. Both Congress president Sonia Gandhi and former party chief Rahul Gandhi were also keen to see an immediate end to the impasse and deputed some senior leaders to hold discussions with Pilot. All that happened before July 14. Hours before the Rajasthan Congress Legislature Party (CLP) met on July 14 morning, the emissaries reached out to Pilot to resolve the crisis. Prasada and Dinesh Gundu Rao apparently told Pilot that if he did not want to attend the CLP meeting, he should at least address the media in Delhi and clarify that he was a “loyal solder” of the Congress and would not do anything to bring down the state government. But Pilot turned the offer and insisted on his demand for immediate removal of Gehlot as the chief minister. For his part, Gehlot also hardened his stance. The same day, Pilot was sacked as the deputy chief minister and the head of the state unit. On July 15, the speaker of the Rajasthan assembly sent a disqualification notice to Pilot and the 18 MLAs loyal to him. On July 16, Pilot and the dissident lawmakers challenged this notice in the Rajasthan High Court. Around the same time an audio tape surfaced, allegedly referring to a plot to overthrow the state government. All of this seem to have made it difficult for the Congress to attempt a reconciliation with Pilot. On July 20, much to the party central leadership’s discomfiture according to people familiar with the matter, Gehlot lashed out at Pilot, calling him useless and worthless. As the legal battle continued, Sibal, representing the Congress in it, seemed to suggest that Pilot was being over ambitious. “I want to know from my good friend, what is it you want now? You can’t be a chief minister with 20-25 people, in any case you can’t become chief minister. If there is any other grievance, let us know, at least tell the people of this country. What is this dissent that you are talking about, dissent about what? And if you are not happy with the way of functioning of a particular person, you should tell us, we will talk about it, and then why are you put up in another state, which does not belong to you or which you are not a member of the legislative assembly or why have you taken people there, whoever is supporting you?” he said while addressing a virtual press conference on July 24. “Is it just flexing muscles, what is it? You say, you don’t want to join BJP and we believe you. If that is the case and you are still a Congressman as you say then why don’t you attend Congress meetings and express your view, whatever you want to add or is it that you have already made up your mind and already have a deal with somebody on this. , I don’t know, but, at least you should make it open as I am asking these questions openly from you, nothing against you. As a person I am a little intrigued, and the party is a little intrigued at your acts,” he added. On Monday, Chidambaram questioned Pilot’s position and his silence. “I spoke to him many many days ago. I have not spoken to him in the last 10 days or so, he has not called me either. It seems to me that he is embracing the BJP. In fact, he should be the first to stand up and say, `Pplease call the assembly session and then we will know which party he belongs to and what he will do,” he said. He also questioned Pilot’s silence on calling the assembly session. “Mr Pilot has maintained that he belongs to the Congress party. He also maintains that Mr Gehlot has lost his majority. The BJP’s position is that it is not an occasion to call a session. Now, where is Mr Pilot’s stand? And why is Mr Pilot silent on calling a session? I think, the question should be put to Mr Pilot? It will be very useful to know what his answer is,” Chidambaram added. A Congress leader involved in attempts to manage the crisis said Rahul Gandhi was initially keen on doing whatever it took to retain Pilot but that this “sympathy too seems to be waning now.” While Pilot could not be reached for comments, his supporters said the Congress lawyers who represent Gehlot in courts will speak the chief minister’s tune. “One one hand, the Congress is saying doors are open for Pilot and on the other the chief minister hurls abuses on him and he is not even reprimanded. Isn’t this double speak?” a leader close to Pilot said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/support-sympathy-for-pilot-waning-within-the-congress/story-hP8ADRrgXXADPwn3XkbcPK.html
29-07-2020||India||Railways freight traffic improves amid economy revival hopes||The ministry of railways on Tuesday said its freight traffic on July 27 was marginally more than that on the same day last year and also doubled the speed of its freight trains “in spite of Covid-19 related challenges.”The national carrier increased the average speed of its freight trains on July 27 was 46.16 kmph which is more than double, the 22.52 kmph of July 27 last year. According to the ministry, average speed in July was 45 kmph compared to 23.2 last year. The speed may be because of a clearer network. The suspension of passenger trains since March 22 has led to decongestion of a bulk of the national transporter’s network. At present only 230 special passengers are plying while cargo and parcel trains have continued to operate through the lockdown and after it. “In the month of July the average speed of freight trains is 45.03 kmph which is around double as compare to last year for the same month (23.22 kmph). West Central Railway with the average speed of 54.23 kmph, Northeast Frontier Railway with the speed of 51 kmph, East Central Railway 50.24 kmph, East Cost Railway 41.78 kmph, South East Central Railway 42.83 kmph, South Eastern Railway 43.24 kmph and Western Railway with the speed of 44.4 kmph are the leading Railway Zones in the average speed of freight train in Indian Railways,” the ministry said.Despite the higher freight loading on July 27, overall loading of freight trains remains 18.18% less than last year. Frieght loading is a proxy for the economy. In general, as the economy revives and grows, the volume of freight increases. On July 27, a total 1039 rakes loaded with freight were ferried by Indian Railways, including 76 rakes of foodgrain, 67 rakes of fertilizer, 49 rakes of steel, 113 rakes of cement, 113 rakes of iron ore and 363 rakes of coal. “Railways has achieved record loading of foodgrains this fiscal which is 80%more than last year, and has also introduced time-tabled (scheduled) parcel services , 4541 services and transported 2.41 lakh tonnes cargo generating a revenue of Rs 86.88 crore (From March 22 till July 27),” railway board chairman VK Yadav said at a press conference on Tuesday.Food grain distributions during the lockdown had more than doubled with Indian Railways transporting 5.2 million tonnes of foodgrains in the month of April since the country went under a lockdown on March 25 to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease, Hindustan Times reported on April 27.In our country the problem has been the sharing of tracks between passenger and freight trains. Hence speed was lower. In the post Covid period, due to lower frequency of passenger trains, speed and hence frequency of freight trains may have increased. The most important thing to note is that with the commissioning of dedicated freight corridors in the next 2 years, this is going to be the new normal. The effort to on-board private players to run passenger trains has also been timed accordingly,” said Arindam Guha, Deloitte India’s partner. Railways has set an ambitious target of achieving 50% more freight loading in the current financial year as compared with FY 2019-2020, Yadav said.“These improvements in freight movements will be institutionalized and incorporated in the upcoming zero based time table. These steps will lead to significantly higher freight traffic and earnings for Railways and cost competitive logistics for the entire country,¨ he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rlys-freight-traffic-improves-amid-economy-revival-hopes/story-zqPxZpC7Er6k6KUg6LIbUM.html
29-07-2020||India||India’s agriculture policy dilemma||In his speech at the CII National Council, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das spoke about five dynamic shifts which are underway in the Indian economy. One of the five themes in the speech was “fortunes shifting in favour of the farm sector”. The speech cites record production of food grains, fruits and vegetables, and all-time high buffer stocks as “the most vivid silver lining in the current environment”. The speech also gives a policy direction for the future. “Shifting the terms of trade in favour of agriculture is the key to sustaining this dynamic change and generating positive supply responses in agriculture. Experience shows that in periods when terms of trade remained favourable to agriculture, the annual average growth in agricultural gross value added (GVA) exceeds 3%. Hitherto, the main instrument has been minimum support prices, but the experience has been that price incentives have been costly, inefficient and even distortive. India has now reached a stage in which surplus management has become a major challenge. We need to move now to policy strategies that ensure a sustained increase in farmers’ income alongside reasonable food prices for consumers,” Das said. That might not always be possible. Favourable terms of trade along with reasonable food prices Terms of trade will be in favour of agriculture if prices of agricultural goods are rising at a faster pace than that of non-agricultural goods. This need not be consistent with reasonable food prices for consumers. The agriculture ministry has released terms of trade data up to 2018-19. This data is given for agricultural versus non-agricultural sectors and farmers versus non-farmers. When the value of the terms of trade index is less than 100, it means that the relative prices are against farmers. The data shows that both these indices were rising in the last decade and have stagnated or fallen since. The farmer versus non farmer terms of trade in 2018-19 was 96.4, while the agriculture versus non-agriculture index was at 106.8.  The trend is worse when it comes to the farmers versus non-farmers index. This is also the period when food price inflation growth has moderated. Food inflation shared the upward trajectory of terms of trade for agriculture when the latter was rising. This suggests that maintaining terms of trade in favour of agriculture and ensuring reasonable food prices for consumers might not be compatible. See Chart 1: Terms of trade and food price inflation Doing away with price support incentives The policy of government procurement at Minimum Support Prices (MSP) has been a key pillar of India’s food security. Guaranteed remunerative prices have encouraged farmers to grow more rice and wheat. Government’s food stocks, which are built through MSP procurement, come in handy during periods of crisis such as the current one. To be sure, the policy has created problems, especially regarding ecologically unsustainable farming practices in India’s original green revolution belt. The policy has also created a regional imbalance. According to latest procurement data from Food Corporation of India — 2018-19 for rice and 2019-20 for wheat — 47% of total procurement was from the states of Punjab and Haryana. The share of these states in total wheat and rice production in 2017-18, the latest period for which data is available in the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) database, was just 22%. These problems notwithstanding, the share of procurement in total rice and wheat production has been increasing continuously. Any sudden withdrawal of this policy is bound to create a huge disruption and possible disincentive for production. See Chart 2: Share of procurement in total production Surplus theory in Indian agriculture The argument that surplus management has become a major challenge in Indian agriculture, logically speaking, implies that agricultural production needs to be brought down. This is definitely not a desirable solution, especially when the policy objective is to double farmers’ incomes.How does one explain the anecdotal evidence of crash in prices with excess production. Two factors may be behind this. The first is the question of boosting food demand in India, which is still low, compared to international standards (see https://bit.ly/2X3XHAf for a detailed discussion). The second is what is referred to as the cobweb model effect. This pertains to production decisions based on limited information leading to wild swings in prices every year. For example, if onion prices crash this year, farmers sow lower quantities, leading to a surge in prices in the next season. This vicious cycle will repeat. The only way to break this is to improve dissemination of information regarding climatic conditions to farmers and make sure that the government does not create additional distortions in food markets. Resorting to imports on the pretext of controlling food inflation to prevent any spike in prices is an example of this kind of behaviour. As climate change increases the incidence of extreme weather events, affecting production, prices will probably become volatile. Exports may provide a way out, but increasing agricultural exports may not be possible in the near future. Agriculture in developed countries is heavily subsidized, which reduces export competitiveness of third world exports. The multilateral trade regime is almost in complete jeopardy, which has significantly reduced hopes of addressing these distortions. These difficulties notwithstanding, there are serious questions on whether such an approach is desirable. A 2016 article by this author highlighted how India was the biggest virtual exporter of water via its agricultural exports and also among the most water stressed regions in the world (see https://bit.ly/2Eiff59 for details). Even though it contributes less than 15% of the GDP, agriculture continues to provide livelihood to more than 40% of the country’s workers. This makes it critical for economic growth. However, to really shift the fortunes in favour of agriculture will require a demand driven sustainable policy trajectory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-agriculture-policy-dilemma/story-UvdtxBJqQMVFwt1QZ5PN5J.html
29-07-2020||India||Money-laundering probe: ED raids GVK group offices in Hyderabad||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday raided offices of Hyderabad-based GVK Group, and its promoters in connection with a money-laundering probe related to alleged irregularities crore in the Mumbai airport’s development and maintenance, two officials said. The Group runs the airport.The case pertains to the period from 2006 and deals with the diversion of money from Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL), in which GVK Group has a 50.5% stake and the state-owned Airports Authority (AAI) of India 26%, to other companies of the company, causing a loss to AAI and the exchequer. The amount involved is 800 crore. The ED money laundering case is based on a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) case probing the alleged diversion of funds. The officials said the searches were primarily conducted at the company’s Mumbai and Hyderabad offices. The office of MIAL was also raided, they added. MIAL is a joint public-private partnership venture between AAI, GVK Group, and few other entities. ED registered a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act this month on the basis of CBI’s June 27 First Investigation Report (FIR) that named 13 people, including the Group’s chairman, G V K Reddy, MIAL, and several companies that were given airport contracts.According to the FIR, the promoters of the Group in MIAL allegedly siphoned off funds “fraudulently adopting various modus operandi” in connivance with their executives and unnamed AAI officials. CBI has alleged MIAL signed fake contracts in 2017-18 with at least nine companies on the pretext of real estate development. HT has seen a copy of the FIR.AAI signed an agreement with the Group in April 2006 for the airport’s operation, management, development, up gradation, and maintenance. MIAL was to share 38.7% of its revenue as an annual fee with AAI as per the agreement. The Group did not respond to an email query on the raids. In a June 27 statement, it assured the company will cooperate with CBI’s probe. “MIAL would have provided every assistance had the agency [CBI] sought explanation or any document even if a preliminary enquiry had been initiated. MIAL is a transparent and responsible corporate entity which is committed to cooperate with the agency in its investigation to arrive at the truth.”CBI and ED are probing GVK Group for alleged irregularities worth over Rs 800 in the Mumbai airport’s development and maintenance.They have named GVK Group, and 13 people including its chairman, G V K Reddy, his son, G V Sanjay Reddy, and several other companies as well as unknown public servants for alleged irregularities.The AAI signed an operation, management and development agreement with the Group in April 2006 for the airport’s modernization, up-gradation, operation, and maintenance.The company is accused of getting into contracts illegally to siphon off funds of the airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/money-laundering-probe-ed-raids-gvk-group-offices-in-hyd/story-WsvLzNW95PwziuXtoDXHYN.html
29-07-2020||India||One in three tigers live outside reserves: Report||One in every three tigers in India lives outside reserves, according to a report, Status of Tigers, Co-predators and Prey in India (2018) released on Tuesday, highlighting the challenge of protecting India’s national animal and reducing instances of man-animal conflict. The proportion has increased from around the one in every four tigers living outside reserves according to a 2014 study. India recorded a 33% increase in tiger numbers from 2014 to 2018, according to the summary of the report, All India Tiger Estimation Results, released last year. There were 2,967 tigers in India in 2018, compared to 2,226 in 2014.Currently, the tiger population within reserves is 1,923, which means that 35% of the population is still outside tiger reserves.No tigers were recorded in Mizoram’s Dampa and West Bengal’s Buxa tiger reserves while they face the severe threat of local extinction in Jharkhand’s Palamau reserve, according to the report. Corbett Tiger Reserve, which is among reserves at or nearing capacity, had the largest population of tigers—about 231—in 2018, the report released by Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar added. Madhya Pradesh had the most tigers (526), followed by 524 in Karnataka and 442 in Uttarakhand. Madhya Pradesh overtook Karnataka, which recorded the highest number of tigers in 2014—406 .Also read: First evidence of tiger breeding in Assam sanctuary brings cheerThe largest contiguous tiger population in the world—about 724—was found in the Western Ghats (Nagarhole-Bandipur-Wayanad-MudumalaiSatyamangalam-BRT block). The second largest— about 604—was found across Uttrakhand and western Uttar Pradesh (Rajaji-Corbett-Ramnagar-Pilibhit-Dudhwa block).Bandhavgarh, Bandipur, Nagarhole, Mudumalai, and Kaziranga had over 100 tigers each while Dudhwa, Kanha, Tadoba, Sathyamangalam, and Sundarban had over 80 each.Three tigers each were recorded in Dampa and Palamau and two in Buxa during the 2014 tiger estimation exercise.“Although, no tiger images were obtained during the sampling session but Dampa Tiger Reserve is one of the important cross-boundary tiger reserves important for the tiger and other wildlife conservation by providing connectivity to other protected and forested area,” the report said. “It may be possible to reintroduce tigers in this landscape from the only source in the North-Eastern Hills and Brahmaputra Landscape i.e. Kaziranga Tiger Reserve. However, a proper protection regime and control of insurgency is required before bringing back tigers is to be considered.”“Even in 2014 the estimate of three tigers was based on molecular work and not direct sightings or tiger signs. This time the entire park including core and buffer area was surveyed but no tigers were seen. My sense is that there were always a very low number of tigers in Dampa. To the west of Dampa there is an open border with Bangladesh. They may be moving there. But the habitat in Dampa is phenomenal and so is the diversity of felines-- marbled cats; golden cat, leopard cat etc. Forest guards are working in extremely difficult conditions but the reserve supports so much diversity possibly because of them,” said Priya Singh, an independent wildlife biologist who has focused her research on Dampa.No tiger was recorded in Palamau Tiger Reserve, which once had a healthy population of tigers, during the 2018 assessment, according to the report. One tiger was photo captured and evidence of tiger signs was recorded from the reserve between January and August 2019.Corbett, Kaziranga, Nagarhole, Ranthambore are among tiger reserves at or nearing capacity. Corbett has the highest density of tigers in the country— 14 per 100 sq km. This also is a challenge for habitat management, said National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) officials.“Some reserves reaching capacity is an issue. We have to see how we can maintain carrying capacity through habitat manipulation. For example, if grasslands are managed well, they can support a good number of herbivores which in turn can support a large number of tigers,” said NTCA member secretary SP Yadav.He emphasized the tiger estimation exercise is a snapshot and that the fact that no tigers were recorded in Dampa and Buxa mean that no tigers were seen in these reserves in 30 to 40 days when the camera trap-based estimations were carried out.“Most of the areas where tigers are occupying the area outside reserves are well connected with the source population through migratory corridors. This is the case in the Corbett-Ramnagar region, and in central India… tigers can take care of themselves; they do not require micromanagement if they get space. For example, tigers are occupying the Ramnagar-Terai east and west area which is contiguous to Nepal. You have to provide them corridors to move and river banks should be free of encroachment,” said Anup Kumar Nayak, who was NTCA member secretary when the 2018 estimation was conducted.Wildlife Institute of India scientist Qamar Qureshi said Palamau had its heyday when Project Tiger conservation programme was launched in the 70s. “But due to [Left-wing] insurgency, the area has not got good protection. There is too much disturbance. Buxa and Dampa had very few tigers always. But Assam and some parts of Arunachal Pradesh like the Dibang Valley have good numbers and the habitat.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-in-three-tigers-live-outside-reserves-report/story-C6hYaEl5mmYjeHcLG2wDVO.html
29-07-2020||India||Delhi riots: AAP govt rejects lawyers proposed by police||The Delhi government appeared headed for another flashpoint with the Lieutenant Governor on Tuesday after it rejected a panel of lawyers proposed by the Delhi Police in cases linked to the deadly communal riots and the anti-CAA protests in the Capital earlier this year, citing the need for a “free and fair” trial over the violence.In February, 53 people died in communal riots triggered by violent clashes between the supporters and opponents of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA. Cases are currently being argued in the Supreme Court and the high court in cases related to the riots.The decision to reject the lawyers’ panel backed by LG Anil Baijal was taken at a meeting of the Delhi cabinet, chaired by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.The cabinet rejected the panel on the grounds that the courts have raised “serious questions” on the “fairness” of the riots investigation, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government said in a statement. “The cabinet also observed that in such a situation a free and fair trial of these cases would not be possible by a panel of lawyers selected by the Delhi Police itself,” it said. It directed the home department to constitute an “impartial panel of the best possible lawyers in the country” to fight the cases.Tuesday’s meeting was held on the direction of LG Baijal, who, in a letter to Kejriwal on July 16, gave the Delhi government a week’s time to decide on the panel of lawyers it wanted to appoint to fight the cases. On July 10, the Delhi Police sent a proposal to the Delhi government, recommending the names of six special public prosecutors, including solicitor general Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi to fight 85 cases related to the riots and clashes during protests against CAA.LG Baijal’s office declined to comment on the matter. On July 18, the LG’s office, in a statement on the same matter, said the north-east riots and the anti-CAA protest cases are of “highly sensitive nature” as they involved large-scale communal violence and require careful handling in view of the gravity and deep impact on the society.The Delhi government later said that anyone who was guilty of causing communal violence in the Capital should be punished severely, but in no case should the innocent be harassed.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, while rejecting the idea of the panel proposed by the Delhi Police, earlier demanded that the Delhi government’s team of lawyers led by Rahul Mehra be assigned the task.Tuesday’s Cabinet note, seen by HT, rejected the LG’s view of going with the Delhi Police’s panel on three grounds: allegations against the Delhi Police that its investigation in these cases was biased; lawyers should be independent of the police; and the matter does not qualify as “rarest of the rare” case for the LG to interfere.“The judiciary has also made adverse remarks against Delhi Police’s investigations on several occasions… Therefore, in order to ensure that all facts are presented before the judges, it is extremely critical that the government advocates are independent of the Police. Therefore, the panel suggested by Delhi Police should be rejected,” the Cabinet note said.It observed that it is the “basic principle of criminal jurisprudence” that investigations should be completely independent of prosecution and the police should not be allowed to decide the lawyers in any case. The Cabinet also alleged “repeated interference” by the LG in appointing the panel of lawyers. It asserted the Delhi government has the right to appoint public prosecutors.“The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, in its order dated July 4, 2018, has repeatedly mentioned that the LG should use this power in ‘rarest of rare cases’. Which lawyer should represent a case - this matter certainly cannot qualify as ‘rarest of rare case’,” the Cabinet note read. A senior government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that as per the procedure, the next step in the matter will be that the LG will send it to President Ram Nath Kovind.The latest run-in comes barely a month after the LG and the Delhi government disagreed over the appointment of 11 public prosecutors proposed by the Delhi Police in lower courts for over 750 riot cases. The LG then decided to refer the matter to the President, citing a “difference of opinion”. Following the move, then home minister Satyendar Jain had approved the Delhi Police’s panel.Responding to the government’s statement on Tuesday, the Delhi Police said it will leave no stone unturned to ensure successful prosecution in the riots cases. “Delhi Police has conducted the investigation of N-E riot cases in a fair and impartial manner and to improve the quality of prosecution it has recommended the panel of senior law officers for the post of special prosecutors under section 24(8) of CrPC for group of anti-CAA and N-E riot-related important cases,” said Delhi Police spokesperson MS Randhawa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-riots-aap-govt-rejects-lawyers-proposed-by-police/story-c3ZkStuOPZF6lC6ghy6qzJ.html
29-07-2020||India||Air pollution cuts Indians’ life expectancy by 5.2 years: Report||Pollution levels in India shave off 5.2 years from the life expectancy of the average Indian and it most acutely hits people living in the Indo-Gangetic plains, according to an assessment by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, which also showed that the situation had slightly improved between 2016 and 2018.India is the second most-polluted country globally after Bangladesh, while Nepal, Singapore and Pakistan are the other top countries with dirty air. The authors use an air quality life index (AQLI), which takes particulate air pollution and determines the hit it has on life expectancy.According to the AQLI, India’s yearly average particulate pollution concentration of 63.2 ug/m3 in 2018 reduced life expectancy of the average Indian by 5.2 years. The life expectancy lost in 2016 was 6.1 years when the particulate pollution – which is linked to diseases affecting the lungs and heart – was at 71ug/m3.Also read: The interplay between the pandemic and pollution | AnalysisIn 2018, Lucknow’s (the most polluted district in the country) residents were exposed to an average annual PM 2.5 concentrations of 114.6 micrograms per cubic metres which is likely to cut short life expectancy by 10.3 years compared. That makes Lucknow the most polluted district in the country followed by 13 other districts, all in Uttar Pradesh. The National Capital Territory of Delhi is the 15th most-polluted region in the country as per the analysis, which relies on satellite data. The average PM 2.5 concentration was 106 micrograms per cubic metres which can lead to loss of 9.4 life years compared to if Delhi had met the WHO guidelines for air quality. The analysis did not include figures from 2019 and 2020. The report, released in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh on Tuesday evening, showed air pollution problem that was severe in India in the late 90’s only worsened further in recent years with an estimated life expectancy loss of 3.4 years in 1998, 4.8 years in 2010 and 6.1 years in 2016.China, however, stands out as a success story as per the data. Singapore, China and India were the three most polluted countries in 1998 with the Chinese losing 3.6 years of life to pollution but by 2018, China was the seventh most polluted and had improved its life expectancy by 1.3 years. Singapore has also improved. China declared a “war against pollution” in 2013 with some aggressive reforms. Since then, three-quarters of the world’s reductions in pollution have come from China and it has reduced PM 2.5 pollution by nearly 40% during the period according to the analysis.“Though the threat of coronavirus is grave and deserves every bit of the attention it is receiving— perhaps more in some places—embracing the seriousness of air pollution with a similar vigour would allow billions of people around the world to lead longer and healthier lives,” said Michael Greenstone, the Milton Friedman distinguished service professor in Economics and creator of the AQLI along with colleagues at the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC). “The reality is, no shot in the arm will alleviate air pollution. The solution lies in robust public policy. The AQLI tells citizens and policymakers how particulate pollution is affecting them and their communities and can be used to measure the benefits of policies to reduce pollution.”Over 20 years, India’s annual PM 2.5 levels have increased by 42%, taking 1.8 years off the life of the average resident. A quarter of India’s population is exposed to air pollution concentrations not recorded in any other country, with 248 million people in north India on track to lose more than 8 years of life expectancy if the same pollution levels persist.There is also emerging evidence that air pollution aggravates Covid-19 complications and increases mortality.“In northern Italy which is highly polluted covid 19 mortality was 12% compared to southern Italy where it was 4.5 %. There was also a study published by Harvard University which said even with a 1 microgram per cubic metre increase in PM 2.5, covid 19 mortality goes up but it has to be long term exposure to air pollution. These two are landmark studies. Even during the SARS epidemic in 2003 mortality was higher in polluted areas, even during the Spanish Flu in 1918 mortality was higher around coal plants. So, there is a clear link between air pollution and covid 19 mortality and morbidity. This is to do with how air pollution affects the airways and immune system of the lungs,” said Dr GC Khilnani, PSRI institute of critical and pulmonary and critical and former and head of pulmonary medicine at AIIMS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indians-life-expectancy-cut-5-2-yrs-by-pollution/story-APQuckQGUHf1tPiod7fGcM.html
29-07-2020||India||Five Rafale jets to land today||Five Rafale fighter jets of the 36 ordered by the Indian Air Force (IAF) from France will land at their home base in Ambala on Wednesday afternoon, an IAF official said. The fighter jets took off from Mérignac in France on Monday and had a one-day stopover at the Al Dhafra airbase near Abu Dhabi. The two-leg flight will see the Rafales covering a distance of nearly 7,000 km. IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria is expected to be in Ambala to receive the Rafales and the pilots flying them home. The first Rafale’s RB-001 tail number denotes the initials of the IAF chief: Rakesh Bhadauria. He led the complex negotiations for the Rafale deal. Also read: Ahead of Rafale touchdown, Section 144 imposed in area around Ambala Air Force stationThe jets are being flown by Indian pilots who have undergone comprehensive training on the aircraft. The Rafales will be a part of the IAF’s No. 17 Squadron, which is also known as the “Golden Arrows”. The aircrew bringing the Rafales to India is headed by Group Captain Harkirat Singh, a decorated fighter pilot, who is the commanding officer of the No. 17 Squadron. Also read: Rafale is a reminder | HT EditorialWhile the French air force refuelled the fighters — three single-seater and two twin-seater aircraft — using its Airbus A330 multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) aircraft on their way to Al Dhafra, aerial refuelling support will be provided by the IAF’s Russian Ilyushin-78 refuellers for the second leg of the journey from Al Dhafra to Ambala. The new fighters — the first imported jets to be inducted into the IAF in 23 years after the Russian Sukhoi-30 jets entered service in June 1997 — will significantly enhance the offensive capabilities of IAF, which has for long planned to update its fighter jet force. The jets -- the first of the 36 Rafale jets purchased from French firm Dassault in a government-to-government deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016 -- have been specially tailored for IAF.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/five-rafale-jets-to-land-today/story-MlcYy5STLDIcVWMv55mtoK.html
29-07-2020||India||JNU student Sharjeel’s voice appears to match speech clips: Forensics||The central forensic science laboratory(CFSL) has concluded that Jawaharlal Nehru University student Sharjeel Imam’s voice appears to match the one in video clips of allegedly seditious speeches delivered by him last year on the campuses of Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), according to the lab report seen by HT.The Delhi Police crime branch submitted a copy of the report, along with transcripts and video files of the speeches, to a city court on Saturday. The findings are a crucial piece of evidence in the cases against Imam, who has been accused of delivering inflammatory speeches on the campuses of Jamia and AMU campuses in the days leading to the violence outside the Jamia on December 13 and 15 last year.Police have charged Imam for sedition (Indian Penal Code 124A) and accused him of mobilising people to block roads and cut of essential supplies while protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. “The voices marked exhibit Q-1(S) & Q-2(S) are the probable voices of the person (Sharjeel Imam), whose specimen voice is marked Q-1(s),” the report dated April 20 reads.According to the police, Imam refused to give a sample of his voice for examination but was ordered by the court on February 12 to do so.Though the report uses the word “probable”, Delhi Police wrote in their submission to the court that the result of CFSl is “conclusive enough” to establish that the speeches dated December 13 and 15 were indeed delivered by Imam.Former Delhi Police additional commissioner Ashok Chand said “probable” is a technical language that the scientific officers use. There must have been some ambient noises in the voice sample which is why the report says “probable match”, said Chand. “Had it not matched, the CFSL would have clearly mentioned that the samples did not match and the report is negative,” said Chand.But Imam’s lawyer, Ahmad Ibrahim, said, These things are insignificant. In February, Imam had given a hand-written application to the Patiala House court where he had informed the magistrate that his voice was modulated and he was asked to speak a few sentences from the speech. The court had taken the plea in cognisance and will consider it during trial. So these things will not matter to the case. We will file a bail application as soon as we get a copy of the charge sheet.” Imam, a student of the Jawaharlal Nehru University, was arrested on January 28 from his house in Bihar’s Jehanabad by a joint team of Delhi and Bihar police. After his arrest, police had said that they would probe Imam for the alleged violence in Jamia campus. Police have in the charge sheet said that Imam misrepresented facts of the new Citizenship Law, widely published it across different colonies and mosques in Delhi, and delivered inflammatory speeches to mobilise people. After Imam’s arrest, a tweet was posted from his handle, which said “he had surrendered and had full faith in the process of law.” Police have also attached copies of pamphlets about the new citizenship law recovered from Imam’s laptop (this, too, was confirmed by the forensic laboratory report), that, according to the police charge sheet, were later distributed across different mosques in Delhi while asking people to protest on the streets and block roads. A statement of a photocopy shop owner in south Delhi, where around 5,000 such pamphlets were photocopied has also been attached in the charge sheet. Police said the pamphlets had details of “non-existent detention camps” in different parts of the country. In the charge sheet, police attached at least 10 transcripts of Imam’s speeches, which, they said, were found in his Google drive.According to the transcripts, Sharjeel asked people not to believe in the Constitution and teach the courts a lesson. Another excerpt of speech attached is one allegedly delivered by Imam in Asansol on January 22, 2020, in Muslims were urged asked join the protest because they do not have adequate representation in Parliament, the courts, the army, or the police. In another transcript of a speech dated, December 13, police allege that Imam asked people to organise “chakka jam” and stop supply of milk and water in Delhi’s colonies.Imam, a resident of Kako in Bihar, was pursuing a doctorate degree from the Centre for Historical Studies at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). He was one of the organisers of the anti-CAA protests in the national capital’s Shaheen Bagh. Imam is currently jailed in Assam. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act was passed by Parliament last year and opened a fast-track to citizenship for Hindu, Sikh, Parsi, Buddhist, Christian and Jain refugees who fled religious persecution in Bangladesh, Pakistan or Afghanistan and entered India on or before December 31, 2014. Soon after, violent protests broke out across India, beginning in the north-east, with activists and opposition parties saying the law violated constitutional provisions and was discriminatory towards Muslims. In response, the government said the law aimed to provide a safe haven for people fleeing persecution and was not meant to take away anyone’s rights or citizenship.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sharjeel-s-voice-appears-to-match-speech-clips-forensics/story-cFuF1uJ8s0nm8x1YNqHUlJ.html
29-07-2020||India||Pakistan looks to mark J&K move anniversary with 18-point agenda||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan who counts the campaign against India over Jammu and Kashmir as his government’s key achievement has involved the country’s spy agency, Inter Services Intelligence, or ISI, in an 18-point plan to mark the August 5 anniversary of India scrapping Article 370 that extended special status to the erstwhile state, people familiar with the development said. The ISI is accused of nurturing terror groups, mostly directed at India and Afghanistan.The 18-point programme includes a visit by Imran Khan to occupied Kashmir where he is tentatively scheduled to address the assembly in a speech that will be beamed live. Before he reaches Muzaffarabad, Khan’s government intends a field trip for foreign journalists to the occupied territory, the people added,asking not to be identified. India tabled laws and resolutions in the Rajya Sabha to strip the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir of its special status under the constitution and split it into two union territories, Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, on August 5. These were passed by the Rajya Sabha the same day, the Lok Sabha the following day, and received presidential assent on August 9.The introduction of the law was preceded by a security and communication lockdown in Jammu and Kashmir and detention of its top political leaders. Most of them have since been released; PDP’s Mehbooba Mufti is among the exceptions.Pakistan, which like much of the country, was taken by surprise by New Delhi’s move soon launched an international campaign against the nullification of Article 370. Imran Khan was the face of this pitch on and off Twitter. Khan even focused his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, or UNGA, last September on Kashmir, warned of a “blood bath” in the region when restrictions were lifted, prophesied a genocide on the streets of the valley and frequently referred to Pakistab’s nuke weapons to blackmail the world to intervene.Only two other countries spoke of Kashmir at the UNGA: Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Turkey and Malaysia, then led by Mahathir Mohamad.China also did issue two statements on the scrapping of Article 370. One asked India and Pakistan to work together on the Kashmir issue. But its primary concern was over the change of Ladakh’s status to a federally-administered territory. “China is always opposed to India’s inclusion of the Chinese territory in the western sector of the China-India boundary into its administrative jurisdiction,” China’s foreign ministry said then.New Delhi underlined to Beijing that changing the status of an Indian territory was an “internal matter”.For Imran Khan’s elaborate plan for August 5, Islamabad has reached out to Kuala Lumpur, Ankara and Beijing to issue statements to commemorate the first anniversary of Jammu and Kashmir’s new status, the people cited in the first instance said. Or at least release tweets to the effect.Turkey’s Erdoğan is expected to oblige but New Delhi is watching how Malaysia responds. Kuala Lumpur has a new prime minister in Muhyiddin Yassin who took over on 1 March. A statement from China, a government official said, didn’t matter given , especially against the backdrop of its aggressive attempt expand its territory that led to the standoff and the bloody Galwan clash in east Ladakh, and the first casualties on both sides along the Line of Actual Control in 40 years.The Pakistani foreign ministry has been told to work closely with spy agency ISI on its diplomatic outreach to Organisation of Islamic Cooperation member countries and international human rights groups, organising commemorative events - even rallies - at missions abroad and drafting a fresh memorandum to be handed over to the UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan headquartered in Islamabad, the people added.Counter terror officials in New Delhi told Hindustan Times that the campaign was drawn up by the military for Imran Khan, right from documentaries, pamphlets and newspaper supplements to the tweets that would be put out. But Imran Khan will front the campaign.The ISI created the The Resistance Front after August 5, a terror group without the religious label that could be used by Pakistan’s propaganda machine to claim that terror was home-bred in Kashmir due to Article 370, the people pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-looks-to-mark-j-k-move-anniv-with-18-point-agenda/story-6AwZC9azUuq0XXNg1tNhjP.html
29-07-2020||India||Important to deal with non-performing assets: Viral Acharya||1. In his speech at the SBI Conclave, the RBI governor said that we are entering a phase where extant wisdom about capital requirement of banks and potential growth of economy might not be of much use. What do you make of his remarks? My interpretation of his remarks is that we might have to encounter scenarios of stress which far exceed the usual standards of Basel capital requirements. Implicitly what he was suggesting was that the hit of a prolonged lock down on bank loans of individual and MSMEs might far exceed traditional losses. The latest Financial Stability Report endorses his remarks. The Non Performing Assets (NPAs) to advances ratio is far in excess of what we have ever seen. With the GDP set to contract anywhere between 5% and 10%, some analysts believe that the NPA ratio could end up even higher. I think there is still time. I am hoping that the RBI will use some of these estimates to get both public sector and private sector banks to shore up their capital. The debt moratorium has still not expired. The RBI should use this time, so that we do not run the risk of questions being posed ex-post. 2. Financial sector stability isn’t like normal economic metrics such as growth rate. It is missed only when there is a crisis. How difficult does it make the job of preserving it? It is very difficult exactly for the reason you mentioned. When you succeed with it, nothing happens. It is just that the counter factual would have been very bad. However in some times the job is a bit easier. Look at our last decade. While there are many hits and misses, most would agree that our NPA problem on the banking and even non-banking sector are the two most important problems we have to deal with. These are the times when politics and economics have to align themselves, because you have a striking example of what has gone wrong. What I’ve tried to argue in my book is that somehow in spite of that collective movement having gained ground, within a short period of time we seem to have reversed the gains. This is the result of divergence between short-term horizons of governments and long-term horizons of central bank. It is this divergence of horizons which makes the central bank’s job more difficult. Also read: RBI faced ‘intense pressure’ on liquidity: Former deputy governor3. In a country like India, where a vast majority does not have any significant monetary savings, are political incentives heavily aligned against governments pursuing financial stability? I think that is a very deep question. If you look at our leverage boom and bust cycles, it has not happened with small borrowers. Think about the fiscal constraints that come about when the financial sector does not do well as result of bad loans. Bank bail-outs effectively mean tax-payer money going into the pockets of wealthier segments of the society. In my view, lack of financial stability in India has actually transferred taxpayer funds through the route of poor underwriting standards away from the re-distributive and developmental objectives for which fiscal policy should be working. 4. In his foreword to your book Dr Y V Reddy underlines the importance of government borrowing crowding out markets for private bonds. We have banks and stock markets to raise capital. Why are bond markets necessary and desirable? First and foremost they are desirable precisely because our bank underwriting standards are not up to scratch. Except a few well capitalised private banks and handful of public sector banks, the track record has not been very impressive. In an environment like this you would want to reduce reliance on banks. If banks are not keeping well, at many points of time they are actually very risk averse to lend. In such a time it is a boon to have a well-functioning bond market. It allows savings in the economy to get channeled through non-bank routes. Developing the corporate bond market is another step in the direction of developing more diversified sources of funding in India. I fully agree with Dr Reddy that until government borrowing does not become more manageable in size, it is going to be a herculean challenge to develop the corporate bond market in India.5. You’ve always warned against the wrath of financial markets. Today, when the real economy is doldrums, stock markets, where global finance is a big player, are doing relatively better. How should we reconcile the two? This has multiple potential explanations. One view is that the pandemic is going to be a one-two year slow growth scenario, while the stock market is really a very long term claim. The second view is that central banks all over the world have responded with massive rate cuts and flooded the system with liquidity. Some of this safe haven excess liquidity is chasing emerging markets. Deposit rates in markets like India are not offering much return. So it is natural that investors turn towards higher yielding assets. Historically Indian investors have gone towards real estate, but that was not in great condition even before Covid-19. A lot of it is now going towards equity markets. But some of the stock market rally could be just froth. When the conditions reverse and interest rates are increased, this could burst in a very short period of time. One has to always watch out for this kind of external sector scenario. 6. Your book discusses demonetisation’s shock to the financial sector. Had demonetisation not happened, do you think that the agenda of cleaning India’s financial sector mess, which brought you to the RBI would have gone further? I wasn’t at the RBI when that phase happened. Even in the post-demonetisation phase, post the normalisation of liquidity, the government was very much on board in some of the critical moves in getting the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code to be applied on stressed assets. In my view demonetisation was not the critical event, although it did trigger a complex process of liquidity flowing into shadow banks and Non Banking Financial Companies. The glut of liquidity led to them underwriting very poor quality loans.The critical issue vis-a-vis financial sector stability in my view was political pressures that were coming up in 2018-19. The government wanted to go for liquidity and credit led short run boost to growth, not much unlike the kind of push that we saw for generating higher growth in the last decade. We felt that we could not allow the system to repeat its mistakes while we were still trying to clean up the previous leverage boom and bust cycle. 7. You describe financial stability as a necessary condition for sustainable growth. This means you don’t see this as a sufficient condition. What role do you see for fiscal policy in a country like India? Fiscal policy should really be focused on infrastructure, health and education. If we had a superior health infrastructure, that would have been a tremendous advantage at the current juncture. This is not to take away from the excellent work our medical workers are doing. Similarly, if we need to benefit from the anti-China sentiment in developed countries, we need seamless infrastructure zones to facilitate companies to execute their projects on time. Reliance on revenue spending in fiscal policy, which is what we do, gives short term growth benefits. But it does not generate high multiplier effects, the way infrastructure, health or education would. Some reorientation of fiscal policy is absolutely necessary. Fiscal stretch is most worrisome when it is only going to generate a short term benefit. It is not worrisome when it puts the economy on a long-term growth path. 8. Two policies have been discussed a lot in connection with India: bad banks and universal basic income (UBI). At the current juncture what do you think about both of them? If government is required to put up capital for a genuine fast-track resolution of stressed assets, it will be seen as credit positive for the financial sector and growth and credit positive for the economy as a whole. Recapitalisation of banks, not so much of weaker banks, is a fiscal stretch which puts the economy on a high growth path. If UBI is a replacement for all kinds of other subsidies we have, it is a win-win for everyone. This could be a good time to introduce it, but it would be a big-big mistake to layer it on top of the subsidies we are already giving. 10. What is your reading of the global economy? Some people are warning that a premature withdrawal of the stimulus could make things worse. I think the developed economy stimulus has been very-very large. But the key focus has to be on the health curve. The US is still not doing that great. Things are not looking great in Brazil and India. If big parts of the world are still facing the pandemic, an economic recovery is going to be hard. This is as much a behavioural challenge, as it is an economic policy challenge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/important-to-deal-with-non-performing-assets-viral-acharya/story-57kw7013mg8v5csAZKZ9XM.html
29-07-2020||India||Karnataka Covid-19 trajectory worse than Tamil Nadu’s||Karnataka’s trajectory of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases is on a path much worse than Tamil Nadu and Delhi’s, two of the countries hot spots, while Andhra Pradesh seems set to soar past the Capital’s tally soon, according to data analysed by HT.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageTo analyse the pace of the outbreak in states, HT looked at Covid-19 case data from 15 states that have over 25,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases as of Monday. In order to keep the starting point of each state uniform, Day 1 was taken as the day the state reported its 1,000th Covid-19 case (see chart). This allows a comparison of the case trajectory in different states which saw outbreaks expand over varying time periods.The most dangerous path traversed appears to be that of Karnataka, which on Monday crossed 100,000 total cases. In 74 days since its 1,000th case, the state has 101,465 confirmed cases — 30,000 cases more than Delhi and Tamil Nadu in the same time period. Tamil Nadu and Delhi, the second and third worst-hit regions in the country after Maharashtra, had 67,468 and 66,602 cases respectively by Day 74.Andhra Pradesh, the state with the second highest number of new cases in the past week (after Maharashtra), is also charting a trajectory that has seen a near-vertical rise in the last two weeks. Among the states analysed, only one state (Telangana with 4,737 cases) had fewer cases than Andhra Pradesh (5,636) on Day 50. By Day 94, the state had become the fourth worst-hit region in the country after the Big Three – Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi.Also read: Indian startup develops Covid 19 detecting mobile app, takes 5 minutesThe trajectory of Assam also comes as a surprise. Although the total numbers remain relatively low (32,228 cases), the state has reached this level in only two months since the day it reported its first thousand cases. Only Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka have had more cases by Day 60. Even Delhi had only 31,309 cases at this point.West Bengal is another state with a fast-increasing caseload. It has over 60,000 cases in 85 days since its 1000th case. Only the big three and Karnataka have had more cases in that time.Delhi, meanwhile, is the only state that has a relatively flat curve compared to others. While the Capital was very close to Tamil Nadu’s trajectory by Day 75 (70,977 cases against Tamil Nadu’s 70,390), since then, it has managed to break apart – there’s a 90,000-case gap between the two as of Day 107.Gujarat also has a relatively flat curve in the past two months, but its numbers should be noted with a caveat about its low testing rate – 9,447 samples tested per million against the national average of 13,007.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/k-taka-trajectory-worse-than-tn-s/story-FtFPP0zNrHpGq6Tp0aoIPI.html
29-07-2020||India||EC objects to L-G’s remark over elections in Kashmir||The Election Commission (EC) on Tuesday took exception to Jammu & Kashmir lieutenant governor G C Murmu’s statements on the conduct of elections in the Union Territory, saying issues such as poll timings solely fall within its remit.“It would be proper for authorities other than Election Commission to refrain from making such statements which are virtually tantamount to interfering with the Constitutional mandate of Election Commission,” the poll watchdog said it a statement. It cited a report in The Tribune on Monday that quoted Murmu saying polls would be held after the ongoing delimitation exercise. The statement referred to Murmu’s similar statements in other newspapers, including HT dated June 26. “Election Commission takes exception to such statements and would like to state that in the Constitutional scheme of things, the timings etc of elections are the sole remit of Election Commission of India.”Murmu’s office did not respond to HT’s email seeking a comment.The Centre in March set up a Delimitation Commission to redraw parliamentary and assembly constituencies in Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, and Nagaland.The statement said EC takes into account factors such as topography, weather, sensitivities, and local festivities before deciding the election timing. “For example, in the current times, Covid-19 has introduced a new dynamic, which has to be and shall be taken into consideration at the due time.”The statement said the outcome of delimitation is also germane to the decision related to polls in Jammu & Kashmir. “Similarly, the availability of central forces and railway coaches, etc. for the transportation of CPFs [central paramilitary forces] are important factors. All this is done after meticulous homework by the senior officials of the Commission and a detailed assessment in due consultation with concerned authorities.”People’s Democratic Party (PDP) spokesman, Waheed Ur Rehman Para, called EC’s statement a classic example of “Delhi talking to Delhi”. He said EC has mentioned all sorts of festivals but has not taken into account the feelings of the people. “The polls are important, but they are not a priority for the people of Kashmir,” said Para, whose party led the government in the erstwhile state until June 2018.National Conference spokesman Tanvir Sadiq said the people of Jammu & Kashmir were disenfranchised the moment EC decided not to hold assembly elections after the PDP government fell.“Of course, it is the EC’s job and not the lieutenant governor’s to decide the right time for elections. That said, has EC really done its job since the governor’s rule was imposed in June 2018?”He asked why Jammu & Kashmir’s people were “consciously disenfranchised” by not holding the assembly elections with the 2019 Lok Sabha polls or immediately after that. “Who is to be blamed for that? Did they not find the topography, weather, sensitivities for the one year from 2018? Had they done their job in time, we would not have been in the mess that we are in right now.” INDEPENDENT COMMENT||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-objects-to-l-g-s-remark-over-elections-in-kashmir/story-Wueo2p0mcSrOmnmzMpfLsL.html
29-07-2020||India||4G restoration in J&K: Govt to verify reports on L-G GC Murmu’s comment||The Centre on Tuesday told the Supreme Court it will verify media reports that said Jammu & Kashmir’s lieutenant governor, G C Murmu, has advocated the restoration of high-speed 4G internet services in the Union Territory.“We will verify,” attorney general K K Venugopal said even as solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for Jammu & Kashmir, sought more time to file a response.In an affidavit, the Centre on July 21 told the apex court that a special panel constituted as per the latter’s May 11 order to review restrictions on high-speed internet has decided against any relaxations for now. The affidavit was filed in response to a plea from NGO Foundation of Media Professionals seeking contempt of court proceedings against the Centre and Jammu & Kashmir on the grounds that no action was taken to comply with the May 11 order.Venugopal made the submission on Tuesday when the NGO referred to Murmu’s statement to the media that 4G services should be restored. The Centre told the Supreme Court on July 21 that the internet restrictions would continue for two more months before they were reviewed again.“In our affidavit, we have attached a news report showing LG [Murmu] has made a statement that 4G should be restored. It is also in line with the statements by J&K interlocutor Ram Madhav. I have submitted those media reports,” senior counsel Huzefa Ahmadi, who appeared for the NGO, told the court.A three-judge bench, which is hearing the matter, posted the case for hearing next on August 7.In the July 21 affidavit, the Centre said the panel on June 10 considered all aspects of the matter, including terror strikes, before deciding to continue the restrictions on 4G services.The May 11 order was passed after the NGO in April challenged restrictions on mobile internet speed to 2G. The NGO sought restoration of 4G services saying patients, doctors, and the general public were unable to access the latest information, guidelines, advisories and restrictions about Covid-19 pandemic because of the restrictions. It pointed out that slow internet speeds make telemedicine, or online consultation, impossible.The Supreme Court on May 11 refrained from passing directions to restore 4G services and instead ordered a constitution of a panel comprising high-level government officers, including the Union home secretary, to take a call on the matter.The NGO in June filed the contempt petition saying there was no information available whether the constitution of the panel was notified and whether it has conducted any meetings or passed any orders.The Centre told the court the panel was constituted by virtue of the May 11 order and no separate notification was required. The panel met on May 15 and sought further inputs before taking any decision. It again met on June 10 and decided not to relax the restrictions, the Centre said.A communications blackout and a lockdown were imposed in Jammu & Kashmir in August last year as part of measures to prevent protests against the Centre’s move to divest the region of its special status. Most of the restrictions have since been eased even as mobile internet remains restricted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4g-restoration-in-j-k-govt-to-verify-reports-on-j-k-l-g-comment/story-mW2i5VSCvelnVoYm14YabL.html
29-07-2020||India||Delhi sero surveillance round 2 in first week of August, results by week 3||More than a hundred teams of the three-four members will fan out across the Capital in the first five days of August to collect blood from around 20,000 people, health officials in Delhi said on Tuesday, giving new details on an upcoming survey that could help determine how much closer Delhi is to achieving herd immunity to Sars-CoV2, the virus that causes Covid-19.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe results of the second such serological study in the city are expected by mid-August.The blood will be used to check for antibodies that indicate a person was once infected and has since recovered and now possibly immune. If more than 40-65% of the population has such antibodies, Delhi will have, possibly, reached the herd immunity threshold. This is when an infectious diseases peters out as vulnerable people dwindle.The first citywide survey of this sort, covering close to 21,800 people between June 27 and July 10, showed 22.86% of those tested had the antibodies. Like that exercise, the one next month will draw on samples that are representative of the city’s population – by age, gender and regional distribution. “For the second round of the survey, the number of samples to be collected from each ward and each district will be decided by the researchers from Maulana Azad Medical College, just like it was done by scientists from NCDC (National Centre for Disease Control) for the last round. We are yet to receive the break-up,” said a district official, asking not to be named. Also read: Least active cases since June 1 in Delhi, 42% more beds than a month agoTo illustrate what some of the yardsticks could be, this person said around 30% of the samples collected in the first round were from those between the ages of one and 18 and all of those tested must have resided in Delhi for the last six months.“The numbers of how many samples will be collected from each district and ward is collected based on the population in the area and the percentage of people who need to be surveyed – the highest are to be collected by North West district and the least by New Delhi district,” this person added, citing the previous survey design.People who were covered in the previous survey will not be part of the sampling, according to the official. The collection of samples will be done by grassroots health workers, who will draw 3-5ml of blood from each member of a selected household. The teams will each consist of ASHA workers, an auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM), a phlebotomist or a lab technician, and a community volunteer. One team will be able to draw 25 to 40 samples a day. “Our teams are ready, we are yet to get the guidelines for the survey. We can start collecting the samples as soon as we get the details. A meeting regarding the same is likely to happen by the end of the week,” said a district health official from another one of Delhi’s 11 districts, asking not to be named. When results of the first citywide serological survey was held, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said it represented the situation that existed around the end of June and the number of people who would have silently had the infection may now have grown. How close, or far, Delhi is from the herd immunity threshold can have an impact on the precautionary curbs on some activities that have been in place to minimise spread of the disease. It could also determine whether some of the infrastructure preparedness –such as the number of beds reserved for Covid patients – is tweaked.Also read: No death reported on Monday at Delhi’s biggest Covid hospital, Lok NayakAccording to the Delhi government, the preparedness is likely to be maintained at current levels, even as current hospitalisations hover around their lowest in nearly two months. “As of now there is no plan to reduce the number of beds even post the sero survey. No such directions have been issued or discussion taken place. The Covid situation in Delhi is still being monitored very carefully by the chief minister and he has advised all officers not to be complacent and continue with all the Covid management activities as it is,” the Delhi government said in a statement on Tuesday.“The repeated sero surveillance will help us understand how many people have developed antibodies against the infection and whether that is the reason for declining prevalence. Also, it would be helpful in studying how long antibodies last,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital. “When a statistical sample is selected, it is done on the basis of a presumed prevalence. In this case, it as the prevalence as per the ICMR survey. Now, if you have to properly observe something that occurs in less than 1 of 100 people, you would need a large sample size to see it. Now that we know the prevalence is about 23% -- and I expect it has gone up -- a smaller sample size will be good enough to observe. I believe 5 to 6 thousand samples will be enough for the second round of surveillance,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-sero-surveillance-round-2-in-august-first-week-results-by-week-3/story-KMa90IIUoCUvWl21L4OJdN.html
29-07-2020||India||Disengagement complete at most locations, claims China||Indian and Chinese front-line troops have completed disengagement at most locations on the border, China said on Tuesday -- a statement Indian Army officers described as a play of words that did not reflect the full picture on the ground.The Chinese foreign ministry was giving an update on the disengagement of border troops following last Friday’s three-hour meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs, which met to review the situation in the border areas and the disengagement process in the western sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Also read | How the cold will alter the India-China power equation next month in LadakhResponding to a specific query on whether Indian and Chinese soldiers had completed disengagement at Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra areas, foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said disengagement was completed in most areas. India’s external affairs ministry did not comment on the matter . “The front-line frontier defence forces of the two countries have disengaged in most locations, and the current situation continues to develop in the direction of easing and cooling,” he said. But Indian Army officers said the locations did not really cover the key areas of conflict.“Completed disengagement at “most locations” reveals there are locations where the process hasn’t made significant progress. Disengagement at Pangong Tso and Patrolling Point-17 (Gogra) hasn’t been up to the desired level,” an Indian Army officer aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity. Also read | Indian Navy’s clear message to Beijing following escalation of border tension ‘registered’ by China: ReportDifferences between India and China on the disengagement process along the LAC emerged following the meeting last Friday, with New Delhi calling on Beijing to “sincerely implement” the understandings on troop withdrawals reached by senior military commanders of the two sides.“Recently China and India have conducted intensive communication through military and diplomatic channels. We have held four rounds of commander level talks and three meetings of WMCC,” Wang said on Tuesday.“Now we are preparing for the fifth round of commander level talks to study the settlement of the remaining issue. We hope India will work with China to implement our consensus and uphold peace and stability along our border areas,” he added.The commander-level talks are likely to be held later this week.Following last Friday’s WMCC meeting, a statement from the Indian external affairs ministry said the two sides agreed “it was necessary for both sides to sincerely implement the understandings reached between senior [military] commanders in their meetings till date”.India at the WMCC meeting focused on the need for China to completely withdraw its forces from key friction points in Ladakh sector in keeping with commitments made at the meetings of the corps commanders and the July 5 phone conversation between the two Special Representatives on the border issue, people aware of the matter told HT in New Delhi.It is still not clear whether Beijing is looking at the disengagement of troops in the same way.The Chinese statement on the same WMCC meeting, issued in Beijing in Mandarin, referred to “positive progress made by the front-line border defence forces of the two countries to disengage and ease the situation on the ground”.Northern Army commander Lieutenant General YK Joshi last week said that disengagement between forward deployed Indian and Chinese soldiers from friction areas along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) was a “complex and intricate process” that required “diligent execution”. Joshi said disengagement was being verified on the ground to “ensure its veracity and correctness.” He said de-escalation of the border conflict would begin after complete disengagement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disengagement-complete-at-most-locations-claims-china/story-8BO8Qt2WOoalznWnWz86JL.html

He alleged that the ‘high profile’ of the ruling front interferes with the ongoing investigation.The 60-member House currently has a strength of 52 after eight lawmakers were disqualified.

29-07-2020||India||ED summons Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot’s brother, asks him to appear within 24 hours||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has issued summons to Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s brother Agrasain Gehlot to appear before it at its headquarters in Delhi on Wednesday in connection with its probe into alleged money laundering in the export of fertilizer meant for Indian farmers, officials familiar with the development said. Without divulging further details, officials cited above said they need to question Agrasain Gehlot as he, through his company, played a key role in the alleged violations. ED’s probe is based on an investigation carried out by the customs department and the Directorate of Revenue and Intelligence (DRI) in 2009 in the export of Muriate of Potash or MOP, which is a restricted commodity for export under the foreign trade policy. It is suspected that Gehlot’s company diverted total 35,000 metric tonnes of MOP, having value of Rs 130 crore in international market, against the laws. The anti-money laundering probe agency had, on July 22, conducted raids at his premises apart from several companies and individuals in Rajasthan, Delhi and West Bengal. Also read: ED raids CM’s brother on money laundering charge, Congress hits outA Customs’ department investigation report, reviewed by HT, alleges that Agrasain Gehlot’s company – M/s Anupam Krishi –played a key role in the export of MOP to companies in Malaysia and Singapore. It added that Agrasain Gehlot “knowingly opted to become a part of the syndicate in the entire chain of conspiracy by facilitating the said consortium (of private companies) by supplying subsidized MOP, which was meant for sale to farmers only and forged documents for which he admittedly gained certain amount as his commission”. ED and the income tax department are also investigating Ashok Gehlot’s son Vaibhav Gehlot in connection with his links with a hotelier. The Income Tax department, had on July 13, conducted raids at several places in Rajasthan and Delhi belonging to three business groups on charges of tax evasion and had recovered around Rs 12 crore in cash. The Congress had, on July 22, termed the ED action against Ashok Gehlot’s brother a “raid raj” created by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership in Delhi. The party added that the Centre was using federal agencies to arm-twist lawmakers to bring down the Ashok Gehlot government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-issues-summons-to-rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot-s-brother/story-L4OU7nKw0hBcy9dNbatSyH.html
29-07-2020||India||Tune into Harshit’s ‘Yaari’ on Friendship Day||Singer-composer Harshit Saxena is coming up with a ‘Yaari’ song that will be released on International Friendship Day on August 2. The ‘Haal-e-Dil’ singer asked his fans to send in their pictures and get featured in the song. ‘Mujhko Teri Yaari’ will feature these pictures. “When we decided to make song celebrating friendship, an idea came that why not feature people and their friendships? So, on my social media account I asked people to mail us pictures of their best friendship moments. I promised to use best pictures in the songs and trust me we really had tough time selecting them as they were so many of them,” said the Lucknowite. In three days, he received around 4,500 pictures on mail. “We closed the entries on July 15 but till date we are getting mails. After a lot of brainstorming around we shortlisted 80-90 pictures that will feature in the song as the duration of the song is less than 3 minutes.” Despite being his single venture, Harshit won’t feature in the song. “I decided not to feature in the video and give the entire screen space to the audience. Even if I have tried to put a 40 second clip of mine then I would have to reduce few pictures which I did not want to happen.” The song will be released on Friendship Day, this week. “We have tried to make it as a friendship anthem so that every friend can dedicate the song to their friend and even sing for them.” Telling more about the song he said, “When lyricist Soumya gave me the lines they were very simple for all to understand and connect with. Listeners want simple lyrics as the love to sing along. So to keep up with the trend we kept it easy and hummable.” In the song he did not use any high pitch and kept it on a simple scale. “My song ‘Haal-e-Dil’ is a big hit but it’s not an easy song to sing for a layman. Best is when you listen to lines which stay in mind your mind and you like to hum it. It was not about showcasing my ‘gayaki’ (singing ability). We used simple instruments and recorded at my own studio.” Earlier in May, Harshit has released a song ‘Bas Kuch Dino Ki Baat Hai’ that was penned by Sameer Anjaan and showcased the plight of migrant labourers during the lockdown phase. “Besides, before the lockdown, I have sung, composed and featured in two music videos. I was supposed to shoot more but then everything was brought to a standstill due to ongoing pandemic. Also, I have composed songs for film ‘Utawle Bawle’. I have an update that my songs have been filmed but some little work is left for the completion of film. I hope things improve and the film gets a good release,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/harshit-s-friendship-anthem-belong-to-the-audience/story-ja1OVjnoomWLlAiOduCKtN.html
29-07-2020||India||Disclosing names of Covid-19 patients involves risk of victimisation: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court on Tuesday observed that there was risk of ostracising Covid-19 patients if their names were disclosed as demanded by two public interest litigants.“What purpose will be served by disclosing the names? This will lead to the risk of ostracisation,” the bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Sarang Kotwal said during the hearing on the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by law student Vaishnavi Gholave and farmer Mahesh Gadekar.The bench said it all depends on how careful the individual is. “Try to avoid congregations, wear face mask and head shield... This is what is advocated to stay safe from the infection,” it said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.In the PIL filed through advocate Vinod Sangvikar, the two petitioners contended that on several occasions Covid-19 patients are unable to recognise and give complete information about the people, who had come into their contact, because of which contact tracing becomes an arduous task and many suspect cases fall through the cracks.They have cited an example of a meat seller from Muraji Peth in Solapur who was found to be Covid-19 positive, and later it came to be known that about 1,000 people had unwittingly come in contact with him.“However, the meat-seller didn’t know all his customers or their whereabouts,” the plea stated.It added that there are about 25 meat sellers in Muraji Peth and since the name of the infected meat seller was not disclosed, people did not know whether they had exposed themselves to SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, and as a result, take precautionary measures.The plea expressed serious concerns about the growing risk of community transmission and argued that it is necessary to disclose the names of Covid-19 patients in a bid to make contact tracing easier and also appropriate precautionary measures be taken such as self-isolation and early treatment for the viral infection.The PIL cited that Maharashtra has been reporting a surge in Covid-19 positive cases even though the state government is maintaining that community transmission has not set in yet.Arguing on behalf of the central government, additional solicitor general Anil Singh opposed the PIL. He pointed out that four high courts have dismissed petitions containing similar prayers, and therefore the HC should not entertain the PIL.The bench, however, posted the PIL for further hearing on Friday after Sangvikar sought time to go through the judgments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disclosing-names-of-covid-19-patients-involves-risk-of-victimisation-bombay-hc/story-6E6pkhLUUe8EpGrHLWc6eL.html
29-07-2020||Editorials||Convene the Rajasthan Assembly | HT Editorial||Rajasthan is witnessing not just a political crisis — which is an outcome of the power struggle between chief minister (CM) Ashok Gehlot and his now-dismissed deputy CM, Sachin Pilot. It is also staring at a constitutional crisis, with a deepening rift between two of the state’s most important institutions — the office of the governor and the office of the CM. Mr Gehlot wants an assembly session from July 31 to be able to prove that his government enjoys the confidence of a majority of the members of the House. Governor Kalraj Mishra has appeared reluctant in doing so, and asked for a set of clarifications on the agenda and Covid-19 protocols, besides hinting at a three-week notice period to convene the Assembly. On Tuesday, the government got back to the governor, telling him, quite bluntly, that imposing what can be construed as conditions is beyond his authority. On Wednesday, Mr Mishra once again rejected Mr Gehlot’s request. The government, on this issue, is right. It is important to go back to first principles here. The elected executive has a right to ask for a session of the legislature. This is an established constitutional principle, reiterated by successive Supreme Court judgments. The governor, in the case of assemblies, or the President of India, in the case of Parliament, has limited discretionary room in this regard. It is also both an established custom, and good form, for any government to seek to prove its majority in the House — when there are doubts about its stability. It is not in television studios or in hotel resorts that the longevity of a government is determined. It is on the floor of the House. And that is why Mr Mishra — a former political figure from the Bharatiya Janata Party — must do the right thing and convene the House. He owes it to both the letter and spirit of the Constitution and the dignity of his office. Not doing so is giving rise to the perception that the office of the governor is acting in a partisan way to allow the rebel legislators, and the Opposition, time to rally numbers to destabilise the government. This perception may or may not be true — but his inaction is creating a wrong precedent and undermining faith in institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/convene-the-rajasthan-assembly/story-bwonO2VOGmzUIL5gFfAqvL.html
29-07-2020||Editorials||The world waits for November | HT Editorial||No United States (US) presidential election will be watched as closely by non-Americans as the one that will take place just less than 100 days from now. In the past, US candidates argued about differences in domestic policy and had almost indistinguishable stances on foreign policy. The Republican incumbent, Donald Trump, and the Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, are almost polar opposites on almost every major issue whether at home or abroad. A second-term President Trump will feel even less shackled by the niceties and traditions of the past in pursing his domestic and international agenda. The multilateral system, whether in trade or security, will struggle to survive another five years of “America First”. His willingness to batter China economically and diplomatically will probably be enhanced, but may become even more unilateral and erratic than it has been so far. A Biden administration will resurrect much of the postwar consensus, especially in regards to the US alliance structure, and bring the US back into the climate fold. However, on China and even trade, the difference will be more in style than in substance.The real task of a President Biden — who has favourable poll numbers at the moment — would be to restore the legitimacy of the US establishment with its citizens because that, more than anything else, is what is undermining Washington and empowering Beijing today. And that continues to be Mr Trump’s biggest failure. Whatever his forceful responses towards China, and many of them are ones India has reason to be pleased about, he has done remarkable damage to the US internally. What Mr Trump is encouraging on the streets of Portland, Oregon, in a strange and unfortunate way has geopolitical consequences in the Indo-Pacific.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-world-waits-for-november/story-DmrejVsC9GyVYeMG5iDUWK.html
29-07-2020||Editorials||Rafale is a reminder | HT Editorial||The unusual fanfare surrounding the arrival of five Rafale fighters from France is a cautionary tale at many levels. The first is the context of the border confrontation with China. So long as Beijing refuses to restore status quo ante along the Line of Actual Control, India must retain a degree of military readiness as a bargaining chip or as a contingency for further violence. Two, the Rafales represent the first strategically significant upgrade in India’s air power in decades. While India is also fast-tracking the purchase of Russian MiGs and Sukhois, one has already been pensioned out of the arsenal and the other serves as a second stringer for the Chinese air force. Three, the importance attached to the Rafales and attempts to fast-track the subsequent batches is a reminder of the slowness of India’s procurement system and the question marks over its indigenisation drive.India had the luxury of putting defence procurement and reforms on the backburner. After all, it enjoyed military superiority against Pakistan, and had a military restraint understanding with China. The Balakot dogfights showed that, at best, India had technological parity with Pakistan. Galwan Valley has shown Beijing no longer feels the need to be constrained by the past 45 years. The Indian political system has been more concerned about accusations of scandals regarding arms purchases than what the weapons meant for national security. It is telling that the Rafales are the first tangible result of a fighter contract that was first unveiled in 2007. To its credit, the Narendra Modi government has implemented several defence reforms. But the gap has been its focus on weapons indigenisation, where the Make in India focus may not be adequate to address the quality needs of the armed forces. But with the changed security environment, the question has to be asked whether, in the case of offensive platforms, this priority makes sense.The new paradigm means the services also need to relook at their earlier convictions. Networking allows militaries to get more accurate bang for their buck but barely exists in even the most primitive form in the Indian military. A host of new technologies means older formulae need a rethink. The advent of the armed drone, for example, means the original 42-squadron air force goal of the Indian Air Force may be obsolete. The times they are a-changing in dangerous ways and mindsets need to be a-changing as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/rafale-is-a-reminder/story-nA2lWg8ULPjTGAE0UCtHVJ.html
