19-07-2020||News||How the UP government is demolishing the mafia||The dacoit gangs in the ravines of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Madhya Pradesh (MP), especially the Banda and Patha area of Chitrakoot of the latter, were always a serious challenge for successive state governments. But these dacoit gangs were successfully wiped out, largely in the 1980s. It was then that the terror of the urban mafia surged in UP.The inception and subsequent rise of the urban mafia did not come out of the blue. It flourished thanks to open political patronage. The Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) are mainly responsible for its rise. Members of the mafia were not only given political protection, but, in many cases, tickets to facilitate their entry into the state legislature and Parliament. Let us look at a few such entrants — Hari Shankar Tiwari, Virendra Paratp Shahi, Atiq Ahmad, Mukhtar Ansari, Vijay Mishra, Uday Bhan Singh, DP Yadav, Madan Bhaiyya, UmakantYadav, Sonu , Monu Singh, PawanPandey, Aruna Shankar Shukla “Anna”. This trend has continued until now with criminals such as Vikas Dubey emerging from the protective shadow of politicians. While not enough attention is being paid to the massacre of policemen at Bikru in Kanpur , an outrageous and horrific incident, people are comparing the encounter of the main accused Vikas Dubey with the incident of Telangana where four criminals, accused of a rape/murder , were killed by the police while on an evidence-gathering mission at night. It is fallacious to compare these two incidents. The Telangana killing was clearly a criminal act by the police.Dubey was a criminal who had a history of challenging the sanctity of constitutional institutions and the judiciary. In early 2000s, he killed the then minister of state Santosh Shukla inside the premises of a court and was then absolved. It turned him into a vicious and unrestrained criminal, as was evident in the manner he killed eight policemen. He seemed to believe he could not be touched. But he did not factor in the resolve of the Yogi Adityanath government in UP.Unlike in the encounter in Telangana, Dubey was killed after he tried to escape taking advantage of the situation as the police van carrying him overturned. Dubey had, in fact, snatched the rifle of a policeman accompanying him and opened fire at the police party. Two constables sustained injuries because of this. The police returned fire to minimise further casualties and, in this fracas, Dubey was killed on July 10.The police were prepared to produce him in the court to undergo the legal process. They took him from Ujjain but the unforeseen accident of the police van, and reckless and indiscreet action on the part of the criminal as the party neared Kanpur, prompted the police to act in self-defence. Don’t forget that it was just a few days earlier that he had murdered eight uniformed personnel.In the Telangana incident, all of four accused had no case against them in any police station. In contrast, Dubey had 64 criminal cases pending against him and he was a notorious historysheeter, carrying a reward of ~5 lakh on his head.The UP government has appointed a probe commission to enquire into this encounter. It has also set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to take an in-depth look into his crimes, his political connections and other activities. The district magistrate of Kanpur has also requested the district judge to institute an inquiry under the supervision of a judicial magistrate. No such action was taken by the Telangana government. The policy of “zero tolerance” towards organised crime and criminals adopted by the Yogi Adityanath-led government has resulted in the elimination of over 100 criminals in the approximately 4,000 encounters that have taken place in his term. Such has been the effectiveness of the UP police’s effectiveness that criminals with rewards on their heads started surrendering in police stations holding up placards. Members of mafia groups such as those run by Mukhtar Ansari and Atiq Ahmad,who controlled their empires from jail, are languishing in penal facilities in Punjab and Ahmedabad.Any mafia can be demolished if its economic backbone is broken. The Yogi government did it with precision and attacked the illegal financial network of the mafias and gangsters. In a planned manner in western UP, the properties of gangsters such as Badan Singh Baddo, Anil Dujana, Sunder Bhati, Udhan Singh Karnawal, Manish Chauhan, Yogesh Bhadaura, and Amit Kasana were attached or demolished. This dealt them a crushing blow. It is now only a matter of time before the UP government destroys the entire mafia network in the state and makes it safer for people, especially the most vulnerable.

In normal times, the preceding weeks involve a range of meetings. But these are not normal times.My appointment was announced in February. By March, I had been diverted to lead the UK government’s long-term Covid-19 response. I saw first-hand the nature of the challenge we all face. But I also saw how connected, and mutually reliant, we are as a global community. I saw how vital the UK’s partnership with India is, whether that was keeping trade routes open for essential medicines and equipment, or Oxford University, AstraZeneca and Serum Institute collaborating on a potential vaccine.The ties between the UK and India run deep. During my preparations, I found a commitment across government to invest further in this relationship — from the prime minister down. This was on display recently at India Global Week, with the UK’s most senior ministers underscoring the enormous potential of our partnership.When I presented my credentials to the president, he spoke warmly of close ties. My arrival may have been delayed and unusual, but the task is clear. The crisis has brought our shared priorities into sharp relief, so I know where my immediate focus lies.Further cooperation on health is the most pressing priority. The UK is already India’s second biggest research partner, with joint research expected to be worth £400m by next year. This partnership is leading the way — from Oxford Nanopore’s work on rapid analysis of virus genomes to the Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation-backed project on temperature-sensitive distribution mechanisms. The goal: A vaccine developed in the UK, manufactured in India.At the same time, we all face economic challenges from Covid-19 and share a determination to secure our prosperity. Over the last 10 years, the UK has invested over £22 billion in India helping create more than 422,000 jobs. In turn, India is now the UK’s second largest source of foreign investment. We are committed to deepening our trade partnership, now that the UK has left the European Union, and will discuss this in next week’s ministerial-level virtual Joint Economic and Trade Committee meeting.We owe it to future generations to build back better and greener. The UK recently announced a green recovery package — including £3bn to create thousands of green jobs and decarbonise buildings. In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi just inaugurated a mammoth solar power plant in Madhya Pradesh. Co-chairing a meeting of the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure was one of my first engagements here. As COP-26 president building our partnership with India on climate change is a priority.I have a lengthy list of further priorities to pursue, from enhancing our security collaboration in the face of shared threats, to strengthening the living bridge that connects our people. But I have also come with a personal list of things and places to rediscover.I worked in New Delhi in the 1990s, and returning feels like coming home. India is the same country, but it has also changed dramatically. It is bolder and more engaged on the world stage, the chair of WHO’s executive board and back on the UN Security Council from next January. In 2022, India will celebrate 75 years of Independence and host the G20.It is the greatest honour and privilege of my diplomatic career to represent the UK in this wonderful country. Continuing to build a modern, forward-looking partnership — through this pandemic and beyond — is a weighty responsibility, but one that I will carry with immense pride.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-deepening-bonds-between-india-and-the-uk/story-scufMrBk2BfZIMVE5NKFNI.html
19-07-2020||Gurugram||Haryana: OP Dhankar appointed new chief of BJP state unit||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday appointed O P Dhankar as the party chief of the state unit. Dhankar, a senior party leader, was a cabinet minister in the previous BJP government in the state. Dhankar replaces Subash Barala.The appointment of Dhankar is being viewed as a move to give adequate representation to the Jat community in the state leadership as it is the dominant caste in the state, said sources within the party. The previous state unit chief, Barala, is also from the Jat community.The party in a statement on Sunday said that Dhankar’s appointment was made by BJP chief JP Nadda.Although Barala has completed tenure eight months earlier, the appointment of a new BJP state chief was delayed as the party was searching for a suitable candidate. Senior leaders such as Captain Abhimanyu, Krishan Pal Gurjar, Sandeep Joshi and others were also in the fray for the position, said sources in the party. However, Dhankar’s experience, work as a ground-level farmer leader and his caste identity tilted scales in his favour, they added. Raman Malik, BJP spokesperson, Haryana, said that the appointment of Dhankar will galvanize the party’s rank and file as he has vast experience as a leader of the youth and the farmers. “He is an aggressive leader who knows the state’s politics and issues of the people deeply. This will help the organisation ,” said Malik. Notably, both Dhankar and Barala had lost their seats in the assembly polls held in October 2019. A party leader, who wished to remain anonymous, said that Dhankar had recently been appointed as the national coordinator for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Statue of Unity project in Gujarat. A former teacher who is from Jhajjar district, Dhankar started his career as a political worker in 1978. Between 1980 and 1996, he worked with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad and honed his skills in student politics. In 1996, he joined the BJP formally and was appointed as the national secretary. He was given the charge of head of BJP Kissan Morcha between 2011 and 2015. He also served as a cabinet minister in the BJP government in Haryana from 2014 to 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-op-dhankar-appointed-new-chief-of-bjp-state-unit/story-tE57HSV6wBWlcuQJzChePO.html

Just a week ago, on July 12, the count was 6,860 cases, indicating an average growth of at least 126 new cases per day, over the past week. At the beginning of the month, on July 1, the district had a total of 5,463 cases.Of the current tally, 1,029 patients are classified as active cases as on Sunday, slightly up from Saturday’s tally of 1,012. While 13 of them are currently hospitalised, the majority — 883 people — are under home isolation. The remaining 141 patients are under observation at various district Covid centres and dedicated Covid healthcare centres.Gurugram on Sunday also recorded 135 new recoveries, taking the district’s cumulative recovery rate to 85.22%. The district also recorded two new deaths on Sunday, both of whom had underlying medical conditions. The total tally of Covid-related deaths has reached 116. The mortality rate in the district stands at 1.5%.Gurugram on Sunday also collected 2,294 new samples for testing, down from 2,562 samples collected on Saturday. Of these, 372 samples were taken by private labs for RT-PCR tests, while the majority of remaining samples are those of RT-PCR and antigen tests by the health department. The district’s test-positivity rate(TPR) on Sunday was about 8% and has been fluctuating between 7 and 9% for close to two weeks now.Gurugram’s daily growth rate of new cases, on Sunday, was 1.8%, and has been fluctuating between 2.2% and 1.6% for the last two weeks.

19-07-2020||Gurugram||Backlog of samples increases, but officials say they are sufficiently equipped to test||Despite an uptick in testing capacity, the district’s daily epidemic bulletin has been showing an increase in the backlog of samples that are yet to be tested via the RT PCR method. Authorities said this was due to the slightly delayed reporting of results from the lab, due to which there is a day’s lag in reporting. While health department data shows that the backlog of samples has increased by more than five times in the past three weeks, officials clarified that this was not really the case.As of July 19, the results for at least 1,103 samples were awaited (from government facilities), up from 220 samples on July 1, as per the district health department’s daily epidemic bulletin. Officials, however, said that the delay was not cause of a dearth of testing facilities in Gurugram.“We are testing up to 800 samples per day via RT-PCR, which is more than what even private labs are testing. The private labs are testing around 300 to 400 samples per day. In early June, a backlog was building up because we weren’t able to test enough.Around 400 tests were being done daily then with a backlog of 700 cases. On the contrary, we are now collecting more samples after increasing our testing capacity, so naturally the bulletin is showing a larger number,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme’s district surveillance officer (DSO) in Gurugram. Unlike earlier, when results sometimes took as long as 48 hours to arrive, samples from government labs in Gurugram are now being tested within 24 hours, Sharma added. “This isn’t reflected in the bulletin because we receive the results at night, after the bulletin is issued. Results for most of Sunday’s 1108 pending samples will be updated in Monday’s bulletin,” he said, while results for about 1,300 samples collected on Sunday will appear in Tuesday’s bulletin.While health department officials said that shortfalls in testing do happen on some days, it isn’t a worrying trend. A doctor with the IDSP in Gurugram, said, “Earlier, the backlog was growing incrementally each day and the infrastructure we had was stretched quite thin. Now, even if there is a shortfall on one day, it is made up for the next day.”A total of 79576 samples from the district have been tested for Covid-19 so far, via both RT PCR and antigen methods. With the opening of a testing lab in Gurugram last month, and a second RT PCR machine being installed at Civil Hospital (inaugurated by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar last week), officials said that they are sufficiently equipped for the time being.The SGT Medical College Hospital and Research Institute in Chandu Budhera, located on the outskirts of Gurugram, will also soon initiate reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests on its campus. The college was awaiting approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which was granted earlier this month. At the time, Dr Mukesh Sharma, microbiologist at SGT College, had said that they would be able to test up to 300-400 samples every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/backlog-of-samples-increases-but-officials-say-they-are-sufficiently-equipped-to-test/story-H2d3H1Nfwv9UZuHQ8jzznJ.html
19-07-2020||Gurugram||Motorcyclist killed after truck overturns near Kherki Daula toll plaza||A 36-year-old motorcycle rider was killed after a truck allegedly overturned and hit at least four vehicles near the Kherki Daula toll on Saturday afternoon. Police said the mishap also triggered an hour long traffic congestion on national highway-48. According to the police, the incident took place when the victim — identified as Manoj Sharma, 36, who worked as an interior decorator — was on his way back home in Bhondsi from sector 84. Investigators say the accident took place around 3.30pm when a truck laden with lemons tried making a U-Turn underneath a flyover, a few metres from the toll plaza.A police officer privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, that while negotiating the turn, the truck lost balance and overturned. “In the process, it collided with a motorcycle and three cars. The motorcyclist was killed on the spot while the cars were heavily damaged. No other person was injured,” said the police official. The mishap triggered an immediate traffic jam, which was cleared in the next hour, he said.The truck driver escaped from the spot after the accident and efforts were on to arrest him, the police said, adding that a case had been registered against the driver under sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 304-A (death by negligence) and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code at Kherki Daula police station on Saturday. Last week, a 25-year-old police constable, who was deputed in the security branch at the office of deputy commissioner of police in Manesar, was killed after an unidentified vehicle had allegedly hit his motorcycle when he was returning home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/motorcyclist-killed-after-truck-overturns-near-kherki-daula-toll-plaza/story-Bxs3tMLtwLgQwrQcfxqd9N.html
19-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram police compiling a list of 770 proclaimed offenders, to arrest them in three months||Officials of the Gurugram Police are working on compiling a list of 770 proclaimed offenders in the district who are yet to be arrested. The police said they have formed teams and duties have been assigned to each of them to ensure they all the offenders are behind bars within the next three months.The teams are conducting investigation based on technical surveillance and keeping close watch on their close contacts and their movement. A weekly report will also be sent to the commissioner of police.KK Rao, who recently became the commissioner of police, said that the criminals, since end of March, have been mostly staying at home, thereby making it easier for the police to track them. “Other Indian states too have arrested a large number of most-wanted criminals, gangsters, bootleggers and gamblers during a massive campaign launched by their respective state police forces. These criminals were evading an arrest for a very long time. Even our state and the district have arrested 12 most-wanted and more than 300 proclaimed offenders and bail jumpers during the period of the lockdown,” he said.The Gurugam Police is working on a crime pattern assessment with the help of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA). The police said they are evaluating the movement of those criminals who were arrested in the last five years and a mapping is being conducted. Based on this mapping, raids will be planned.The police said after the lockdown was announced, there was extra deployment of forces across the district and a large number of checkpoints were set up. “Most of the criminals keep changing their hideouts but due to the Covid-19 pandemic, they are not moving much due to the fear of the infection. They are hiding in either in their own villages or in the places of their close aides. We are keeping an eye on suspected locations to ensure that they do not get chance to move out of their hideouts,” said Rao.“We have also intensified night patrolling and our informers have also been alerted. We have asked crime teams to activate their sources and to take inputs regarding these criminals on a daily basis. The cyber crime cell have also been asked to focus on technical surveillance,” said Rao.A list of hideouts will be prepared within the next seven days by all the crime teams and inputs will be taken from other investigation agencies. Once the mapping of the suspected hideouts is complete, raids will be conducted.Additionally, vehicles are being randomly checked at the borders. Any vehicle found to be suspicious is being scanned immediately, said Rao, adding that during lockdown, the maximum number of bootleggers were arrested.The police commissioner said they have decided to increase patrolling, vigilance and set up additional checkpoints to control petty crimes at the dark spots, following the crime-mapping exercise. The major crimes identified in the district were snatching , car-jacking, and robbing people on the pretext of offering them a lift.A total of 41 station house officers (SHOs) of various police stations across the city will submit their weekly report to the commissioner of police, highlighting the petty crimes in their areas and crime-prone spots in their jurisdiction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-police-compiling-a-list-of-770-proclaimed-offenders-to-arrest-them-in-three-months/story-dVZGeLqShnBoGqq9jPipzJ.html
19-07-2020||Gurugram||Caught dumping sewage, men assault civic body officials in Sector 70A||Three officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) were allegedly beaten by a group of people in Sector 70A on Saturday. The incident took place when the civic body officials had gone to take action against the group of men, who were allegedly illegally dumping sewage waste out in the open, said MCG officials on Sunday.MCG officials said the accused include a father-son duo. The son, who has been identified as Rahul, was caught dumping sewage waste from two tractors.Officials said that while the MCG team was apprising him of the violation and the penalties for illegal dumping of waste, he slapped one of the civic body’s junior engineers and subsequently called around 30 more men, including his father, who arrived at the spot and started attacking the MCG team with bricks and sticks. They even held the officials captive for a short duration but soon fled the spot with their tractors., said officials. The three MCG junior engineers suffered minor injuries in the incident, confirmed Amit Sandilya, executive engineer of MCG, who filed a police complaint at the Badshahpur police station on Saturday. “We received information from local residents that a few men were illegally dumping sewage waste in the open. An MCG team visited the spot and found some people engaging in the illegal activity. When we tried to argue with them, they turned violent and started attacking our team members. We have registered a case in the matter and the police have initiated their investigation,” said Sandilya.Inspector Deepak Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Badshahpur police station said that the “MCG officials have identified two or three people among the group while the rest remain unidentified. Our investigation is underway. We are yet to make any arrest in the matter.”Two weeks ago, following a National Green Tribunal (NGT) direction, the directorate of urban local bodies (ULB) directed MCG to appoint teams and conduct on-spot surveys for checking illegal dumping of sewage by private tankers in residential areas. Subsequently, the civic body created teams and started sending them to different parts of the city for inspection.Earlier this week, the MCG had revised its fine for illegal sewage dumping, increasing it by as much as ten times. As per the MCG’s revised fine amount, a first-time violation would invite a penalty of ₹25,000 and if the same person is found repeating the violation, then he will have to pay a fine of ₹50,000. Prior to this revision, the fine for illegal sewage dumping was ₹5,000.If a person is unable to pay fine, then the civic body will impound the vehicles and the machinery of the violator used in the activity.According to MCG officials, illegal dumping of sewage is very common in the city, especially in the new sectors — 58-115 — where many residential areas are yet to be connected to the master sewerage lines of Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP). In January, last year, a Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) report stated that at least 80 million litres of untreated sewage is being dumped in stormwater drains across the city, choking up water bodies and drains, polluting the underground water table, and leading to waterlogging during the monsoon season. Incidentally, last month, two MCG officials were also beaten up by some locals during a stray animal capture drive in Sector 52.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/caught-dumping-sewage-men-assault-civic-body-officials-in-sector-70a/story-cmh67D8iNAlxTRFXwa9zBL.html

He further stated that in 2008, the Punjab and Haryana high court had allowed the filing of challan but the matter was kept in limbo for four years as after fresh delimitation, Bathinda Lok Sabha seat was de-reserved and the Badal family was eyeing the seat for 2009 general elections. They therefore started trading started with dera chief, said Jakhar.“Just three days before the 2012 assembly polls, the Akali-BJP government filed a fresh affidavit stating that the dera chief neither came to Salabatpura in May 2007 (where he dressed like the tenth master) nor participated in any function,” said the PPCC chief.He further said, “Sukhbir stage-managed the release of the dera head’s movie in 2015 and implemented his divisive agenda of 2007. Now on the directions of Sukhbir Badal, the dera chief has been pardoned by the temporal seat of Sikhs, to be withdrawn later.”JAKHAR’S COMMENTS, A BUNDLE OF LIES: CHEEMAReacting to the charges by Jakhar, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) called it a bundle of lies. Former minister Daljit Singh Cheema said that Jakhar was in such a hurry to mouth malicious lies against the SAD that he forgot to mention that it was the SAD- BJP government which sanctioned the prosecution of the dera head in the Salabatpura case for hurting the sentiments of the Sikh community.Cheema said not only was a case registered against the Dera head under Section 295 (A) and 298 for hurting religious sentiments but also under Section 153 (a) for provocation with intent to riot. “The case went up to the sessions court and is still pending in the Punjab and Haryana high court,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/action-against-dera-chief-by-akali-govt-in-2007-would-have-averted-sacrilege/story-rd27fmZaPrnyGKCIAUFi2H.html

They have also revised their list of major criminals active in the area.The decisions were taken during a review of the department by nodal police officer, Sanjay Sighal, additional director general, Railways.“The review is being done for all 75 districts in the state. We were required to evaluate them and share the findings with the state government. Apart from that, I interacted with the public as well; the response and perception to the commissionerate has been quite positive,” said Singhal.He said that the department will continue to take action against known criminals, gangsters and organised crime.“Top 10 criminals of the district have been identified, along with top 10 criminals in each police station’s jurisdiction. I visited Knowledge Park and Badalpur stations to review the process as well and to analyse if there are any short comings and whether proper procedures were being followed or not,” said Singhal.To combat organised crime, the department has been attaching the assets of known criminals.The nodal officer said that they were also focused on ensuring that there is proper enforcement of guidelines during the pandemic, especially in containment zones, as the police work to ensure that regulations related to wearing masks, social distancing, and thorough implementation of night curfew.“We are also focusing on women and children safety and working on improving prosecution. There have been certain delays in the past three months and the slack will now be picked up gradually,” said the nodal officer.He reviewed the progress of ongoing cases, their investigations and trial progress, etc.A senior police officer said there was a specific agenda to the two-day meeting but in addition, there was focus on postings of police personnel in the district along with public sensitisation.“Going forward, we will also crack down on mafias and organised crime while improving women safety and the prosecution dealings, while ensuring that there is thorough policing in containment zones,” said the senior officer, asking not to be named.The officer quoted above also said that the top criminals in the district have been identified and with action against them, the list will keep revising. However, the department is not revealing the names of the top criminals just yet.According to Sriparna Gangoulee, joint commissioner of police, crime, “We have identified these criminals who are a mix of mafia and regular crime. But we will not reveal their names. The work done against organised crime has been appreciated and we will continue to do so. The dispute resolution centre in Knowledge Park has also been appreciated. Other than that, no specific inputs have been given.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/organised-crime-women-s-safety-priorities-in-noida-police-review/story-NuS3kRr20CvEHgc1jW5paM.html
19-07-2020||City||GB Nagar achieves over 100% of Covid samples target for three consecutive days||NOIDA: The Gautam Budh Nagar achieved over 100% of its target of collecting 3,000 samples for Covid-19 test a day for the third consecutive day on Sunday during the four-day surveillance drive. Aimed to check the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the district administration has started camps for testing of general public through rapid antigen kits at five different locations every day in the district from Friday.During the three-day period, a total of 9,585 samples were tested through rapid antigen kits, of which 145 were found positive for the virus, district administration officials said. “On the first day of this drive, the district achieved over 100% of its target as 3,020 persons were tested through rapid antigen kits, of which 46 were reported positive. Similarly, on Saturday, 3,365 persons were tested, of which 57 were found positive. And, on Sunday, samples of over 3,200 people were taken, of which 42 have tested positive,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, GB Nagar.Enthused with the active participation of the general people in the drive, Suhas said that it is being considered to continue the drive in the other localities also. “Now, it is open for the general public. Even those who don’t have any specific symptom of Covid-19 can also be tested at these public camps,” he said.The DM further said that apart from testing through rapid antigen kits, over 1,600 persons have been tested through lab-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Of 1,600 people, 513 were tested on Friday, 793 on Saturday and 345 on Sunday. “Their results will come in a day or two,” he said.Suhas said that a requisition of 100,000 rapid antigen kits for the month of July had been sent to the state government. “We have so far received around 25,000 kits. Since there is no dearth of testing kits and beds in the district, all the officials have been asked to intensify the testing across the district. Now, the trend indicates that the rise of cases in the district is going on a consistent graph, which is a very encouraging sign,” he said.Experts feel that intensified surveillance has brought many positive indications for the residents of GB Nagar. Dr Gyanendra Kumar, officer on special duty (OSD) to state government and professor at Jhansi medical college, said that the results of these camps have made clear that positivity rate in the district is low. “The number of active cases is almost the same for the past 15 days and even the casualty is not only due to Covid-19.

19-07-2020||City||Noida likely to receive more rains in next three days||Noida: Noida city, in one of the most rain deprived districts of Uttar Pradesh – Gautam Budh Nagar – saw moderate rains Sunday morning, with an estimated rainfall of 50.7mm, which the weather department expects to continue for the next three to four days.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), between 5.30am and 8.30am, Greater Noida experienced an estimated 21.2mm rainfall while Ghaziabad experienced 6.3mm rainfall. Weather analysts predict light rains on Monday as well.Rainfall below 15mm is considered light, between 15-64.5mm moderate, and above 64.5mm is considered heavy.Weather analysts have asserted that the monsoon line of trough – a low-pressure line that oscillates around Delhi and brings rains to the region – is now passing through the national capital and is expected to remain here for the next three to four days, leading to moderate to heavy rains across the NCR, including Noida and Ghaziabad.“For the next four days, the monsoon trough line will oscillate around NCR so we can expect light to moderate rainfall for the next three to four days over large pockets of the region. There are chances of moderate to heavy rainfall late Monday night to Tuesday morning,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.Meanwhile, certain parts of the city saw water logging due to the rains, however, no major snarls were seen as the district was under the weekend lockdown, imposed by the state to curb the spread of Covid-19. Photos, however, were circulated on social media of a water-logged police post in Dadri on Sunday afternoon, wherein a policeman was seen removing water from within the structure using a bucket.“We have instructed the Dadri police station to review the situation and put in a request for any necessary requirement to improve infrastructure,” said additional deputy commissioner, zone 3, Vishal Pandey.According to IMD records, Gautam Budh Nagar is one of the most rainfall deprived districts of the state. So far, since June 1, Noida has seen about 94% and Ghaziabad has seen 73% deficit, while western Uttar Pradesh saw only 36% deficit till date. The records state that while Gautam Budh Nagar district should have received 160.1mm rainfall, it has only received 10mm so far and while Ghaziabad should have received 160.1mm seasonal rains, it received 43.3mm as of July 19. Uttar Pradesh has however seen an overall surplus rainfall of 7%, with actual 274.5mm rainfall received till date against expected 257.2 mm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-likely-to-receive-more-rains-in-next-three-days/story-FUJq1FTpX5489a1LxIZDzI.html

19-07-2020||City||Noida: Woman attempts to end life at police commissioner’s office||Noida: A 33-year-old woman allegedly tried to take her own life outside the police commissioner’s officer in Sector 108 on Saturday. She is currently undergoing treatment at a private hospital, the police said.The incident was reported around 2pm when the woman tried to get inside the office to meet senior police officials when a review meeting was going on. However, she was refused entry and then she tried to take her own life by hanging from the grille of a window outside the building, the police said. But police personnel at the spot intervened and she was taken to Yatharth hospital in Sector 110.“She is doing fine now, though she has some anxiety,” said Dr Ankur Dass, medical superintendent, Yatharth hospital.A family member said that the woman was under pressure after she had been booked by the Phase 3 police allegedly in a false case.“Our property has been grabbed by a man and we are fighting that case in the court. In February this year, she was sent to jail in a shooting case for no fault of hers. She was just trying to meet police officers yesterday. But she was not allowed to plead her case and took this step in frustration,” said the relative on Sunday.Police officials said that the property dispute case is going on in the Allahabad High Court.“The man, Satish Mittal, had been shot at a day after he had returned from Allahabad. He had identified the woman and her family in the shooting after which they had been arrested. However, we have called for an investigation in the case once more,” said Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Zone 2.The officials said that the woman had also attempted to take her life earlier this year outside the district magistrate’s office.Gautam Budh Nagar does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in Delhi are 9582208181 (SNEHI) and 011-23389090 (SUMAITRI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-woman-attempts-to-end-life-at-police-commissioner-s-office/story-FoVnN8ItLOO4jYM09ozF3O.html
19-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Amid rising cases, administration moots micro-level containment plan||For the first time, the number of category-2 containment zones with two or more Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad has exceeded that of category-1 containment zones that have just one case, a fallout of the surge in cases. The Ghaziabad administration has directed officials to chalk out ‘micro level management plan’ for containment exercise under which all the aspects of strict containment, surveillance and testing will be taken up in certain residential pockets in order to break the chain of infection.According to Uttar Pradesh government guidelines, category-1 containment zones are created in pockets with only one Covid-19 case, and the sealed areas are spread over a radius of 250 metres. On the other hand, the category-2 zones are created where more than one case is reported from a pocket, and an area spread over a 500-metre radius is sealed with a buffer area going up to a 250-metre radius.According to the official figures on July 19, the district at present has 330 containment zones which include 162 under category-1 and 168 under category-2. According to officials, there are certain residential segments which are running high on number of Covid-19 cases and regular cases have emerged.“This is why we are chalking out the micro plan through which there will be strict containment exercises which will be taken up in containment zones where cases have figured regularly. Before implementing the plan in residential pockets, we have designated a nodal officer who will supervise the timely sealing and de-sealing of containment zones,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “We have already improved systems with respect to testing, contact tracing, speedier referral and treatment. Now, we are going to deal with containment zones in strict manner.”The officials said that under the micro plan, identified residential pockets will be subjected to strict containment exercise like previously done in Khoda, Loni and Vaishali.“We have planned that once the area gets contained we will take up 100% surveillance exercise of every household and also get 100% testing done in the residential pocket. We will also make available private vendors for sanitization purpose and these can be hired by residents for household sanitization. Our teams will take up outer santisation and may also sanitize common areas in highrises. Along with these exercises, we will also rope in the district supplies department for door to door delivery of food items,” Pandey said.According to the official list of 330 containment zones, the Sihani Gate police station area has 65 zones (33 under category-1 and 32 under category-2) and followed by Indirapuram police station area having 53 zones (18 under category-1 and 35 under category-2) while the Vijay Nagar police station area is third highest on the list with presence of 47 zones (29 under category-1 and 18 under category-2).The micro plan would means that residential pockets in police station areas of Sihani Gate, Vijay Nagar, Indirapuram, Sahibabad and Kavi Nagar, etc. may be subjected to rigourous containment exercise in order to control further spread of infection.Along with the containment exercises, the administration has also planned that recommendations of the Ministry of AYUSH will also be publicised widely so that residents can take help of immunity boosters to prevent against the infection.Box:Total category-1 containment zones: 162Total category-2 containment zones: 168Top five of 18 police station areas with containment zonesPolice station category-1 category-2Sihani Gate 33 32Indirapuram 18 35Vijay Nagar 29 18Sahibabad 08 25Kavi Nagar 16 18||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-amid-rising-cases-administration-moots-micro-level-containment-plan/story-mzr9lqQUdEun2X8bj2C5DO.html
19-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad: In 23 days, antigen kits account for half of Covid-19 tests||In just 23 days, more tests have been conducted using the antigen test kits than the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, considered to be the gold standard in testing for the Sars-CoV-2 virus, in Ghaziabad. According to the official records, the Ghaziabad district till July 18 has performed 64,755 tests, of which 32,325 (49.91%) were under antigen tests, 31,436 under RT-PCR (48.54%) and 994 (1.53%) through TrueNat machines. With total cases at 3,902 in the district, the total positivity rate (TPR, the total number of positives per test expressed as a percentage) was 6.02%. With 848 people testing positive under antigen tests, their share is just over a fifth of all positive cases.Antigen tests are inherently unreliable with very poor sensitivity, which means its ability to detect true positives is low and could result in many negative tests turning positive under an RT-PCR test. Despite this, its share is high because of two advantages: point of care testing and no need of taking it to a laboratory, and that it gives a result within 30 minutes, as compared to the two days it would take an RT-PCR test.“It is vital that if a person tests negative under antigen testing, their supplementary test should be conducted through RT-PCR which has higher sensitivity,” said Dr. Lalit Kant, former epidemiology and communicable diseases head at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). “The antigen tests should be conducted ideally from the fifth to eighth day of a person developing symptoms. Any earlier, then there are chances that test may miss it and the person may spread the infection.”According to ICMR guidelines, only those who show symptoms after their antigen test need be tested again.Officially, of the 31,477 people who tested negative under the antigen test, 5086 were re-tested under RT-PCR tests and 405 samples came positive, a TPR of nearly 8%. Since its first introduction in the district on June 26, a fresh lot of 24,000 antigen kits will now be deployed in different areas, including the containment zones, for speedy tests.“The antigen kits will now be used widely in containment zones and also in other areas having high risk groups. Its use has lead to speedy results which have helped us in immediate identification, faster referral of patients and even speedier contact tracing of positive cases. We have planned that more focus will be on use of antigen kits and planning to conduct about 3000-3500 tests per day,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.In Ghaziabad, July 18 marked 136 days since the positive Covid-19 case was reported. In March, the case positivity rate stood at 3.36% out of total 149 samples and five positive patients. By April 30, the positivity rate stood at 2.29% with total 2878 samples and 66 positive cases. The rate went up to 3.05% with total 9984 samples and 305 total positive cases on May 31.By June 30, the total sampling went up to about 20690 with total 1615 cases and positivity rate of about 7.8%. The present positivity rate is about 6.07% with 3902 cases out of total sampling of 64,755 till July 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-in-23-days-antigen-kits-account-for-half-of-covid-19-tests/story-xOx72emOcQn9OpsHzfslgL.html

It will take us a month and a half to finalise a successful bidder. The work will start after we get the requisite approvals from the Union government once an agency is finalised,” said managing director of NMRC, Ritu Maheshwari, who is also the chief executive officer of Noida authority.The NMRC had started the process of inviting the bids for this elevated 14.95-km long Metro link on June 9, 2020. The corporation had said it did not want the coronavirus disease pandemic to delay the work on this ambitious project that will provide connectivity to newly built housing societies of Noida and Greater Noida West (also known as Noida Extension).The first phase of the corridor which will be 9.15-km long will have five Metro stations—Sector 122, Sector 123, Greater Noida Sector 4, Ecotech-12, and Greater Noida Sector 2. This phase is scheduled to be completed in 2022. The second phase, which will be 5.8km long, will have four Metro stations—Greater Noida Sector 3, Greater Noida Sector 10, Greater Noida Sector 12, and Knowledge Park 5.The NMRC wants to start working the construction of Metro stations under the first phase and the via-duct of this portion and has laid down a budget of ₹430 crore for the same.Earlier this year in January, the NMRC had started the survey for testing of soil, topography and geography for the Metro Link which is set to branch out from the existing 29.707km Aqua Line, which started running in January 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/nmrc-to-soon-finalise-agency-for-construction-of-aqua-line-extension/story-JWVysm05ZSHCYecyjtrCEK.html

19-07-2020||Mumbai||With all eyes on Dharavi, BMC forgot about K-East ward: Locals||With the entire focus on Dharavi and Sion-Koliwada, Andheri (East), Marol, Vile Parle (East) and Jogeshwari (East) have not got the required attention to curb the spread of Covid-19, which is to blame for the surge, residents have alleged.The K-East ward, which has 70% slums, tops the list of civic wards in terms of cumulative Covid-19 cases and deaths in the city. Since the outbreak in March till July 18, the ward has recorded 6,543 cases and 416 deaths. During the same period, the total number of cases in G-North ward comprising Dharavi and Dadar is 5,954, while it is 3,988 in Sion-Koliwada.From the start of the outbreak until May, the civic ward did not figure among the top 10 Covid-19 hot spots. On June 1, the ward had reported 2,402 cases, but by June-end, it surpassed the accumulated number of Covid-19 cases reported at G-North ward that covers Dadar and Dharavi. On June 30, K-East ward recorded 5,301 cases, as against 4,913 cases in G-North. The infection rate at the ward is growing at 1.1% and a doubling rate of 62 days to become the only ward to cross the 6,500 mark. The slum pockets in the ward have become a hotbed of the pandemic. “All attention was paid to Dharavi and Koliwada, but the civic body took the slums in Andheri East and Govandi for granted,” said activist and lawyer Godfrey Pimenta, a Marol resident. “Despite the lockdown, people were roaming freely and didn’t maintain social distancing. I had written to the civic body, but nobody paid heed.”The ward has 41 containment zones with 716 sealed buildings. Some areas in the ward that have reported the highest number of cases include Marol Pipeline, Mograpada, Indira Nagar, Hanuman Nagar, Meghwadi, Shiv Tekdi, Saraswati Chawl, Malpadongri, Kondivita and Shastri Nagar. “The ward not only has the highest number of cases, but also fatality rate. Considering almost 70% of the area comprises slums, the civic body should have been more cautious. It’s only due to early detection that Dharavi is reporting the least number of daily cases,” said Dr Mohan Desai, a local general physician. Despite repeated calls, Prashant Sapkale, assistant municipal commissioner of K-E ward, didn’t respond. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, said the civic body has started ‘Saving Lives’ strategy to reduce the fatality rate. “We have been able to control the doubling rate. At present, the ward has around 1,400 active cases. The situation will improve in one to two weeks,” he said. While G-North has 1,488 active cases, Sion-Koliwada has 675.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/with-all-eyes-on-dharavi-bmc-forgot-about-k-east-ward-locals/story-bIj4ZwY8YvMZ4QKwAYhJzO.html
19-07-2020||Mumbai||Redevelopment projects derailed by Covid-19?||The Covid-19 pandemic is likely to have derailed the redevelopment process of old and dilapidated buildings in the city. There are nearly 40,000 such buildings in the city housing lakhs of citizens.Builders are wary of taking up these projects due to a range of reasons including liquidity crises, high premiums, lack of manpower as well as negative sentiments in the realty sector.“Forget new ones, we are worried about executing our existing ongoing projects. We are facing acute shortage of funds and also don’t have labour to carry out work at construction sites,” said Harrish Jain, vice-president of Brihanmumbai Developers Association.He added, “Builders are not in a position to take up any new projects; many may even exit current negotiations which have been going on since before Covid-19 lockdown.”Ashok Mohanani, chairman of Ekta World, a group specialising in redevelopment projects for affordable and luxury segment in Mumbai, said it is unviable to take up new projects in the current circumstances. “It is impossible to take up projects if the government continues to charge us such high premiums and taxes,” said Mohanani. “Even the banks are not supporting us in these difficult times. In such circumstances, how can we execute any project,” he said.For years, builders used to secure developmental rights of old buildings, wherein they would construct new building in the plot have and give existing tenants bigger apartments for free, while selling the other apartments at market price.Even tenants who have given developmental rights to builders are in a fix. “There is fear among residents that they may end up on streets if builders fail to execute the project. Hence, many are deferring redevelopment plans,” said Ramesh Prabhu, chairman of Maharashtra Societies Welfare Association. State housing minister Jitendra Awhad agrees that these are hard times but added that the government is committed to ease the solution. “We are planning to reduce premiums in the coming days. To speed up projects, we will now fix deadlines where permissions have to be given within a fixed period,” said Awhad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/redevelopment-projects-derailed-by-covid-19/story-J73rLVkhHp7nB9CyD0Ok0M.html
19-07-2020||Mumbai||Testing times for lecturers as e-classes used for trolling||Online classes are posing as much of a challenge to teachers as students, with many educators complaining that they are unable to have disciplined classes.Weeks after the management of St Xavier’s College in Dhobi Talao suspended three Class 12 students for sharing their online class IDs with outsiders, who, in turn, abused the teacher during a class, a large number of teachers are complaining about similar problems.A handful of colleges have already started lectures for Class 12 as well as second and third-year degree courses, and teachers are finding it difficult to handle students, most of whom keep their videos and audios off during class, leaving the teacher unsure of their presence during the lecture.“The rule is that only the teacher gets to talk during the class, while students can ask questions in a chat window, or at the end of the class. The problem is that at any given point, I’m unsure of the students’ presence because the screens are mostly blank. There’s no way of finding out if the students are present or not,” said Archana Sachdeva, a visiting faculty at a host of suburban colleges.Several colleges are using free video chat apps to conduct lectures, and many teachers believe it is the reason security cannot be upgraded for online classes.“The paid apps are for around 90-100 people per class, but our junior college classes have anywhere between 100-120 students, so we will end up paying for two classes per lecture, which is not feasible. At present, we are trying to plug the loopholes with the help of our information technology team,” said Rajendra Shinde, principal of St Xavier’s College. He added that while a first information report (FIR) has not been registered against the perpetrators, the incident has been shared with the deputy commissioner of police, cyber crime cell.Recently, a senior professor from a Delhi-based university took to social media to share his experience of conducting an online class, in which he faced constant abuse and was made fun of by some users. His post went viral within hours, and teachers affiliated with Mumbai colleges shared similar problems faced by them during online classes.While regular lectures as per a timetable are yet to begin, many colleges have started conducting classes online to ease teachers and students into the process. This insistence on starting online classes, however, has not gone down well with many teachers.“None of the colleges have thought things through, and have dived into the online class bandwagon without considering security protocols and precautions for teachers as well as students. In some cases, the colleges have not even bothered to check if teachers or students have access to good internet, and still, classes have started,” said a lecturer of a prominent south Mumbai college, on condition of anonymity.As of now, the Maharashtra Federation of University and College Teachers’ Organisation (MFUCTO) has not received official complaints from their members, but the problem is real, said the spokesperson. “Classes have commenced due to the compulsion laid down by colleges, and teachers are bearing the brunt. To date, not a single notification to start classes has been released by the University of Mumbai (MU) or state government. On what basis then, have classes begun,” asked Tapati Mukhopadhyay, president, MFUCTO.She added that amidst confusion on the status of exams for final-year students, no notification has been released by universities to the colleges. “What’s worse is that colleges have started lectures without waiting to find out about the syllabus. Since the 2020-21 academic year is being reduced to seven months instead of nine or 10, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has clarified that the curriculum will have to be compressed. Yet, some colleges have started lectures,” she added.As of now, state universities have asked their affiliated colleges to promote all students, except those in the final year, but no clarity on commencement of regular academics has been shared yet.“We still request colleges to call off classes until further clarity from the government,” added Mukhopadhyay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/testing-times-for-lecturers-as-e-classes-used-for-trolling/story-jAp4OYgnjCZgHs7x1cibcN.html
19-07-2020||Mumbai||IIT-B develops ultra-thin optical sensor for wearable electronics||A team of researchers from Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) developed an ultra-thin next-generation optical sensor prototype that can be used for applications such as bioimaging, wearable electronics, environmental monitoring, defence and telecommunications.Optical sensors, such as photodetectors, can convert rays of light into electronic signals. These sensors are used as optical switches in telecommunication, for capturing images in defence and biomedical equipment, as toxic gas monitors for pollution control, as well as photovoltaic cells for renewable power generation. However, conventional optical sensors currently in use are made from thick silicon or III-V compound semiconductors which make them power hungry. Hence, they are difficult to use in emerging applications such as wearable devices, flexible electronics, and multi-sensor networks for the internet-of-things (IoT). The researchers at IIT-B, led by Saurabh Lodha, professor, department of electrical engineering, designed a prototype of ultra-thin optical sensors using graphene-like two-dimensional (2D) materials that has high optical sensitivity and can also generate power. The prototype overcomes the limitations of conventional optical sensors owing to the exceptional electronic, mechanical, and optical properties of these 2D materials. Their study was published in the American Chemical Society’s monthly peer-reviewed journal Nano Letters in February. “We conductedseveral rounds of theoretical calculations before we started work on the prototype. The thickness of the materials was critical. We found that two specific materials from the graphene family, when stacked on top of each other with the right thicknesses, form a heterojunction that results in excellent optoelectronic performance and enables broadband light detection from visible to infra-red, which is not possible with the individual materials,” said Lodha, the principal investigator of the project.“The recent work from IIT-B is of great interest to the device community; it is expected to give a new direction to this field because it exploits the light sensing and energy harvesting potential at the junction of two dissimilar 2D materials which are just a few atomic layers thin. We call it “interlayer band gap” and, to my knowledge, no one has investigated or reported it earlier to show promising solar cell behaviour and ultrafast photodetectors,” said Digbijoy Nath, assistant professor, Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, who was not a part of the research. The theoretical calculations were conducted at IIT-B with inputs from Monash University, Australia, and the prototype was fabricated at IIT-B’s Nanofabrication Facility. Key theoretical predictions of the sensors were experimentally verified in collaboration with the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, said Abin Varghese, PhD student and first author of the study.“Most of the research on photodetection using low-dimensional materials focusses on enhancing one or two performance parameters, typically at the expense of other metrics. However, it is the multi-functional excellence of this heterostructure platform that makes it promising and brings us a step closer to the real-world technologies”, said Lodha. “In the future, we plan to take this work forward from lab-to-fab using wafer-scale material growth techniques. Then, we plan to integrate optical, gas and thermal sensors to build an energy-efficient IoT sensor network,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iit-b-develops-ultra-thin-optical-sensor-for-wearable-electronics/story-t91EabeaS902wOPypU1lqI.html
19-07-2020||City||DU runs out of paper to print degrees, student moves HC||New Delhi: A psychology student who graduated from Delhi University in 2017 approached Delhi High Court on July 6, citing that the university was yet to issue him his postgraduate degree due to which he could not pursue a degree in King’s College, London.Dhritiman Ray, 25, a freelance mental health practitioner, said, “The institute wanted a degree with conferral date — the date on which the degree is officially awarded. It was not there on the special certificate which was given to me by DU in December 2019 when I approached the officials to get my degree. The degrees are never awarded in the same year and often take around two years to come,” he said.Ray said response submitted by the varsity in the court left many surprised. As per court documents, DU submitted “that the reason for non-issuance of the degree certificate is lack of proper quality paper and that the contract with the printer has also expired”.“The contract with the printer engaged by Delhi University came to an end and the same had to be re-tendered. Owing to the lockdown situation, there were very few bids received for the tender which delayed the process. However, the tender for the printer is being finalized shortly,” the university had submitted in the court on July 7.Dean (Exams) Vinay Gupta said the finalisation of tender is in final phase and the university expects to wrap up the work before July 31 – when the next hearing is scheduled. “Besides, data from the colleges came in late in around December 2019 and we got further delayed due to the lockdown. We expect the matter to get resolved in a couple of weeks,” he said.“The non-availability of paper and printing facilities cannot be a justifiable cause especially when the careers and educational prospects of students are at stake,” the high court had noted on July 7, asking the varsity to streamline the process of issuing degree certificates and file an affidavit in the matter in four weeks.Ray, pursued postgraduate degree in Psychology from Zakir Hussain’s college, is now hoping to pursue his higher education from University of Glasgow in Scotland.“Following the court’s intervention, the university on July 9 gave me a degree certificate wherein my name and other details are handwritten. While Glasgow might make some exceptions owing to the pandemic, I might not be able to use the same in later stages of life. So I have asked the varsity to present me a formal degree with the regular security features as well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/student-moves-hc-against-du-seeking-pg-degree/story-4SQSVCGr6j2qHPAblJDQaP.html
19-07-2020||City||This year, Ludhiana residents prefer ‘desi’ rakhis over Chinese ones||After the traders’ body Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) issued an appeal to boycott Chinese rakhis, ahead of the Raksha Bandhan festival next month, local residents are preferring Made in India rakhis over Chinese ones. From the past many years, rakhi imported from China has been ruling the market due to its looks, varieties and cheap cost. It is considered to be the biggest wholesale and retail market for festive items.A wholesale trader in Gurmandi Sumit Jain said that even traders are not interested in selling any Chinese products. “Buyers are looking for India-made rakhi even though they are sold at a much higher price. Many people are coming to stores and asking for Indian rakhis,” said Sumit.Mainly, rakhis are manufactured in Kolkata and Ambala, but over the years Chinese rakhis, particularly the ones with cartoon characters and electronic bands, had swept the market.The estimated business of China-made rakhis was over ₹1 crore.“This year, there is no demand for Chinese rakhis. This inclination towards local rakhi may be due to the ongoing stand-off between Indian and Chinese troops at the Galwan Valley. After so many years, we have witnessed that people are preferring to buy local rakhis. If such sentiment prevails in other festivals as well then it would be boon for the local industry,” said Rajinder Singh, a local dealer.Divya Jain, a resident of Sunder Nagar said that earlier she used to purchase Chinese rakhi but this time she decided to boycott Made in China products.Sanjiv Sharma, a resident of Sarabha Nagar, said, “After witnessing the India-China tensions at the border we have decided not to buy Chinese products. Further, Raksha Bandhan is purely a ‘Hindustani festival’ so at no point in buying Chinese products for the occasion. We are encouraging our children to buy Indian products as much as possible.”Recently, the Confederation of All India Traders had issued an appeal to boycott Chinese rakhis. The CAIT, which has 40,000 trade associations has called for the boycott of Chinese products, the move which may cause a dent to China’s estimated ₹4,000 crore of trade during the festival, said Badish Jindal, president of Federation of Punjab Small Industries Associations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/this-year-ludhiana-residents-prefer-desi-rakhis-over-chinese-ones/story-kc8XHcjpIlRZKa4HJj5FNJ.html

19-07-2020||City||Basmati growers expect turnaround as exporters flush with orders||Chandigarh The cultivation of premium-quality basmati in Punjab has touched 14 lakh acre this season, surpassing last year’s 13 lakh acre. The turnaround has been possible as basmati exporters are flush with orders from North America, European Union (EU) and the West Asia. The order book is full as importing countries from North America, EU and the West Asia want to stock up, in view of the covid-19 pandemic, and also because the state’s farmers have learnt from 2018, after the EU and Saudi Arabia rejected their basmati produce, following detection of traces of a fungicide, tricyclazole.This season, however, both the industry as well as government is optimistic. “Due to the covid19 pandemic, the importing countries are building (basmati) stocks. Our farmers have also checked use of pesticides and fungicides which has made our crop acceptable worldwide. Farmers will fetch a good price for their crop,” said Ashok Sethi, director, Basmati Exporters Association, Punjab. Top officials in state agricultural directorate say the total area under basmati would cross 18 lakh acre as the last date for sowing is July 31.EXPORTS BANKING ON 10% HIKEBasmati exporters target a total sale of Rs 36,000 crore, post-harvest that will begin in October-November, expecting an increase of 10-12% over the previous year. “India exports 40 lakh tonne annually. From Punjab, at least 20 lakh tonne is exported as rice from the border belt in Tarn Taran, Amritsar and Gurdaspur is preferred in importing countries,” said Sethi, adding that 23-24 lakh tonne could be exported this year from the state. Till 2018, Iran was a major importer seeking at least 14 lakh tonne annually. Last year, however, India became party to trade sanctions imposed by the US on Iran, leading to stopping of basmati imports. Now, there is no direct trade, with Iran expected to buy from traders based in Dubai who get imports from India.“Basmati growers in Punjab are expected to make good profits this kharif season as prices of produce are expected to touch Rs 3,500,” said Punjab agriculture secretary, Kahan Singh Pannu. The orders are for 1121 and 1718 basmati varieties. Basmati is grown in all 22 districts with Amritsar topping the chart with the crop grown over 3.5 lakh acre; Tarn Taran (2.2 lakh acre); Muktsar (1.7 lakh acre), Sangrur (1.3 lakh acres) and Fazilka (1.2 lakh acre). Cultivation of aromatic variety rice in Gurdaspur is slow, with only half an acre under it by Saturday; the district generally grows basmati on large tracts. This year, the cultivation of aromatic grain is expected is expected to touch a high of five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/basmati-growers-expect-turnaround-as-exporters-flush-with-orders/story-fmVK122ovgRbpuuU2MewZP.html
19-07-2020||City||Important to pay attention to quality of masks that you wear||With Covid-19 showing no signs of abating, our cloth masks are here to stay. These masks have in fact now become part of our daily wear and we are constrained to purchase more of them or make them at home in order to protect ourselves.That’s not all. Given the rapid spread of the disease, we also need to pay much more attention to the quality of these cloth masks and their design and fit, so as to ensure maximum protection from the deadly virus. Fortunately , several recent studies have measured the filtration efficiencies of different kinds of fabrics for use in masks and we need to take note of them to wear what is in our best interest.I would like to quote in this context, a study published in April this year in the American Chemical Society Journal (ACS Nano), that gives good advice on how to improve the filtration efficiency of your cloth mask. Titled “Aerosol filtration efficiency of common fabrics used in respiratory cloth masks” the study has looked at 15 different kinds of fabrics and made some extremely important recommendations for improving the effectiveness of cloth face masks. For example, the study points out that the filtration efficiency of a fabric varies on the basis of its thread count. Cotton, for example, performs much better as a material for mask, at higher weave densities or thread count. A 600 TPI (threads per inch) cotton, for example, was found to be far more effective than 80 TPI cotton. So the study recommends that fabrics that are porous should be avoided and those with tight weaves and low porosity, such as those found in cotton sheets with high thread count, should be used for making the mask.Secondly, the study points out that more layers of fabric provide better protection than a single layer. For example, while two layers of natural silk offered 65 per cent filtration efficiency, four layers gave 86 per cent efficiency. Similarly one layer of chiffon gave 67 per cent filtration efficiency, while two layers gave, 83 per cent. The efficiency of one layer of 600 TPI cotton was 79 per cent, while that of two layers , 82 per cent.Third, the study found that by combining different kinds of fabrics and leveraging their mechanical and electrostatic filtering properties, the mask could be made even more effective. For example, a hybrid cloth mask made of one layer of high thread count cotton and two layers of natural silk or chiffon , could be very effective. While such hybrids of cotton and chiffon showed a filtration efficiency of as much as 97 per cent, that with cotton and silk, 94 per cent.The study also emphasized the importance of ensuring that the mask is so designed as to fit the consumer snugly, particularly around the nose and the mouth. In fact the study showed that improper fit and leakages could well reduce the filtration efficiency of masks by over 50- 60 per cent. So consumers would do well to keep these things in mind when they purchase or make their own mask and wear them..We are all aware that N-99 and N-95 masks offer the best protection (the numbers 95 and 99 represent the percentage of filtration efficiency of the mask) and most of them are also so designed as to fit snugly around the nose and the mouth, but they are reserved for those in the health sector. On the other hand, several studies evaluating different kinds of masks have ranked the home-made single layer mask that most of us wear, as the poor cousin. And if the fit is not good, then the protection that they offer is even lower. But that need not be so. With the use of right material and design, the fabric masks can be as good as the best, and consumers must make the effort to ensure that.--||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/important-to-pay-attention-to-details-of-masks-that-you-wear/story-EeZp5t2vVbrWiDVPCVdxJJ.html

I request you to approach sponsors and raise more money for the members,” Pandey said. “Instead, you (Batra) are writing so many emails against IOA itself and pushing away even the existing sponsors.”Raising objections over Batra’s directives that the internal audit report of IOA should be submitted directly to him, Pandey said as the treasurer of IOAit was his duty to look after finance and audit function and give necessary instructions. ...”In case the internal auditor does not follow this procedure, I will have to recommend his removal to the executive council.”“IOA has to ask for his membership number of chartered accountants institute and UDIN number before we accept his report. I am aware that the internal auditor is also auditor of Hockey India and you appointed him as he was known to you personally,” he said. “I request you that IOA has a very good procedure for making payments and is absolutely a good and clean organization. Your letters are giving the wrong impression and are against the interest of IOA. Please be responsible. Otherwise, IOA will be in serious trouble only because the president is writing against IOA,” Pandey said, levelling the allegation of payment of Rs 13 crore without Batra’s approval as baseless. “Each and every payment of IOA has been made in transparent manner as per the constitution and well established procedures of IOA. “I never objected to your spending more than Rs 1.2 crore on the visit of IOC president to India. This amount included huge payment of more than 50 lacs to Lalit Hotel where you are a director without any tender.”“Our public relation exercise was good and you as IOA president were successful after this function to become IOC member. Now that you are IOC member please be helpful to the members rather than behaving like a ‘Big Boss’ with no sympathy or feelings for the difficulties of members.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/ioa-s-treasurer-wants-batra-to-give-financial-support-to-nsfs-soas/story-8karfr3Wn5R1qyVeHd0PBM.html

19-07-2020||City||Shrimp farmers want transport from govt to stay afloat||Bathinda In an uncertain market environment for shrimp, aquaculturists in the state want the state government to help ensure transport of their export-oriented crop to key shipping destinations in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, amid the pandemic to set-off some of the losses. This year, the output is expected to come down to half of the 800 tonne that the state produced from 350 acre, due to issues with seed availability etc. The crop is harvested up to October and is sown April onwards. Lakhwinder Singh, a farmer from Ratta Khera village in Muktsar, said, “I have seven-acre land under aquaculture, but this time it is a poor production season. Farmers will struggle to recover even the cost of Rs 4 lakh invested in one acre. As there is no respite in covid-19, it is also doubtful if buyers from coastal regions will send their trucks to Punjab. As the aqua-crop will be harvested in October, an assurance by the state government of transportation to processing units will save from financial disaster,” he said.He added to minimise losses, he has scaled down his five-year-old year initiative of shrimp farming by putting 1 lakh seeds in a 1.5-acre area that was half in comparison to 2019.Dr Meera D Ansal, department of Aquaculture College of Fisheries, Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU), Ludhiana, said shrimp farming was a risky venture in today’s times. “Root stocking of shrimp is imported from the US. Due to the pandemic, international consignments got delayed. Due to non-availability of seeds in Punjab and Haryana, shrimp cultivation began after June 15, a delay of over three months. US and China are main importers of Indian shrimp and farmers have doubts over smooth exports this year, shrimp should be promoted for consumption in the Indian market,” she said, adding the situation could give good return if the situation improved. Experts say the aquaculture has turned a boon for the farmers of south Malwa region since it was introduced in 2016 in the area where land was not usable for conventional crops due to high salinity level and water-logging.About 4,000 kg of shrimps can be produced from a pond excavated on an acre of land, which can fetch a price of Rs 350-400 per kg. After excluding costs, the net profit may be up to Rs 3 lakh per acre, which is more than any other conventional crop.An enterprising farmer from Bathinda’s Kot Guru village Harpal Singh said he reduced land under shrimp to two acre from four acre last year. Shrimp farmers is treated as small-scale industry and charged Rs 9-unit for electricity. The tariff should be lowered as a relief measure to make sustainable, he added. Similarly, Jagmohan Singh from Arniwala village in Fazilka said government subsidy will help them stay afloat in shrimp farming during the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shrimp-farmers-want-transport-from-govt-to-stay-afloat/story-tNbrSdqeQVoXmT3w71t94M.html

The protest will be held at all district collector and tehsildar offices, said BJP state chief Chandrakant Patil. Patil said that all BJP allies will also participate in this protest, which will take a serious turn from August 1 if the government continues to ignore their demands.“The plight of dairy farmers is terrible as prices have fallen as low as ₹16 to ₹18 per litre. Due to Covid-19 milk collection is not happening and they had faced severe losses. To express their plight, all allies of Mahayuti will come together and protest,” said Patil.Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant, however termed this protest as “opportunistic politics”. “They have nothing to do with farmers. First, they had announced a protest on August 1, but when it came to light that the dairy development minister Sunil Kedar has announced a meeting to address this issue on Tuesday, they preponed their so-called protest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-to-launch-state-wide-milk-protest-on-monday/story-suB4cKjbpXPTNymSkrnYWK.html

19-07-2020||City||Ganpati at your doorstep: e-booking opens amidst Covid pandemic in Pune||The Ganesh festival is now a month away and Pune is readying for a Ganesh Utsav like has been never experienced in living memory.The first day of the 10-day Ganpati festival is on August 22, celebrated as Ganesh Chathurthi, and the Ganesh festival 2020 is going to be “Bappa at home” in Pune.The public outpouring of faith and festivity has been put on hold due to the Covid-19 pandemic, with the number of progressive positive cases in Pune having crossed 30,000 cases and currently growing at the rate of 1,500-plus cases per day.Mandaps, elaborate décor for public viewing, and the public sale of Ganpati idols are all on hold, and unlikely to happen this season.Idol makers who have had to come up with new of business strategies to ensure the city’s “Vignaharta” makes it to every home, as is the tradition.“In a bid to reach the maximum number of people and provide them Ganpati idols at their doorsteps we started a concept called ‘Bappa Aplya Dari’ (Ganpati at your doorstep). People should not come out of their society or area to the market to purchase the idols this year. So we have three vans in which we have displayed the different types of Ganpati idols. In each van there are 70 to 80 varieties - at least 215 varieties on display. This includes idols with diamonds, and idols made from plaster of paris (POP), clay, red clay, and the eco-friendly idols. These idols are one-to-two feet in height and we have not increased the rates this year,” said Abhijeet Suresh Abnwae, owner of Abhijeet Arts, a firm that has been in the idol-making business for the last 30 years.“Initially, we contact the chairman of a residential society, and they give us a date and a time slot to take our vehicle to the society. With proper social distancing, society members see the idols, make a booking and before the Ganpati festival begins, we will do home deliveries,” said Abnwae, adding, “The daily rent of one van is Rs 3,500, and to make the racks inside the van to display the idols Rs 30,000 has been spent per van. Staff, including drivers and helpers, are paid salaries. We have a sales target of 10,000 idols this year, but it might increase looking at the response,” added Abnwae.The Ganesh Kala Kendra, popular for its “shadhu mati” Ganpati idols, is also reaching out to customers.Amol Mehta, one of the co-owners of the kendra said, “This year, due to corona, the entire business model has changed. Earlier, we use to install a tent, or rent a shop on Tilak toad where customers would come, select their Ganpati idols and then take it home before the festival. This year, we have gone online with a website for booking of idols. We already have customer data from the previous years and are contacting them via email for orders. We also send idol photos out on WhatsApp to our regular customers. People are ready to pay more this year to get the idols home delivered,” says Mehta.Another senior Ganapti idol maker from Pune, 62-year-old Ganesh Lanjekar, owner of Lanjekar Ganpati Idols in Kasba peth said, “We have hundreds of fixed customers. This year, all manufacturers are worried about the business. Our work starts from January, but due to lockdown, the work stopped. We were not able to get raw materials and paints. The number of idols we produced, which was earlier 2,500, has now come down to half this year. There are many challenges to reach out to the public safely. We are sending the photos to our regular customers on WhatsApp and then they book their choices. We are losing customers, though.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ganpati-at-your-doorstep-e-booking-opens-amidst-covid-pandemic-in-pune/story-uXXhyzKMTNR8HLiwzhwzMK.html

Those that flout guidelines are sealed and power connection is disconnected. During the lockdown, when factories were shut, polluted water continued to flow into Buddha Nullah. This shows that factories are not releasing pollutants,” Ahuja said.He said a letter has been sent to Punjab CM and industry and finance minister to use panchayat Land and other additional land available for setting up industry.He said Dhanansu hi-tech valley is good model of converting panchayat land, which was bought by Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation (PSIEC) for Rs 94 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/commercial-industries-body-backs-punjab-cm-recommends-setting-up-industrial-park-in-mattewara/story-F3KPwNE0f0Au7vQsEtJl6K.html

We are hopeful that the crowds will lessen in the next few days. However, we kept the highest standards of cleaning and hygiene for our customers as per the directions of the health department,” he said.Meanwhile, the rise in prices of vegetables by at least 40 to 50 per cent did not stop the residents from purchasing it.

It is unfortunate that now the Congress was trying to deceive farmers by indulging in mischievous propaganda which has been launched for the purpose of diverting attention from failures of the Congress government,” added Sukhbir.The former deputy CM added that even now multi-nationals and flour mills did not pay any tax to purchase food grains. “Then why resort to scare tactics by claiming they will capture the entire market when the Union agriculture minister has already clarified that the entire government procurement will take place from mandis. This means there will not be any difference in revenue collection of around ₹4,000 crore,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ready-to-lead-delegation-if-msp-clarification-needed-says-sad-chief/story-ZAKKPcZcXMB7bOfl6i6JxL.html
19-07-2020||Bangalore||No extension of lockdown in Bengaluru: BBMP Commissioner||There was no question of extending the ongoing week-long lockdown here set to end on July 22, newly appointed commissioner of the city civic body N Manjunatha Prasad said on Sunday, amid speculations it may be continued for another fortnight in view of rising cases. The government has imposed complete lockdown in Bengaluru Urban and Bengaluru Rural districts among a few others since 8 pm of July 14 till 5 am on July 22. “The Chief Minister has made it clear that the lockdown will not be extended for any reason, after Tuesday there will not be any lockdown. We will follow the government’s orders.There is no question of lockdown,” Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike Commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad told reporters here. His clarification comes as speculations were rife that the lockdown may be extended for 15 days, despite Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa’s statement to the contrary. Yediyurappa had on Friday said lockdown was not the solution for controlling Covid-19 and made it clear that there was no proposal before the government to extend it. Prasad took over as the commissioner of the city civic body on Saturday evening. His predecessor B H Anil Kumar, along with city Mayor M Goutham Kumar, however, had favoured extension of lockdown. Ahead of the Chief Minister’s statement, they had said that in their personal opinion lockdown for 15 days would be good, as that much time is required to break the chain. As of July 18 evening, cumulatively 59,652 Covid-19 positive cases have been confirmed in the state, which includes 1,240 deaths and 21,775 discharges. Bengaluru Urban district tops the list of positive cases, with a total of 29,621 infections. Out of 4,537 fresh cases reported on Saturday in the state, the district alone accounted for 2,125.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/no-extension-of-lockdown-in-bengaluru-bbmp-commissioner/story-pjBskp8KU7SBWRw5lZShCP.html
19-07-2020||Jaipur||We’ll be kingmakers, says BTP as Rajasthan crisis unfolds||As the Ashok Gehlot government struggles to retain power in Rajasthan, the Bharatiya Tribal Party says it is now in a position to punch way above its weight despite its minuscule presence in the state assembly. “We have two MLAs in a House of 200, yet we are in the position of kingmakers,” party president Maheshbhai C Vasava told PTI on Sunday. At a joint press conference with the Congress on Saturday, BTP legislators Rajkumar Roat and Ramprasad Dindor made it clear that they are with Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot. This ended days of uncertainty over where the Gujarat-based party’s loyalties lie. The two MLAs supported the ruling Congress in the state in last month’s Rajya Sabha polls. But when the power tussle between Gehlot and his now sacked deputy Sachin Pilot re-surfaced recently, the BTP said it will remain neutral. Vasava said the party is now extending support to Gehlot after an assurance that its demands related to the development of tribal areas will be met. “We have fought against the Congress and the BJP on tribal issues but if the government now assures full support on the issues raised by us, why shouldn’t we support it? After all it is fulfilling the agenda of tribal welfare and development,” he said. When the crisis began last week, Vasava issued a whip directing both Roat and Dindor not to support any leader or party in case there is a floor test in the assembly. However, Sagwara MLA Ramprasad Dindor expressed defiance of the whip, saying both of them will support the state government. Later, party office-bearers and the MLAs held discussions with the chief minister on their demands. “We had supported the Congress government in the Rajya Sabha elections last month after an assurance by the chief minister on our demands,” Chorasi MLA Roat said. “But the demands were not fulfilled. Some of them could have been met in just one day,” he complained. The party then thought of not extending support to him, the MLA said. Last week, Roat appeared in two video clips, alleging that he was being stopped by Rajasthan police from travelling to his constituency in Dungarpur district. He claimed that police personnel had come in two vans and taken away his car keys. He also alleged that some people were forcing him to come with them. The videos were circulated by the Sachin Pilot camp and the BJP had questioned the state government over them. But Raut later dismissed the episode as a “misunderstanding” with police. He said the party’s agenda is development of tribal areas and they have raised 17 demands before the CM. Some of the demands are related to reservation in jobs and the utilisation of funds for tribal areas. The BTP came into being in 2017 in Gujarat, and expanded into Rajasthan the next year. In the December 2018 assembly elections, it fielded 11 candidates in the tribal belt in southern Rajasthan. Raot was 26 when he won and most other candidates too were young. “The youth are our power. Today’s youth is educated, understands issues and understands how the tribal people were deprived of their rights. We fielded many young candidates and the party’s performance was very good,” BTP state president Velaram Ghoghra said. The crisis in Rajasthan Congress has been brewing since the party picked Gehlot over Pilot for the chief minister’s post. Pilot was sacked as deputy chief minister and the party’s state unit president when he and 18 other MLAs stayed away from two Congress Legislature Party meetings. The rebel MLAs were served notices by Speaker C P Joshi after the Congress sought their disqualification from the assembly. The Rajasthan High Court will on Monday resume hearing their petition challenging the notices. Including the dissidents, the Congress has 107 MLAs in the 200-member assembly and the BJP 72. If the 19 Congress dissidents are disqualified, the current strength of the state assembly will reduce to 181, slashing the half-way mark to 91 and making it easier for Gehlot to retain majority support. In the past, the ruling party has claimed the support of 13 independents, two MLAs each from the CPM and the BTP), and one from the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/we-ll-be-kingmakers-says-btp-as-rajasthan-crisis-unfolds/story-9pJVyTUyHisdkO5U4yuNtO.html

The DGP added that after the covid-19 pandemic was over, the state would like to send a five-member team headed by a SP-ranked officer to observe and gain first hand experience in managing large crowds, as done at the TTD.Kundu added that he had also requested Andhra Pradesh DGP make arrangements of a week-long training module for HP police officers and to share systems and technologies that TTD uses. “The state police would like to learn from the TTD about security systems, protocols and technologies so that we may benefit from it. TTD is one of the biggest Hindu temple conglomerates in the world and handles large numbers of pilgrims daily and the number becomes larger on special occasions like Bramhotsavam,” the DGP says, that biometric scans, online registrations and an extensive network of surveillance cameras (CCTV) would all work well in the state as well. In a letter written to DGP AP, Kundu mentions all the religious places of historical importance and temples that are massively thronged during festivals and the need for cooperation between the two police forces. Kundu mentions that Himachal is also home to this Holiness Dalai Lama and several Buddhists monasteries, temples and shrines, the key amongst them being His Holiness Dalai Lama’s main temple Key Gompa, Key monastery, Buddha Temple, Rewalsar and Kardang monastery. Therefore, HP police also make arrangements for not only for devotees but also for the safety and security of our temples.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hp-wants-its-cops-to-be-trained-in-andhra-pradesh-to-learn-new-techniques/story-Z52HYJcb8sbLT9Sd7K2HmJ.html

As the family failed to find a suitable donor, the man breathed his last at Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial hospital on Saturday early morning.The deceased who tested positive on July 16 needed plasma therapy, said the doctors at the hospital.A relative of the deceased said, “We have no idea how he got infected, but we got to know that plasma could cure him and hospital was not finding any donors. We also tried our best, but failed.”In Pune, plasma therapy is carried out at Sassoon General Hospital and Poona Hospital. A senior doctor from Sassoon said, “We contacted at least 1,000 people who have been discharged, but only close to 40 people have come forward and 21 were eligible. Most of the people we contacted do not respond positively, they are always reluctant to show up and give excuses. It takes only two hours to test and complete the process.”A man whose wife is admitted at YCM is also looking for a donor with AB+ve blood group to come forward. After much labour, he found a donor.He said, “We live in Ambedkar Colony and my wife lost both her parents to Covid-19. After she tested positive, we admitted her to YCM as there was no ventilator available in any private hospital.”“Here the doctors said they needed a donor with AB+ve blood group who has been recovered in the last one month. We got one donor on Saturday and now he is being tested for eligibility and if approved the process would start,” he said.Another 56-year-old woman admitted at Command hospital needs an O+ve blood group donor who has been undergoing treatment since June 30. However, even after much search, the family has not been able to find any donor.Her son said, “We did try to contact a few blood banks, but it was of no help. The administration must at least set up a toll-free number for the same so that people like me can be guided.”The Indian Medical Association (IMA), Maharashtra chapter, even wrote a letter to the state government on July 14 that the state government must make it compulsory for those recovered to donate plasma under the ‘Epidemic Act 1897 or a new Ordinance.District collector Naval Kishore Ram said, “If the IMA has such a proposal we can discuss it with them and are trying to counsel people even during discharge and after discharge too, but not many are coming forward.”“We are working on getting more donors. If need be, we can get it in writing from those cured to donate during discharge,” he said.In its letter, the IMA wrote, “IMA Maharashtra State suggests that the Government of Maharashtra must make it mandatory for all the patients who got cured of the deadly disease, to donate blood for the plasma therapy. To facilitate this procedure, a mandatory undertaking can be taken from all the patients to report on the 15th day after the discharge or recovery. Thereafter they will be tested for fitness for the Blood Donation. A separate plasma bank may be formed for the procedure at every place with the help of the blood banks in the public as well as the private sector”.Who can donate plasmaThe donor must be 18-60 years of age.The donor would be thoroughly checked before the plasma is retrieved from the blood and retransferred into the person’s body.The entire process takes about 2-3 hours and the person does not experience any weakness.As of July 15, close to 6,500 people were discharged after being declared as cured only in PMC jurisdiction. All those, who have no comorbidity and have not reported any symptoms in the past month within the age group of 18-60 are eligible to donate plasma therapy.Plasma therapy has proven to be a successful treatment method for patients who are critical.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/hesitant-donors-impact-use-of-plasma-therapy/story-yTsZ8brLQ9u4wgmH8p8OJN.html

19-07-2020||Pune||Clerics appeal to faithful to follow safety norms on Eid in Pune||The state home department has appealed to the Muslim community to observe Eid-ul-Adha (Bakrid) in a symbolic manner in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. The festival is likely to be observed on August 1.Qari Idrees, a cleric from Pune said, “We appeal to all the Muslim community members to give top priority to health and safety while performing Qurbani. We respect the orders issued by the home department.”Maulana Razeen Ashrafi, another cleric, “Qurbani is mandatory for the community and they must perform it in the simplest and humble way following the instructions given by authorities. Everybody must wear masks, carry sanitisers and maintain social distancing. Those unable to sacrifice an animal must do it next year.”The state has directed the Muslim community to offer traditional Eid Namaz in homes instead of mosques.Since the goat market is closed due to lockdown, the home department has appealed that the pious must buy sacrificial animals online or through phone communication.Temporary goat markets that flourish in Muslim dominant areas like Kondhwa, Yerawada, Pune Camp, Ghorpadi peth, Nana peth and Momin Pura during this period are not set up this year. The prices of goats, however, have not come down due to shortage.According to goat sellers, the shortage of fodder and lockdown has hit the goat farmers hard. With transportation services hit during the lockdown, goats from Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and other far-flung states did not reach Pune market. The buyers are relying on the local goat market to cater to the needs of the community every year.Abid Shaikh, social worker, said “There is a shortage of goats in the market but prices will remain high due to a lesser number of animals available in the market.”Supply less, demand moreKondhwa had more than a dozen goat markets in 2019 where around 10,000 animals were available for sacrifice, however the market was not given permission this year because of the Covid pandemic.Tausif Shaikh, owner of Kohinoor farms, a prominent goat seller in Kondhwa said that they were accepting online orders and would even facilitate the slaughtering of sacrificial and meat distribution.“This year, the market conditions are very tough and there are less number of goats with us despite good demand from customers. We have ordered truckload of goats from Madhya Pradesh, but transportation during lockdown is a major issue. We are hopeful that the stock will arrive before Eid,” Shaikh said.BoxPune’s biggest goat markets which are set up in Kondhwa, Mominpura and Camp are missing this year, the number of sacrificial goats available has also fallen in number. Kondhwa had more than a dozen goat markets in 2019 where around 10,000 goats were available for sacrifice, however, no permission for markets has been granted this year. The high priced goats purchased by wealthy businessmen are available for sale.Tausif Shaikh, owner of Kohinoor farms, a prominent goat seller in Kondhwa said that they were accepting online orders for their goats and would even facilitate the slaughtering of sacrificial and meat distribution.“This year the market conditions are very tough and there are less number of goats with us though there is a demand from the customers. We have ordered another truckload of goats from Madhya Pradesh but transportation shutdown during lockdown is a major issue and we are hopeful that the stock will arrive before Eid,” Shaikh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/clerics-appeal-to-faithful-to-follow-safety-norms-on-eid-in-pune/story-E8kJWDIzmdd3Ug4qURlB8O.html
19-07-2020||Pune||Ambulance drivers at YCMH in Pimpri Chinchwad demand better facilities||The ambulance drivers employed at Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital (YCMH) are demanding better facilities while transporting Covid patients.The civic-run hospital has 14 ambulances that operate round the clock. These vehicles are used to transport positive patients and carry deceased to crematorium.The drivers claim that there are only two ward boys in service for 14 ambulances and demanded two ward boys for each ambulance.Dr Aniket Lathi, professor and head of ENT department, accepted shortage of ward boys for ambulance service, but assured of increasing manpower shortly.“The hospital has issued a tender for increasing manpower and soon more hands will join us. Currently, there are four ward boys in every shift and soon the number of ward boys will be eight per shift,” said Lathi.The drivers said that shortage of ward boys is felt the most when they face emergencies.“Ward boys at the hospital have different shifts and two ward boys cannot attend all ambulances. Many times we are not provided hand gloves, masks and sanitiser. When we demand it, it is provided after four days,” said an ambulance driver on request of anonymity.The ambulances are working in three shifts – 9am-3pm, 3pm-11pm, 9pm-7am.“As more deaths related to Covid-19 was reported last month, hence more ambulances were on duty,” added Lathi.Drivers want the hospital administration to be more responsible when it comes to protecting the health of staff.“We should be provided with all protective material,” said an ambulance driver.As of Friday, PCMC reported a total of 9,790 Covid positive cases, 162 deaths and 5,900 patients have been cured.As of Saturday, PCMC reported a total of 10,446 Covid positive cases, 175 deaths and 6,480 patients have been cured.“Load on ambulance drivers have been increasing since last one month, soon hospital will be getting extra staff to help Ambulance drivers,” Anna Bodade, Assistant Municipal Commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/ambulance-drivers-at-ycmh-in-pimpri-chinchwad-demand-better-facilities/story-KTWfVyPNYQQf1NJPQmb9PL.html
19-07-2020||Pune||Drugs’ shortage continues, but FDA hopes to regularise supply||Despite a rising number of Covid-19 cases in Pune, the city is reporting a shortage of essential drugs including Anti-viral drug remdesivir and tocilizumab (a drug that modifies the immune system or its functioning), itolizumab and favipiravir all of which are used for critical patients or those with moderate symptoms. The Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), Pune division has made a list of all the registered suppliers of these drugs and brought in a three-point check to ensure that city hospitals do not hoard the drugs and the needy patients get it on time.As of Friday, there are 666 critical patients among 1,530 active cases in the district.The FDA issued a list of 23 registered suppliers of these drugs for the entire Pune division of which 10 are in Pune district. One of the distributors, Girish Lunavat from Prakash Medical Centre, said, “We are facing a shortage of essential drugs mainly remdesivir and tocilizumab. The demand is huge and rising, but the supply is not regular. We give full advance payment, but still the supply is not consistent. Only if the production increases will the supply become smooth. However, we have been assured by the company that by next week, the shortage of both these drugs will be fulfilled.”SB Patil, FDA joint commissioner (drugs) Pune division, said, “There is a shortage, but we will regularise the supply by the end of this month. However, we have also seen that doctors are prescribing these drugs to even those who are in home isolation whereas these drugs are for those who are hospitalized and are critical. We get around 400 vials of remdesivir and 100 vials of tocilizumab every day, but the demand is high.”Patil further said that to ensure that the drug reaches the right patient for every vial the hospital/distributor has to provide the hospital’s admission card, patients’ identity proof, relative’s identity proof who has come to buy the drug and Covid-19 report.He said, “The drugs are supplied either through distributors to individuals or to the hospital’s medical store. The same documents have to be provided. Each hospital has to provide a daily report of the opening balance of drugs, closing balance and details of the patients who have been administered with the drugs. We also keep a three-way check at the company’s depot, distributor level and the hospital level to ensure that the drugs are not kept away from needy patients.”Patil further added that by next week the supply will be regularised as about 20 per cent of the drugs which the state will receive will be diverted for Pune.Remdesivir is the only drug approved by the United States food and drug administration for treating Covid-19 patients. While tocilizumab is still imported, remdesivir has now been certified to be manufactured by two Indian companies Cipla and Hetero Drugs.Families of Covid-19 patients and doctors have said that generic brands of remdesivir and tocilizumab are in short supply in Mumbai too. However, stocks of remdesivir and tocilizumab are likely to improve from next week, according to manufacturing companies and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Hetero Healthcare on Friday announced that it will distribute 60,000 units of the Covifor injection, which is its generic brand of remdesivir, across the country between July 13 and July 20.Of these, 12,500 units will be distributed in Maharashtra. Cipla, the other company permitted to manufacture the drug, started production of CIPEMI (remdesivir) on Monday. Around 80,000 vials will be available within the first month, said Nikhil Chopra, executive vice president and chief executive officer (India, business), Cipla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/drugs-shortage-continues-but-fda-hopes-to-regularise-supply/story-Hrs86IXqwwi03AD5VL0oMI.html

19-07-2020||Lucknow||Two Uttar Pradesh hospitals set to begin human trials of India’s Covid-19 vaccine, Covaxin||Two private hospitals in Uttar Pradesh will soon begin human trials of Covaxin, the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech International Limited.The two hospitals—Prakhar Hospital in Kanpur and Rana Hospital and Trauma Centre in Gorakhpur—are among the 12 institutes across the country where the human trial of the vaccine candidate will be conducted.However, none of the two hospitals is affiliated to a medical college and is not a dedicated Covid-19 hospital.Prakhar Hospital in Kanpur is looking at a sample size of 50 people in the first phase and another 150 in the second phase of the human trial. The Rana Hospital, meanwhile, is awaiting a safety certificate before the trials can begin.“We are getting a number of calls from healthy people every day who want to volunteer for the clinical trial of Covaxin,” said Dr JS Kushwaha, owner of Prakhar Hospital.“The hospital has a database of volunteers in place with a team of eight specialists, headed by a doctor, who has joined the hospital from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS),” he said.The hospital has received a letter from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and is waiting for statutory permission from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI).“It is expected to come by next week. Then, we can move ahead in line with the ICMR protocols,” Dr JS Kushwaha said.In the past, the hospital has conducted successful clinical trials for the rotavirus vaccine.Bharat Biotech did not comment on the matter. A senior ICMR official, in the know of things, said the size of a hospital doesn’t matter when it comes to conducting clinical trials.“There are a lot of other factors such as ethics committee approvals, infrastructure to support the type of trial, subject recruitment, qualified principal investigator etc. It’s better to have a mix of sites that is decided mutually by trial sponsors,” said the official, who did not wish to be named.ICMR issues permits for conducting the trials to government facilities (67%) and the private sector (33%).The primary task of the hospital would be to vaccinate and keenly observe the side-effects, if any, and send samples to an National Institute of Virology (NIV) or ICMR-sanctioned laboratory after 28 days—the period in which the antibodies are developed, said Dr Kushwaha.After the recruitment of volunteers, the hospital would first send their samples for RT-PCR and antibody tests in Delhi. On the basis of the reports, the vaccine would be given to the subjects. Their samples would be tested again to ascertain the increase in antibodies. The process would be repeated after another 14 days.“The antibodies take 28 days to develop. All the data will be analysed at the level of ICMR and NIV. We have no capability here in Kanpur to evaluate that kind of data,” Dr Kushwaha said.The hospital would monitor the subjects after they are given the vaccine.“There is no problem in 99% of cases and if someone shows adverse symptoms, these would be treated and corrected by a team of specialists,” he said.For the Rana Hospital, it will be the third vaccine trial in a span of one year.“We completed two vaccine trials for typhoid and Japanese Encephalitis (JE) with a sample size of 100 volunteers in January. The third will be the Covid vaccine,” Venkatesh Chaturvedi, chief administrative officer of Rana Hospital, said.Established in 2001, Rana Hospital is known for obstetrical and gynaecological services. The human trial at this hospital will be held under the supervision of physician Dr Ajit Pratap Singh and Dr Sona Ghosh.Dr Ghosh, a senior consultant gynaecologist and one of the key members in the vaccine trial at the Rana hospital said the hospital was selected by Bharat Biotech when the trials for Covid-19 vaccine were announced. “In eastern Uttar Pradesh, we are the only medical centre with the experience of conducting two vaccine trials,” Dr Ghosh added.Chaturvedi said that delivery of the vaccine for the trials is awaited. “Also the sample size has to be decided by the company along with final guidelines for the trial method,” he said.He said a list of volunteers was ready with the hospital and more volunteers were contacting the hospital. “Random sampling will be done to check their health status and then a final list of volunteers will be made. Our prior experience will help us in the Covid vaccine trials,” he said.Chaturvedi said the hospital would move ahead with the trials as soon as the guidelines and vaccines arrive.ICMR director general Dr Balram Bhargava had said in a letter that the plan was to launch the vaccine for public health use latest by August 15, after completion of all clinical trials.The hospitals had also been directed to enrol healthy people for the trial of the vaccine earlier this July.Covaxin, India’s first potential indigenous Covid-19 vaccine, has been jointly developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL).Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech is among the seven Indian firms working on Covid-19 vaccines. It was the first to get the regulatory nod to begin phase 1 and phase 2 human trials to test the vaccine for efficacy and safety.Zydus Cadila has also got an approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for human clinical trials for ZyCov-D, its indigenously developed vaccine candidates against Sars-Cov-2, which causes Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/two-uttar-pradesh-hospitals-set-to-begin-human-trials-of-india-s-covid-19-vaccine-covaxin/story-DITvMxiBgJTvgIAE1mcybL.html

Gambhir, who represents East Delhi in Parliament, had posted several photographs of waterlogged roads on Twitter to make his point.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader’s tweet came almost an hour after Gambhir’s retort over the condition of the Capital’s roads. He mentioned Minto Bridge, where the body of a 60-year-old man was found after the heavy rains, as one such area which was cleared of waterlogging earlier in the day. “I have been with agencies since this morning and was monitoring the process of removing water from there. There are several such areas in Delhi which are being monitored. We shall send pumps immediately to areas in which waterlogging is reported,” he tweeted.“This year all agencies, which include the Delhi government and the municipal corporations, were completely invested in managing corona. They have faced a lot of difficulties,” he posted on Twitter.“This is no time to get into any blame game. All agencies must join hands in fulfilling their responsibilities. We will make all efforts to clear areas where waterlogging is reported at the earliest,” he added.Raghav Chadha, the AAP’s national spokesperson and Delhi Jal Board vice-chairperson, said de-silting and clearance of drains in the city got delayed this year because of the coronavirus pandemic.“Drains that come under the jurisdiction of the Delhi government and the municipal corporations are cleared before the arrival of monsoons, especially in April. This year, all agencies were invested in Covid management, so the work concerning drains either got postponed or delayed,” said Chadha.“The work could not take place in the scheduled time. Agencies could properly get into clearing and de-silting of drains only by June. The current issue is being monitored personally by the CM. We are sending pumps to clear water from waterlogged areas,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/amid-criticism-arvind-kejriwal-says-keeping-an-eye-on-delhi-s-waterlogged-areas/story-5hce7G7q1s9akac9JEmZPM.html

He welcomed LJP President Chirag Paswan’s statement in which he thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Central government for sending a team in Bihar to assess the situation of Covid-19 in the state.“I welcome what Chirag Paswan has said, he has presented the right picture while in government. I was the Health Minister there 20 years ago and I know the health structure there. Health facilities are the worst in the state.

Police guards have been deployed and the areas have been declared a containment zone. We are investigating the case,” Alok Ranjan, deputy superintendent of police (DSP), said.The thieves entered the house of the patient, who works in the surveillance team of Jugsalai Nagar Parishad, by breaking open the rear door with sharp weapons and crowbar, police said. “The thieves cooked mutton, rice and chapatis and feasted in the house before fleeing,” brother of the Covid-19 patient alleged in his written complaint lodged on Friday evening. “The house and adjacent areas were declared a containment zone after my brother had tested positive on July 8. He was admitted to TMH and the house was sealed. His wife and children have been living at their village house for the past one month. We came to know about the theft after my brother sent me to check the house on Friday and neighbours informed me that the rear door of the house is broken,” he said.In the second incident, thieves stole cash, sanitizers and mobile phones from student leader Khushboo Lama’s house at Old Sitaramdera under Sitaramdera police station late on Thursday night.

19-07-2020||Kolkata||Durga Puja organisers in Kolkata recommend safety measures during festivities||A Durga Puja organisers’ forum in Kolkata has recommended certain safety measures to be taken during the festivities.The Forum for Dugotsab, an association of 350 Durga Puja committees in the city, said it will submit its list of recommendations to the office of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, an office-bearer of the body said on Sunday.The forum has recommended measures like thermal screening of visitors, making the wearing of masks mandatory for everyone, allowing only 25 people inside a marquee at a time and regular sanitisation of the structures, he said.It has also called for keeping the marquees open from the front so that visitors can see the idols without having to enter the structures, the forum’s office-bearer said.“After Mamata Banerjee said in state secretariat Nabanna that everyone should be careful about their health so that they can celebrate Durga Puja in a grand way, we are hopeful of celebrating the festival this year with all safety measures in place.“We have distributed a list of guidelines among members of the forum. We will submit the same to the Chief Minister’s Office,” he told PTI.Durga Puja organisers across Kolkata are hopeful they will be able to celebrate the festival this year, albeit in a scaled-down manner and by taking safety measures.“We will celebrate Durga Puja by following the guidelines as the livelihood of thousands are attached to it.But maybe, we will not be able to celebrate the festival the way we had initially planned,” Somen Dutta of Kasi Bose Puja Committee in north Kolkata said.Partha Ghosh of Shiv Mandir Puja Committee in south Kolkata said the festival will be a low-key affair for them this year and safety measures will be taken.“The celebration will be scaled down this year while retaining our artistic hallmark. We will have a grand theme- based celebration next year,” he said.Debashis Kumar, former mayor-in-council of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation and one of the key persons of the Tridhara Sammilani Puja Committee in Ballygunge, said they are waiting for safety guidelines from the administration.“We haven’t started our preparations yet for this year’s Durga Puja. We haven’t even booked any idol. Unlike some Durga Puja organisers, we don’t believe in using thermal devices to screen revellers. Unless we get clear guidelines from the administration on how to go about with the celebrations, we will not take any decision,” he said.Subhendu Ghosh of Kasba Talbagan Puja Committee said they will scale down the celebrations. “Our decorator has tested positive for COVID-19. We will decide accordingly,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/durga-puja-organisers-in-kolkata-recommend-safety-measures-during-festivities/story-XjYyE88fZlQe5anxCAvAUJ.html

There are about 5,000 living in this area and there are 1,026 flats.Also read: India begins study on BCG vaccine impact on Covid-19Tripathi said the World Health Organization (WHO) has organised a camp for the checkup of people in the area. The RWA also facilitated a camp by the ministry of AYUSH to distribute medicines to increase people’s immunity. Regular sanitisation of areas and roads where cases are being reported are also being done, he added.However, Tripathi said the rising number of Covid-19 cases is a matter of concern.Tripathi said the RWA has made sure that no resident faces any problem after the area was declared as a containment zone. He, along with the treasurer of the association, Yashpal Singh, is working closely with the administration and police. He said there is no restriction on people’s movement and medical, ration and milk shops are opening. But other shopkeepers say they are facing a lot of trouble.RN Shukla, a 50-year-old owner of a clothes shop, told Hindustan he has been facing financial problems as the shop has been closed for a long time and he can’t take up any other job.Shukla said the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) has verbally allowed other shops to open but since there are no written directions, the police are not allowing him to open his. Officials of the RWA said they have written to the SDM and the issue will be resolved soon.Also read: How soon can the world get Covid-19 vaccine? A look at which country stands whereAccording to the residents association, the number of coronavirus disease cases are higher among the employees of the hospitals in the area. There are five big hospitals in this area, including the GTB Hospital, Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, and Delhi State Cancer Hospital. The route to the GTB Hospital via the colony has been closed.Residents said the police, including station house officer Arun Kumar Singh, have been a big help and they have not faced any issues so far. GTB Enclave’s Block E was among the first 23 containment zones announced by the Delhi government in April to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease in the city. There are four other areas—blocks K and G in Jahangirpuri, Majlis Park in Adarsh Nagar and Hauz Rani—which have remained containment zones for more than three months.The Centre’s orders say a containment zone can be de-sealed 28 days after the last Covid-19 case has recovered or tested negative.However, district officials have said there were still some major reasons because of which these zones have remained sealed for months.They said these include the presence of several medical professionals living in some zones, the 28-day rule for de-sealing a containment zone and continuous movement of people within the zone despite strict curbs. District administration officials said they have raised the matter with the Delhi government. Delhi has 120,107 cases of the viral disease and 3571 people have succumbed to Covid-19, according to the Union health ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-cases-rising-in-delhi-area-even-after-100-days-of-containment/story-aFJ4eWO4aAPACld9acBYmL.html

The event was attended by many people including members of Khap Panchayat.Those who participated in the event were seen sitting very close to each other and many of them did not cover their faces as per the Covid-19 guidelines.The event was organised to protest the dismissal of Haryana’s PTIs. “The PTIs and those organisations who are supporting them were not given any permission. They did not follow Covid-19 protocols. We are investigating the case. We will take action accordingly,” said Manoj Ahlawat, duty magistrate at the spot. Meanwhile, Meham MLA Balraj Kundu who came out in support of the protest said: “This protest is not only about PTIs but about all those who are not being made permanent by the government and working on a temporary basis. I am with them.”“This is utter injustice with these PTIs. The state government has all the powers to ensure justice to them.

19-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt asks panel to look at factors that can reduce Covid-19 fatality||The Delhi government earlier this week told a 12-member committee, set up on directions of the Supreme Court to inspect Covid-19 hospitals in the national capital, to look into factors that can help reduce the deaths caused by coronavirus disease (Covid-19).According to an office memorandum from Delhi’s principal health secretary Vikram Dev Dutt, the government also provided a checklist containing questions such as time taken for triaging (the practice of assigning treatment based on urgency) Covid-19 patients; whether early warning scores to determine whether a patient might deteriorate was followed; and whether the hospital had a standardised investigation protocol. “Since committees constituted for the inspection of hospitals in Delhi, consequent to orders passed by the Supreme Court, are already carrying out their mandate in a continuous manner, it would be appropriate that specific attention may now be focused upon aspects which have a bearing on the reduction of Covid-related mortalities,” the memorandum read.This comes after the Delhi government released protocols for management of Covd-19 patients, including having a dedicated health care worker monitoring each critical patient. The protocols had also said that availability of dialysis has to be ensured by all hospitals as patients with Covid-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome may also develop acute kidney problems.The government had also said hospitals had to set up a proper holding area for Covid-19 patients, apart from ensuring an effective triage and monitoring of oxygen saturation.Dr Mahesh Verma, a member of the committee and vice-chancellor of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, said, “The government has provided us with a checklist of questions to look into whether the hospitals are following protocols for admission, triage, critical care, and infection control. Even one death that can be prevented should be prevented and the committee has just been asked to look into whether there is anything that can be done.” So far, most of the deaths in hospitals have been of patients who tried to managed their symptoms at home and reached hospitals only when their lungs were compromised or at a stage when they needed to be put on ventilators and the condition could not be reversed. Earlier, Covid-19 related deaths were also happening because doctors did not understand the progression of disease and there was a sudden coagulopathy (formation of clots) or drop in oxygen saturation,” he said.The data provided by the chief minister’s office showed that 691 deaths took place in Delhi between June 24 and July 8, which works out to an average of 46 deaths a day. The numbers have gone down further, with just 26 deaths being reported on July 17 in the daily health bulletin. Of the 691 deaths, the the CM’s office said zero deaths happened in home isolation in July and only seven deaths were reported in home isolation between June 24 and 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-asks-panel-to-look-at-factors-that-can-reduce-covid-19-fatality/story-luCm4gUO1iJunqzdHpt6HL.html
19-07-2020||Delhi||SDMC plans to levy professional tax on self-employed people, firms||Professionals working in south Delhi areas will have to shell out more money on taxes in the coming months as the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) will soon start colelcting a ‘professional tax’ from companies operating in areas under its jurisdiction.According to SDMC officials, the civic body is planning to implement professional tax over the next two months. Self-employed professionals such as doctors, lawyers, chartered accountants, and architects, among others, will also have to pay the new professional tax. However, those earning less than ₹20,000 a month have been kept out of the ambit of the new tax.A senior SDMC official, on condition of anonymity, said a plan to implement professional tax has already been finalised and it will now be passed by the House on July 27. The official said the professional tax is collected against the amenities being provided by the civic body to professionals and companies.“Since the proposal has already been approved by the standing committee, there will be no problem in getting it passed by the House. After that, it will be sent to the Delhi government for a gazette notification and then we will start collecting the tax from companies and self-employed professionals. The new tax is likely to be implemented in two month’s time,” the official quoted above said.As per the move, a professional tax of ₹150 per person per month will be collected from those earning between ₹20,000 and ₹50,000 a month while it would be ₹200 per person per month for those earning above ₹50,000 per month. The tax will be charged even if the person doesn’t live in the SDMC areas but works there. Traders will remain outside the ambit of the tax.The official said this would be the first time that a professional tax is being implemented in Delhi. This tax is already levied in 19 states across the country, including Maharashtra, West Bengal, Bihar and Gujarat, among others.These recommendations for realising a professional tax were made in the SDMC’s 2020-21 budget proposal for the enhancement of revenue. The SDMC officials said the new tax will net the corporation an income of ₹50 crore a year.Anamika Mithilesh, SDMC mayor, said in the past few years, the civic body had refrained from imposing this tax on the public but this year due to “acute fund crunch”, the proposal was approved.“Instead of relying solely on funds from the state or central government, we are taking steps to increase our revenue by enhancing our sources of income. This year, our income has gone down drastically due to the Covid-19 pandemic and so we decided to go ahead and levy the professional tax. This move will bring a revenue of ₹50 crore a year to the cash-strapped civic body. We are hopeful of people’s support i this regard,” the mayor said.Mithilesh said very soon, notices would be issued to firms operating in SDMC areas informing them about the professional tax and its modalities. The companies will be asked to submit the amount to the civic body after a gazette notification from the Delhi government.A second official, also on condition of anonymity, said efforts are being made to add professional tax to the house tax bills so that people can pay it along with the property tax. He, however, said modalities on this front are being worked out.“It can be collected online as well as offline. Professional tax will be collected from all companies and self-employed people whose office is in SDMC areas. The maximum tax will be ₹200 per month or ₹2,400 annually. The minimum will be ₹150 a month or ₹1,800 annually. People will be given options for making either monthly or annual payments. The accounts of companies will be attached if they fail to pay professional tax within the given time frame,” the official said.Dr Akanksha Singh, a gynaecologist who has a clinic in Lajpat Nagar, said burdening the public with more taxes is not fair. “People are already paying a number of different taxes and one more will only put more burden on their pockets. The condition of professionals, be it self-employed or the service class, is not good especially during these times of the coronavirus pandemic. People are already going through a lot of problems and imposing one more tax will only make things more difficult,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sdmc-plans-to-levy-professional-tax-on-self-employed-people-firms/story-3PAhJApsya3e4NMe081OmM.html

This will be in addition to the existing 25 MGD extracted from the region.Senior officials of the Jal Board said the water augmentation project being carried in the region will be in line with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s vision to provide round-the-clock supply to all Delhi residents.Chadha said the additional 25MGD water can be extracted in a sustainable manner from this region, as the extracted groundwater will be recharged during the flood season.“To bring about an overall improvement in the water management system of the DJB, this additional 25 MGD should be extracted and connected to the main supply to augment the distribution in north and northwest Delhi,” Chadha said.He said it is estimated that the work on the installation of 200 tubewells to extract 25MGD water will be completed in the next two years. DJB officials said a 25-acre pond with a depth of 1.75 metres was also checked and 35 piezometers were installed around it to study the impact of water recharging during floods.“Many technical committees, researchers and scientists were brought to the table and they have all agreed that this project has the potential to increase the groundwater level, which can be extracted during the lean season to augment the supply in the national capital. Currently, the pilot project is being executed on 25 acres, which will be expanded to cover 1,000 acres,” Chadha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/djb-inspects-palla-region-site-for-setting-up-200-tubewells-to-extract-25mgd-water/story-1OCQOvUpgMN15YRcLanicO.html
19-07-2020||Delhi||Three held for assaulting cop who asked them to follow social distancing||Three members of a family, including a father-son duo, from Shahdara were arrested late Friday night for allegedly thrashing a Delhi police constable who asked them to return to their house and follow social distancing. The constable was on patrol duty in the area. Senior officers said two of the arrested men also have a previous criminal record of molestation and assault. A fourth family member who was also involved in the altercation fled, the police said.According to the police, around 9pm Friday, constable Pradeep was on patrol duty along with head constable Akash (both known only by their first names). A senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, said that when the two policemen neared the rear of Rahman building in Shahdara, they noticed that a group of people had gathered there.“Constable Pradeep asked the group the reason for gathering and requested them to disperse. Because head constable Akash was still a few paces behind Pradeep, the group of men ignored him. When Pradeep threatened them with legal action, they started abusing him. Some of the men surrounded and thrashed him. They even tore his uniform,” the officer said.Akash jumped into the fray and both of them nabbed three of the group, while one fled. “We identified the men who were caught as Arun Singh, a driver, his father Raghuvir Ram and uncle Ram Pal. Arun’s brother Vishal Singh, also a driver, ran from the spot and efforts to arrest him are underway,” the officer said. The deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) Amit Sharma said Pradeep was taken to a hospital where he was treated and, based on his statement, the three arrested men were booked for assault, obstructing a public servant in discharge of public functions and voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant.Sharma said the preliminary enquiry revealed that Arun, his father and his brother have been involved in a case of molestation and assault.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/three-held-for-assaulting-cop-who-asked-them-to-follow-social-distancing/story-BC1isFtEootWxQ4Gl7ADJL.html

He used a bedsheet to hang himself. No suicide note was recovered. He was jailed on Thursday in the murder case of his mother-in-law registered at the Mohan Garden police station. He was in the cell with six other inmates,” said Director General (Tihar prisons) Sandeep Goel.Goel said that a magisterial enquiry (inquest proceeding under Section 174 CrPC) has been initiated by the metropolitan magistrate concerned in the prisoner’s death. On Friday, the deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka district) Anto Alphonse had issued a press release regarding the man’s arrest. The DCP mentioned that the man was enraged as he suspected that it was because of his mother-in-law that his wife and daughter were not ready to live with him in his house. His wife and daughter left him and started living at her mother’s home after the man was arrested in a case of rape in 2019, the DCP said. “The man was released from the jail after nine months but as his wife and daughter were unwilling to return to him, he planned to kill his mother-in-law, holding her responsible for everything,” the DCP said, adding that the man purchased an ice pick to execute the murder plan.On Thursday around 12.30 am, the man’s wife and mother-in-law had come out to see off their three relatives – a couple and their 10-year-old son. Suddenly, the man arrived, overpowered his mother-in-law and stabbed her multiple times with the ice pick. When the relatives tried to intervene, he attacked them as well, the DCP said.“The man was brandishing the ice pick and nobody in the neighbourhood was daring to go near him. Hearing the commotion, two beat patrolling constables reached the crime scene and overpowered the attacker,” he added.The man was arrested with the ice pick and sent to jail the same day, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jailed-for-mother-in-law-s-murder-prisoner-hangs-himself-in-tihar/story-1cJM8P2nXoJ7lcL2Ms1GKK.html
19-07-2020||Delhi||DU further extends registration dates for admissions till July 31||The Delhi University (DU) on Saturday extended the date of registration for admissions to undergraduate, postgraduate, MPhil and PhD courses till July 31. This is the second time in the ongoing admission season that DU has extended the dates of registration, which had begun on June 20, and was scheduled to close on Saturday. The decision of extending the date of registration was taken during a meeting of the University’s admission committee on Saturday. A member of the committee said, “While the Central Board of School Education (CBSE) recently announced the results of Class 12, some state boards are yet to announce the results. The committee has decided to further extend the date of registration to July 31 and give some more time to the students.”Suman Sharma, another member of the committee, said, “We received several requests for extension. The university’s students’ union had also sent us a request, citing the fact that many candidates could not apply due to the prevailing situation. So the committee has decided to extend the registration dates.”The number of applications has already exceeded last year’s figure. By Saturday evening, 288,900 paid applications were received for undergraduate courses, 131,531 for postgraduate courses and 29,862 for MPhil and PhD courses. Last year, as many as 258,388 paid applications were received for admission to undergraduate courses, 131,129 for postgraduate courses and 20,862 applications for MPhil and PhD programmes. Principals said that the spike in the number of applications will lead to tougher competition. Anju Srivastava, the principal of Hindu College, said, “It’s good that the University is giving a chance to students whose Class 12 results have not been declared yet. But yes, it will surely lead to high cut-offs.” The college had the highest cut-off of 99% across the University in 2019.Meanwhile, the number of applications under the reserved categories for admissions in undergraduate courses is still low as of now compared to last year. By Saturday evening, 54,518 applications were received under the OBC category, 33,720 under the SC category, 6,247 under the ST category and 7,662 in the EWS category. However, the number of applications in OBC, SC, ST and EWS categories was 55,457, 34,262, 7,100 and 9,091, respectively, in 2019.Hansraj Suman, the chairperson of the DU SC/CT/OBC teachers’ forum, said, “Many students could not get their reservation certificates issued amid the pandemic and hence the number of applications is low as of now. The extension will give such students some more time to apply.”Given the Covid-19 pandemic, DU has shifted its admission process completely online this year. The admission process has also been delayed by over two months this year due to the prevailing situation. Last year, the registration process had begun on May 30 and the first cut-off list was announced on June 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-further-extends-registration-dates-for-admissions-till-july-31/story-jTHTCEZhB0yIBvPpM3eTOL.html

The incident took place when the suspect was taken to the park to recover a firearm that he had buried there, the police said.The injured suspect, identified as Rafiq alias Rokha, tried to outsmart the police by tricking them into digging a particular spot, claiming that he had buried the automatic pistol and ammunition there. While the policemen were busy digging, he stood near the spot where he had actually hidden the firearm with just a constable holding him by the hand to keep him from fleeing, police said.“Suddenly, Rafiq pushed the constable away and pulled out the pistol he had hidden nearby and fired at the constable. The bullet missed the constable, who immediately fired a round in the air to scare Rafiq into stop shooting,” said deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Vijayanta Arya.As Rafiq tried to flee, a sub-inspector who was in the raiding team fired two bullets – one in the air and the other on Rafiq’s leg. An injured Raiq was overpowered by the constable following a scuffle in which the constable suffered two fractures to his hand and shoulder, the DCP said.DCP Arya said Rafiq was involved in over 50 burglaries across the city and was also wanted for firing at the police party near Akshardham Temple last year. He and his associate Akhtar were caught with firearms from the same park on Thursday afternoon.During questioning, Arya said, Rafiq revealed that he had buried another firearm in that park. The police team took him there to recover the weapon. He tried to flee after misleading and firing at the police party. However, he was caught after a brief exchange of fire, the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/suspect-cop-injured-in-scuffle-shoot-out-at-park-in-outer-delhi/story-BW7w26B32cPwtVg7FsfrtJ.html

The court is slated to pronounce the quantum of punishment in the case on July 22.Director-general (Tihar prisons) Sandeep Goel said that Punjaban was lodged in Jail Number 6, a women’s jail. She consumed some medicines on Thursday evening and became drowsy. When she complained of uneasiness and told the jail officials that she had consumed some pills, she was taken to a dispensary within the premises.“We shifted her to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital for better medical attention. She remained under doctors’ observation and was brought back to the jail after her condition stabilised and she was discharged. We still don’t know what medicines she consumed. Prima facie, it appears that she had collected medicines given to inmates for fever, headache and other minor health issues,” Goel said, adding that the jail authorities had informed Punjaban about her conviction a few hours before she overdosed.No police complaint or case has been registered. “We are looking into why she took so many pills,” added the DG.Punjaban, of Haryana’s Rohtak, was last arrested in December 2017 on the complaint of a girl, who alleged that she beat her, drugged her and forced her into prostitution. The girl was 13-years-old when was kidnapped by Punjaban’s associate Sandeep Bedwal in 2009 was and was sold and resold to a score of people in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, including Punjaban, the crime branch team probing the case stated in the charge-sheet filed in 2018.On Thursday, a Delhi court noted that the prosecution has proved the charges against the two accused persons—Sonu Punjaban and Sandeep Bedwal—beyond a reasonable doubt. The court convicted Punjaban for the commission of offences such as procuration of minors, slavery, selling and buying minors for prostitution, poisoning, wrongful confinement and criminal conspiracy under the Indian Penal Code and sections of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act. Bedwal was convicted for kidnapping, procuration of minors, slavery, selling minors for prostitution, rape and criminal conspiracy under the Indian Penal Code.In 2011, the police had booked Punjaban under charges of stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sonu-punjaban-overdoses-in-tihar-jail-after-conviction/story-5waQwVIbQzSyS9fZyp9sNN.html
19-07-2020||City||Rohini road rage: Man arrested for threatening woman with rape||New Delhi: The police have arrested a man for assaulting a woman and threatening her with rape and murder after an altercation over giving passage to each other’s cars in a narrow lane at a residential society in outer Delhi’s Rohini on Friday morning.Two groups were involved in the incident which took place around 11am in the area’s Sector 3 — one with a 28-year-old woman and her husband, while the other family included an elderly man, his two sons and a daughter. The 28-year-old woman alleged that the attackers assaulted and molested her, tried to drag her inside their house, and threatened to rape her while holding her husband at gunpoint. She also accused them of allegedly assaulting her mother as well. A case of assault, wrongful restraint, molestation, sexual harassment and criminal intimidation along with illegal use of a licensed firearm was registered against the other party on the woman’s complaint, said Pramod Kumar Mishra, deputy commissioner of police (Rohini).“We have arrested one of the men from the other party as he used his father’s licensed revolver to threaten the couple. The case is being probed,” he said.A senior police officer associated with the matter said a separate case of assault and molestation was registered against the couple after the woman from the other party lodged her complaint in the evening.“However, no arrest has been made in her case, as she lodged her complaint after the couple filed their complaint. Her allegations are being verified through the eyewitnesses and other available evidence,” said the officer who did not want to be named.The police said the couple was returning to Noida. Their car was near the exit gate when an SUV, in which were travelling a father and son, entered the lane through the same gate. Both cars stopped in front of each other, and the parties asked each other to reverse the vehicle and give a passage to their car, said another officer, quoting the couple’s complaint.The couple reversed their car after a security guard deployed at the gate intervened. While crossing each other they hurled objectionable remarks on each other following which a fight broke out between them. The couple alleged that the father-son duo called their two family members living in a nearby building and they assaulted them.“The son driving the SUV took his father’s licensed revolver and put it at the abdomen of the woman’s husband while his brother twisted her arm and threatened to rape her. When the woman’s mother came and intervened, they manhandled her as well,” the officer cited above said.The fight stopped after some residents intervened. The couple called the police and informed them about the incident. Their medical examination was conducted at a nearby hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rohini-road-rage-man-arrested-for-threatening-woman-with-rape/story-n5hBJllsrPlu8RIPQH5gfJ.html
19-07-2020||Delhi||Guest teachers claim being made to sign Covid undertaking, govt says no such order issued||Several guest teachers employed on contractual basis in government schools alleged that they have been asked to sign an undertaking by the principals declaring that they would not claim compensation or monetary help in case they are infected with Covid-19 while on duty. Officials in the Delhi government, however, said that no such order has been issued to schools. Around 20,000 guest teachers, employed in Delhi government schools on a contractual basis, found themselves out of jobs after their contracts lapsed in May. Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia had, on July 2, announced that these teachers must be engaged in the online teaching taking place in all government schools amid the Covid-19 pandemic. On July 13, the Delhi of Education (DoE) issued an order to all its schools stating, “Heads of Schools (HoS) are advised to engage willing guest teachers wherever required for the online teaching-learning activities.”Earlier this week, many of them were called back to work. However, the schools have asked them to sign an undertaking stating, “I know that on account of the spread of the Covid-19 contagion, my health may be at risk. I will not claim any compensation or monetary benefits in case of infection during the normal discharge of my duties towards the school and students.”DoE director Binay Bhushan said that the education department has not issued any order asking schools to make the teachers sign such an undertaking. “The government has given compensation to only those who were infected with or died of the coronavirus disease while on duty. We will look into the matter and issue notices to the schools who are doing this,” he said. Education minister Manish Sisodia, when asked about the matter, said, “The government has not issued any such order.”A senior official in his office echoed his statement and said, “No such direction has been issued to the HoSs. The education department will take action against any HoS who does this.”Several guest teachers on Saturday said that they were asked to sign a similar undertaking. “This is the first time we have been asked to sign such a threatening undertaking while joining work. It’s absolutely unnecessary,” a teacher working at Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya in Mangolpuri said.Head of the School (HoS) Seema Puri said that the undertaking was a way to ensure that the guest teachers were “willing” to work amid the pandemic. “The government has been giving monetary help to teachers infected with Covid-19 on duty. There is no such provision for the guest teachers. So, we are making sure that they do not claim any such compensation in future,” she said.Another guest teacher at Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya (SBV) in Noor Nagar said that he and his colleagues were made to sign a similar undertaking. When contacted, HoS Nazakat Ali said, “The schools have decided to take an undertaking to ensure that they do not later say that they were asked to join work forcefully amid the pandemic.”Praveen Tobaria, the president of the All India Guest Teachers’ Association, said that the department should remove the word “willing” from its order. “There is no much confusion over this word ‘willing’ in the order. Schools are interpreting it according to their convenience. All the guest teachers are willing to join duty. Such an undertaking clearly show that the schools are trying to discourage them from joining,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/guest-teachers-claim-being-made-to-sign-covid-undertaking-govt-says-no-such-order-issued/story-VMXptklYHyQyfbpJpMzKdL.html

The body was found in the water close to a spot where a Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) bus was submerged in the waterlogged underpass. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative figures for the city, recorded 74.8mm rainfall till 8:30am.It added that Ridge, Lodhi Road, Palam and Ayanagar weather stations recorded 86 mm, 81.2mm, 16.9mm and 12.2mm rainfall, respectively.Rainfall below 15mm is considered light, between 15mm and 64.5mm moderate, and above 64.5mm heavy.The department has predicted thunderstorm with rain in the national capital and neighbouring areas till Tuesday.

Monsoon reached Delhi on June 25, two days earlier than its usual date, but despite the early arrival rains had remained subdued so far.Weather forecasting agencies have said Delhi and its adjoining states of Punjab and Haryana are likely to experience continuous rainfall typical of the rainy season from Sunday as the monsoon trough is likely to shift to its normal position.The northern plains have received only patchy rains since the beginning of July as the axis of the monsoon trough had been oscillating north and south frequently (towards and away from the Himalayan foothills), private Skymet Weather said.It said the trough will move north and stabilise for the next three to four days and that a significant increase in rainfall in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab can be expected from July 19 to July 21.IMD has predicted normal rainfall in the national capital during the season.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/rains-hit-parts-of-delhi-showers-to-continue-till-tuesday/story-hyBuHloaGtopUpXFLhiZOP.html
19-07-2020||Delhi||Shravan Shivratri: Denizens celebrate with small acts of kindness||Unlike previous years, the celebration of Shivratri in the month of Shravan ie monsoon will be of a different kind. Due to the pandemic, most of the temples are shut and even the Kanwar Yatra couldn’t take place. So, the devotees have found another way to pray to Shiva. On this day, rather than offering milk, sweets, fruits, etc to the shivalinga, Delhi-NCR residents have taken up initiatives to help the needy. And it is though their acts of kindness towards human beings and animals that they are endeavouring to get closer to God. Naman Goyal, a 21-year-old student of Delhi University, says, “My dad often visit a cow shelter (Gopal Gaushala in Aravalli hills, Faridabd) to feed the cows. So I thought it would be good idea to accompany him on Shivratri, and feed the blind and disabled cows and their calves. There are around 1,300 cows in that shelter and the care taker plays instrumental flute music on speakers to make the atmosphere soothing and peaceful. You actually feel closer to God in such an environment.”Everyone has their way to extend help the needy. While some feel happy in the company of animals, others such as Kritika Kamra, a Noida-based homemaker, feels it’s the company of kids that makes her feel closer to God. Kamra explains, “On my son’s birthday ever year, I donate for the welfare of underprivileged children. So, this year, I decided to make the donation on Shivratri, which will be the birthday of lord Shiva. I believe a smile on the faces of children can impress anyone, even God. I have even set aside the money, which I use to spend in purchasing milk that was to be offered to the Shivalinga, and will use this to support the needs of these children.”Every small initiative leads to a bigger change and can even change our lives. Shweta Sharma, a Delhiite, has plans to sponsor the education of a child. “One of my friends informed me about a boy who wants to study but can’t, due to financial crunch. I asked my family and friends to help, and we have now decided that together we will enable him to get into a good school. This is my offering to lord Shiva this Shivratri, and what could be better than helping a child get access to good education? Shiksha daan is also given importance in our culture, and no doubt it brings us close to our God!”Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/shravan-shivratri-denizens-celebrate-with-small-acts-of-kindness/story-9vw9VxrEkdIrpfE8kmToxO.html

19-07-2020||Delhi||SDMC to levy professional tax on firms in 2-3 months||Professionals working in south Delhi areas will have to shell out more money on taxes in the coming months as the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) will soon start collecting a ‘professional tax’ from companies operating in areas under its jurisdiction.According to SDMC officials, the civic body is planning to implement professional tax over the next two months. Self-employed professionals such as doctors, lawyers, chartered accountants, and architects, among others, will also have to pay the new professional tax. However, those earning less than ₹20,000 a month have been kept out of the ambit of the new tax.A senior SDMC official, on condition of anonymity, said a plan to implement professional tax has already been finalised and it will now be passed by the House on July 27. The official said the professional tax is collected against the amenities being provided by the civic body to professionals and companies.“Since the proposal has already been approved by the standing committee, there will be no problem in getting it passed by the House. After that, it will be sent to the Delhi government for a gazette notification and then we will start collecting the tax from companies and self-employed professionals. The new tax is likely to be implemented in two month’s time,” the official quoted above said.As per the move, a professional tax of ₹150 per person per month will be collected from those earning between ₹20,000 and ₹50,000 a month while it would be ₹200 per person per month for those earning above ₹50,000 per month. The tax will be charged even if the person doesn’t live in the SDMC areas but works there. Traders will remain outside the ambit of the tax.The official said this would be the first time that a professional tax is being implemented in Delhi. This tax is already levied in 19 states across the country, including Maharashtra, West Bengal, Bihar and Gujarat, among others.These recommendations for realising a professional tax were made in the SDMC’s 2020-21 budget proposal for the enhancement of revenue. SDMC officials said the new tax will net the corporation an income of ₹50 crore a year.Anamika Mithilesh, SDMC mayor, said in the past few years, the civic body had refrained from imposing this tax on the public but this year due to “acute fund crunch”, the proposal was approved.“Instead of relying solely on funds from the state or central government, we are taking steps to increase our revenue by enhancing our sources of income. This year, our income has gone down drastically due to the Covid-19 pandemic and so we decided to go ahead and levy the professional tax. This move will bring a revenue of ₹50 crore a year to the cash-strapped civic body. We are hopeful of people’s support in this regard,” the mayor said.Mithilesh said very soon, notices would be issued to firms operating in SDMC areas informing them about the professional tax and its modalities. The companies will be asked to submit the amount to the civic body after a gazette notification from the Delhi government.A second official, also on condition of anonymity, said efforts are being made to add professional tax to the house tax bills so that people can pay it along with the property tax. He, however, said modalities on this front are being worked out.“It can be collected online as well as offline. Professional tax will be collected from all companies and self-employed people whose office is in SDMC areas. The maximum tax will be ₹200 per month or ₹2,400 annually. The minimum will be ₹150 a month or ₹1,800 annually,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sdmc-to-levy-professional-tax-on-firms-in-2-3-months/story-p73nzfihathJOTQpF4bjzJ.html
19-07-2020||Delhi||Row over prosecutors in Delhi riots cases escalates||The ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday objected to interventions by lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal in the judicial representation of cases on the northeast Delhi riots and anti-citizenship amendment act (CAA) protests even as the L-G’s office sent a letter to the CM saying the government must decide if the police proposal to appoint six lawyers was acceptable to it.Baijal said in the letter that despite the police justifying its choice of lawyers, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia rejected the proposal.“Since the difference of opinion still persists, I would request the chief minister to expeditiously refer the matter to the Council of Ministers under Rule 49 of TBR of GNCTD, 1992 with Section 45 (c) of the Government of NCT Act, 1991. In view of urgency and sensitivity of the matter, it is requested that the decision of cabinet be communicated expeditiously, preferably within a week,” stated the contents of the letter as read out by an official in Sisodia’s office.If the Delhi Cabinet decides to hold on to its stand of appointing its own panel of lawyers led by Delhi government counsel Rahul Mehra, then the L-G is likely to refer the matter to the President exercising his powers in the event of a difference of opinion with the elected government, said an official in the L-G office.Reacting to the letter, Kejriwal in an interview to HT on Saturday said the decision to frequently use gubernatorial powers in cases of difference of opinion with the elected government was against the spirit of a Supreme Court judgment dated July 4, 2018. The latest disagreement has been over the appointment of public prosecutors, most recently in the hiring of lawyers to represent the state in the northeast Delhi riots cases.“I personally feel that the Centre’s decision to use this extraordinary power in the matter of deciding the advocates is not in the correct spirit of the SC judgment, according to me. Deciding on lawyers does not account for a ‘rarest of rare case’. But, still, they keep using that power,” Kejriwal said.Officials said there was a meeting between Baijal and Sisodia through video conference on Friday to settle differences, but the matter could not be resolved.Senior AAP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh said, “The AAP government in Delhi is committed to providing the strictest possible punishment to all those involved in these riots. But for that to happen, an independent investigation by the police and a free and fair trial are a must. The L-G and the central government are insisting on the appointment of a panel of special public prosecutors chosen by the central government.”“This is happening when there are very serious allegations on the response of Delhi Police to these riots as well as how the investigation process is going on... If they are under the central government and appointed by Delhi Police itself, their independence is under serious question.”The L-G office in a statement said the cases pertaining to the northeast Delhi riots and the anti-CAA protests involved large scale communal violence and require careful handling in view of their gravity and deep impact on the society.“As such, effective prosecution in these cases is the need of the hour. Since the cases are of highly sensitive nature, very large in numbers and there are several petitions including bail matters, other applications and writ petitions, these require constant monitoring and coordination across different courts. It was felt that a dedicated team of prosecutors is needed and senior law officers/senior advocates/advocates may also be appointed as Special Public Prosecutors to ensure that the cases are handled properly and in a focused manner,” the L-G office said.On July 10, the Delhi police had sent a proposal to the Delhi government recommending the names of six special public prosecutors including Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi to fight 85 cases related to the riots and the anti-CAA protests in the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/row-over-prosecutors-in-delhi-riots-cases-escalates/story-lriqofsa5qQAMEFbu0dr4H.html
19-07-2020||Delhi||Govt asks panel to look at minimising Covid fatality rate||The Delhi government earlier this week told a 12-member committee, set up on directions of the Supreme Court to inspect Covid-19 hospitals in the national capital, to look into factors that can help reduce the deaths caused by coronavirus disease (Covid-19).According to an office memorandum from Delhi’s principal health secretary Vikram Dev Dutt, the government also provided a checklist containing questions such as time taken for triaging (the practice of assigning treatment based on urgency) Covid-19 patients; if early warning scores to determine whether a patient might deteriorate were followed; and whether the hospital had a standardised investigation protocol. “Since committees constituted for the inspection of hospitals in Delhi, consequent to orders passed by the Supreme Court, are already carrying out their mandate in a continuous manner, it would be appropriate that specific attention may now be focused upon aspects which have a bearing on the reduction of Covid-related mortalities,” the memorandum read.This comes after the Delhi government released protocols for management of Covd-19 patients, including having a dedicated health care worker monitoring each critical patient. The protocols had also said that availability of dialysis has to be ensured by all hospitals as patients with Covid-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome may also develop acute kidney problems.The government had also said hospitals had to set up a proper holding area for Covid-19 patients, apart from ensuring an effective triage and monitoring of oxygen saturation.Dr Mahesh Verma, a member of the committee and vice-chancellor of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, said, “The government has provided us with a checklist of questions to look into whether the hospitals are following protocols for admission, triage, critical care, and infection control. Even one death that can be prevented should be prevented and the committee has just been asked to look into whether there is anything that can be done.” “So far, most deaths in hospitals have been of patients who tried to manage their symptoms at home and reached hospitals only when their lungs were compromised or at a stage when they needed to be put on ventilators and the condition could not be reversed. Earlier, Covid-related deaths were also taking place because doctors did not understand the progression of disease and there was a sudden coagulopathy (formation of clots) or drop in oxygen saturation,” he said.The data provided by the chief minister’s office showed that 691 deaths took place in Delhi between June 24 and July 8, which works out to an average of 46 deaths a day. The numbers have gone down further, with just 26 deaths being reported on July 18 in the daily health bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-asks-panel-to-look-at-minimising-covid-fatality-rate/story-Rd4gbYJDZmetiRUBTZngJP.html

India has conducted about 13.1 million tests, behind only the United States and Russia.Neighbourhood Covid Care Centres were to be operationalised with minimal support from the government in case the number of cases soared and the requirement for beds went up. Besides the creation of Covid care centres in the colonies, the government has also been holding training programmes under the ‘Swasthya Doot’ project to prepare community volunteers in basic health care techniques. Also read: COVID-19 Statistics for IndiaThe ministry guidelines stated that community centre or common utility areas can be used for setting up these centres. Vacant flats that are isolated from occupied ones may also be used. The centre must have a separate entrance and exit gate, follow hand hygiene and thermally scan all persons who enter.Within the centres, the beds have to be placed at a distance of 3 feet and adequate natural ventilation has to be ensured. The air conditioning system should follow the government guidelines of maintaining the temperature between 24°C to 30°C and relative humidity between 40% and 70%, avoid re-circulation of air, and ensure as much intake of fresh air as possible.These centres will be linked to surveillance teams and an ambulance service. They will be staffed by doctors from either within the community or those provided by NGOs. They have to undergo training on a government portal. Support for clinical assessment, sample collection, and transportation will be provided, the guidelines stated.The guidelines also stated that continuous monitoring of the centre (by guards or via video feed) is needed to ensure that patients do not go out.To engage the community in the prevention of the infection, Residents’ Welfare Associations (RWAs) should encourage people above the age of 65, pregnant women, and children to stay at home and keep contact with visitors to a minimum, the ministry stated in another document.The guidelines also called for creating awareness on preventive measures, need for early reporting on the disease and fight the stigma If a colony is declared a containment area then the Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) must facilitate house-to-house screening, ensure daily surveillance, shift suspected cases to the nearest Covid-19 facility, and identify volunteers to ensure the supply of essential services, the guidelines stated.“The involvement of the community is essential when it comes to preventing and managing this infection. The government should have taken steps to involve people from the start. In places such as Delhi and Mumbai, the number of cases has started stabilising—involving the community in setting up Covid care centres in these places would have been helpful. This can be implemented in maybe Bengaluru, Chennai and their outskirts, and some places in Telangana where the number of cases is still quite high or is rising. Other than that, most cities and towns are not too well-planned and have very few gated colonies that can implement this,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, the head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/centre-frames-rules-for-covid-care-centres-in-gated-colonies/story-LyyRMcvYDLjQt7VK4TmUVP.html
19-07-2020||Chandigarh||June versus July: Chandigarh tricity infections already up by 46%||The number of Covid-19 cases reported in the first 18 days of July has already surpassed the total infections reported in June across the tricity.While there were a total of 389 cases across the tricity in June, the number is already 569 this month – a spike of 46%.In Chandigarh, July saw the cases rising by a whopping 72%. Similarly, Mohali had a 54% jump in cases in the same period and Panchkula 51%. (see graphic).According to experts, health authorities should further ramp up tracing and treatment of patients. “There is a possibility that we have reached the stage of community transmission because every positive patient does not have travel or contact history, and at the same time people have gone lax. Public places are flooded with people, with no regard for precautions and social distancing rules,” said Dr Yogesh Chawla, former director, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER).PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said the spurt in cases was on expected lines. However, which way the graph goes in the near future will depend on people’s attentiveness to norms. “It is hard to predict the infection’s spread, but restrictions, which do not harm people’s economic interests, need to be devised and implemented,” he said. WHAT LED TO THE SPIKE?Chandigarh’s director of health and family welfare, Dr G Dewan said the current affairs were similar to those in the neighbouring states.“When the lockdown was in place, the number of cases was low. As the restrictions got eased, borders were reopened and there was an overall surge in infections. In Chandigarh, there are no longer any clusters and most of the cases are limited to families and their contacts,” he said.The rise in cases can also be attributed to a more liberal approach to testing, he said, adding, “Once private labs came into play, more people, irrespective of symptoms, are being tested. This was restricted to only symptomatic people at government labs. But, at the same time, our recovery and fatality rates have improved,” he said.In Panchkula, civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur said most of the recent infections were detected at the quarantine centres established in the ITBP and CRPF stations.“The surge is largely due to ITBP and CRPF personnel returning from various states and being tested positive at the quarantine centres. We have decided to conduct the antibody testing as well. We have received ELISA test kits from the headquarters,” she said. Mohali civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh said the cases in the district soared after the borders were reopened in June. “Several recent infections comprise visitors from outside Mohali,” he said.TESTING LOWEST, POSITIVE CASES HIGHEST IN UTWhile testing is the lowest in Chandigarh in July, the city’s positivity rate remains the highest at 6.3%, followed by Mohali (2.7%) and Panchkula (1.69%).Beginning July, Chandigarh has conducted only 163 tests on average per day. Panchkula tested 269 people a day, while Mohali had the highest tests per day, at 303.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/june-versus-july-chandigarh-tricity-infections-already-up-by-46/story-8eFa1WCBBzeS9a2HDzEOwJ.html

Of the 513 confirmed cases now, 318 have recovered and 11 have succumbed to the virus. The district has 185 active cases.Among those dead is a 43-year-old man from Preet Colony, Zirakpur. He traded in building construction material. “He had diabetes and was also suffering from typhoid,” said Dr Manjit Singh, civil surgeon, Mohali. The patient was under treatment at GMCH, Sector 32, Chandigarh.The other deceased, an 82-year-old man from Kharar, breathed his last at PGIMER, Chandigarh. He was admitted there with acute hypertension and tested positive thereafter.Private hospital sealedThe fresh cases on Saturday included seven staff members of Sohana Eye and Super Specialty Charitable Hospital, Sector 77.Health authorities declared the hospital a containment zone and sealed the entire complex.Earlier on July 15, nine nurses and two doctors of the same hospital had tested positive for Covid 19. The remaining cases were reported from Sector 69, Sunny Enclave, Kharar; AOM Enclave, Kharar; Dhakoli, Sunny Enclave, Zirakpur; High Land Park, Zirakpur; and Peer Muchhala tested positive.“The extensive sampling and contact tracing has brought to fore 21 new Covid-19 cases,” said deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan.“In view of recent spike in cases, sampling has been intensified and extensive contact tracing is afoot to curtail the spread of infection,” he said.Two positive in PanchkulaPanchkula Two persons tested positive in Panchkula on Saturday.

19-07-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 positive P Varavara Rao shifted to Nanavati Hospital||Poet and Elgar Parishad case accused P Varavara Rao, who had on Thursday tested positive for Covid-19 after he was shifted out of jail to a hospital, was moved to Nanavati Hospital from St George’s Hospital on early Sunday.Dr Akash Khobragade, medical superintendent of St George Hospital, said that around 1am, Rao was shifted to Nanavati Hospital for further neurological and urological management. Khobragade confirmed that Rao doesn’t have complications related to Covid-19.Earlier, Mumbai Police sources had confirmed that 81-year-old Rao, who was first moved out of Taloja Jail to Sir JJ Hospital last week, would be shifted to the private hospital. The decision from the state government came a day after the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) issued notices to the Maharashtra government on Friday to ensure the health condition of Rao, arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), is taken care of and adequate medical facilities are arranged. Rao was shifted to Sir JJ Hospital on July 13 after his health started deteriorating.NHRC, based on a complaint from the special monitor of the commission, Maja Daruwala, had issued a notice to the chief secretary and the director-general of prisons of Maharashtra state, asking for a report on the health of Rao within two weeks. It was mentioned in the complaint that Rao was suffering from many ailments, owing to which his health condition was deteriorating.Taking cognisance of the matter, the commission observed that the right to life and medical care is one of the basic human rights and the state is duty-bound to provide a prisoner who is in its custody appropriate medical care so that there should be no danger to his life.The commission has also directed the state to constitute a medical board to examine the health condition of Rao and to see whether the treatment being provided to him is appropriate. The commission has mentioned that the board is expected to decide as to which hospital, whether government or private, will give best medical treatment to Rao. NHRC had also asked the state to provide Rao the best possible treatment in a private hospital and also to ensure to bear all the expenditure for his treatment.Rao was first taken to JJ Hospital on May 28 after he fell unconscious, but was discharged on June 1. The family had alleged that Rao was discharged in a hurried manner to obstruct his bail plea. “He was not normal at the time of discharge. While sodium normal range was 134-145, he attained only 133 and potassium normal range was 3.5 to 5.0, he attained only 3.55, according to the hospital’s own discharge summary. But, later on June 2 it was proved that all this – admission in hospital, getting a normal report, getting him discharged – was part of a conspiracy by the police. June 2 was the date of hearing on his bail application on health grounds in NIA special sessions court and police argued against his bail showing this hospital “normal” report. The judge accepted that and refused bail on June 26,” read a statement from the family.Later, Rao continued to show signs of delirium and after objections from various quarters, Rao was admitted to JJ Hospital again on July 13. On Thursday, Rao tested positive for Covid-19 and was shifted to St George’s Hospital. Rao’s bail plea in the Bombay high court (HC) will be heard today.(With inputs from Rupsa Chakraborty)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/p-varavara-rao-to-be-shifted-to-nanavati-hospital/story-hPN0P5nnmsUje8Jed4wQrJ.html
19-07-2020||City||Covid-19 outbreak: Mumbai stable, other districts in Maharashtra cause for concern||On July 4, Maharashtra had recorded 2 lakh cases of Covid-19. Within 14 days, the state has added another 1 lakh cases, taking its tally to 3,00,937 cases on Saturday. Although Mumbai crossed 1 lakh cases on Saturday, the pandemic curve has plateaued in the city, which has contributed only 19% of the cases in the most recent surge. However, districts such as Thane, Raigad, Pune and Nanded are now major contributors to the spread of Covid-19 in the state.“Till May, Mumbai constituted almost 60% of the total cases recorded in Maharashtra. But gradually, the city started reporting constant numbers of daily cases below 1,500, which helped flatten the pandemic curve in Mumbai. The city was the epicentre, but now the wave has spread to other districts,” said Anup Kumar Yadav, commissioner (family welfare) and director, National Health Mission, Maharashtra.Mumbai now accounts for 33.8% of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 cases and the remaining 66.2% cases have been reported from elsewhere in the state. After Mumbai, Thane has recorded the maximum cases of Covid-19, with its tally rising from 45,833 cases on July 4 to 71,345 on July 14. As per data from the state government, 92,525 new Covid-19 cases have been recorded between July 4 and 17 in Maharashtra.An analysis of all 36 districts in Maharashtra shows Covid-19 cases in Raigad have increased from 5,585 to 10,548 in the last 13 days – an 88.8% rise and the highest in the state. This is followed by Nanded, which recorded an 87% surge with its caseload increasing from 388 to 726 in the same period. Cases in Pune have increased from 26,956 on July 4 to 49,037 on July 17, marking an 81.9% rise.“The pandemic curve may have plateaued in Mumbai, but it is at its peak in other districts. Our main priority is to get more oxygen-supported and intensive care unit (ICU) beds. Also, despite the rise in number of cases, we have been able to keep a check on the mortality rate,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope.Experts have identified several reasons for this gradual increase in the number of cases. First, in mid-May, migrant workers from Mumbai, Pune and neighbouring states returned to their home regions, often without properly-conducted tests. District health officers have complained that many ignored quarantine rules and thus spread the infection. “The returning workers don’t trust us and often try to run away from quarantine centres. If we keep them in home quarantine, they don’t follow social distancing,” said Dr AR Gita, district health officer, Aurangabad.Another reason is that after the lockdown was relaxed from June 3, the infection spread from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) to other regions through people travelling to and from Mumbai. “MMR has a large population, so it was expected that cases would increase with lockdown relaxation,” said Tope.Health officials also pointed to increased testing as a reason for more recorded cases of Covid-19. Dr Sanjay Mukerjee, secretary of the medical education and drugs department said the state at present has 124 testing laboratories with a daily testing capacity of 40,000 samples. “On July 16, we did over 36,500 tests in a day. We have tested more than 15 lakh people, which is a 40% rise over the last three weeks. With increased testing, the number of patients diagnosed with Covid-19 will rise naturally,” said Mukerjee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-outbreak-mumbai-stable-other-districts-in-maharashtra-cause-for-concern/story-JxCPJpWkstOvzkspMigPSN.html
19-07-2020||City||Coronavirus shows no signs of slowing in Maharashtra||The Covid-19 numbers coming every day from Maharashtra dwarfs all other states. In the past week, India’s worst-hit state reported over 75% more daily cases than Tamil Nadu — the state with the second-highest number of new cases.In the past week, until July 17, the state recorded more than 7,700 new cases a day on an average, compared to 6,500 the week before that — a statistic that highlights how cases are still growing in the state. The doubling rate of cases — the number of days it takes for a given number of infections to double — in the state is currently 23.7 days, slightly higher than the national average of 20.6 days.If Maharashtra’s 300,000 cases are divided into bands of 100,000 each, we see that the first 100,000 cases took 96 days (June 12) since the first case was reported in the state. The state touched 200,000 cases 22 days later on July 4. The latest 100,000 cases, however, have come in just two weeks.The positivity rate, too, has shown no signs of slowing down. In the past two months, the weekly average positivity rate in the state has grown from 17.6% to 23.6%, despite a three-fold increase in testing. This means that currently, nearly a quarter of all tests conducted in the state are turning out positive — one of the most alarming trends coming out of the state.In the two other states with high caseloads – Tamil Nadu and Delhi – as the testing has been ramped up, the positivity rate has remained less than half the number in Maharashtra. In Tamil Nadu, the average positivity rate for the week ending July 17 was 10.2% and in Delhi,it was 7.8%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-shows-no-signs-of-slowing-in-maharashtra/story-uJYP3p9Lm7Qx5Kuu9a4deO.html
19-07-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s coronavirus fight enters battle mode as cases cross 3-lakh mark||Maharashtra’s share in India’s Covid-19 tally has declined over the past two months, but it still remains the state with most infections (300,937) and fatalities (11,596). On May 18, Maharashtra accounted for 40.9% of that day’s Covid cases in India – 2,033 of 4,970 cases in 24 hours. The state’s share in the daily rise in infections dropped to 27.6% on June 18, and it was 23.8% on July 17. This is primarily because the state has managed to contain the spread of the virus, while cases in other states have risen at a greater pace. The case fatality rate (CFR), however, has remained a constant worry for Maharashtra, as it stands at 3.85%, second only to Gujarat (4.54%), and more than the national CFR of 2.53%.The state has reported 62,476 infections in the past eight days, with a daily average of 7,809 cases, while the fatalities during the same period are 1,702 at a daily average of 212 deaths.Mumbai, the state’s worst affected city, has 100,350 cases and 5,650 deaths, but the rise in infections in the city has plateaued over the past fortnight. However, other cities in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Nashik, Aurangabad and Jalgaon remain a cause for concern as the cases in these cities have witnessed a massive spike. Currently, the eight civic bodies of Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Mira-Bhayandar, Vasai-Virar, Navi Mumbai, Panvel and Ulhasnagar contribute to 30% of the total cases in Maharashtra. These civic bodies have witnessed more than three times rise in infections in the past four weeks. Many of these cities have poor health infrastructure and it has been the primary reason for the rise in cases, high mortality rate and poor recovery.“Kalyan-Dombivli, Bhiwandi, Mira-Bhayandar, Vasai-Virar, Panvel in MMR and Pune, Jalgaon, Solapur have poor health infrastructure. Besides, the local bodies have failed to aggressively track, trace and isolate suspected contacts of Covid patients. We had directed them to trace at least 10 people per patient, but in some cities, it has not happened, leading to the rise in the cases,” said a senior government official, on condition of anonymity. “Civic bodies like Kalyan-Dombivli, Bhiwandi, Pune and Jalgaon could not ramp up their facilities with oxygen beds and ICUs and failed to cope up with the surge witnessed in the past few weeks. We had to change commissioners of at least six civic bodies in MMR over the past month.”While Mumbai still tops the daily rise in cases – between 1,200 and 1,300 – it is closely followed by Pune, which has reported a daily average of 1,023 cases over the past week. In MMR, Kalyan-Dombivli’s daily average is 470 cases, the highest among other civic bodies. Solapur has the highest CFR (7.4%), followed by Mumbai (5.63%), Jalgaon (5.5%) and Akola (4.9%).Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the 11-member task force constituted for clinical management of patients, said local authorities of areas with the high number of cases need to ramp up their facilities. “I am personally not happy with the infrastructure and the tracing-testing-isolation done by some of the civic bodies like in Kalyan-Dombivli. Testing for coronavirus takes two days and another three to four days for the report to come. They need to go for capacity building for testing, apart from aggressive tracking of the suspected contacts. The civic bodies and districts are also facing shortage of doctors and health experts. If they can match up to these challenges and ready themselves to fight the surge, then it is possible to contain the spread.”The state government, meanwhile, has been closely monitoring the areas with constant rise in cases. “We have been giving projections for 15 days to every district to enable them to ramp up their infrastructure. Barring a few districts or civic bodies like Pune, and civic bodies in MMR, rest of Maharashtra is well equipped to take up the additional load. Even in Pune, they have added 600 oxygen beds two days ago and have started acquiring private hospitals. It is true that in exceptional cases the patients are facing hardships owing to the weak infrastructure, but we have been putting in constant efforts to augment it,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer. Joshi said Mumbai has reached its peak of the infection, while the rest of MMR has entered into peak mode and may stabilise in the next two weeks. “The rest of the state is entering the peak and may see a rise in cases over the next few weeks. In the next four weeks, the entire state can be stabilised,” he said.Awate said they expect the descending limb of the virus spread to begin by mid-August, which is also considered the midpoint of the monsoon season. He said that with more than 35,000 tests daily and introduction of rapid antigen tests, the government expects rapid containment of the transmission of the virus and a drop in CFR. Dr Anil Pachnekar, national vice president of the Indian Medical Association and a private practitioner in Dharavi, said the model used to contain the spread of coronavirus in India’s largest slum will help other parts of the state too. “Dharavi pattern has shown the way by aggressively implementing ‘chase the virus’ mantra with the help of various stakeholders of the society. It has been widely applauded and needs to be implemented across the state, especially in areas with rising numbers. The coronavirus test has been freed from the compulsion of having a doctor’s prescription in Mumbai, while antigen and antibody testing has been introduced across the state. This will help in effective containment of the virus over the next few weeks,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-s-coronavirus-fight-enters-battle-mode-as-cases-cross-3-lakh-mark/story-7UxCaIwk26Pird0FShOs2L.html

She tested positive after her death at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32.“She was brought dead to the hospital on July 16 and sampled. The results are positive. She had undergone an abdominal surgery some years back. She was brought to GMCH with severe abdominal pain, but was declared brought dead,” health officials said.It was on July 13 last when Chandigarh saw the most cases in a day, at 29, from nine different areas.As many as six of the 12 people, who have died of the virus in the city, were aged above 60. Half of the total fatalities occurred in the past two weeks.Among the fresh cases is an employee of Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research. The 42-year-old man lives in Sector 37. Two cases are contacts of an already positive case.Six members of a Sector 29 family, including four males and two females, have also tested positive. They are also contacts of a positive case.Similarly, a one-year-old girl and two persons, aged 62 and 22, from a single family in Sector 27, have contracted the infection from a positive patient.Four persons of one family from Sector 32, which includes two females and two males, have also been found positive.Remaining cases are from Sectors 25, 27, 33, 41 and 44, besides Manimajra, Dhanas and Daria village.Five patients from Khuda Lahora, Sector 45 and Sector 20 were discharged on Saturday, increasing the number of recoveries to 485.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/12th-fatality-in-chandigarh-highest-singl-day-spike-of-31-new-cases/story-GJ0ABIDbmohS9TT24xDM8L.html

The corporation will set up additional 1,000 oxygen beds and 100 intensive care unit (ICU) beds at the Cidco exhibition centre in Vashi, while the facility at India Bulls quarantine centre in Panvel will get 3,000 more beds.Bangar, who has taken charge this week, visited the two NMMC Covid care centres (CCCs) to take a stock of the facilities and services being provided there to the patients.Currently, the Vashi facility has 1,200 beds. “Patients, especially those who are in a serious condition, are finding it difficult to get beds in the city. We will convert 500 beds each in the facility to oxygen-equipped beds in two phases. I inspected the facility along with a team of doctors and we intend to have an ICU facility here with 100 beds in the first phase,” said Bangar.The civic commissioner said that the 3,000 beds that will be set up at the Panvel facility will also include oxygen beds for emergency cases.“The antigen test facility that we have started in our hospitals will be provided to the patients in the Panvel facility also to ensure that results are received immediately and the patient can be treated accordingly. Our objective is to augment the bed facilities in the city so that no patient is without one,” said Bangar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-covid-centres-at-navi-mumbai-to-get-4-100-more-beds/story-nssBTAdXY8pryHFZXQ7tLM.html
19-07-2020||Mumbai||Tell victims about acquittal of accused: Bombay HC to trial courts||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday directed all trial courts to inform victims whenever the accused persons are acquitted so that the victim can effectively exercise his or her right to appeal against the verdict of the trial.“It is a common experience that in most cases, informants [victims of crimes] are not well educated or come from a stratum of society that lacks awareness and nuances involved in the proceedings,” said the bench of justice SS Shinde and justice VG Night, highlighting the importance of informing the victims in time about the acquittal of accused persons.The court has directed that the office of the district magistrate should ensure that a copy of the judgment is provided to the victim, whenever criminal trials result in acquittals so that the victims can exercise their right to appeal in time.The bench fastened the liability on the district magistrates, as under section 365 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), trial courts are mandated to provide a copy of their judgments in criminal trials to the district magistrate within whose jurisdiction the trial is held.The bench noted that district magistrates have the mechanism and manpower to provide copies of judgments to the victims.To ensure that the directive is scrupulously complied with, the bench has directed all trial courts across Maharashtra to maintain a register to record all relevant dates –date of delivery of the judgment, date of dispatch to the office of the district magistrate, and date of receipt of the verdict copy by the victim.The directives were issued on a plea filed by 56-year-old Dharavi resident Ranjana Suryavanshi, seeking condonation of a delay of 717 days in filing an appeal against the acquittal of her son-in-law Jayprakash Gupta.Gupta had been tried for murdering his wife – Suryavanshi’s daughter – and had been acquitted by the Mumbai sessions court on March 13, 2014.Suryavanshi, however, belatedly appealed against the acquittal last year.Her counsel, senior advocate Rajiv Chavan, pointed out that the delay occurred as the 56-year-old applicant was illiterate and financially weak. Chavan argued that the appeal delay should be condoned based on these grounds.HC accepted the submission and condoned the delay. The bench said the delay appears to be huge, but “we cannot be oblivious of the applicant’s social status and financial condition”. The bench also accepted Chavan’s argument that no period of limitation had been prescribed for the victim to prefer an appeal in terms of proviso to section 372 of the CrPC, against the acquittal of the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tell-victims-about-acquittal-of-accused-hc-to-trial-courts/story-Pwm0mbllB46z9yhT8KGY2H.html
19-07-2020||City||Test report mix-up: Recovered patient told to quarantine||The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) on Friday asked a 35-year-old man, who had recovered from Covid-19 two months ago, to shift to a quarantine centre as their records showed him to be positive. TMC called the person several times before reaching his house, despite the person’s claims that he is negative. The corporation later admitted that there was a mix-up in the names and left.The civic body also sanitised the entire building considering him to be positive. The man, Mayur Date, has claimed this has led to lot of mental harassment as his neighbours believed he was infected again. A resident of Vartak Nagar, Date had tested positive for Covid-19 two months ago and was treated for the same, first at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital, then at Thane civil hospital and later he was kept in quarantine in Horizon School. He returned home on May 23.Date said, “On Friday morning, I got a call from TMC telling me that I have tested positive for Covid-19. I thought someone is playing a prank on me as I had not even given a swab sample and ignored the call. Later, I also received a call from Vartak Nagar police station saying the same thing. This scared me and I kept my previous reports ready to show the authorities.”He also approached local politicians to get their help. “The corporation also sanitised my building due to which the residents assumed I have tested positive again. When the employees came home, I showed them all my reports and told them that I had not opted for the test.”Civic officials claimed the mix-up might be the result of similar names. Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner, said, “The confusion must be over two similar names. However, we will conduct an inquiry as to why a negative patient was harassed and ensure such things do not happen again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/test-report-mix-up-recovered-patient-told-to-quarantine/story-PCVl95QQDnKTQZaluS34yL.html
19-07-2020||Mumbai||Pink hue in Lonar Lake due to salt-loving bacteria, says report||Scientists have identified salt-loving bacteria as the reason for change in water colour at Lonar Crater Lake in Buldhana in June, which could also hold true for the pink hue spotted at Talawe wetlands in Navi Mumbai in May.A report by Agharkar Research Institute (ARI) in Pune, an autonomous body under the Department of Science and Technology, said the change in water colour from green to pink was due to the dominance of a pink pigment producing halophilic microbes that grow in an extremely high-saline environment giving a bright pink or reddish appearance.The report, released on Thursday and received by the state forest department on Friday, will be submitted before the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court (HC) on July 22.“Change in colour was due to a salt-loving bacteria (red-coloured archaeal strains classified as halophilic archaea or haloarchaea). It is associated with high salinity and alkalinity (pH),” said Prashant K Dhakephalkar, director of ARI, who carried out the study with Monali Rahalkar, Sumit Dagar, and Karthik Balasubramaniam.A section of the flamingo feeding ground at Talawe wetlands near NRI Complex in Navi Mumbai also witnessed a similar change in water colour in May. “While we did not collect samples from Navi Mumbai area, a similar phenomenon could hold true as characteristic changes in surface water were similar. However, more research is needed,” said Dhakephalkar.Meanwhile, flamingo presence was reported at Lonar Lake in December 2019 and February 2020. ARI’s study identified this as an incidental observation and a unique aspect that might be related to the change in colour. “Flamingos have characteristic pink plumage caused from carotenoids ingested from carotenoid-abundant food sources. Whenever these birds consume food having high halobacterium growth (rich in carotenoid), it helps them gain this pink plumage,” said Dhakephalkar.Manoj Khairnar, deputy conservator of forest, Akola, confirmed flamingo numbers were much higher at Lonar lake this year. The Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) had said 25% more flamingos had visited Mumbai wetlands this migratory season, surpassing 1.5 lakh in April alone.The presence of deep pink colour was noticed towards a section, enclosed from three sides, towards the southeastern end of Talawe from May 13-19. “The enclosed section from three sides allowed stagnation of water where salt concentration increased, allowing rapid bacteria growth,” Dhakephalkar said.The surface water at the 113-hectare Lonar Lake turned reddish-pink during first week of June. Worried about increasing water pollution, the Maharashtra forest department requested ARI Pune and the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Nagpur to assess the cause of discolouration. “NEERI will be submitting its report directly to the HC next week. Open defecation and sewage discharge was a cause of concern but ARI’s report denies any increase in water pollution,” said Khairnar.At Lonar Lake, alkaline (pH) levels were 9.8 as opposed to 7 which is neutral. Salinity was over 6%, whereas over 3% is considered a high-saline environment, said Dhakephalkar adding, “Due to the lockdown there was no dilution in water. High-salinity and pH allowed rapid conducive growth of halobacteria. When the rains set in both parameters dropped, and green algae growth allowed normal water colour to return.”The study also reported presence of an algal species (Dunaliella algae) in Lonar Lake, previously reported from Mumbai saltpans and Rajasthan’s Sambhar Lake. “We initially thought the pink hue was an algal bloom, but on studying water samples we realised that halobacteria population was much higher than algae.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pink-hue-in-lonar-lake-due-to-salt-loving-bacteria-says-report/story-f0izImYoB3cnWPU3pfkAFM.html

Kherwadi police had arrested the six for assaulting three men at Sant Gyaneshwar Nagar in Bandra (East).As per protocol, the accused were tested after being arrested. “Five of them tested positive for the virus. And as a precautionary measure, we have asked our men to home quarantine,” said deputy commissioner of police Zone -8, Manjunath Singe.Dnyaneshwar Khollam, senior inspector of Kherwadi police station, said, “Once we received the test results of the accused, we immediately shifted them to a Covid care centre (CCC) at Vakola.”According to police, the incident of rioting occurred on July 13, around 2pm, when eight people attacked 29-year-old Gyaneshwar Upadhyay. Upadhyay was standing with his two friends when the accused, equipped with swords, knives, choppers, and blades, attacked them due to a fall out because of an old enmity between two groups. Locals who witnessed the attack informed the police.Six of the accused were arrested after a first information report (FIR) was registered against eight accused under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Arms Act, and Maharashtra Police Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/5-policemen-home-quarantined-after-5-arrested-accused-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-5tS0EXXVPgdHxZYAozTPtO.html

The police also seized ₹11.10 lakh from the accused.After receiving a tip-off, Palghar superintendent Dattatray Shinde directed the LCB to conduct the raid. The accused gathered from different parts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region as well as Gujarat.“The accused flouted social distancing norms and none of them were wearing masks. They also violated section 144 (unlawful assembly) imposed by the Palghar collector. On Saturday, the Vasai court granted all the 34 accused bail,” said assistant police inspector Santosh Gurjar of LCB, Palghar.Meanwhile, Shinde is to initiate an inquiry against the Waliv police for failing to conduct the raid in the alleged incident. “Based on the inquiry, we will take action against Waliv police,” said Shinde. In a similar incident in September 2018, the then Palghar superintendent took action against five officers of Waliv police station, as they did not act against a gambling racket in a resort on the highway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/34-held-in-vasai-for-gambling-11l-seized/story-P4A9XqkJOLUb2ODa13KWhO.html
19-07-2020||City||Will state home minister apologise for Panvel Covid facility rape incident: Kirit Somaiya||Former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Member of Parliament (MP) Kirit Somaiya on Saturday demanded an apology from Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh over the Panvel Covid centre rape incident. Despite repeated attempts, Deskhmukh was not available for comment.On Thursday evening, a 25-year-old man posed as a doctor and allegedly sexually assaulted a 40-year-old woman at the centre.Somaiya, along with BJP Maharashtra vice-president Chitra Wagh and Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC) mayor Kavita Choutmol, met the local police, demanding an upgrade in the security at Covid-19 quarantine centres. He later visited the Indiabulls quarantine facility in Kongaon, where the incident took place.“I have a question for home minister Anil Deshmukh. When will you apologise to the people of Maharashtra for this incident? What will the [Uddhav] Thackeray government do to ensure such an incident is not repeated?” Somaiya said at the quarantine facility.Choutmol demanded that the men and women’s wards be separated at all centres.“Only one person is admitted in a room to ensure infection does not spread. So the security at the quarantine centres should be upgraded,” said Choutmol.She also issued a press release stating that the administration should appoint security personnel at the facility. “At a time when coronavirus already spread fear among people, such an act can only be committed by a monster,” the press release added.Referring to last year’s police encounter of four men accused in the gang rape and murder of a 27-year-old veterinarian, Choutmol said, “Such a monster should be given the same punishment given [to the accused] in the Hyderabad incident.”Meanwhile, Wagh cornered the state government over women’s security and demanded action against the administration and security personnel for negligence.“The woman visited the centre for her treatment. The accused should get punishment, but action should also be initiated against the administration and security staff as their negligence led to the incident. Women have been molested at various quarantine centres in Maharashtra, and this incident raises further questions on women’s security. The government must tell us if women should go to Covid centres for treatment or die at home?” Wagh added.Meanwhile, Raigad guardian minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Aditi Tatkare also demanded strict punishment for the accused. “I have spoken to the police officials and have demanded strict punishment for the accused,” she said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-home-minister-apologise-for-panvel-covid-facility-rape-incident-kirit-somaiya/story-pjD3RDHSfJEMqXuzNtmiiL.html
19-07-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana records 17 deaths, 750 fresh virus infections||Haryana on Saturday recorded 17 deaths and 750 fresh Covid-19 infections, taking the total number of positive cases in the state to 25,547, officials said.The death toll in the state has risen to 344.

19-07-2020||City||Period till monsoon ends is crucial for Mumbai, says additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani||As Mumbai crossed the grim milestone of one lakh Covid-19 cases on Saturday, Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), said the number of cases being reported every day in the city will “remain in the same range or may go down”. Kakani, who is in-charge of the civic body’s public health department, has played a crucial role in handling the Covid-19 outbreak in Mumbai. It has been four months since the first case was reported in Mumbai. What is your take on the current situation? What does the future hold?A lot has happened in the past four months, but in the past month, the situation has only improved in Mumbai, with the recovery rate touching 70%. The recovery rate going up has also resulted in active cases going down, and that has helped us to be ready with more beds for a future surge. The number of cases has stabilised and we have not seen more than 1,500 cases in a day, except for a couple of days. I feel the number of cases may remain the same or may go down in the coming days, but we are ready for a scenario if there is a surge in cases. The BMC has liberalised testing and has tested over four lakh persons till now. How are you planning to increase the number of tests in the city?We have been conducting around 6,000 to 7,000 tests every day, and the number will only increase in the coming days. We have also seen an increase in tests after we allowed citizens to get tested without prescription. In addition, we conduct around 600-700 tests every day using the rapid antigen kits. In the coming week, we plan to increase the number of tests using antigen kits to around 1,500-2,000 every day. The area where these kits will be used will also be increased. Currently, these kits are being used in the western and eastern suburbs, but we will expand it. We are also taking blood samples in the form of a sero-surveillance test to understand the development of antibodies in citizens.How many more months or days are crucial for Mumbai? When can we see situation normalising?We need to understand that there is no definite period to say when the situation will be normal. I can’t comment on a time limit for conducting tests, tracing and treating people. Each passing day is crucial for Mumbai. The period until the monsoon gets over will be very crucial. We also have to deal with other diseases such as malaria and dengue during this period. Even after the monsoon, we can’t say that the virus will be eliminated. We can’t eliminate, but control its spread until we have a vaccine or medicine to treat the disease. When can we expect more relaxations in the city or will there be further lockdowns?Locking down the city again is not something that is on the cards currently. We are working out details and in the next 15 days we might be in a position to allow small- and medium-sized restaurants to reopen. But that does not mean big restaurants will not be allowed to reopen. We will have to maintain a balance. In case of gyms and theatres, we might have to wait some more time. Gyms are confined air-conditioned spaced. There is exercise equipment, which is frequently touched by multiple individuals. There are similar issues in case of theatres. We will have gradual reopening and citizens will have to take all precautions.What are the areas of concern for BMC?The area of concern in terms of Mumbai remains the number of cases increasing in high-rises and multi-storey buildings. Cases in slums have been controlled. We are now focussing on high-rises. Another important factor is the number of cases being reported in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). It is equally important that cases in MMR come under control. We are giving all assistance to the municipal corporations and councils in MMR.What about the shortage of crucial medicines required for treatment of Covid-19 patients? There have also been allegations that there is not enough medical staff available for the newly built Covid-19 centres. As far as civic run hospitals are concerned, there is no shortage of medicines to treat patients of Covid-19. We have sufficient medicines at civic run hospitals. It will not be correct to say that there is a shortage of doctors in jumbo facilities. We have kept the facilities ready in advance, considering it is monsoon. We will use them as and when required. Is the capacity of Covid-19 care centre is more and the admissions there are less, that’s not because there is shortage of staff. We are treating every single patient. What about the Covid-19 deaths happening in the city? The fatality rate is around 5.50%-5.75 %.We are constantly taking steps to bring down the fatality rate in Mumbai, and have implemented various measures for it. If we compare these deaths with the overall deaths that take place in the city, the number is not that high. But definitely, we are working towards bringing the fatality rate at par with the national average. Kerala on Friday became the first state to confirm that community transmission of Covid-19 has occurred in two coastal hamlets of capital Thiruvananthapuram and asked people to be extra vigilant. Is there community transmission in Mumbai?We have to understand that the BMC can’t make or announce this. In case of Mumbai, we are not claiming or even predicting that there is community transmission. This has been our stand. However, we are working on understanding the spread of the disease in the city. Currently, we are taking around 10,000 blood samples from three wards in the city as part of a sero-surveillance test. After collecting these samples and knowing their results, we will undertake such a drive again in these areas. However, that will be later, and the sample size might not necessarily be the same, but it will help us analyse the spread of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/period-till-monsoon-ends-is-crucial-for-mumbai-says-additional-municipal-commissioner-suresh-kakani/story-1B1QoTk5nWR4j9gbqnBM1I.html
19-07-2020||Mumbai||78 people duped of ₹12 crore by investment firm||The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Mumbai Police has booked six co-owners of a firm and their two relatives for allegedly duping 78 people to the tune of ₹12 crore by accepting money from them by offering 12% annual interest. The accused used the money to invest in other firms for higher returns, but they failed to return the interest as well as the principle amount to investors. According to EOW officers, the complainant, Rajesh Shah, a resident of Goregaon, has alleged that Ramnik Hashmukh Associate lured him into investing money by offering 1 to 1.05% interest per month, in 2016. “The firm gives a promissory note to investors as an acknowledgement. The said note was allegedly also signed by concerned executives of the firm where the investor’s money would be further invested for high returns,” said a police officer.Shah, who works at a senior post in a private bank, was also promised by the accused firm that they would return the money within a month if the investor wishes to withdraw the amount.Shah invested ₹48 lakh and initially received the interest regularly. However, since January 1, 2018, he has not received any interest or principal, following which he filed a complaint, a copy of which is with HT.Later, Shah learnt that many others also did not get the money from the firm and visited the firm’s Matunga office together. The firm told them that they were facing a major crisis due to demonetisation.However, investors later found out that the firm invested their money in eight other companies under their relative’s names.Shah and 77 other investors then approached EOW.All six of the firm’s co-partners Hasmukh Gogari, Ramnik Dedhia, Dilesh Vira, Mukesh Chheda, Pankaj Chheda, Kushal Chheda and their relatives Hemant Chheda and Jayesh Dedhia are named as accused in the case and have been booked under sections 409 (breach of trust), 420 (cheating), 120B (conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and 3 and 4 of Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) Act. The case was first registered at Matunga police station, later EOW took over the investigation, said an officer requesting anonymity.Calls to Ramnik Hasmukh Associates went unanswered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/78-people-duped-of-12-crore-by-investment-firm/story-LCMWMRBfi0Eug3nNJMd2hL.html
19-07-2020||Mumbai||Yuva Sena moves Apex court against UGC directive to hold final-year exams||Shiv Sena’s youth wing Yuva Sena, which is led by Maharashtra environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray, filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court (SC) on Saturday against the University Grants Commission’s (UGC) decision to hold final-year exams in universities by September-end.“Today Yuva Sena has filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court with a humble prayer to save lives of lakhs of students, teachers, non-teaching staff and their families by asking the UGC to not be stubborn about enforcing examinations when India has crossed the 10-lakh cases mark,” Thackeray tweeted.Calling the UGC’s decision “bizarre”, he further wrote, “We believe that academic excellence can’t be judged by 1 examination and for academic excellence, we must calculate the aggregate marks of the past semesters. Beyond which, if students still feel the need to appear for an examination, they voluntarily may do so post-Covid.”Yuva Sena’s secretary Varun Desai, in a video released on Saturday, said that despite writing to the UGC and the Human Resource Development ministry, the student group did not receive any reply from either of the two authorities.“Maharashtra government already cancelled the final-year exams and we want the same decision to be taken for the entire country. In the past 10-15 days, we received messages from lakhs of students seeking our support on the issue,” Desai said in the video. The Congress, which is in coalition with the Shiv Sena in the state, also supported the latter’s decision.“Conducting exams in the background of the #COVID-19 is the culmination of insensitivity (sic),” tweeted Satyajeet Tambe, president of the Maharashtra State Youth Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yuva-sena-moves-apex-court-against-ugc-directive-to-hold-final-year-exams/story-ryI2zQGSBSqxLwzszTEJqK.html
19-07-2020||Mumbai||Four held for beating 37-year-old to death, driving over body||Shivaji Nagar police arrested four accused on Friday for allegedly kidnapping and murdering a 37-year-old man a month ago near Turbhe in Navi Mumbai. The victim, identified as Ahadullah Khan, a painter, was kidnapped in a vehicle from Govandi on June 17. According to police, the accused — Naushad Khan, 50; Ramkumar Nirmal alias Devraj, 28; Noor Alam Munir Khan, 38; and Mohammed Taki Ahmed Shaikh, 28 — attacked Khan with iron rods and killed him. The main accused in the case, Naushad, then decided to place the victim’s body on the highway near Turbhe and drive over his head to make it look like an accident. When the matter came to the notice of Turbhe police, they registered a first information report (FIR) against an unknown person for causing death due to rash and negligent driving.On June 18, when the victim did not return home, his wife registered a missing complaint at Shivaji Nagar police station.Datta Nalavade, deputy commissioner of police (preventive), and in-charge of Zone 6, said, “Our teams started questioning several people, and Sajid, Khan’s brother, told us that Naushad had threatened the victim and had refused to return ₹1.5 lakh that he had borrowed.” Naushad and his friends were called for questioning, and Mohammed informed police officers about the murder and accident set-up in Turbhe. “Naushad was lying, but when we confronted him with facts that we had learnt from his accomplices, he confessed to the crime,” said Nalawade.Turbhe police were informed about the incident, and Khan’s wife was taken to the hospital to identify his body.“During Naushad’s questioning, we learnt that he had an affair with Khan’s wife. He had also borrowed money which Khan was asking him to return. Naushad then plotted to murder Khan,” said Kishor Gayke, senior inspector at Shivaji Nagar police station. Police have not yet identified Khan’s wife as a conspirator in the murder and are investigating the case further. The four arrested accused have been remanded in police custody till Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/four-held-for-beating-37-year-old-to-death-driving-over-body/story-vUUO2jmEacjBModtUTZXUK.html
19-07-2020||Mumbai||Cancel retest for failed Class 9, 11 students: Parents to state||Parents of several students who failed to clear their Class 9 and 11 exams urged the state education department to cancel the mandatory re-exams and instead promote students to the next class.On Friday, a group of parents from the city wrote to the state, threatening to stage a hunger strike on July 21 if their children are not promoted.“We understand that our children have to take a re-exam to be promoted. But an exam can’t be conducted anytime soon in the current situation, and so it is better to promote them. Students are currently awaiting a decision by the state amid anxiety and uncertainty, even as they started attending online teaching sessions for Class 10 or 12,” said a parent of a student at a Dadar-based school.Education commissioner Vishal Solanki said a decision on the issue will be taken soon. “The Maharashtra State Council of Educational Research and Training will be submitting a proposal to the government soon,” he said.Earlier, the education department cancelled the exams for Class 1 to 8 in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak and the ensuing lockdown, after which schools promoted the students on the basis of internal assessments. However, for Class 9 and 11, re-exam is mandatory for students who failed, to be promoted to Class 10 and 12. But owing to the lockdown, schools could not conduct these exams until now. Meanwhile, the state allowed these students to attend classes for the next year.Rajendra Ahire, deputy director of Mumbai region, said schools can conduct online retests to promote students who failed Class 9 and 11. “Students can’t go to school for exams in the current situation. But schools can hold online exams for such students as a way out,” he said.Shivnath Darade, secretary of Shikshak Parishad, a teachers’ group, said the state should consider the unprecedented circumstances and cancel re-exams. “Many students failed this year because they have not been evaluated on their final exams. This is unjust to them and they should be promoted,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cancel-retest-for-failed-class-9-11-students-parents-to-state/story-jyUlEOmmS5GHE4GYYG1WBM.html
19-07-2020||Mumbai||Satara start-up provides ready-to-eat packets to isolation centres||A Satara-based start-up that works in partnership with the Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT), Mumbai, is supplying ready-to-eat food packets to Covid-19 isolation centres and frontline workers across the state, thus also helping reduce food waste in these facilities.Trilok Foods India processes fresh agricultural produce to make preservatives-free ready-to-eat packets that have a shelf life of up to one year. “All you have to do is place the packets in hot water and enjoy the meal,” said Gourang Potnis, managing partner of the firm. The retort processing technology to dehydrate food items and increase their shelf life used by the start-up was developed by Smita Lele, a food tech engineer and a professor at ICT. “In most isolation centres, there is no fixed head count and the number of food consumers varies every day. If fresh food is cooked, it either falls short or there is excess which gets wasted. Our ready-to-eat packets are handy in such situations,” Potnis said. Trilok is supplying two meals a day and a breakfast to three isolation centres in Pune and also serving frontline workers in Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur. “We have supplied sample packets to a few centres in Mumbai as well. We are hoping to start delivering food in Mumbai soon,” said Potnis. While the breakfast menu includes Poha, Shira and Upma, meals include chapatis, rice and curry. The start-up was established three years ago with the intent to provide quality and hygienic ready-to-eat snacks and staples for mobile consumers, particularly those who do not have the access to home-cooked foods due to hectic lifestyles. The manufacturing facility situated near Satara has a capacity of processing 1.5 tonne of food each day and is equipped with requisite technology that produces ISO 22000 certified products. It is a public-private enterprise between the start-up and ICT, Mumbai. Lele said the start-up was working with 80 farmers in Satara who are paid assured prices. “Unlike most companies offering a fixed contract to farmers, Trilok provides assured prices irrespective of market fluctuations. Trilok also lets farmers sell their produce directly in the market if they get a better price, so farmers have a lot of freedom,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/satara-start-up-provides-ready-to-eat-packets-to-isolation-centres/story-pLZawi9CxJKgmrYR1QdXEL.html
19-07-2020||Mumbai||Two Mumbai teenagers help NGO raise funds for 1.3 lakh meals for the poor||With the Covid-19 outbreak leaving many in need of relief, some agencies like the non-governmental organisation (NGO) Indian Development Foundation (IDF) have found support coming from unexpected avenues. Two teenagers from Mumbai have helped IDF raise funds to mobilise 1.32 lakh meals for the needy in the city.IDF’s Meal to Heal program IDF has provided 1.5 million meals in the Mumbai metropolitan region (MMR) so far, said Dr Narayan Iyer, chief executive officer at IDF. “We got a lot of support from several youngsters in the city. We have been running our community kitchens for more than 100 days now. We have also provided meals and dry ration kits to 200 transgenders in Mumbai,” said Iyer.In June, 16-year-old Rajveer Bothra took to Instagram and Whatsapp to talk about the Meal to Heal program, which provides dry rations and organises community kitchens. Bothra asked friends and friends to each donate Rs 600 to the program which would help IDF provide a week’s dry ration to a family or make 30 meals in one of their community kitchens. “Within 10 days, we raised around Rs 2 lakh,” said Bothra, a resident of Malad.Ananya Dalmia, 17, also helped IDF by creating a presentation about its projects and approaching private companies in the city for donations. “With the help of my parents, I could reach out to several corporates,” said Dalmia, who is also volunteering with the NGO Magic Bus India Foundation for an upcoming fundraiser.Both Dalmia and Bothra had previously volunteered with IDF. “Looking at what was happening, I felt I needed to do something. So I called IDF, which asked me to help them raise funds,” said Bothra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/two-mumbai-teenagers-help-ngo-raise-funds-for-1-3-lakh-meals-for-the-poor/story-naLTSqWqFVmTfYsQZ5qAcP.html
19-07-2020||Mumbai||No impediment in granting temporary parole to Pocso convicts: HC||Observing that there is no impediment in releasing persons convicted under provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012 on temporary parole, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday ordered that a Pocso convict be released on parole for 30 days.“Considering the language of the notification dated May 8, 2020 and particularly in view of the fact that the offence under Pocso Act is not mentioned in the proviso which bars for grant of parole, there should not be any impediment for releasing the petitioner on parole,” said the bench of justice AS Chandurkar and justice Amit Borkar, and granted parole to 27-year-old convict presently lodged in Amravati central jail.The bench was referring to the notification issued by Maharashtra home department by which Rule 19 of the Maharashtra Prisons (Bombay Furlough and Parole) Rules, 1959 has been amended to allow decongestion of prisons by granting certain convicts temporary parole and furlough leaves in view of Covid-19 contagion.The bench accepted the argument advanced on behalf of the convict that under the proviso to the amended rule, conviction under Pocso Act is no longer a disqualification for availing parole or furlough leaves.The proviso to Rule 19 states that prisoners convicted for serious economic offences or bank scams or offences under special Acts (other than IPC) like Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, Prevention of Money Laundering Act, Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (In Financial Establishments) Act, Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act etc. which provide for additional restrictions on grant of bail, shall not be released on temporary parole or furlough.The bench said there was no impediment in granting temporary parole to the convict “considering the language of the proviso and particularly in view of the fact that the offence under Pocso Act is not mentioned in the proviso which bars grant of parole.”Besides, the bench also noted that some other Pocso convicts have been released by the jail authorities on parole. The convict had moved HC after his plea for parole leave was rejected by jail authorities. He had sought leave to attend to his ailing sister, but the jail authorities rejected the plea on the grounds that he had not submitted any proof showing his sister was seriously ill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-impediment-in-granting-temporary-parole-to-pocso-convicts-hc/story-5z3Fm47ca4AJWfsoJSs3xO.html

19-07-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai crosses 100,000 Covid-19 cases 129 days after reporting first infection||The city crossed the grim milestone of 100,000 Covid-19 cases, 129 days after it had recorded the first case on March 11. Mumbai on Saturday reported 1,186 cases, pushing up its count to 100,350, and 65 fatalities took the city’s toll to 5,650.Mumbai, which is the worst affected city in Maharashtra, took 91 days to reach 50,000 cases on June 8, with the recent 50,000 infections added to the city’s tally in just 40 days. Active Covid-19 cases in the city stand at 23,917, according to the state health department bulletin, which states that 70,492 people have so far recovered in the city. Mumbai’s recovery rate is 70.24%. With the rise of cases having plateaued over the past month, when Mumbai has recorded infections in the range of 1,000-1,500 every day, citizens are now waiting for the Covid-19 case curve to start dipping. Civic officials and experts, however, said it would take a few more weeks before they can declare with certainty that cases have started to drop. Officials said the situation in Mumbai is far better now than what it was in April, May and June. While the number of active cases in Mumbai has gone down from around 30,000 in June to 24,000 in July, the doubling rate, too, has improved from 28 days to 54 during the same period. Where does Mumbai currently stand?The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has increased its daily Covid testing capacity from an average of 4,000 tests in June to 6,000 tests in July. Since July 7, the civic body also allowed citizens to get tested at private laboratories without a doctor’s prescription or self-declaration. “This should have had increased the number of daily cases, but the number has stayed between 1,200 and 1,600. This is a good sign. We are also prepared with our health facilities if there is a surge in the cases,” said a civic official. The city has conducted 427,378 tests so far and has a positivity rate of 23.48%.The recovery rate of Mumbai currently stands at 70.24% in comparison to Maharashtra’s 55.05%. A high recovery rate has also helped in reducing the number of active cases in the city. BMC claims to have around 7,000 beds of Covid patients lying vacant in its health facilities. The cause for concern for Mumbai is its case fatality rate (CFR). The pandemic has claimed 5,585 lives in the city so far, with a CFR of 5.63%. The state’s CFR stands at 3.85%. One of the primary reasons for the sudden spike in CFR was BMC adding 862 old fatalities to the city’s toll in June after a reconciliation exercise.Looking aheadWith the case curve of Mumbai flattening, most restrictions in the city have been lifted gradually by the authorities. The state government and BMC have plans to also open up malls, theatres, restaurants and gymnasiums in a phased manner soon. Civic chief Iqbal Singh Chahal had said on Tuesday that reopening of malls and restarting suburban trains for the general public will only happen after the situation in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), which includes Navi Mumbai, Thane and Kalyan-Dombivli, among other areas, improves.“The situation looks under control [in Mumbai] for now, considering the number of cases that are reported every day... Nearly 85% of the total patients are asymptomatic… Also, it’s taking much longer for cases to double, which helps in bed availability. If this trend continues, it will be easier for us to bring down the number of cases in the future,” Chahal had said. Civic officials said extending more relaxations will also depend on citizens as they will have to continue to follow social distancing norms and take precautions. “BMC should now prioritise restricting movement of senior citizens and patients with co-morbidities. Also, it needs to check if the city is heading towards herd immunity. There needs to be more community participation and involvement of private health practitioners. Result of all of these measures will ensure what needs to be done for future relaxations in the city,” said Sanjay Pattiwar, a public health expert.Covid fight so farAround a month after the first Covid-19 case was found in Mumbai on March 11, the total cases in the city had crossed the 1,000-mark and there were 38 fatalities. By the end of April, areas like Worli and Dharavi had emerged as hot spots, with a significant number of cases in slum pockets and densely populated localities.Authorities then came up with several initiatives such as ‘Chase the Virus’, ‘Save Lives Strategy’ and ‘Rapid Action Plan’ in order to increase testing, enhance contact tracing, improve fatality rate and bring down cases in hot spots. All this and proactive citizens helped to improve the situation in Worli and Dharavi, which now see very few cases.However, over the past four months, there have been numerous complaints from patients and their relatives as the crumbling health infrastructure of the city could not handle the spread of the virus. There were reports of deaths owing to unavailability of beds and ambulances, delayed admissions, and lack of timely treatment. The bed capacity has been gradually scaled up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-crosses-100-000-covid-19-cases-129-days-after-reporting-first-infection/story-DmkcQYA7mKCArrhF7FO4iP.html

The accused, Karan Birbal Bahadur, a resident of Aarey Milk Colony, confessed to the crime and said he committed the murder as an act of revenge after the child’s mother obstructed him from constructing a boundary wall to prevent water from coming inside his house.Police officers said that on June 9 the accused took the child in his auto under the pretext of going out for a drive and took him to an isolated spot near Dharavali village at Madh in Malad, and smashed his head with a heavy stone. He then chopped off the boy’s head, said police officers.“On Friday, we received information from a local about a headless body of a boy near Dharavali. A team of police officers found the head around two to three metres away from the body. The body was partially decomposed, making it hard to identify,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 11, Vishal Thakur.A photograph of the body was circulated to all police stations to check if there was any missing complaint registered, following which Aarey police responded. “The description in the missing complaint of the child including the clothes was similar to those found on the body, so we called his parents to identify the body,” said Thakur.His parents informed the police about an argument with Bahadur earlier in the month, following which Bahadur was called for questioning, said Thakur. “During questioning, Bahadur confessed to the crime,” said Thakur. A case of kidnapping and murder will now be registered at Aarey police station, and further probe will be conducted. “On Sunday, Aarey police officials will produce the accused before a court to get his custody,” said Thakur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/auto-driver-arrested-for-killing-13-year-old/story-7Wie2jBi4MToGTTiFzkdsO.html

19-07-2020||City||UP to conduct more rapid antigen tests, use drones to monitor containment zones||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, during a video conferencing with officials of different districts on Friday night, directed that antigen testing be ramped up and drone cameras be used for monitoring containment zones, besides having special cleanliness and sanitisation drives every weekend.Adityanath directed the health department to conduct a minimum of 500 rapid antigen daily in districts having a population less than 25 lakh and 1,000 such tests daily in districts having a population exceeding 25 lakh. The state health department has been directed to ensure that sufficient kits -- 5,000 in smaller districts and 10,000 in big districts -- be made available.“Although Adityanath has directed that 1,000 antigen tests be conducted in districts like Ghaziabad that have a population exceeding 25 lakh, we will be conducting up to 3,000-3,500 antigen tests daily. The 1,000 tests per day limit is a minimum but we plan to do more for about a month in order to filter out all suspected cases of ILI(influenza like illness) and SARI (severe acute respiratory infections). Once comprehensive testing is done, we expect that active containment of Covid-19 infection will help reduce the number of cases,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, Ghaziabad district magistrate.Overall, till July 17, the Ghaziabad district has a total of 3,902 Covid-19 cases and 63 deaths,of which 1,560 cases are currently active. The district has tested 61,292 samples till July 17 which includes 30,497 antigen tests.The district magistrate also said he had roped in a ‘sector scheme’ which was a component meant for better enforcement in containment zones in areas such as Khoda, Loni and Vaishali.“We have on our radar areas which have a high number of cases since March. So, we have also planned that sector scheme may be implemented in localities if the cases fail to reduce. This will help in breaking the chain of infection and has helped us previously in the three localities. Through our records, we have also come to know about people who are yet to be traced. We are taking the help of police surveillance,” Pandey added.According to the latest list of containment zones, as of July 10, the district has 189 category-1 zones (having one case) and 173 category-2 zones (having more than one case).According to health department’s mapping figure, as of July 14, the district had 3,458 cases, with Karhera-2 segment comprising Indirapuram, Makanpur and Kanawani localities having the highest number cases at 403, while the segment of Sahibabad-2, comprising areas of Lajpat Nagar, Rajendra Nagar and Shalimar Garden had 261 cases. This was followed by Carte segment having localities of Kavi Nagar, Shastri Nagar and Nehru Nagar with 238 cases.The Ghaziabad police said they have two drones available with them but they are also making use of drones available with private agencies for monitoring containment areas and weekend curfew.“The SHOs of all the 18 police station areas have been asked to rope in surveillance drones to ensure strict adherence to weekend restrictions. In our drive since March, we have lodged 2,339 FIRs against different persons for violation of lockdown norms,” said Kalanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police.According to police records, they have fined 31,663 persons till July 17 for not wearing a mask. On this account, police have collected about ₹39 lakh in fines. Till July 17, they have also penalised 5,766 persons for violating lockdown norms and health protocols.MISMATCH IN GHAZIABAD’s COVID TALLY The daily health bulletin released by the state control room on July 18 had mismatch figures for Ghaziabad district as it displayed total 3,902 cases, the same figure reported on July 17.On July 17, the control room figures stood at overall 3,902 cases including 2279 patients discharged from hospitals, 63 deaths and 1560 active cases. The figure included 139 fresh cases as well.However, on July 18, the figures indicated 2,305 patients discharged from hospitals, 63 deaths and 1,534 active cases, while the cases reported in the last 24 hours were 104 and 26 patients had been discharged. The total figure released on July 18 should have been 3,980.“There is a mismatch in the data of the control room as their count includes some duplicate records and some cross-notified patients who have been (transferred) to other districts. But this is not indicated in the report. We will convey the issue to the control room,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-to-conduct-more-rapid-antigen-tests-use-drones-to-monitor-containment-zones/story-nMUDqIQVC9WsIJyThHgW9I.html
19-07-2020||Gurugram||Residents allege DHBVN issuing inflated power bills based on average||Residents of a number of upscale residential colonies in the city have alleged that they have been served inflated electricity bills as these were calculated on the basis of average usage rather than the actual meter reading. The residents also said that bills for the months of May and June have not been delivered and have been delayed in many areas.They said that they were apprehensive that these would also be on the higher side than the actual usage as readings have not been taken. Residents of Sushant Lok 1, south city 1, sectors 57, 46 and 45, in particular, have been affected and allege that despite repeated calls and messages to Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN), there has been no action.Ajay Sharma, a resident of sector 57 who bought a house in a Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) sector in the middle of last year, said he was shocked when he was given a bill for Rs50,000 for the month February and March.“The bill is almost ten times my average monthly bill. I tried to check my past usage through online records but the maximum amount that can be arrived at through this is Rs 20,000. I have spoken to officials through the call centre but every time a complaint or docket number is raised and the matter is automatically shows as ‘resolved’ after 15 days by them, and an SMS is sent to me, without any redressal,” said Sharma, who now plans to lodge a written complaint in this matter.In the neighbouring sector 56, resident Kriti Agarwal said on twitter that they have not received electricity bills for months. “In fact, we have raised this matter but are told soon or next week,” she wrote.Lokesh Madan, a resident of Sushant Lok 1, said that since March the utility officials have not taken meter reading in their area and no physical inspection has taken place despite the relaxation of lockdown.“We have been issued a bill of Rs30,000 for two months based on the average usage but it is inflated, as a realistic and correct assessment would never make it exceed Rs15,000 to Rs16,000. I have complained to the authorities on their web portal but nothing has happened,” he said.Dr AK Nagpal, another resident of Sushant Lok 1, said a large number of residents there had not received their bills and this was causing worry as delays meant inflated bills or penalty for consumers.Yatendra Nath Jha, a resident of South City 1 said that the bill issued to him has been calculated on a flat rate instead of applying slabs. “The authority should clarify on these things and rebates and show some consideration during the pandemic. My bill is almost double my usage,” he said.In neighbouring sectors 45, 46 and 47, apart from the problem of delay in bills and higher charges, the residents are also grappling with the problem of acute power cuts that occur daily and are making lives of residents miserable. “We are suffering both problems of delayed and inflated bills and also power cuts which continue for four to five hours,” said RS Yadav, president, sector 46 residents’ welfare association.The residents also said that the problem was more acute in colonies on the eastern side of the highway as compared to parts of the old city and across the highway.KC Agarwal, chief engineer, DHBVN, Gurugram did not reply on the matter despite repeated phone calls and messages.Manoj Yadav, superintendent engineer, DHBVN, Gurugram 1, however, said that above said areas were not in his jurisdiction but maintained that areas under his jurisdiction that included old city and colonies around it had been served bills that were based on metre reading. “Our bills have been issued on time and these are based on actual readings. Despite that, if there is a concern we will resolve it,” he said.When asked about the matter, Haryana power minister Ranjit Singh Chautala said that he would certainly ask the DHBVN officials in Gurugram to look into the issues faced by city residents and ensure that they are resolved at the earliest.“If people are facing issues with regard to electricity supply or related matters, they can approach me directly through social media or can drop a message on my phone number 94160-48386. All matters pertaining to consumers are taken very seriously and resolved by concerned power utilities,” said Chautala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residents-allege-dhbvn-issuing-inflated-power-bills-based-on-average/story-kU4Xnim9ipuWWcOjfumhgK.html
19-07-2020||Noida||Noida school teen death: Chancellor, wife booked for murder||The chancellor of a city-based private boarding school, has been booked by the Noida Police on Friday for murder and causing disappearing of evidence, along with his wife in connection with the death of a 14-year-old Haryana girl who was found hanging in the establishment on July 3.The incident had come to light on July 12, nine days after the girl’s death, when a video of her mother went viral. In the video, the mother had alleged that her daughter was a target of foul play and the hostel authorities had dubbed her death as a suicide case as part of a cover-up. A suicide note had been reportedly recovered at the spot in which the girl had alleged that no one was responsible for her death.The family of the girl, who was a class 10 student, had filed a complaint with the local police in Haryana and also wrote to the state chief minister saying they suspect foul play in their daughter’s death and that she could have been murdered. Following this, the Noida police took suo motu cognizance of the matter and launched a probe into the incident. A case was registered on Friday against the school’s chancellor and his wife at the Sector 49 police station, under which the private boarding school falls, under sections 302 (punishment for murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) of the Indian Penal Code. “A probe is underway. We are awaiting the result of the forensic examination of the alleged suicide note which was recovered from the spot. Meanwhile, statements of everyone concerned- the family, the suspects, the school staff, other students among others- will be recorded,” said deputy commissioner of police (DCP), zone 1, Sankalp Sharma.The family of the deceased said they were against hushing up the matter, and how the school authorities allegedly forced to perform the last rites of their daughter girl without informing the police. According to the mother, her daughter was in Class 10 and was studying at the school along with her younger sister and brother. The family had dropped the kids off at school on June 18 for their final exams.“The way the school authorities tried to hide the whole matter shows that there was something wrong that happened. There was no reason for my daughter to take her own life. I just want them to be brought to justice for their role in her death,” said the mother.According to the family members, they had received a call from their eldest daughter’s boarding school on July 3 to come to the school at the earliest. “They wouldn’t tell us anything. They simply asked us to come there at the earliest. We immediately rushed to the spot. What we saw their filled us with horror. Our daughter’s body was hanging from a fan. The hostel management took our phones away and told us that she had taken her own life. They even claimed that she had left a suicide note behind,” the girl’s mother had earlier said. The family had further alleged that the school forced them to sign a non-disclosure and the body was cremated, without the police being informed.The police had earlier said that the school was wrong for not reporting the girl’s death to them.The chancellor has, however, denied all allegations of foul play.“Everything happened with the consent of the girl’s family. My wife and I don’t even live in the school premises. But we are cooperating with the investigation, and are ready to provide all information. The police have also checked the CCTV camera footage from near our house to verify our whereabouts from that day. We only came to the school after we found out about her death,” said Jayandra Prakash, the school’s chancellor.Notes were also reportedly recovered from the girl’s school bag in which she had written about some “troubles” in her life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-school-teen-death-chancellor-wife-booked-for-murder/story-8MgyWPfE4NRV3mYVR8AQEP.html
19-07-2020||Noida||PG students perform risky liver procedure, save 71-yr-old Covid patient’s life||Taking serious notes of the deteriorating condition of a 71-year-old male Covid-19 patient, who had a huge amount of pus in his liver, two post-graduate (PG) residents of Sharda hospital, on Friday evening, successfully drained his liver abscess with the help of needles. Though still on ventilator, the patient is reportedly recovering and is now out of danger, sources at the hospital said.Dr Vani Dutta, a PG student of general surgery at the Sharda Institute of Medical Sciences, said it was a case of alcoholic liver disease, complicated with liver abscess. “Added to these complications was the fact that the patient was diagnosed with coronavirus (Covid-19) disease five days ago and admitted here. Because of Covid-19 and the expanding abscess, the patient went into a state of shock and was resuscitated in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Covid ward,” she said. She added that since the drainage was necessary, she and another PG student of radiology Dr Aanchal (single name), decided to take a final call without further ado. “When it’s about a patient’s life on the edge, Covid scare is the last thing on our mind. Under the ultrasound guidance through video conferencing by our medical superintendent (MS) Dr Ashutosh Niranjan and head of radiology department Dr Vishal Gupta, we started performing the drainage procedure. It was really a moment of pride for us when the patient felt well enough to himself ask for water and eatables this morning,” she said.Appreciating the efforts of these young medicos, the hospital’s MS, Dr Ashutosh Niranjan, said tackling such complicated cases in pandemic times is a great sign of their brilliance. “Liver abscess is a mass filled with pus inside the liver. Common causes are abdominal conditions such as appendicitis or diverticulitis due to haematogenous spread through the portal vein. Had it not been done on time by our young students, it could have caused a major liver injury, which often takes the life of the patient. Their commitment will also inspire many doctors who prefer not to work fearing for their lives. Our PG students never shy away from treating Covid-positive patients,” he said.It should be noted here that as many as seven doctors and 47 nurses of the Sharda hospital did not report to duty last month, fearing for their lives due to the pandemic. However, after the state government decided to book them under the Pandemic Act if they remain absent, most of them resumed their duties recently. Incidentally, as many as 100 out of a total of 125 PG students of the Sharda Institute are presently working in Covid wards of the hospital.Dr Gyanendra Kumar, officer on special duty (OSD) to the state government and a professor at the Jhansi medical college, said that draining pus from the liver is never an easy task, even for trained doctors. “First of all, all credit goes to the bright students, and secondly, it is the high-end technology available at the hospital that boosts the morale of the doctors and students there,” he said.Hailing the efforts taken by these PG students, Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY also said that these young hands are the real torch-bearers during this pandemic crisis. “I think it will spread a positive message among other doctors,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-pg-students-perform-risky-liver-procedure-save-71-year-old-covid-patient-s-life/story-jeMGWBVPD0U1ETWT9QnWjK.html
19-07-2020||Noida||Noida residents complain of inflated water bills||Several residents in the city are complaining of inflated water bills received from the Noida authority. Residents from many areas including sectors 28, 29, and 37 among others claimed that despite paying the water bills for the 2019-2020 financial year, the amount has been wrongly added to their current water bill. They are also miffed about being forced to go to the authority’s water department office to get the water bill corrected amid the coronavirus disease pandemic. “There is some technical error in the system of the water department that is calculating the bills wrongly and adding previous year’s amount, which was already paid, to the new bill. The shocking thing is that the authority’s website itself states that I had paid the last year’s water bill in full. But the amount was still added to the new bill. I am above 75 years and had to stand for an hour in a queue during this pandemic to get this corrected,” said colonel (retired) Diwakar Sharma, who is a resident of Sector 37. Sharma said he had paid last year’s water bill of ₹3,000 and he had the receipt for it too. However, the water bill for this year is ₹6,300 water bill which wrongly includes last year’s bill year as well, he said.“When I showed the officials at the counter at the water department office the last year’s receipt then they got it corrected. But like me, many others need to needlessly visit the water department to get their bills corrected during this tough time when social distancing has to be maintained strictly,” colonel (retd.) Sharma said.Several other residents are similarly irked with inflated water bills. “I had paid my last year’s bill amounting to₹2,850 and the payment was visible on the Noida authority’s portal as well. However, the authority generated a new bill including the last year’s amount. This is bizarre, the authority is troubling its consumers for no reason especially when we are going through an unprecedented time” said Gaurav Sahrawat, a resident of Sector 28.Elderly people said they find it even more difficult to go out to get their water bills corrected when they should stay home and keep themselves safe during the coronavirus pandemic.“At a time when we are supposed to maintain social distancing, we are being forced to go to these offices to get our bill’s corrected when the proof of our last year’s payment is on the authority’s website already,” a senior citizen, who did not wish to be named, said.The Noida authority officials said that there is some error in their system that is causing inconvenience to consumers and the glitch will be fixed soon. “We are addressing the issues being faced by our consumers. Consumers who had deposited their last year’s bill at our counter via cash might be getting inflated bills. The online system might have skipped these payments. We will, however, address the grievance and ensure the errors are corrected to ensure no new consumer faces this issue,” said BM Pokhriyal, deputy general manager, Noida authority. The authority had on May 3 increased water tariff by 7.5% amid the Covid-19 pandemic facing flak from consumers who were demanding relief from bills. As per the old rates the authority charges ₹175 per month from a middle-income group (MIG) flat owner; ₹210 per month from a high-income group flat owner; and, ₹ 260 from a duplex flat owner. An owner of a 200 square metre plot needs to pay ₹ 250 per month and the authority charges ₹470 per month from the owner of a 350 square metre plot. Now beginning from April 1, 2020 each consumer will have to pay 7.5% more, said officials of the Noida authority. Generally, the consumers pay their bills annually at the end of a financial year in April, said, officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-residents-complain-of-inflated-water-bills/story-Ty6GurkuPAzH5WbefzRI1L.html
19-07-2020||City||Witerati: My big fat Indian Zoom minus Dhoom wedding!||This piece has been inspired by infiltrators of an interesting sort in these times of “Chini Kum” narratives, by creatures scripting ‘virtual’ infiltration narratives into the other kind of LAC – Line of Audio Control. Where else, but on Google Hangouts or Zoom. And where the infiltrators are crossing all lines of etiquette enabling Zoom’s zero-background intrusion protocol, there it tantamounts to infiltration of the Line of Aesthetic Control.Like the tell-all tales in Donald Trump’s new biopic, Too Much And Never Enough, by niece Mary, these infiltrators, in this season of pandemic where Virtual is the New Real, come in all shapes, sizes and surprises.Not all lungs are as gifted or garrulous as those appended to the anatomies of the Prattlemouths of Primetime – Arnab, Chaubey & Co – to have the power to drown decibel-ism from the background that the Zoom call may be inviting onscreen, the way a roaring lion outshouts the whimpers or whining of lesser creatures who deign to air their lungs just when the King of the Jungle is jibber-jabbering his jingle.A portrait of peculiar tribes of Tweeple guilty of infiltrating into Zoom’s LAC. And how!Of Far From The Migrating CrowdPicture this. Lollita is on a Zoom call with CEOs, Colleagues & Co, deconstructing and deliberating how jobs have been robbed by recession. Bingo, barging into the background is a floating form of recession – the receding hairline of Lalit ji or Lamba ji.Inadvertent intrusion, for he happened to be tiptoeing into the other room and was manoeuvring to materialise this migration by ducking down almost on all fours so as not to be caught on Zoom, much like monkeys at a Hanuman Mandir crawling to creep off with your Chanel clutch without being spotted. Alas, Lamba ji or Lalit ji’s bald pate somehow strayed onto screen to stage a guest appearance. Love it or hate it (oops, pate it).Now, if this had been a scene from the 2014 romcom Khoobsurat in which the heroine Mili (Sonam Kapoor) is having her “Maa Ka Phone Aaya” moment – a video call on the terrace with mom Manju (Kirron Kher) – and just then, the hero decides to stroll into the background and even stray into the video call, Lollita & Co wouldn’t really mind it. Nor would the peers on the Zoom call. For, who minds if peers get to peer at eye candy and who minds flaunting a dandy, as dapper as Pakistani heart-throb Fawad Khan.Alas, when Lollita is twaddling with colleagues about their company’s fiscal deficits, it isn’t the most opportune moment to expose her household’s follicle deficits.Or just when Lollita is pontificating on a pandemic webinar about mid-caps or middle-class survival, it isn’t the best of times for the middle anatomies of the migrating population on home turf to raise their heads, virtually. That smacks so much of actor Kajol’s baby bump playing a cameo, where else but in a song in KJo flick Kal Ho Naa Ho.Best is to be ready for a realistic remedy – of being pushed up against the wall. But if the wall doesn’t boast backdrops as oomph-y as The Oprah Winfrey Show studio or as museum-y as The Louvre, or even as clinically cerebral as a Rajdeep Sardesai and Arnab Goswami news studio – the sort of setting conducive to the “Nation Wants To Know” brand of squeaky screen presence – then the only way to keep creeping ‘n’ crawling populations out of the Zoom backdrop is to migrate one’s screen countenance in sync. When in (Zoom) roam, do as the roamers do.If facial migration fails, as badly as Donald Trump’s dumb tweets or even dumber histrionics, simply stick your face up close and personal into the webcam such that fellow Zoomers can even count the blackspots on your nasal bridge. After all, in these pandemic times, Zoom-ing is but the only bridge between Tweeple.The curious case of Zoomers zinging, “Honey, I shrunk the creeps!”Of Band Baaja Baarat & Beyond LACThen, there is the infiltration by Biradri, BFFs, Bulldogs & Co into Zoom’s Line of Audio Control.Zoom is New Normal’s Banquet Hall and Marriage Palace. From virtual sangeet ceremonies to cacophonous Antakshri rituals to saat pheras saat samundar paar, Zoom is the new ‘Band Baaja Baarat’ stage for the Great Garrulous & Ghee Fattened Indian Family. But it’s not only the Zoom screen that’s staging the Kith, Kin & Canines’ Day Out, as in the shaadi of SpuddyKat (Bengaluru bride Spandika Jayaraj) where a canine in Candy Cane Tie stole the show. Off-screen action may steal the show, too.Sample this. Lockdown’s Lamba ji or Lalit ji and family are all copiously congregating globally on Zoom for the third wedding of the second brother of their first cousin Larry or Lalli. Vows and wows waft from the Zoom wedding, which has upstaged My Big Fat Indian Dhoom Wedding, as the masked priest prattles, “Till Death Do Us Part … “Bingo, that very moment the pets of the household – Chihuahuas, Cats & Co – start tearing their teeth into Lamba ji or Lalit ji’s pyjama string (pyjamas and boxers being elevated to the New National Dress of India Quarantining and curiously constituting the casual bottom wear beneath the blue-collared or white-collared elitism or formalism of Zoom conferencing). And the pets ‘belt’ out their own canine chorus driven by similar sentiments stirred for the string, “Till Death Do Us Apart … “Lo behold, the Big Reinvented Zoom Minus Dhoom Wedding party gets ‘torn’ -- between listening to the vows and ‘bow-bows’.The curious case of Zoom staging 101 Dalmatians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/witerati-my-big-fat-indian-zoom-minus-dhoom-wedding/story-hN8Wwt4vMhCQZ2Vh4EYEkN.html

19-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Missing 11-year-old girl lands in shelter home, family alleges police negligence||Due to the lack of coordination among various police wings in the city, an 11-year-old girl, who was reported missing from Mauli Jagran, ended up at Nari Niketan in Sector 26 here. As the Mauli Jagran police station failed to keep the police control room in loop, she was taken to the women shelter in a PCR vehicle after cops found her walking on the road alone three days ago.The girl’s mother said it was through a call from the shelter home that they got information about her daughter on Friday.On July 15, the girl’s mother had approached the Mauli Jagran police station and lodged a complaint, following which a case of kidnapping was registered. However, the police station was unaware that the child had already been found by a PCR vehicle and taken to the Nari Niketan.This comes after four cases of missing minor girls were recently reported at four different police stations on the same day.The 11-year-old stays with her aunt in Vikas Nagar in Mauli Jagran, while her mother and two brothers live in Daddu Majra colony along with her grandmother. “On July 15 around 1pm, she had gone out to play, but got lost on her way back home,” said the mother.Later when a PCR vehicle spotted the child, the cops tried talking to her, but she did not speak. The PCR then took her to Nari Neketan, and there too she could not share any information about her address.“Though intimation was sent to all the police stations regarding an 11-year-old having been found, but the Mauli Jagran police station did not respond,” alleged the mother.“Had the police acted in time the child would have been home sooner. Her medical examination has been done and we have met her. She is safe, but the two days when we did not know her whereabouts were like hell,” the mother added.She said she would visit the Nari Niketan on Monday to complete the formalities and bring her daughter home, though she would have to undergo quarantine in the wake of Covid-19 spread.When asked, Chandigarh Police public relations officer DSP Charanjit Singh said, “The child remembered her address of DMC only so the information was shared with the concerned police station, but no missing complaint was found there. It was only on July 17 that the Mauli Jagran police station got information that the child had been taken to Nari Niketan by officials of Bapu Dham police post on July 15. The Mauli Jagran SHO then contacted the Nari Niketan superintendent, who informed him that the child’s family was informed.”The girl is now safe and will be produced before the child welfare committee on July 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/missing-11-year-old-girl-lands-in-nari-niketan-family-alleges-police-incoordination/story-tX6mJdaRfGrMfyyOaT2VPI.html
19-07-2020||Chandigarh||Fearing infection, residents of Chandigarh’s Sector 11 demand shifting of Covid testing kiosks from market||The residents of Sector 11 here have been feeling unsafe lately due to their proximity to three Covid-19 testing kiosks set up on the road near their homes and possible exposure to infected patients.They have written to the administration, including UT adviser and director health services, asking that the facilities be shifted elsewhere.Punjab and Haryana high court advocate Anshuman Chopra, who lives right opposite to the Sector 11 market, said the situation had become bad only about two weeks back. “When the price for Covid testing was capped at Rs 2,000, more and more people got their tests done at the drive-through booth set up on the road. The World Health Organization has said that Covid-19 can be transmitted through air, so the citizens living nearby are concerned. Sometimes, it is hard for us to take out our vehicles as long queues could be blocking the road,” he said adding that he had written to the UT authorities about this a week ago, but no action has been taken.Market welfare association president Diwakar Sahoonja added, “Earlier, SRL Diagnostics Lab had one booth here, but about a week ago, Atulya labs have also opened two more kiosks on the other side of the road leading to more rush. When they come for Covid tests, people have to wait and they often get out of their vehicles to buy something to eat or drink, or to get photocopies of their ID proof, which are needed for the tests. This has got the shopkeepers very worried. Even customers are afraid to visit this market now and we have been steadily losing out on business.”Local area councillor Maheshinder Singh Sidhu said residents and shopkeepers here had asked him to help in the matter. “Though the labs have the necessary permissions, I’m taking up the people’s concerns with the authorities so that the drive-in booths may be shifted to a spot away from the residential area.”‘DRIVE-THROUGHS SAFE, SET UP ALL OVER COUNTRY’Meanwhile, SRL regional chief operating officer (north and east) Anindya Chowdhury said, “We understand people’s apprehensions, but we assure them that they have nothing to be worried about. In the drive-through, there is no close contact so there is no chance of spread. The swab is taken through the car window so there is no aerosol generation. The booth and the vehicles are regularly sanitised. A hypo-solution is used for sanitisation after each sample is taken.”UT adviser Manoj Parida said, “These kiosks are just collection centres and have been built on the lines of other private Covid testing facilities throughout the country. The kiosks have been allowed by the government and the residents have nothing to be worried about.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fearing-infection-sector-11-residents-demand-shifting-of-covid-testing-kiosks-from-market/story-ZrnhVeFtRMvIVGEFqFLv6J.html

19-07-2020||World||Surging attacks by Baloch separatists increase risks, costs of BRI projects in Pak: Report||A surge in the deadly attacks by Baloch separatists in Pakistan has increased the risks and costs of China’s ambitious Belt and Road projects, including the CPEC, while its interests at the strategic Gwadar Port on the Arabian Sea are caught up in the proxy war between Islamabad and Tehran, according to a media report.Security risks and costs of the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) are rising amid a resurgence of the deadly attacks by separatists in the troubled Balochistan province, home to the Chinese-operated Gwadar Port, a report in Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post said on Saturday.The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) aims to link Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Gulf region, Africa and Europe with a network of land and sea routes. The CPEC is the flagship project of President Xi Jinping’s ambitious BRI.In the third such attack since May, militants opened fire on a patrolling paramilitary convoy in Panjgur district on Tuesday, killing three soldiers and wounding eight others, including an army colonel.Militant ethnic Baloch factions have also recently expanded their range of operations to adjoining Sindh province and its provincial capital Karachi, according to the report.Beijing’s stakes in Sindh are as high as they are in resoure-rich Balochistan, it said.China’s state-owned enterprises run container terminals at Karachi port and have invested in nuclear and coal power projects established both under the umbrella of the CPEC and in partnership with local corporations, it said.On June 29, four militants were killed by police commandos when they tried to shoot their way into the Karachi Stock Exchange, which is 40 per cent owned by a consortium of three Chinese bourses.“Baloch groups have not only intensified their attacks but also expanded the outreach of their terrorist violence beyond Balochistan, but it is hard to predict whether this trend will persist,” Mohammad Amir Rana, director of the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies, an Islamabad-based think tank, told the Post.He said Baloch insurgent factions had historically preferred to conduct low-intensity attacks, while their high-intensity attacks had tended to come in waves lasting “only for a few weeks”.Rana said the CPEC projects and Chinese personnel remained well protected by the dedicated 13,700-strong Special Security Division, led by a two-star Pakistan Army general, established in 2017.“Only low-intensity attacks have been reported around the CPEC project sites, but the financial cost of the security (to Pakistan) is high,” he said.Beijing’s political risks are also escalating because of a renewed wave of public anger in many parts of Balochistan against human rights abuses by Pakistani troops deployed to crush the low-intensity insurgency in the province, the report said.In June, Akhtar Mengal, leader of the Balochistan National Party-Mengal, parted ways with the ruling coalition led by Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan’s party, citing the government’s failure to bring a halt to state-enforced disappearances.In a subsequent interview with the BBC’s Urdu-language service, Mengal said more than 1,500 Baloch had “disappeared” since Prime Minister Khan took office in 2018 and claimed that he had personally secured the release of nearly 500 people from the custody of the security forces.Because of the political and security situation in Balochistan, China’s CPEC investments in the province have hitherto been limited to the development of the Gwadar Port and a road linking it to the coastal highway to Karachi.The port is not yet fully operational and only recently handled its Afghan transhipment cargo. The city continues to suffer severe power and water shortages, the report said.Also, Chinese geopolitical interests at Gwadar, the Arabian Sea outlet of the corridor, running overland from Xinjiang, have become caught up in a web of espionage and proxy warfare involving Pakistan and Iran, it said. Iran is highly suspicious of Pakistan and its relationship with arch-rival Saudi Arabia, especially since Riyadh was invited in late 2018 to establish a USD 10 billion oil refinery and storage facility at Gwadar.“The Iranians feel that Pakistan is not doing enough to secure the border on its side,” said Seyed Mohammed Marandi, a professor of English literature and oriental studies at the University of Tehran and renowned political commentator.“A lot of Saudi money has gone to extremist groups in this region and the Saudis have funded these [Jaish ul-Adl] terrorists,” he told the Post.Similarly, Pakistan is deeply concerned about India’s involvement at Iran’s Chabahar Port, which is competing with Gwadar for transit cargoes heading to landlocked Afghanistan.Politicians have warned that popular resentment towards federal government policies in Balochistan is dangerously close to igniting a wider uprising, it said.Pakistan’s former president Asif Ali Zardari last month said the state needed “to be more careful in Balochistan”.Journalist Kiyya Baloch said Chinese security concerns would continue to drag on the pace at which the CPEC projects in Gwadar have been developed.“Despite increasing diplomatic engagement, it is highly unlikely Beijing will make any significant further investment in Gwadar until security is improved,” Baloch said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/surging-attacks-by-baloch-separatists-increase-risks-costs-of-bri-projects-in-pak-report/story-8Iuo5t3SFyYzRNQS3WVdFN.html
19-07-2020||World||Donald Trump not ready to commit to election results if he loses||President Donald Trump is refusing to publicly commit to accepting the results of the upcoming White House election, recalling a similar threat he made weeks before the 2016 vote, as he scoffs at polls showing him lagging behind Democrat Joe Biden. Trump says it’s too early to make such an ironclad guarantee.“I have to see. Look ... I have to see,” Trump told moderator Chris Wallace during a wide-ranging interview on ”Fox News Sunday.” “No, I’m not going to just say yes. I’m not going to say no, and I didn’t last time either.” The Biden campaign responded: “The American people will decide this election. And the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.”Trump also hammered the Pentagon brass for favoring renaming bases that honor Confederate military leaders — a drive for change spurred by the national debate about race after George Floyd’s death. “I don’t care what the military says,” the commander in chief said.The president described the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, as a “a little bit of an alarmist” about the coronavirus pandemic, and Trump stuck to what he had said back in February — that the virus is “going to disappear.” On Fox, he said, “I’ll be right eventually.” The United States tops the global death toll list with over 140,000 and confirmed infections, with 3.7 million.It is remarkable that a sitting president would express less than complete confidence in the American democracy’s electoral process. But for Trump, it comes from his insurgent playbook of four years ago, when in the closing stages of his race against Hillary Clinton, he said he would not commit to honoring the election results if the Democrat won.Pressed during an October 2016 debate about whether he would abide by the voters’ will, Trump responded that he would “keep you in suspense.” The president’s remarks to Fox are certain to fuel conversation on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers had already been airing concerns in private about a scenario in which Trump disputes the election results.Trump has seen his presidential popularity erode over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and in the aftermath of nationwide protests centered on racial injustice that erupted after Floyd’s death in Minneapolis nearly two months.Trump contends that a series of polls that show his popularity eroding and Biden holding an advantage are faulty. He believes Republican voters are underrepresented in such surveys.“First of all, I’m not losing, because those are fake polls,” Trump said in the taped interview, which aired Sunday. “They were fake in 2016 and now they’re even more fake. The polls were much worse in 2016.”Trump was frequently combative with Wallace in defending his administration’s response to the pandemic, weighing in on the Black Lives Matter movement and trying to portray Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, as lacking the mental prowess to serve as president.Among the issues discussed was the push for wholesale changes in policing that has swept across the nation. Trump said he could understand why Black Americans are upset about how police use force disproportionately against them.“Of course I do. Of course I do,” the president said, adding his usual refrain that “whites are also killed, too.”He said he was “not offended either by Black Lives Matter,” but at the same time defended the Confederate flag, a symbol of the racism of the past, and said those who “proudly have their Confederate flags, they’re not talking about racism.”“They love their flag, it represents the South, they like the South. That’s freedom of speech. And you know, the whole thing with ‘cancel culture,’ we can’t cancel our whole history. We can’t forget that the North and the South fought. We have to remember that, otherwise we’ll end up fighting again. You can’t just cancel all,” Trump said.Wallace challenged Trump on some of his claims and called out the president at time, such as when Trump falsely asserted that “Biden wants to defund the police.” The former vice president has not joined with activists rallying behind that banner. He has proposed more money for police, conditioned to improvements in their practices.Trump continues to insist that Biden “signed a charter” with one of his primary rivals on the left, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. At one point in the interview, Trump calls on aides to bring him documentation to support his assertion. Trump, however, is unable to point to language from a Biden-Sanders task force policy document released this month by the Biden campaign.Trump stood behind his pledge to veto a $740 billion defense bill over a requirement that the Defense Department change the names of bases named for Confederate military leaders. That list includes Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Hood in Texas and Fort Benning in Georgia.The president argued there were no viable alternatives if the government ever tried. “We’re going to name it after the Reverend Al Sharpton?” Trump asked, referring to a prominent civil rights leader. “What are you going to name it?”Trump, 74, stuck to a campaign charge that Biden, 77, is unable to handle the rigors of the White House because of his age. As for polls showing the incumbent is trailing, Trump noted he was thought to be behind for much of the 2016 contest. “I won’t lose,” he predicted.The president and top advisors have long accused Biden of using the pandemic as an excuse to stay in “his basement” in his Delaware home. Biden has indeed shifted much of his campaign online, but frequently travels in Delaware and Pennsylvania, organizing speeches and small gatherings with voters and community leaders that are within driving distance of his home. Biden’s campaign says it will begin resuming normal travel and campaign activities, but only when health officials and state and local authorities say it is safe.Questioned about the coronavirus, Trump chided Fauci, the National Institutes of Health expert, and repeated false claims that anybody could get a test and that increased testing was the only reason that the U.S. was seeing more cases. When Wallace cited criticism about the lack of a national plan to confront the virus, Trump said, “I take responsibility always for everything because it’s ultimately my job, too,” and claimed, “I supplied everybody.”Case are rising because people are infecting each other more than they were when most everyone was hunkered down. The percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus has been on the rise across nearly the entire country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-not-ready-to-commit-to-election-results-if-he-loses/story-gO8GN2Em777svpKx1UN6aL.html
19-07-2020||World||Coronavirus rebounds around the world, deaths top 600,000||The coronavirus pandemic has found fresh legs around the world, as confirmed deaths pass 600,000 and countries from the U.S. to South Africa to India struggle to contain a surge of new infections. Hong Kong issued tougher new rules on wearing face masks, Spain closed overcrowded beaches and Germany reported another outbreak at a slaughterhouse.Pope Francis said “the pandemic is showing no sign of stopping” and urged compassion for those whose suffering during the outbreak has been worsened by conflicts.The World Health Organization said that 259,848 new infections were reported Saturday, its highest one-day tally yet.While the U.S. leads global infections, South Africa now ranks as the fifth worst-hit country in the pandemic with more than 350,000 cases, or around half of all those confirmed on the continent. Its struggles are a sign of trouble to come for nations with even fewer health care resources.India, which has now confirmed more than 1 million infections, on Sunday reported a 24-hour record of 38,902 new cases.In Europe, where infections are far below their peak but local outbreaks are causing concern, leaders of the 27-nation European Union haggled for a third day in Brussels over a proposed 1.85 trillion-euro ($2.1 trillion) EU budget and coronavirus recovery fund.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there is “a lot of good will, but there are also a lot of positions” in the talks, which have have laid bare divisions about how the countries hit hardest by the pandemic, such as Italy and Spain, should be helped. She said the talks, which were initially scheduled to end on Saturday, could still end without a deal.As scientists around the world race to find a vaccine to halt the pandemic, Russia’s ambassador to Britain on Sunday rejected allegations by the United States, Britain and China that his country’s intelligence services have sought to steal information about vaccine efforts.“I don’t believe in this story at all, there is no sense in it,” Ambassador Andrei Kelin said when asked in a BBC interview about the allegations. “I learned about their (the hackers’) existence from British media. In this world, to attribute any kind of computer hackers to any country, it is impossible.”Confirmed global virus deaths risen to nearly 603,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins. The United States tops the list with over 140,000, followed by more than 78,000 in Brazil. Europe as a continent has seen about 200,000 deaths.The number of confirmed infections worldwide has passed 14.2 million, with 3.7 million in the United States and more than 2 million in Brazil. Experts believe the pandemic’s true toll around the world is much higher because of testing shortages and data collection issues.Infections have been soaring in U.S. states such as Florida, Texas, Arizona, with many blaming a haphazard, partisan approach to lifting lockdowns as well as the resistance of some Americans to wearing masks. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Sunday that the situation was so dire in his California city that authorities were considering a new stay-at-home order.Even where the situation has been largely brought under control, new outbreaks are prompting the return of restrictions.Following a recent surge in cases, Hong Kong made the wearing of masks mandatory in all public places and told non-essential civil servants to work from home. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said the situation in the Asian financial hub is “really critical” and that she sees “no sign” that it’s under control.Police in Barcelona have limited access to some of the city’s beloved beaches because sunbathers were ignoring social distancing regulations amid a resurgence of coronavirus infections. Authorities in Amsterdam urged people not to visit the city’s famous red light district and have closed off some of the historic district’s narrow streets because they are too busy.Slaughterhouses also have featured in outbreaks in the U.S., Germany and elsewhere. Authorities in northwestern Germany’s Vechta county said 66 workers at a chicken slaughterhouse tested positive, though most appeared to have been infected in their free time. An earlier outbreak at a slaughterhouse in western Germany infected over 1,400 and prompted a partial lockdown.Cases in the Australian state of Victoria rose again Sunday, prompting a move to make masks mandatory in metropolitan Melbourne and the nearby district of Mitchell for people who leave their homes for exercise or to purchase essential goods.Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said those who fail to wear a mask will be fined 200 Australian dollars ($140).“There’s no vaccine to this wildly infectious virus and it’s a simple thing, but it’s about changing habits, it’s about becoming a simple part of your routine,” Andrews said.Speaking on Sunday from his window overlooking St. Peter’s Square, Pope Francis renewed his appeal for an immediate worldwide cease-fire that he said “will permit the peace and security indispensable to supplying the necessary humanitarian assistance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-rebounds-around-the-world-deaths-top-600-000/story-SRJEgnm52k8TtpWivAYi7K.html

Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez has signaled he wouldn’t rule out a full lockdown after imposing restrictions including a 10 p.m. curfew in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus.Florida deaths and new infections have slowed in the last two days; on Sunday the state reported that cases had risen by 3.7% against the previous 7-day average of 4.1%.“I care deeply about the economy, but first I care about human life,” Shalala said.“With our hospitals filled and the lack of appropriate testing and getting results, the lack of medicines -- we’ve had to beg for medicines that would save lives -- we simply cannot protect the economy if we don’t protect the lives of the people in our community,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-coronavirus-out-of-control-need-to-close-down-again-ex-hhs-chief/story-OlEKJeN7G653AhBndfzkVM.html
19-07-2020||World||Donald Trump minimizes spike in coronavirus cases, calls Anthony Fauci ‘alarmist’||President Donald Trump played down rising coronavirus cases in the U.S., saying many people experience nothing more than “sniffles,” that positive tests are only up because of wider testing, and that the U.S. response is the “envy of the world.”Trump also said that Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious-disease expert, is a “little bit of an alarmist” but that the two men have a “great relationship.”Trump made the comments in a lengthy interview on “Fox News Sunday” that was recorded Friday.Asked about rising Covid-19 diagnoses, Trump offered that “many of those cases are young people who would heal in a day, they have the sniffles and we put it down as a test.”“Show me the death chart,” Trump said when asked about daily cases in the U.S. now exceeding 75,000. “The death chart is much more important.”The daily U.S. death toll from Covid-19 is down sharply from the spring but has been creeping up again this month. Total deaths now exceed 140,000.“We have embers and we do have flames. Florida became more flame like, but it’s -- it’s going to be under control,” Trump said.Pressed about past statements that the coronavirus would at some point disappear, Trump said “I’ll be right eventually. I will be right eventually,” adding, “It’s going to disappear, and I’ll be right.”Undermining FauciIn the past week members of Trump’s administration have criticized Fauci, listing what they said were errors made by the longtime head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro penned a scathing op-ed about Fauci for USA Today.“Dr. Fauci’s made some mistakes,” Trump said. “But I have a very good -- I spoke to him yesterday at length. I have a very good relationship with Dr. Fauci.”Trump added: “He’s a little bit of an alarmist. That’s OK. A little bit of an alarmist.”Fauci was once a ubiquitous figure in daily White House coronavirus task force briefings but hasn’t spoken publicly at the White House since late April. Fauci has been more candid in warning of the virus’s risks, and the dangers of a hasty reopening, than Trump and other administration officials.As coronavirus cases have spiked in the U.S. in recent weeks, public opinion has increasingly turned against Trump, and Democrat Joe Biden has opened a growing lead in polls ahead.Trump also said he’d heard the U.S. has the “best mortality rate” related to the virus. He provided White House data that undercut his argument, showing the U.S. rate isn’t the lowest. His data also didn’t include some countries with lower mortality rates.“We are the envy of the world,” Trump said about testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-minimizes-spike-in-coronavirus-cases-calls-anthony-fauci-alarmist/story-mH59seeYELpQEWWdcEYEtO.html
19-07-2020||World||Donald Trump calls Joe Biden ‘incompetent,’ says he’d cry ‘mommy’||President Donald Trump again questioned the competence of Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee continues to lead in polls ahead of the November election.“Let Biden sit through an interview like this, he’ll be on the ground crying for mommy,” Trump said in an often contentious interview with correspondent Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday.” “He’ll say, ‘Mommy, mommy, please take me home.’”Trump added: “He can’t do an interview. He’s incompetent.”As the number of coronavirus cases surges in the U.S. and Biden gains in polls nationally and in battleground states, Trump has tried to portray the former vice president as unfit to assume office. Trump’s campaign has repeatedly highlighted Biden gaffes and misstatements.Asked whether he thinks Biden is senile, Trump responded: “I don’t want to say that.” He added: “To be president, you have to be sharp and tough and so many other things. He doesn’t even come out of his basement.”Cognitive ChallengeThe Biden campaign, in response, said Trump was recycling self-defeating attacks that have already failed to gain traction.“He lurched from smear to smear, all while being forcefully corrected on most, including the lie that Joe Biden wouldn’t keep the American people safe and supports defunding the police -- which has been fact checked into oblivion over the last month,” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, said in a statement.Biden has made his campaign events almost entirely virtual, making about one public appearance a week before small groups of reporters and supporters and maintains strict social distancing and mask requirements for attendance.He has been sharply critical of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus and is pushing a plan to revive the economy from the virus-related recession, offering a contrast with Trump’s insistence the economy is bouncing back.In the Fox interview Trump also challenged Biden to take the same cognitive test recently administered to the president. “I’ll guarantee you that Joe Biden could not answer those questions,” he said. “And I answered all 35 questions correctly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-calls-joe-biden-incompetent-says-he-d-cry-mommy/story-C3mF5MGq83wt2m60MMxVbK.html
19-07-2020||World||How the coronavirus spread through one immigration facility in US||Gregory Arnold walked into the warden’s office April 1 as the novel coronavirus ripped through one of the largest immigration detention centers in the United States. Waiting with about 40 guards to begin his shift, he heard a captain say face masks were prohibited.Incredulous, he and a guard who recently gave birth wanted to hear it from the boss. Arnold told Warden Christopher LaRose that he was 60 years old and lived with an asthmatic son.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here “Well, you can’t wear the mask because we don’t want to scare the employees and we don’t want to scare the inmates and detainees,” Arnold recalls the warden saying.“With all due respect, sir, that’s ridiculous.” Arnold retorted.He said he wanted to wear a mask and gloves, and “everyone else should be doing the same.” But the warden was unmoved. And in the weeks that followed, Otay Mesa Detention Center would see the first big outbreak at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 221 detention centers.The origins of the outbreak are uncertain, but accounts of workers and detainees reveal shortcomings in how the private company that manages the center handled the disease: There was an early absence of facial coverings, and a lack of cleaning supplies. Symptomatic detainees were mixed with others.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Other centers would follow with their own outbreaks, and a Homeland Security Department internal watchdog survey of 188 detention centers taken in mid-April echoed some of what The Associated Press found at Otay Mesa: 19% of facility directors said there weren’t enough standard surgical masks, 32% said there weren’t enough N95 respirator masks, and 37% felt there wasn’t enough hand sanitizer for detainees.Like prisons, living conditions are cramped -- except people held in immigration detention centers aren’t accused of any crimes. They wait to appear before an immigration judge to argue they should be allowed to remain in the country.Otay Mesa sits on a tucked-away periphery of San Diego amid vehicle storage lots, a gas-fired power plant, a state prison, county jail and juvenile detention camp. ICE’s average daily population of 956 detainees last year made it the agency’s 11th-busiest detention center.The squat, two-story facility -- managed under contract by CoreCivic Inc. and shared with U.S. Marshals Service inmates -- is surrounded by two layers of chain-link fence topped by razor wire. Rooms of two to four bunk beds open into common areas with televisions, sofas and board games.Margarita Smith, a guard who was named CoreCivic’s Otay Mesa employee of the year in 2019, said managers frequently discouraged workers from wearing masks. The topic came up during briefings in March.“They didn’t want anyone wearing masks,” said Smith, who was tapped by CoreCivic to lead an employee morale committee in January. “They said it would frighten the detainees and make them think that we’re sick or something.”In a court filing, LaRose, the warden, said policies on masks evolved with guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Staff was required to wear them around quarantined detainees and they were optional for other employees starting the third week of March, he said, a statement that Arnold and Smith dispute.Arnold said he wore a mask after learning about the detention center’s first case on March 31, an employee who handed out equipment to guards starting their shifts. Unaware of any ban on facial coverings, detainees thanked him.“I was disgusted,” Arnold said. “It’s obvious this thing was ramping up. I knew it was going to happen. I could just tell.”The contractor gave masks to detainees on April 10 but on condition they sign an English-language liability waiver, according to several detainees. It quickly retreated after a tense showdown with detainees.“Everyone was screaming,” said Issis Zavala of Honduras, who refused to sign but was released with an ankle bracelet because a 2007 bout of tuberculosis made her vulnerable. “They said, ‘You just sign it. OK, if you don’t want to sign, we’ll just go.’”___On March 17, the day that San Diego limited public gatherings to 50 people and closed restaurants, colleagues gathered to grill the warden. Smith recalls wondering why so many people -- including about half the lieutenants -- were allowed to gather so closely together in one room.When an employee pressed for clean rags, the warden answered twice that there was no need because the chemicals used for cleaning were very powerful. Others asked when they would get more wipes and gels.Gloves were hard to find, Smith said. Arnold said the ones he saw were too small for his hands. Hand sanitizer dispensers were often empty.Feeling the warden wasn’t taking the virus seriously, Smith felt she had no choice. At 48, she missed a week of work in early March with pneumonia, has asthma and had been sick off and on since November.She quit. “I thought to myself I’m not going to get sick again,” she said. “I just had a feeling that things weren’t going to go good.”The detainees, of course, had not choice but to stay. Carlos Gonzalez Gutierrez, Mexico’s consul general in San Diego, wrote ICE April 16 about a “generalized fear” among detainees, raising concerns about mixing ill and asymptomatic detainees and requiring liability waivers for masks. A consulate hotline got more than 100 calls.Common grievances included a lack of personal hygiene products, social distancing and masks, Gonzalez Gutierrez said. They complained that they were instructed to drink saltwater to deal with pain, and that employees were not wearing personal protective equipment.CoreCivic spokeswoman Amanda Gilchrist said the contractor rigorously followed guidance of health officials and ICE. She noted the CDC didn’t fully embrace masks until the first week of April and said employees and detainees get face coverings without having to sign a waiver.“We have responded to this unprecedented situation appropriately, thoroughly and with care for the safety and well-being of those entrusted to us and our communities,” she said.Zelaya, 35, said instructions came to wipe surfaces every hour on March 30 but rags were dirty. She used the same towel to clean toilets, door handles, phone receivers -- and her hands.“I clean houses,” Zelaya remembers telling guards. “You can’t use the same towel.”“Oh, we have a special chemical. It kills the bacteria,” Zelaya said she was told.Victor Rodriguez, 44, was among 35 detainees who went on a five-day hunger strike April 4. The Guatemalan man was upset about a detainee who worked in the dining hall handling food and appeared to have a fever, for which he was given ibuprofen. (CoreCivic said it prohibited detainees with symptoms from working in the kitchen and that it followed CDC guidelines on cleaning and disinfectants.)Authorities insist detainees had plenty of free soap -- 23,300 bars from March 24 to April 23 -- but Rodriguez said the bar he got daily was barely enough to wash his hands or shower. Hand-sanitizer requests were denied because authorities worried they could be used for homemade alcohol.Elizabeth Cruz, 22, said a detainee who was coughing badly in their cell the first week of April was removed for about a week, returned and removed again before testing positive. Cruz said she reported chest pain and breathing difficultly for two weeks but couldn’t get more than allergy medication.“I know my body and I am not well,” she remembers telling a nurse, who told her there was nothing more she could do.Cruz, of El Salvador, eventually tested positive and was placed in isolation with eight other infected detainees.___The virus has brought renewed scrutiny to ICE. The agency housed an all-time high of more than 56,000 people last year, with more than 500,000 bookings over a 12-month period, but policies to severely limit asylum and recent releases aimed at controlling the virus reduced the population to 22,340.Overall, ICE has had 3,596 detainees test positive -- 27% of those tested. Of those, 967 are currently in custody -- the rest were released, deported or have recovered. At ICE, 45 detention center workers have tested positive, along with an undisclosed number of contractors.Chad Wolf, acting Homeland Security secretary, told reporters in May in San Diego that ICE stopped taking detainees at Otay Mesa and “one or two others” and will continue to release the elderly and medically fragile. ICE cut the population at Otay Mesa by more than half in three months to 376 from 761 on April 1.For weeks, Otay Mesa had the dubious distinction of the most cases in the ICE system but the spread effectively stopped; 168 detainees have tested positive since the start of the outbreak, as have 11 ICE employees and more than 30 CoreCivic workers. ICE said in a statement that increased testing and isolating detainees who tested positive contributed to improved conditions.Cases are surging at facilities in Farmville, Virginia, with 315 detainees having tested positive, Anson, Texas, with 290, Eloy, Arizona, with 250 and Houston with 206, At Eloy, 128 of about 315 employees had tested positive as of earlier this month, according to CoreCivic, which manages the facility.Arnold resigned after his April 1 confrontation with the warden, just as the virus was tearing through Otay Mesa. Smith took a two-week leave before resigning, torn over her loyalty to the job and what she considers is CoreCivic’s tendency to “cut corners.” Both have sued the company in federal court.CoreCivic will address the guards’ accounts in court, Gilchrist said, but “we can say generally that we deny their specious and sensationalized allegations that are designed to obtain a favorable outcome in court.” Daniel Struck, an attorney for the warden, didn’t respond to a request for comment.Smith and Arnold believe the spread started with someone from outside -- perhaps a guard or lawyer. Smith called detainees “sitting ducks.”“After the first officer got it, it was like a fire there,” Smith said. “It just took off after that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-the-coronavirus-spread-through-one-immigration-facility/story-pT3l1bOB6P9Udz2SS97rdM.html
19-07-2020||World||Donald Trump calls Joe Biden ‘not competent’ to lead US, says ‘he’s mentally shot’||President Donald Trump assailed likely opponent Joe Biden as “not competent” to lead the country, speaking as polls over the weekend showed deepening voter disenchantment with his own handling of the coronavirus pandemic.“He’s shot, he’s mentally shot,” Trump said about Biden in a wide-ranging interview with “Fox News Sunday.” He said that if Biden is elected on November 3, he will “destroy this country.”Facing the multiple challenges of a spreading pandemic, racial unrest and a struggling economy, Trump made several unfounded or highly speculative accusations against the former vice president, saying Biden would “triple your taxes” and “defund the police.” He added, “Religion will be gone,” referring to Democratic officials banning large church services to stem the virus spread.Asked whether he would accept the election result in November, even if he loses, Trump echoed his position of 2016, saying, “I have to see ... I’m not going to just say yes.”The interview, which was taped in advance, came as new polling results showed support for Biden surging as doubts about Trump’s handling of the pandemic grow amid a resurgence in many states. Interviewer Chris Wallace told the president that a new Fox opinion poll showed Biden with a substantial lead over Trump not only on his ability to manage the pandemic (with a 17-point edge) and to deal with racial unrest (by 21 points), but even -- by a single point -- on handling the economy, long a Trump strong point.And a new Washington Post-ABC News poll has Biden leading Trump among registered voters nationwide by a resounding 15-point margin, 55-to-40 percent.Trump dismissed such polling as “fake,” saying White House surveys show him winning both nationally and in key swing states.- ‘Mommy, Mommy...’ -He repeatedly pummeled Biden, who has kept a relatively low profile amid the restraints imposed by the pandemic.Trump claimed that the Democrat wanted to “defund the police” -- a battle cry of some anti-racist protesters -- and insisted that such language was in a Biden policy document, though he was unable to produce it when challenged by Wallace.As he repeatedly questioned his rival’s mental acuity, Wallace asked him directly if thought Biden was senile.“I don’t want to say that,” Trump replied. “I say he’s not competent to be president.”He questioned whether the Democrat could pass a cognitive ability test that he said he had “aced,” and said the former vice president would fall apart under tough questioning.“Let Biden sit through an interview like this, he’ll be on the ground crying for Mommy. He’ll say, ‘Mommy, Mommy, please take me home.’“- ‘Envy of the world’ -Trump again defended his handling of the pandemic, claiming that “we are the envy of the world” on testing; and, of his early prediction that the virus would someday disappear, said, “I’ll be right eventually.”He again opposed any national mandate for mask-wearing, saying, “I want people to have a certain freedom.”Referring to the racial unrest in the country, and a recent spike in violent crime in some cities, the president blamed “Democrat-run cities,” which he said were “stupidly run.”Asked about statistics showing American blacks are twice as likely to be shot and killed by police as whites, Trump replied, “Many whites are killed also. You have to say that.”And he equated those who fly the Confederate flag with those saying that “Black Lives Matter,” adding, “It’s freedom of speech.”- ‘Long overdue’ -Trump again stated his opposition to renaming US military bases named after Confederate generals -- even after the military supported the idea.“I don’t care what the military says,” the president said.“We’re going to name it after the Reverend Al Sharpton?” he asked rhetorically, referring to a prominent African-American civil rights leader.There was no immediate response to the interview from Biden or his campaign, though the former vice president did tweet that “Banning the Confederate flag from military installations was long overdue.”On other subjects, Trump said the economy was “doing very well,” even as millions remain jobless, with some states reimposing lockdowns. The stock market, he said, was near record highs.bbk/jm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-calls-joe-biden-not-competent-to-lead-us-says-he-s-mentally-shot/story-tVVeSnyq8fdPNdKr8w4eAI.html

The first governor of the presidency of Fort William, Bengal, Clive died in London 1774, leaving behind a controversial legacy.Peter Nutting, the Conservative leader of the council, mentioned the statue in Kolkata as one of the reasons to retain it, implying that when post-colonial India has chosen to retain it, the statue in the England should also be kept in place.Steve Charmley, deputy leader and portfolio holder for assets, economic growth and regeneration, said the statue, which has stood in Shrewsbury’s square since 1860, is listed (a protected monument) and would require consultation with authorities to remove it.Reports from Shropshire said that at the full council meeting, 28 councillors voted in favour of the recommendation of no further action on the removal of the statue, while 17 voted against the proposal and one councillor abstained.After thousands signed a petition to remove the statue, thousands more signed a counter-petition, insisting that “removing statues does not change history nor help us learn from it. Shropshire has been influenced by the actions of Robert Clive, whether we condone all of his actions or not”.Clive’s statue is among several across the UK sought to be removed by campaigners. They include Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in Leicester, where the local council is due to decide on a petition calling for it to be removed from the arterial Belgrave Road, the hub of Asian culture and business.The BLM campaign witnessed protests across the UK after George Floyd’s death in the US, gathering momentum after the statue of slave trader Edward Colston was pulled down in Bristol in early June. The campaign has prompted a review of public spaces in London and elsewhere on symbols of racism, colonialism and slave trade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-kolkata-has-clive-statue-why-remove-it-in-uk/story-IYfMY7j1K5H0IJZXGfux7M.html

New cases have dwindled in recent days and weeks.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Johnson told the Sunday Telegraph in an interview that health officials were getting better at identifying and isolating local outbreaks, adding that the power to order national action will remain an option. Leicester in the east Midlands remains in lockdown.He said: “I can’t abandon that tool any more than I would abandon a nuclear deterrent. But it is like a nuclear deterrent, I certainly don’t want to use it. And nor do I think we will be in that position again”.Johnson’s optimism about improving conditions has led to reopening several sectors of the British economy that has taken a severe hit due to the pandemic. But top officials warn that another lockdown may be needed as the challenging winter months near.Patrick Vallance, chief scientific officer, cautioned in a parliamentary hearing on Friday that relaxing measures would inevitably lead to new cases in the coming months, which could need another nation-wide lockdown.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage He said: “As you release measures it is inevitable as you get more contacts that you will see more cases … Come winter, the challenges will be very much greater and of course there is a risk that this could need national measures”.“Everyone that I’ve spoken to thinks it’s highly likely that this disease will continue to circulate and will come back in waves. And therefore the measures of reducing contact to reduce spread, the sorts of social distancing measures that we’ve talked about, and the hygiene measures that go along with that, will be necessary,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-lockdown-like-n-option-won-t-need-again-says-pm-boris-johnson/story-2LLj6CoWhwCyFvlURKtSFM.html

19-07-2020||World||Covid-19: Australia’s Victoria state to impose a mandatory face cover rule||Australia’s coronavirus hot spot, Victoria state, will enforce a mandatory face cover rule in view of rising new coronavirus infections in the state. Victoria reported 363 new Covid-19 cases and three deaths in the last 24 hours, said state Premier Daniel Andrews. “We are going to be wearing masks in Victoria, and potentially in other parts of the country, for a very long time. There’s no vaccine to this wildly infectious virus, and it’s a simple thing but it’s about changing habits,” Andrews said. “Common sense” will guide the new rules, and despite being mandatory, Andrews advised the measure be done “whenever practical”. “If you are out of your home for one of the four (permitted) reasons, then you need to be wearing a mask and I stress it need not be a hospital-grade mask,” he said, adding, “Any face covering is better than no face-covering.” Andrews said the move was the “powerful next step” in mitigating the spread of coronavirus in the state. “It doesn’t come at an enormous cost to the Victorian economy,” he said. “It still allows us to go about our business — particularly those who can’t work at home and for going shopping for the basics.” Anyone who fails to wear a mask could be fined 200 Australian dollars (Rs 10,479) with some exceptions including for those with a medical reason, kids under age of 12 years, those who have a professional reason. The new rule will be enforced from 11.59 pm (local time) on Wednesday night. Victoria is currently struggling with the second wave of coronavirus cases that has taken the state’s death toll to 38 as of Sunday and the national toll to 122. “About 80 per cent of our new cases since mid-May are being driven by transmission in workplaces, including private sector aged care,” Andrews said. Currently, there are 2,837 active cases in Victoria, 130 people in hospital and 28 of those in intensive care. Meanwhile, New South Wales recorded 18 new cases in the last 24 hours while no new cases were recorded in Queensland and Western Australia. NSW Health deputy chief health officer Jeremy McAnulty has asked residents to remain vigilant. “It wouldn’t take much for us to be in Melbourne’s situation and we need everyone’s assistance,” he said, adding, “Everyone has got a role to play.

The research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, provided the first experimental evidence on the capacity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19 disease, to infect and be transmitted by mosquitoes. “Here we provide the first experimental data to investigate the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to infect and be transmitted by mosquitoes,” the study noted. “While the World Health Organization (WHO) has definitively stated that mosquitoes cannot transmit the virus, our study is the first to provide conclusive data supporting the theory,” said Stephen Higgs, a co-author of the research from Kansas State University in the US. According to the study, conducted at the university’s Biosecurity Research Institute, the virus is unable to replicate in three common and widely distributed species of mosquitoes -- Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus, and hence cannot be transmitted to humans.Samples collected by the scientists within two hours of inoculation in mosquitoes confirmed efficient delivery of infectious viruses to these insects. However, based on the lack of detectable infectious virus in any of the 277 samples collected at all time points beyond 24 hours post-inoculation, the scientists said SARS-CoV-2 cannot replicate in mosquitoes. “Even if a mosquito fed on a person with virus in the blood, the mosquito would not be a vector if feeding on a naive host,” they concluded. “We demonstrate that even under extreme conditions, SARS-CoV-2 virus is unable to replicate in these mosquitoes and therefore cannot be transmitted to people even in the unlikely event that a mosquito fed upon a viremic host,” the scientists wrote in the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-cannot-be-transmitted-by-mosquitoes-says-study/story-ngOh9oIzyrp5pzbiElrisO.html

In this world, to attribute any kind of computer hackers to any country, it is impossible.”Intelligence agencies in the US, Britain and Canada on Thursday accused the hacking group APT29 — also known as Cozy Bear and believed to be part of Russian intelligence — of using malicious software to attack academic and pharmaceutical research institutions involved in Covid-19 vaccine development. It was unclear whether any useful information was stolen.British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also said that “Russian actors” had tried to interfere in last year’s general election by “amplifying” stolen government papers online.Kelin said in the interview that his country had no interest in interfering in British domestic politics.“I do not see any point in using this subject as a matter of interference,” he said. “We do not interfere at all. We do not see any point in interference because for us, whether it will be (the) Conservative Party or Labour’s party at the head of this country, we will try to settle relations and to establish better relations than now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-ambassador-to-britain-rejects-covid-19-vaccine-hacking-claims/story-5Rm3NjHcrF7W6k86uisN4K.html
19-07-2020||World||Syrians vote for new parliament amid health measures against Covid-19||Syrians headed to polling stations in government-held parts of the war-torn country on Sunday to elect a new parliament amid strict health measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus amid an increase of cases in recent days.The vote is the third to take place in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011. It has killed more than 400,000, displaced half the country’s population and sent more than five million as refugees mostly into neighbouring countries.The vote this year comes amid a new wave of US sanctions that came into effect last month and a campaign to fight corruption that saw a wealthy cousin of President Bashar Assad come under pressure to pay back tens of millions of dollars to the state.Some 1,658 government-approved candidates are running this year for the 250-seat People’s Assembly. The total number of eligible voters hasn’t been announced.As in previous votes in Syria, the vote will produce a rubber-stamp body loyal to the president.Inside polling stations, all workers were wearing masks and gloves and voters had to use their own pens in the sanitized booths. Once they cast the ballots they have to leave immediately as no gatherings were allowed inside. People also have to keep a safe distance while waiting for their turn.Assad has twice postponed the country’s parliamentary elections this year in light of restrictions in place to combat the spread of the coronavirus. Assad himself is not standing for election.Syria, that had a pre-war population of 22 million, has reported 496 cases of infections and 25 deaths because of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. However, the actual numbers are likely far higher.The head of the Higher Judicial Committee for the Elections, Judge Samer Zumriq, confirmed on Saturday in a statement to state news agency SANA that more than 7,400 polling stations have been set up in 15 voting districts. They include 1,400 stations where troops and members of the country’s security services will vote.No vote was being held in the northwestern province of Idlib, the last rebel stronghold in Syria or in the country’s northeast, which is controlled by US-backed Kurdish-led fighters.Polling centers opened at 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) and are scheduled to close 12 hours later. Results are expected to be announced the following day.Some 167 seats are allocated for Assad’s ruling Arab Socialist Baath Party — guaranteeing it a solid majority — while the rest are allocated for independents, including merchants, businessmen and industrialists.“We hope that the members of the new council would work to improve the living conditions of citizens by enacting new legislation,” said Samir Sulaiman, a 50-year-old employee.This year’s vote comes as the country is also witnessing harsh economic conditions including a crash in the local currency worsened by US sanctions and an economic crisis in neighbouring Lebanon.The so-called Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, envisages sanctions on Syrian troops and others responsible for atrocities committed during Syria’s civil war and funding for war crimes investigations and prosecutions.Syria calls the sanctions acts of “economic terrorism.”Outgoing legislator Mohannad Haj Ali, who is under US and European sanctions, said the country is experiencing a “suffocating economic and political siege.” He also said Syrian citizens are aware of corruption within state institutions adding that Assad has started “dealing with corruption by tracking down on the corrupt.”Haj Ali did not give any names but his comments came after Assad’s maternal cousin Rami Makhlouf, who was once described as central to Syria’s economy, has been pleading for Assad to help prevent the collapse of his business.The last parliament was elected in April 2016, when large parts of Syria were outside of government control and people there did not take part in the polling. Since then Assad’s forces have captured much of Syria with the help of his allies Russia and Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrians-vote-for-new-parliament-amid-health-measures-against-covid-19/story-LQ3ifEJG8Ur3qxyYyntbPN.html
19-07-2020||World||Germany’s Merkel warns of summit failure on EU recovery fund||European Union leaders may not reach a deal on a coronavirus stimulus plan on Sunday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said as marathon negotiations ran into a third day and acrimony mounted over the demands of rich but thrifty countries.Germany and France, the EU’s powerbrokers, are seeking a deal on a 1.8 trillion euro ($2.06 trillion) economic recovery package to rescue the bloc’s economies that are facing their worst recession since World War Two.After two exhausting days of negotiations, a “frugal” group of northern, richer states led by the Netherlands appeared no more willing to back down from demands for cuts to the package, underscoring the depth of the EU’s north-south split.“There is a lot of goodwill, but also many positions. I will make every effort but it is possible that there is no result,” Merkel said in Brussels as she arrived for a third day of talks.Late on Saturday, she and French President Emmanuel Macron left the day’s final stretch of informal talks early, refusing to accept that the level of free grants to ailing economies in the package fall below 400 billion euros.Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte had earlier accused the Netherlands and its allies Austria, Sweden, Denmark and Finland of “blackmail”. Stockholm proposes to cut grants to 155 billion euros.ANNOYED DEPARTURESIn their first face-to-face summit since the spring outbreak of the coronavirus in Europe, leaders wearing face masks have framed the summit as a ‘make-or-break’ moment for nearly 70 years of European integration.Failure to come together amid an unprecedented health and economic crisis would raise serious questions about the continued viability of the bloc, officials and experts say.Macron said there was a willingness to compromise, but it should not deter “from the legitimate ambition that we need to have,” referring to the level of money available in the planned 750 billion euro recovery fund, which is to be funded by money raised on capital markets.Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who faces parliamentary elections by March 2021, was frank about the divisions with France and Germany on Saturday night.“They walked away annoyed,” Rutte said of Merkel and Macron. “Large differences still remain,” he said.While the Netherlands and its allies held out, other obstacles remained, not least because Britain’s departure from the EU means others have to stump up more cash to cover the gap in the bloc’s joint coffers.Hungary, backed by its eurosceptic ally Poland, has threatened to veto the package over a new proposed mechanism, supported by the Dutch and most other EU countries, to freeze out countries flouting democratic principles.“There are very different positions,” Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis told reporters. “The Netherlands insists that rule of law must be one of the conditionalities to provide funds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-s-merkel-warns-of-summit-failure-on-eu-recovery-fund/story-EcgvidoqzFy99HZ036J3bN.html

The US embassy was not immediately available for comment.Myanmar has increasingly become a battleground for influence between the two countries since relations between the government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and the West became strained over its treatment of the Rohingya Muslim minority.Author and historian Thant Myint-U told Reuters in an email although the country was of negligible economic value to the rivals, its strategic importance as a bridge between mainland China and the Bay of Bengal was hard to ignore.“Myanmar’s instincts since independence in 1948 are to try to be friends with everyone, but it’s not clear that’s going to remain possible, in this coming period of increasingly febrile superpower rivalry,” he said.“The sheer weight of China’s giant industrial revolution next door is already transforming Myanmar; if multi-billion dollar infrastructure projects are added to the mix, the border between the two countries will become increasingly difficult to see,” he said.“It’s important to remember that Myanmar was one of the few countries in the world where the last Cold War led to proxy armed fighting which in turn led to military dictatorship and decades of self-imposed isolation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ugly-face-us-china-trade-barbs-in-myanmar-as-south-china-sea-rift-deepens/story-ipf3c22KVa66OgeW6gI0HK.html
19-07-2020||World||Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s graft trial resumes amid country’s Covid-19 anger||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s corruption trial resumed on Sunday, as the long-serving leader faces mounting discontent over his handling of the coronavirus crisis.Netanyahu is charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a series of scandals in which he is alleged to have received lavish gifts from billionaire friends and exchanged regulatory favours with media moguls for more agreeable coverage of himself and his family.Netanyahu denies wrongdoing, painting the accusations as a media-orchestrated witch-hunt pursued by a biased law enforcement system.The trial opened in May. Just before appearing in front of the judges, Netanyahu took to a podium inside the courthouse and flanked by his party members bashed the country’s legal institutions in an angry tirade.Netanyahu was not expected to appear at Sunday’s hearing, which is taking place at a Jerusalem court and is mostly a procedural deliberation that will determine the pace at which the trial will proceed.The trial resumes as Netanyahu faces widespread anger over his government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis.While the country appeared to have tamped down a first wave of infections, what’s emerged as a hasty and erratic reopening has sent infections soaring. Yet even amid the rise in new cases Netanyahu and his emergency government — formed with the goal of dealing with the crisis — appeared to neglect the numbers and moved forward with other policy priorities and its reopening plans.It has since paused them and even reimposed restrictions, including a weekend only lockdown set to begin later this week.Netanyahu and his government have been criticized for a baffling, halting response to the new wave, which has seen daily cases rise to nearly 2,000. It has been slammed for its handling of the economic fallout of the crisis.While Israel has pledged billions of dollars worth of aid, it hasn’t all been doled out to those in need, and a plan to give a stipend to all Israelis, even the wealthy, has been panned by the country’s leading economists. The first and second round of restrictions has battered the economy and sent unemployment skyrocketing to more than 20%, up from 3.9% before the outbreak.The anger has boiled over into protests over the past few weeks that have culminated in violent clashes with police.The protests haven’t been on a massive scale, partly due to restrictions on large gatherings, but the rising frustration appears to be among the greatest challenges Netanyahu has faced in his decade-plus in power.His trial thus comes at inopportune timing. Netanyahu had hoped to ride on the goodwill he gained from overcoming the first wave of infections going into his corruption trial but the increasingly souring mood has dropped his approval ratings and may deny him the public backing he had hoped for.Although his base remains firmly behind him, only a smattering of supporters turned up outside the court to voice their backing for the prime minister, far fewer than the throngs at the trial’s opening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-s-graft-trial-resumes-amid-country-s-covid-19-anger/story-SnqHwl06oM5DbLBAFw01BP.html

Fears of an outbreak loom in China’s Xinjiang province which has now moved on to offer free coronavirus tests. Malls and hotels here have been shut and housing compounds locked down.The local government on Saturday said that the testing will be carried out in two phases in Urumqi where China’s 13 locally-transmitted virus cases were found, Bloomberg reported. The city of has 30 confirmed cases and 41 asymptomatic carriers since it reported its first infection in five months on July 15.Also read: How to deal with dengue during Covid-19? States come up with new protocolsThose who came in contact with the confirmed and suspected cases will be the first ones to get tested followed by residents in other housing compounds, government and civil servant in the second phase of testing.Meanwhile, China reported 16 new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours, Sputnik reported citing the country’s National Health Commission said on Sunday. 13 of these are local cases while the rest are imported. China registered 42 asymptomatic coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, the commission stated. Capital city Beijing, on the other hand, reported no new confirmed domestically transmitted Covid-19 cases on Saturday, as per the municipal health commission.China, the original epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, reported its first case around December 2019. In a matter of months, the country reported a spurt in cases which went up to over 80,000. By the time Beijing said it has reached its virus peak, the infection had already travelled across the world and assumed the form of a pandemic. The World Health Organization described it as a global health crisis. Europe soon became the next epicentre with countries like Italy, Spain and the UK reporting massive rise in Covid-19 cases and fatalities. Cases also began to rise in the United States which is the worst-hit country at the moment followed by Brazil and India at the third spot.

Water levels in the region were likely to exceed the maximum level that reservoirs can withstand, the ministry added.At Lake Tai, on the border of the wealthy coastal provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, water levels have already risen above the safety guaranteed level, according to government data.The summer rainy season brings floods to China almost every year but the impact of the disruption they cause is being felt further afield as Chinese goods become more important in global supply chains for various items, including personal protective equipment, vital in the fight against the novel coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-raises-flood-alert-levels-along-huai-river/story-UGXIl1EcOImGPv83tv3TTL.html

Over 45,000 new infections were reported by the health ministry on Thursday (July 16). The real figures, however, are believed to be much higher due to a lack of testing. The total confirmed coronavirus-related deaths in the country stood at 76,688, also the second-highest globally behind the United States, Al Jazeera reported.Even as cases eased a bit in the biggest and hardest-hit Brazilian cities, infections are still rising in new locations through the country.At a public hospital in the city of Campinas, northwest of Sao Paulo, a video recorded by a doctor who works at the facility showed that there were no intensive care (ICU) facilities, available to treat Covid-19 patients.Health officials in the city say that the coronavirus has become a major factor of threat to public health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-hospitals-struggling-to-deal-with-influx-of-coronavirus-patients/story-0ImnXbdFaPaJGrvmWumh0H.html
19-07-2020||World||Baloch families seek answers from Pakistan as more disappear amid insurgency||For over 11 years relatives of people who disappeared in the murk of a separatist insurgency in southwestern Pakistan have gathered outside the Press Club of Quetta wanting to know who took their fathers, husbands and sons.The daily sit-in protest in the provincial capital of Balochistan began on June 28, 2009 after a doctor, Deen Muhammad, was abducted by “unknown men”.Relatives suspect Muhammad, like many other missing ethnic Balochs, was snatched by Pakistani security forces hunting separatists, who for decades have waged a campaign for greater autonomy or independence.Sometimes less than a dozen join the daily protest, other days many more, but Muhammad’s two daughters have been among the regulars since they were eight and ten years old.“Our little hands were holding pictures of our father back then; now we have grown up and we still have no clue if he is alive,” Sammi Baloch, now 21, told Reuters by telephone from Quetta.Even when the weather is too extreme in Quetta to hold protest, a sit-in is observed by Balochs in front of the press club in Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city and a melting pot for different ethnic groups.The insurgency in Balochistan, a sparsely populated, mountainous, desert region bordering Afghanistan and Iran has sometimes waned and sometimes intensified over the years.But for all the durability of the Baloch struggle, the conflict has seldom drawn international attention. It grabbed headlines however, in late June when a group of young Baloch militants launched an attack on the Pakistan Stock Exchange in Karachi.On Tuesday, three soldiers were killed and eight wounded in an area known for attacks by Baloch fighters. But beyond giving the grinding casualty toll, the veil of secrecy over the conflict is seldom lifted, and foreign journalists are often discouraged from visiting Balochistan.Multiple calls, texts and emails to Pakistan’s human rights ministry, the military and Balochistan’s provincial government, seeking comment for this story went unanswered.The military did issue a statement last year sympathising with families of missing Balochs, while saying that some may have joined militant groups and “not every person missing is attributable to the state.”Pakistan has repeatedly blamed India for fanning militancy in Balochistan, a charge New Delhi has consistently denied.MORE MISSINGLast month, the Balochistan National Party (BNP) quit Prime Minister Imran Khan’s parliamentary bloc, frustrated by unfulfilled promises to address Baloch grievances including the festering issue of the disappeared.When he led the BNP into an alliance with Khan’s coalition two years ago, Akhtar Mengal gave the government a list of 5,128 missing persons.Since then over 450 of the people on the list have been found or returned to their families, but during the same period Mengal says another 1,800 were reported to have disappeared.“If you cannot recover people, at least stop disappearing more people,” said Mengal.Another Baloch party - set up in the months prior to the 2018 elections with backing from the military establishment, according political analysts - is in a coalition with Prime Minister Khan’s party at both federal and provincial level.Balochistan Awami Party Senator Anwar-ul-Haq Kakar told Reuters the numbers of missing are “exaggerated”.But, Mama Qadeer, who heads a group called Voice for Baloch Missing Persons, keeps his own count.“In last six months, the number of Baloch missing persons has risen,” he told Reuters by telephone. His son disappeared a decade ago.In February last year, Qadeer’s group handed a list of 500 missing to provincial officials. Since then nearly 300 have been returned to their homes, but 87 others disappeared in the first half of this year, according to the group.CHINA RAISES STAKESA federal commission set up nine years ago listed 6,506 cases of enforced disappearances nationwide by the end of 2019. Most came from the northwestern province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.Only 472 were registered from Balochistan. Advocacy groups say Balochistan’s number is far higher, pointing to difficulty in having cases accepted by the commission.“There’s hardly a home in Balochistan that hasn’t had a relative or loved one picked up,” Mohammad Ali Talpur, an aged activist who once fought alongside Baloch insurgents in the 1970s, told Reuters.The conflict has a long, complex history, but since that time the stakes have risen as Balochistan’s wealth of copper, gold, gas and coal deposits caught China’s eye.The prospects of Pakistan’s most reliable ally pouring in money excited successive governments, while fuelling Baloch resentment over how little would come their way.Separatist militants have frequently targeted Chinese construction in Gwadar, a port on the Balochistan coast, near the entrance to the strategically-important Gulf.And in 2018, the Balochistan Liberation Army launched an assault on the Chinese consulate in the southern port city of Karachi, killing four Pakistani police and civilians.It was the most high profile attack by the group until June 29 this year, when its fighters attacked the stock exchange, again killing four people.The attack came a day after hundreds of relatives of missing Balochs gathered in Quetta to mark the four thousandth day of their protest since the disappearance of Dr Muhammad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/baloch-families-seek-answers-from-pakistan-as-more-disappear-amid-insurgency/story-AwL7Gkum7i2QhXYxe94JvN.html

The social media company has several times disabled or commented on tweets by the president because of what it said were copyright complaints or violations of a policy against threatening violence.Twitter removed an image the president tweeted on June 30, which included a picture of Trump, because of a complaint from the New York Times, whose photographer had shot the image.The company also put a tweet from the president behind a warning label in late May, saying that he had violated its rules against “glorifying violence” when he advocated that Minneapolis authorities be tough in responding to protests over the death of George Floyd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-disables-donald-trump-s-tweet-over-copyright-complaint/story-KJxBu2taKfS7g3ajOCb4iJ.html

Please help us to stop the spread of this disease” by staying home except for necessary trips, socially distancing and wearing masks in public, Rodriguez said.Rodriguez did not return messages for comment Saturday from The Associated Press.Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is also stressing that the widespread use of face coverings could avoid another lockdown, which he hasn’t ruled out.Texas health officials reported more than 10,000 new cases for a fifth consecutive day on Saturday and said 130 more people have died due to Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, bringing the number of reported cases to 317,730 and the number of deaths to 3,865.The true number of cases is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up within weeks. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the highly contagious virus can cause severe symptoms and be fatal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-coronavirus-cases-include-more-than-80-infants/story-e1aRMGodQfKCYKRrwVCuzO.html

It’s the end of press freedom as we knew it in Hong Kong,” Yuen Chan, a former local reporter now lecturing at London’s City University, told AFP.The New York Times, CNN, Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, CNBC, the Financial Times and AFP are among numerous international media outlets with a presence in the city, many basing their regional headquarters there.Free from the harassment, censorship and restrictions pervasive on the authoritarian Chinese mainland, semi-autonomous Hong Kong has thrived as a safe haven for both local and foreign reporters.But signs of the sands shifting have begun to emerge since China introduced its draconian new law earlier this month.On Tuesday the New York Times announced it would relocate a third of its staff to Seoul, saying it faced unprecedented trouble obtaining visas.Hong Kong authorities recently launched a review of independent but state-funded broadcaster RTHK following accusations it was overly sympathetic to pro-democracy protests.Immediately after the security law was passed, two columnists quit the city’s rambunctious Apple Daily newspaper, a staunch advocate for greater democracy.The tabloid is owned by Jimmy Lai, a tycoon who Chinese state media has labelled a leading “black hand” colluding with foreign forces to destroy the mainland.‘Open season’ Beijing has made little secret of its desire to rein in Hong Kong’s media, both domestic and foreign.One provision of the national security law orders authorities to “strengthen the management” of foreign news organisations.“It seems like they are starting to at least consider using the visa as a means to punish the people they don’t like,” said Keith Richburg, director of the Journalism and Media Studies Centre at the University of Hong Kong and a former foreign correspondent for the Washington Post.In 2018, Financial Times journalist Victor Mallet was refused a visa renewal weeks after he hosted a talk at the city’s foreign press club with an independence activist.Sharron Fast, deputy director at Hong Kong University’s journalism programme, said the clause about foreign media in the new law “sounds ominously like Hong Kong will move towards a China-style press credential requirement”.The legislation also grants the territory’s police and China’s intelligence apparatus sweeping surveillance powers, something Fast said could make it harder for journalists to protect their sources.“It is basically open season on interception of communications and online surveillance,” she told AFP.Much of the law is broadly worded and criminalises certain speech, such as a ban on instigating hatred towards the government or advocating independence.Journalists fear they may inadvertently cross a red line by reporting what others say.Self-censorship Media groups warn local outlets are particularly vulnerable.Hong Kong reporters have historically been a crucial conduit of information out of mainland China. And the city’s press corps routinely barrages officials with the kind of critical questioning that would be unthinkable north of the border.Last week, city leader Carrie Lam was asked if she could “100 percent guarantee” media freedoms.Her reply was that if reporters “guarantee that they will not commit any offences under this piece of national legislation”, then she could.However, even before the security law, local media were under pressure, with advertising often drying up for the most Beijing-critical outlets.“The problem of self-censorship, which has already been a concern, will get worse,” said Chris Yeung from the Hong Kong Journalists Association.“It is likely that the mainland-style media control system and mechanism will be gradually introduced in Hong Kong.”But London City University lecturer Chan said the press would not be easily tamed.“Journalists in Hong Kong will do as much as they can for as long as they can,” she said.Apple Daily boss Lai was asked in an online Q&A on Friday about the future of his reporting staff.“It’s very difficult to protect them. All I can do is tell them to do things according to their conscience,” he said. “I cannot ask them to be a martyr.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-new-security-law-sends-jitters-through-city-s-feisty-press/story-swKa5TMe3MzURAHobjAxBO.html
19-07-2020||World||Masks made mandatory in Melbourne as Covid-19 cases continue to rise||People in Melbourne must now wear masks when leaving their homes as Victoria, Australia’s second most-populous state, marked two weeks of triple-digit increases in new coronavirus infections on Sunday.Melbournians not wearing face coverings will be fined A$200 ($140), said Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews.Victoria, which has forced nearly 5 million people into a partial six-week lockdown on July 9, reported 363 new cases of the coronavirus on Sunday, after 217 cases the previous day. “We’re going to be wearing masks in Victoria and potentially in other parts of the country for a very long time,” Andrews told a televised briefing.“There’s no vaccine to this wildly infectious virus,” he said. Masks are “a simple thing, but it’s about changing habits, it’s about becoming a simple part of your routine.”Australia has recorded about 11,800 cases of Covid-19, a fraction of what has been seen in other countries or even some US states, but an outbreak of community transmission in Victoria has been growing, prompting authorities to restrict social distancing.Three Covid-19 deaths were reported in Victoria on Sunday, bringing the total to 38 and raising Australia’s death toll to 121. New South Wales, the most populous state, has seen new cases in the low double digits in recent weeks and growing. Health officials are concerned about the transmission rate, which they say is higher than in Victoria.About 60 people in Sydney face a fine of $1,000 each after attending a party Saturday night and breaking the public health guidelines of no more than 20 visitors to a home, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/masks-made-mandatory-in-melbourne-as-covid-19-cases-continue-to-rise/story-08m6HXVA1j8lSfhw6UuyeK.html

19-07-2020||World||Merkel and Macron walk out on Rutte in dispute over EU stimulus||European Union leaders failed to unlock an agreement on a 750 billion-euro ($860 billion) response to the coronavirus pandemic after a second day of sparring in Brussels and will come back to try again on Sunday.Leaders continued with informal talks after negotiations broke up at at 11 p.m. on Saturday as they tried to find common ground on the composition of the fund and the conditions attached to it. A crucial late-night meeting including Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Germany’s Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron of France ended abruptly in a dispute over how much of the package should be disbursed as grants and how much as loans.Germany and France are insisting that at least 400 billion euros should be handouts and Rutte and four other fiscal hawks from northern Europe are pushing for a much lower figure, a French diplomat said. After several attempts at finding a compromise, Merkel and Macron left the meeting and returned to their hotel together for further discussions, the diplomat said.“They are walking away grumpy,” Rutte told reporters afterward. “A compromise is possible tomorrow but there remain big issues.”With investors already pricing in a deal after a series of bold announcement in recent weeks, leaders are under intense pressure to bridge their differences before financial markets open on Monday.Yet the battle has exposed the fault lines at the heart of the EU. Fiscally hawkish countries from northern Europe are showing their resentment at paying for the pandemic while the southern countries worst affected are struggling to contain their outrage at the lack of solidarity.“We will keep going because we have to resolve it,” Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told reporters. “Delaying this does no good to anyone.”Rutte and his allies from Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Finland are trying to water down the handouts that the highly indebted South sees as critical for shoring up its finances. While Saturday proved less bad-tempered and more constructive than Friday’s gathering, it was still difficult to discern much progress. Conte called it a “deadlock” while a German diplomat said the talks had reached a critical phase.The 27 leaders were meeting in person for the first time since February, when initial talks over the EU’s seven-year, 1 trillion-euro budget also ran into a wall. Now, with more than 100,000 Europeans dead from the virus and an economy to rebuild, investors are looking to the group to muster a display of unity to maintain the rally in stocks.Saturday started with a fresh compromise proposal drafted by EU Council President Charles Michel but as time wore on, frustration grew. While Rutte, the hardliners’ ringleader, welcomed a proposal to reduce the amount of grants to 450 billion euros from 500 billion euros, his allies from Austria and Finland pushed for the total to go lower still setting up a clash with Merkel and Macron.In an attempt to bend to another of Rutte’s demands, the new plan had also included a mechanism that would give any country the right to put the brakes on disbursement if it didn’t think the money was being spent correctly. The Dutch saw it as a step in the right direction, but the southerners fretted that it could slow up the cash they need to get their economies going. Leaders must agree unanimously if there’s to be a deal.Power BrokersThe deliberations are proving to be a baptism of fire for Michel, a former Belgian Prime Minister, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who drew up the original plan. They only took up their jobs in December and have faced criticism from governments over their handling of the pandemic response.Merkel and Macron have been pressing for an agreement before the summer but haven’t yet been able to bring to their weight to bear to force a result. The bloc’s two largest economies but are seen as crucial power brokers and they were photographed sitting on a sunny terrace as they searched for a breakthrough.Adding to the complications is the number of side issues that are being tied to the fund.Many leaders want to see access to financing linked to member states’ compliance with democratic standards and that’s something that Poland and Hungary strongly oppose, since both are subject to EU legal proceedings over rule-of-law backsliding.Leaders spent the last part of the Saturday discussing the latest proposal, seen by Bloomberg, which stipulates that rule-of-law “conditionality under the regime will be genuine” and that when transgressions are identified, the European Commission will propose “appropriate and proportionate” measures. Those measures will be approved by a qualified majority rather than unanimously, meaning that the Poles and the Hungarians won’t have vetoes to bail each other out as they do in other areas.Adding another layer of complexity, Hungary’s parliament passed a declaration this month that called on Prime Minister Viktor Orban to reject any stimulus package until the EU investigation into its democratic standards was withdrawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merkel-and-macron-walk-out-on-rutte-in-dispute-over-eu-stimulus/story-EWPkc7gzVivcwBER37kWhP.html

The previous WHO record for new cases was 237,743 on Friday. Deaths rose by 7,360, the biggest one-day increase since May 10. Deaths have been averaging 4,800 a day in July, up slightly from an average of 4,600 a day in June.Total global coronavirus cases surpassed 14 million on Friday, according to a Reuters tally, marking another milestone in the spread of the disease that has killed nearly 600,000 people in seven months. The surge means that 1 million cases were reported in under 100 hours.The WHO reported 71,484 new cases in the United States, 45,403 in Brazil, 34,884 in India and 13,373 in South Africa.India on Friday became the third country in the world to record more than 1 million cases of the new coronavirus, behind only the United States and Brazil. Epidemiologists say India is still likely months from hitting its peak. Cases in Brazil crossed the 2 million mark on Thursday, doubling in less than a month and adding nearly 40,000 new cases a day. A patchwork of state and city responses has held up poorly in Brazil in the absence of a tightly coordinated policy from the federal government.The United States, which leads with world with over 3.7 million cases, has also tried to curb the outbreak at the state and local levels with only limited success.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-reports-record-daily-increase-in-global-covid-19-cases-for-second-day-in-a-row/story-ORKCPBrn30SFJVa2mbDQVI.html
19-07-2020||World||Given a chance, Trump would push court pick before election||President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have tried to make it clear: Given the chance, they would push through a Supreme Court nominee should a vacancy occur before Election Day.The issue has taken on new immediacy with the disclosure Friday that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is receiving chemotherapy for a recurrence of cancer after four earlier bouts with the disease. The 87-year-old liberal, who apologized in 2016 for her pointed public criticism of Trump during his first campaign, says she has no plans to retire.The development has focused even more on what’s at stake this election, with the winner in position to help shape the trajectory of the court for years to come.Trump administration officials have underscored that Trump would not hesitate to fill an opening before voters have their say Nov. 3, less than four months away, on whether to give him a second term.Four years ago, also in a presidential election year, the GOP-controlled Senate refused to hold a hearing or vote when President Barack Obama, a Democrat, nominated federal judge Merrick Garland to succeed Justice Antonin Scalia after his death in February. Nine months before that year’s election, McConnell said voters should determine who would nominate the person to fill that seat.Fast forward to this past week. Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, told reporters: “I can’t imagine that if he had a vacancy on the Supreme Court that he would not very quickly make the appointment and look for the Senate to take quick action.”Meadows spoke shortly after the court said Ginsburg was briefly hospitalized, but before the justice announced she had a recurrence of cancer and has been treated with chemotherapy since May 19.Ginsburg is the oldest justice, followed by Stephen Breyer, 81, Clarence Thomas, 72, and Samuel Alito, 70.Trump sees his efforts at reshaping the judiciary as a signature achievement of his presidency. Last month he marked his 200th judicial appointment. Earlier in his term, he won confirmation of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the high court.The president has sought to remind fellow Republicans that should he win a second term, he would have the chance to push the Supreme Court and lower courts further to the right.Last month, after the court rejected his administration’s attempt to end an Obama-era program that provided legal protections to roughly 650,000 immigrants illegally brought to the United States as children, Trump said more needed to be done to push the court to the right.He said he would release a “new list of Conservative Supreme Court Justice nominees” by Sept. 1. “Based on decisions being rendered now, this list is more important than ever before (Second Amendment, Right to Life, Religous Liberty, etc.) – VOTE 2020!” he tweeted.Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law school professor, said Republicans “have shown no consistency” between their refusal to give Garland a hearing and their insistence it would be proper to move forward on a vacancy during the waning days of a potentially lame-duck presidency.Tobias said Trump and Republicans are calculating that playing up their commitment to adding another conservative justice is such an attractive pitch to base voters that it’s worth risking being labeled hypocrites by their opponents.Leading Republicans, including the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, now say it’s OK to consider an election-year appointment when the Senate and the White House are held by the same party.“Merrick Garland was a different situation,” Graham said in May. “You had the president of one party nominating, and you had the Senate in the hands of the other party. A situation where you’ve got them both would be different.”McConnell was even more blunt. “Yeah, we’d fill it,” he said in a February interview.Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, a member of the Judiciary panel who is facing reelection, told Iowa PBS on Friday that she would also be supportive of holding hearings and a vote on a Trump nominee this year, even if the president lost reelection.“There’s likely not to be a lot of disagreement” between the Senate and the White House on the selection of a nominee, unlike in 2016, Ernst said.At least one key Republican has expressed reservations.Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the former chairman of the Judiciary panel who blocked Garland’s nomination in 2016, said two years ago that he would not take up a new nomination if he were still the committee chairman in 2020 and there were a Supreme Court vacancy. But Grassley, who now heads the Senate Finance Committee, said if there were a different chairman that person would have to make the call.Grassley told Fox News in 2018 that the wouldn’t take up the nomination because “I pledged that in 2016 … That’s a decision I made a long time ago.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/given-a-chance-trump-would-push-court-pick-before-election/story-MSRtRmdzyXBhfaOAGPJoiK.html

But it has hired aggressively in California this year, including poaching Kevin Mayer, a former Walt Disney Co executive, to be TikTok’s chief executive. He is based in the United States.TikTok is facing heavy scrutiny in Washington over suspicions China could force the company to turn over user data.

19-07-2020||World||‘Black Lives’ mural outside Trump Tower defaced for 3rd time||A “Black Lives Matter” mural painted on the street in front of President Donald Trump’s namesake New York City tower has quickly become a target for vandalism, defaced with bucketfuls of paint three times in less than a week.In the latest incident, two women were arrested around 3 p.m. Saturday after police said they poured black paint on the block-long mural outside Trump Tower on Manhattan’s chic Fifth Avenue.Bystander video showed police officers surrounding one of the women as she rubbed the paint on the mural’s bright yellow letters and screamed: “they don’t care about Black lives” and “refund the police.”One of the officers slipped on the paint and tumbled to the ground, sustaining injuries to his head and arm, police said. He was listed in stable condition at Bellevue Hospital.A police department spokesperson said the women’s names and information on possible charges against them weren’t immediately available.The city’s largest police union, the Police Benevolent Association, tweeted: “Thankfully our brother will be OK, but this nonsense needs to stop. Our city is in crisis. Paint on the street helps no one.”Saturday’s vandalism happened less than 24 hours after three people were caught on surveillance video smearing blue paint on the mural around 4 p.m. Friday while a woman littered it with flyers that referenced the recent shooting death of a 1-year-old boy in Brooklyn, police said.Officers found the trio nearby a short time later with blue paint on their hands and clothing, police said. According to the video of the incident, one of them was wearing an “All Lives Matter” shirt as well as other apparel indicating support for President Donald Trump.They were arrested, charged with criminal mischief and released with a order to appear in court at a later date.The woman, 64, was issued a criminal court summons for illegal posting of flyers. A photo provided by police showed one of the flyers designed like an internet meme, with a close-up picture of 1-year-old shooting victim Davell Gardner Jr. under the words “DID MY LIFE MATTER” followed by a crying emoji.Next to Gardner’s picture was a message written in red marker: “I wasn’t killed by a cop. I was killed by a Black person. Where’s BLM?”Police have released surveillance video showing two men running and pointing guns who are believed to be suspects in the July 11 shooting. Witnesses say they jumped out of a car and fired multiple shots at the group before driving away. No arrests have been made.Meanwhile, police are continuing to look for a man in black shorts and a dark blue T-shirt who was seen splashing red paint on the “Black Lives Matter” mural around noon on Monday.The words “Black Lives Matter” have been painted on streets in New York and elsewhere in recent weeks to show support for the movement demanding justice and reforms after the recent police killings of George Floyd and other Black people.Mayor Bill de Blasio helped paint the mural in front of President Donald Trump’s namesake tower last week.Trump said last month in a tweet that affixing the words to Fifth Avenue in front of his building would denigrate “this luxury Avenue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-mural-outside-trump-tower-defaced-for-3rd-time/story-IkHf5B8oH6kPvGNZ4RescM.html
19-07-2020||World||Mass protests rock Russian Far East city, challenge Kremlin||Mass rallies challenging the Kremlin rocked Russia’s Far East city of Khabarovsk again on Saturday, as tens of thousands took to the streets to protest the arrest of the region’s governor on charges of involvement in multiple murders.The massive unauthoritized crowds gathered despite local officials’ attempts to discourage people from taking to the streets, citing the coronavirus epidemic and an alleged averted terrorist threat.Local media estimated the rally in the city 3,800 miles east of Moscow drew 15,000 to 50,000 people, while city authorities put the number at 10,000. Hundreds of people have rallied in the city every day this week against the arrest of Sergei Furgal, reflecting widespread anger over the arrest of the popular governor and a simmering discontent with the Kremlin’s policies.Furgal, the Khabarovsk region governor, was arrested on July 9 and flown to Moscow where he was put in jail for two months. Russia’s Investigative Committee says he is suspected of involvement in several murders of businessmen in 2004 and 2005.Furgal has denied the charges, which relate to his time as a businessman importing consumer goods ranging from timber and metals. Khabarovsk residents dismissed the charges against him as unsubstantiated and denounced the Kremlin for targeting a governor they elected.“It’s not only about this (whether Furgal arrest is legal or not). People are fed up with the way we are treated, that they can simply take away our choice,” protester Mikhail Yerashchenko told The Associated Press on Saturday.A member of the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party, Furgal was elected governor in 2018, defeating the Kremlin-backed incumbent. His victory was unexpected: Furgal didn’t actively campaign and toed the Kremlin’s line, publicly supporting his rival.People voted for him nonetheless, delivering a humiliating blow to the main Kremlin party, United Russia, that has been losing seats in regional governments over the past two years.During his two years in office, Furgal has earned a reputation of being “the people’s governor.” He cut his own salary, ordered the sale of an expensive yacht that the previous administration bought, met with protesters when rallies happened and significantly reduced flight fares for residents in remote areas.“Furgal became a political symbol for the residents of the region, and all accusations — no matter how grave — are from another, non-political dimension,” political analyst Abbas Gallyamov said in a Facebook post.Last Saturday, crowds of reportedly up to 35,000 people rallied in Khabarovsk. Protesters demanded that Furgal’s trial be moved to Khabarovsk, with one saying “we have elected him and it’s up to us to judge him.” Some questioned the timing of the arrest, pointing to Furgal’s decade-long stint as a lawmaker in the Russian parliament before running for governor, during which the murder charges never came up.The unauthorised protests are the largest ever in Khabarovsk, a city of 590,000. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the situation “not standard” this week. Moscow has not yet appointed an acting governor 11 days after Furgal’s arrest.Police didn’t interfere with Saturday’s rally. Protesters held banners demanding Furgal’s freedom and chanted “I, you, he and she – the entire country is for Furgal”.Smaller rallies in support of Furgal also took place Saturday in Komsomolsk-on-Amur, another big city in the Khabarovsk region, and in the city of Vladivostok in the neighbouring Primorye region.“Though I’m almost 70, I worry sincerely about my region, about Russia and our nation, about Furgal and freedom. I want us to be free,” Alla Sokolova, a protester in Khabarovsk, told the AP.

19-07-2020||World||14 hours later, Trump says he is ‘saddened’ by Lewis’ death||In the hours after the death of American civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to retweet old missives about Democratic rival Joe Biden and lash out at his former national security adviser and his niece for writing tell-all books about him.Trump then headed to his golf course in northern Virginia with a political confidant, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, for a nearly four-hour outing.Shortly after 2 p.m., as Trump was returning from his golf outing — and more than 14 hours after Lewis’ death was announced — he offered his and the first lady’s condolences in a two-sentence Twitter message.“Saddened to hear the news of civil rights hero John Lewis passing. Melania and I send our prayers to he and his family,” Trump wrote.By that point all four living former US presidents, Vice President Mike Pence and scores of lawmakers had publicly remarked on the passing of the lawmaker whose brutal beating on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, 50 years earlier marked a turning point in the civil rights movement.Trump had battled publicly with Lewis, 80, the youngest and last living member of the Big Six civil rights activists who organized the 1963 March on Washington.Lewis, D-Ga., memorably tangled with Trump days before the president’s inauguration in 2017. The congressman said he did not see Trump as a “legitimate president,” prompting Trump to blast Lewis as “all talk” and denigrate his majority Black district as “crime infested” and “falling apart.”For the only time during his long service in Congress, Lewis in 2017 skipped the swearing-in ceremony.In December of that year, Lewis refused to speak at the opening of Mississippi civil rights and history museums because Trump would be there. He said the president’s “hurtful policies are an insult to the people portrayed in this civil rights museum.”Then, as this year’s election battle heated up in the spring, Lewis threw his weight behind Biden and urged young Black voters to help make sure the former vice president wins in November.He didn’t mention Trump by name during his April endorsement, but made clear that he saw Biden’s mission as a chance to “redeem the soul of America.”Rep. Karen Bass, the Democratic chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, wrote on Twitter that she hoped that Trump would stay silent about Lewis’ death.At that point, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany had noted that Lewis “was an icon of the civil rights movement,” and Pence had issued a statement praising Lewis for his place in American history and noting that as colleagues in the House that “even when we differed, John was always unfailingly kind.”Bass wrote: “@realDonaldTrump while the nation mourns the passing of a national hero, please say nothing. Please don’t comment on the life of Congressman Lewis. Your press secretary released a statement, leave it at that.”The White House did not respond to a request for comment about Bass’ statement.The White House also issued a proclamation from the president ordering the lowering of US flags at federal buildings for Lewis’ death. By law the flag is lowered the day after a sitting member of Congress passes.In some ways, Trump’s perfunctory offering of condolences showed a measure of restraint compared with some past episodes involving political opponents.The president was not invited to attend Sen. John McCain’s funeral in 2018. Trump had said earlier that he didn’t think McCain was a hero because the senator was captured in Vietnam. McCain was tortured and held prisoner for more than five years.Trump seemed unable to forget one of McCain’s Senate votes in particular, the thumbs-down that sank the Republican effort in 2017 to repeal the Obama health care law. Trump was furious, and it showed even after McCain’s death. The administration lowered the American flag over the White House to half-staff, but then raised it again two days later. The flags were lowered again after a public outcry.And Trump’s anti-McCain Twitter tirades continued long after his death from brain cancer. The president also complained that he was never properly thanked for McCain’s funeral at Washington’s National Cathedral.Trump drew criticism late last year for suggesting the late Rep. John Dingell, a Democrat, might be “looking up” from hell during a rally in Dingell’s home state of Michigan.The dig at Dingell, whose wife, Rep. Debbie Dingell, succeeded him in the House, came during Trump’s impeachment. Days earlier, Trump expressed anger that the congresswoman had supported his impeachment.“The last time I spoke to Debbie Dingell was her call thanking me for granting top memorial and funeral service honors for her then just departed husband, long time Congressman John Dingell,” Trump tweeted. “Now I watch her ripping me as part of the Democrats Impeachment Hoax. Really pathetic!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/14-hours-later-trump-says-he-is-saddened-by-lewis-death/story-ulwGSaDOWvW5wHCGrtIkmM.html
19-07-2020||World||Back to normal by Christmas: UK Scientists dismiss Boris’ claim, says vaccine needed||British scientists are dismissing Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s hope the country may emerge from coronavirus lockdown and return to normality by Christmas.Johnson has announced more easing of restrictions, with people urged to return to public transit and workplaces. He says sports fans should return to stadiums by October and remaining restrictions could be lifted from November, “possibly in time for Christmas.” But epidemiologist John Edmunds, a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, says a return to pre-pandemic normality wouldn’t be possible until there’s a vaccine for the virus.He says a world where people can “go to work normally, travel on the buses and trains, go on holiday without restrictions, meet friends, shake hands, hug each other and so on — that’s a long way off, unfortunately.” England’s Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, also says social distancing rules would have to be in place for a “prolonged period.” Britain has registered more than 45,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths, the highest total in Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/back-to-normal-by-christmas-uk-scientists-dismiss-boris-claim-says-vaccine-needed/story-n21nDlatlJToxIl2W6oRAK.html
19-07-2020||World||Firebrand civil rights leader John Lewis from 1960s America passes away||John Lewis, the civil rights warrior who marched with Martin Luther King Jr and was nearly killed in police beatings before serving for decades as an American congressman, died on Friday.Lewis, a Congressman from Atlanta who had announced in December that he had advanced pancreatic cancer, was 80.The African-American icon spent his life getting into what he liked to call “good trouble” - the confrontations necessary to improve the US democracy by racial injustice. “John Lewis was a titan of the civil rights movement whose goodness, faith and bravery transformed our nation - from the determination with which he met discrimination at lunch counters and on Freedom Rides, to the courage he showed as a young man facing down violence and death on Edmund Pettus Bridge, to the moral leadership he brought to the Congress for more than 30 years,” House speaker Nancy Pelosi said of the 17-term congressman from Georgia.The son of sharecroppers, Lewis was just 21 when he became a founding member of Freedom Riders, who fought segregation in the US transportation system in the early 1960s. He was the youngest leader of the 1963 March in Washington, DC in which King delivered his famous “I Have a Dream” speech. Lewis entered Congress in 1986 and became a figure of moral authority. Lewis kept up the fight for civil rights until the end of his life. He made his last public appearance in June, as protests for racial justice swept the United States and the world.He stepped away from his congressional duties in recent months for undergoing cancer treatment.“Our conscience, he was a griot of this modern age, one who saw its hatred but fought ever towards the light,” said Stacey Abrams, a Democratic activist and founder of Fair Fight, a voting rights group in Lewis’ home state of Georgia.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/firebrand-civil-rights-leader-john-lewis-from-1960s-america-passes-away/story-B2b4iyoEcAdRm2w48gGCMN.html
19-07-2020||World||Coronavirus crisis: A million infected in just 100 hours||Global coronavirus infections passed 14 million on Friday, according to a Reuters tally, marking the first time there has been a surge of a million cases in under 100 hours.The first case was reported in China in early January and it took three months to reach 1 million cases. It has taken just four days to climb to 14 million Covid-19 cases from 13 million recorded on July 13.The number of cases globally is around triple that of severe influenza illnesses recorded annually, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).The pandemic has now killed at least 600,000 people in almost seven months, edging towards the upper range of yearly influenza deaths reported worldwide. The first death was reported on January 10 in Wuhan, China before infections and fatalities then surged in Europe and later in the US.In China, Xinjiang reported 16 new domestically transmitted cases for Friday, health authorities said on Saturday as the country readies to battle a new front against the outbreak in the remote northwestern region.The jump in cases followed one new case, and eight more asymptomatic ones. All the cases have been reported from the regional capital Urumqi, and at least 269 people in the city have been put under medical observation. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is moving to cancel the next two-week sitting of parliament because of the recent spread of the virus.Parliament has been scheduled to meet on August 4-13 and then sit again for a two-week session starting August 24.Morrison said on Saturday that he has written to the parliamentary speaker asking for a cancellation, but the request is considered only a formality.Saudi hosts G20 talks on recovery, debtG20 finance ministers and central bankers held talks on Saturday aimed at spurring global economic recovery from a recession amid calls to widen debt relief for crisis-hit poor countries.The virtual talks, hosted by Saudi Arabia, come as the surging pandemic continues to batter the global economy and campaigners warn of a looming debt crisis across poverty-wracked developing nations.The ministers and bankers seek to “discuss the global economic outlook and coordinate collective action for a robust economic recovery,” G20 organisers in Riyadh said in a statement.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-crisis-a-million-infected-in-just-100-hours/story-Z82r4KndaychnYAez26YrK.html
19-07-2020||World||UK to roll out free antibody kits||Britain is making plans to distribute millions of free coronavirus antibody tests after a version backed by the UK government successfully passed its first major trials, The Daily Telegraph reported on Friday.The finger-prick tests, which can tell within 20 minutes if a person has ever been exposed to the coronavirus, were found to be 98.6% accurate in secret human trials held in June, involving nearly 300 people and conducted by scientists at Ulster University, the newspaper reported.It added that the test was developed by the UK Rapid Test Consortium (UK-RTC), a partnership between Oxford University and leading UK diagnostics firms.Britain’s only antibody tests approved thus far have involved blood samples being sent to laboratories for analysis, which can take days, The Telegraph said.Anticipating a regulatory approval in the coming weeks, tens of thousands of prototypes have already been manufactured in factories across the United Kingdom, the report added.Ministers are hoping that the AbC-19 lateral flow test will be available for use in a mass screening programme before the end of the year, the newspaper reported.“It was found to be 98.6% accurate, and that’s very good news,” Chris Hand, the leader of the UK-RTC, was quoted as saying by The Telegraph.The tests are likely to be free and would be ordered online instead of being sold in supermarkets, according to plans cited by the newspaper.“While these tests will help us better understand how coronavirus is spreading across the country, we do not yet know whether antibodies indicate immunity from reinfection or transmission,” a Department of Health and Social Care spokesman was quoted as telling the newspaper.Britain has so far reported more than 295,000 Covid-19 cases and at least 45,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-roll-out-free-antibody-kits/story-tzQ4SgP92aDM9BKM8f8zWJ.html
19-07-2020||World||US 2018 cable triggered claims Covid-19 epidemic may have started in Wuhan lab||The United States has released an internal diplomatic cable that had triggered speculation by senior officials of the Trump administration that the Covid-19 epidemic might have started because of an accident at a virology lab in Wuhan, a Chinese city that became the epicenter of the outbreak last December.Officials of the US embassy China, who wrote this cable in January 2018 after a visit to the lab, had raised concerns in this state department cable about “serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory”.And, though the lab could conduct study SARS-like coronaviruses extracted from bats, it needed the permission of designated authority to research strains that could infect humans, officials wrote in the cable, whose release was secured by the Washington Post this week through a lawsuit.But the cable did not prove or disprove the lab origin theory of the outbreak. “I don’t see any evidence to support the idea that this was released deliberately or inadvertently,” Ian Lipkin, the director of Columbia University’s Center for Infection and Immunity, told the Washington Post after being being made aware of the content of the cable.“You can’t just say someone is guilty of accidentally releasing a virus. You have to prove it.”The Trump administration, however, appeared to have made that determination already in an effort to deflect blame for the spiraling infections and fatalities in the United States. President Donald Trump said in May he had a “high degree of confidence” that it had indeed started from the Chinese lab. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo followed up claiming “enormous evidence”.But, also in May, the US intelligence community punctured that theory. The office of the director of National Intelligence said in a statement it was still investigating outbreak started through contacts with infected animals “or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan”.The Trump administration has not pushed the lab theory much in recent days, but it has blamed China for the outbreak, broke off ties with the WHO accusing it of being complicit in China’s cover-up of it responsibility for the outbreak. Trump and Pompeo have called the virus the “Chinese virus” and the “Wuhan virus”.Covid-19 infections, meantime, are soaring in the United States, with nearly 78,000 new cases reported in the last 24 hours and 843 deaths. Texas, Florida, Arizona and other southern states are the worst hit in this second surge. ICUs are running to full capacity in some of their worst affected counties, and, in a repeated of the grim situation in New York some weeks ago, refrigerated trucks are being used to store bodies because of overwhelmed morgues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cable-about-wuhan-lab-released-nearly-78-000-new-covid-19-cases-reported/story-5XFRFKqNzhDy1XCOVZADDK.html
19-07-2020||India||First heavy rain of season leaves the Capital flooded||At least two people drowned in separate incidents as showers that lashed Delhi on Sunday morning triggered water-logging in several low-lying areas, stranded commuters and vehicles on flooded roads, and washed away several structures with storm water drains overflowing in the wake of the first spell of heavy rains in the national capital this monsoon. Delhi, which logged a rain deficit of 55% from June 1 till Saturday, witnessed heavy showers for three hours early in the morning. According to weather officials, south Delhi’s Safdarjung station recorded 74.8mm rainfall during the day, its highest for a single day in July in five years. Before this, the station recorded 93.8mm rainfall on July 11, 2015.Delhi Ridge and Lodhi Road also saw 86mm and 81.2mm rainfall, respectively, data from the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre showed.Rainfall between 64.5mm and 124.4mm is considered “heavy” rain by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).“Most of the heavy rain we received today was between 5.30am and 8.30am... moderate category rain is expected again on July 20 night or July 21 early morning,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.A 56-year-old man, Kundan Singh Mehra, drowned as he tried to navigate his tempo through eight feet-deep water on the Minto Road underpass near central Delhi’s Connaught Place, the police said.“He tried to manoeuvre his vehicle through the water, but couldn’t make it,” said Rajender Dubey, assistant commissioner of police (Barakhamba Road).Mehra sat on his submerged mini truck for several minutes before his death, according to a video clip that was authenticated by his family members who said passersby did not try to rescue him. Fire officials, who rescued three others stranded there, said they were unaware there was a fourth person.Mehra’s body was later spotted by a linesman working nearby.The area near Minto Road railway bridge, which has become emblematic of the annual water-logging issue in the Capital, went under water. Photos on social media showed a Delhi Transportation Corporation (DTC) submerged under the bridge.Dramatic videos also showed people wading through knee-deep waters, several structures collapsing due to gushing drain water in Anna Nagar near ITO in central Delhi, and traffic chaos on arterial roads hours after showers relented.“Since my childhood I have seen almost every year, photographs of DTC bus submerged in water under Minto bridge during monsoon. Why can’t engineers, town planners & civic agency officials fix it? Let only one agency, whose name should be prominently displayed there, own & fix it,” senior Delhi Police officer Muktesh Chander, who was the former chief of the traffic police, said on Twitter.In another incident, a 28-year-old labourer working at a scrap yard died after falling into three-feet-deep water in south-east Delhi’s Srinivaspuri, the police said.A boy, 8, is believed to have been swept away in river water in south-east Delhi’s Jaitpur, but the police said there was no clarity if this was a rain-related death.At least 20 trees were uprooted in Sunday morning showers and two buildings in east Delhi’s Lakshmi Nagar and Shanti Mohalla in Gandhi Nagar collapsed, fire department officials said.The police said one of the three domes of the 197-year-old Mubarak Begum mosque in Hauz Qazi in old Delhi was severely damaged in the rain. “No one was around the mosque when it happened. There have been no injuries due to the damage,” said a Delhi Police official.Even as authorities rushed to manage the chaos, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal responded to criticism by opposition parties, and said all government and civic agencies must work together in the Capital instead of indulging in blame-game at a time when the city is battling the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.“This year all agencies, which include the Delhi government and the municipal corporations, were completely invested in managing corona. They have faced a lot of difficulties due to Corona. This is no time to get into any blame game. All agencies must join hands in fulfilling their responsibilities. We will make all efforts to clear areas where waterlogging is reported at the earliest,” the chief minister wrote on Twitter.Citing images of the submerged bus at Minto Road, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Badarpur MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri questioned Kejriwal on his promise to make Delhi a world-class city. “In a short spell of rain, Delhi roads are flooded with water. Who is responsible for the death of the person [at Minto Bridge]?” Bidhuri tweeted.On criticism that the Delhi government failed to de-silt drains – a process that is normally undertaken by authorities before monsoon — Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) spokesperson and vice-chairperson of the Delhi Jal Board Raghav Chadha said the work was delayed due to Covid-19.The traffic police issued advisories for commuters after vehicles came to a standstill along key stretches such IP Estate Marg (central Delhi), Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg (central Delhi), Dhaula Kuan (south Delhi), Mayapuri Chowk (west Delhi), Panchkuian Road Gol Chakkar (central Delhi), and near Apollo Hospital (south-east Delhi), among others, due to water-logging and uprooted trees. Most jams cleared up by the evening.Experts have said although Delhi received heavy rainfall, the damage in the national capital was disproportionate to the amount of rain. “The topography of Delhi is such that we should never see flooding here... The reason we see such flooding even after a couple of hours of rain is because we are not allowing the water to find its own path. We have not taken care of the natural drainage...,” said Manoj Mishra, convenor of NGO Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-heavy-rain-of-season-leaves-the-capital-flooded/story-KV1qRLW9n477qyy1iyLtIN.html
19-07-2020||India||UGC set to issue norms for online degree courses||Universities having an accreditation rating of 3.26 and above will be eligible to begin online degree courses and those with a score of 3.01 and above will be able to do the same after getting requisite nods, as the University Grants Commission (UGC) gets closer to issuing regulations for giving a boost to internet-based education.“The UGC has finalised the regulations that have been sent by the HRD ministry to the Law ministry for vetting. Once the regulations are issued, the way for a large number of universities to start online degree courses would be paved,” a person familiar with the development said.Once the UGC guidelines are issued in the coming weeks, it would be easier for varsities to begin online degrees from the next academic session, which is likely to begin in November-December.The UGC, in an earlier meeting, had discussed the modalities for imparting online degrees.“The Commission has been of the view that universities with high accreditation be allowed to impart degree courses online. The ones in the highest category (with a rating of 3.26 and above) will have to only give intimation about the courses they want to start. Others, in the second rung, will be allowed after they take permission,” said the person cited above.Significantly, there is a view that to ensure quality, there may be an initial cap on the number of online degrees universities may offer. Universities are accredited by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), with those receiving a rating of 3.26 and above, out of four, awarded A++ and A+ status. Those with a rating of 3.01 to 3.25 are ranked A, as per the range of institutional cumulative grade point average.The human resources development (HRD) ministry has been focusing on online education, especially in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The ministry is also looking at the concept of setting up a virtual university, which has been recommended in the draft National Education Policy (NEP).Among other initiatives, the UGC is also developing its own app, for easier accessibility to students and educators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ugc-set-to-issue-norms-for-online-degree-courses/story-2Dd6gqGFrSaiswjm4AlW3O.html

19-07-2020||India||Parents’ views sought on resuming schools||New DelhiThe human resource development (HRD) ministry has written to the states to seek and furnish feedback from parents on when they would like schools to reopen– August, September or October - and what their expectations are for the resumption of lessons after the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) lockdown.Significantly, the ministry has written to states and Union territories at a time when the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has completed its examination process. The CBSE has also reduced its syllabi for the Covid-19-hit academic year.According to a letter sent on July 17 to the education secretaries of all states and union territories, the HRD ministry wants parental feedback on when they would be comfortable with schools reopening. August, September or October? What are parental expectations of schools as and when they reopen? HT has reviewed a copy of the letter.The ministry is also preparing detailed social distancing norms for schools to avoid transmission of the virus.There has been concern among parents as well as students about the safety of physical classes. The HRD ministry may provide broad contours for the proposed reopening, leaving it to the states to decide on the actual opening of schools depending on the Covid-19 situation. Education falls in the concurrent list of the Constitution, which means both states and the Centre jointly work in the area.Earlier, during a meeting with states, school education secretary Anita Karwal had given an outline of what school life can be like post-Covid-19.Waiving mandatory attendance for students, holding staggered classes, and providing breaks to different classes at different time were among the suggestions that officials of the human resource development ministry and state education departments had considered.Among the measures that the HRD ministry has considered are encouraging students who can log in to classes online to stay at home, doing away with morning assemblies, ensuring the transport facilities follow social distancing norms,not having a lunch recess for all classes at the same time, use of masks and sanitisers and avoiding sports or cultural activities .The ministry will also come up with detailed norms for residential schools. The HRD ministry has also released norms for online education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parents-views-sought-on-resuming-schools/story-LrTgSkrP66K5GwDuPF7QuN.html
19-07-2020||India||Assam floods: Relief camps battle to keep Covid at bay||GUWAHATI: Amid floods that have affected over 2.5 million people in 24 districts of Assam and claimed 84 lives, the state has to deal with the additional challenge of curbing the spread of coronavirus disease pandemic in 521 relief camps across the state. No Covid case has been reported from these relief camps yet, officials said. “In view of Covid-19, we had issued guidelines in May itself on management of flood relief camps. District administrations have followed those rules, but floods this year have been unrelenting, making it tougher for them,” said Pankaj Chakraborty, project coordinator of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA).Over 50,000 displaced people have taken shelter in the 521 relief camps in 24 of the 33 districts of the state.The local administrations are trying to implement a new set of rules, which require safety and social distancing among inmates of these camps. As per the guidelines, district officials have been told to identify additional relief camps according to the population density of villages to earmark space for social distancing. Unlike earlier when 3.5 sq m of space in relief camps was earmarked for each person, the figure was doubled to 7 sq m to ensure there’s one metre’s distance between two camp inmates.Golaghat district project officer Ronney Rajkumar, disaster management authority, said, “There are 22 relief camps in our district at present and 3,240 persons are staying there. We have provided face masks, sanitisers, soaps at the relief camps. Though we have had cases of inmates suffering from cough, cold etc, no one has been found Covid-19 positive yet.” “We have been staying at a relief camp since July 13. Local officials informed us about maintaining hygiene and social distancing and we are trying to follow as much as possible,” Ramen Doley, a farmer in Golaghat, who is staying at a relief camp at Mungilal lower primary school, in Golaghat district, along with 126 other inmates.About the arrangements made at relief camps in Barpeta, district project officer Nandita Dutta, said, “We have 52 relief camps at present and over 6500 persons are staying in them. Our personnel are ensuring all safety and social distancing protocols are followed. Health workers are visiting camps and conducting tests on those showing symptoms. No one has been found infected yet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-floods-relief-camps-battle-to-keep-covid-at-bay/story-GTFCFfxEldGWn7judZXQBL.html
19-07-2020||India||Central team tells Bihar to manage its hospitals better, increase capacity amid Covid-19 surge||A three-member Central team has asked the state to ensure better management of its hospitals and increase their capacity given the recent spike in Covid-19 cases in the state.Citing Bihar’s case doubling rate, which was around 12 days, the team cautioned the state to prepare itself to admit new cases in hospitals as they were rising alarmingly.Bihar with 26,379 cases, after 1,412 new infections were added on Sunday, could be looking at touching 50,000 cases in the next 12 days and 1 lakh in the next 24 days from now if the case doubling rate remained the same.The Central team asked the state government to brace up for this challenge by creating capacity in hospitals to accommodate a rising number of patients while also improving its patient pick-up system through ambulances.The Central team also stressed on increasing testing capacity in the state through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which was the confirmatory test for Covid-19. For this, it stressed on creating greater capacity for RT PCR. Bihar has the lowest testing rate in India.The Central team also visited the Patliputra indoor stadium where the MSF (Medecins Sans Frontiers or Doctors Without Borders) has supported a 100-bed Covid-19 treatment facility.It also visited a medical college hospital in Patna, besides the Rajeev Nagar locality to assess a containment zone, before leaving for Gaya late in the evening. The team would return to Delhi on Monday.As the Centre stressed on RT-PCR tests, the state government assured to provide on demand testing facility to all Covid-19 symptomatic patients.“Testing target is not relevant anymore as the government has decided to provide on demand testing facility to all Covid-19 symptomatic patients up to primary health centre (PHC) level,” said Anupam Kumar, secretary Information and Public Relations Department (IPRD), at a media briefing on Sunday.District hospitals had initiated the facility of rapid antigen Point of Care (POC) testing. “The facility will be extended at sub-divisional hospitals on Monday and to PHCs this week itself,” said Bihar health secretary, Lokesh Kumar Singh during the joint media briefing. Around 500 people were screened in Patna on the first day Saturday, after the government introduced the rapid antigen POC test in Patna through 25 testing centres and five mobile testing vans.Together with rapid antigen POC test, RT-PCR, TrueNat and CBNAAT-based testing, Bihar tested 10,276 samples on Saturday as against 10,502 on Friday. The state health department has stopped sharing break-up of tests.Two deaths were reported in the state, one each from Khagaria and Saran, as per the Covid-19 bulletin shared by the health department through its Twitter handle.Seven deaths were reported from the AIIMS-Patna and the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), the two designated Covid-19 hospitals in Patna.Singh said 836 people had recovered during the last 24 hours, taking the total recoveries to 16,597.

The development came after CM Rawat on Saturday indicated that so far a total of “110 army personnel have tested positive for Covid-19 in the state out of which about 100 cases have emerged in the past 3 to 4 days”.According to an official in the state secretariat privy to the development, “PM Modi spoke to CM Rawat in the afternoon in which he enquired about the health condition of the army personnel affected by Covid-19 virus.”“During the conversation he asked the CM to provide every possible help to the army personnel in terms of treatment with proper coordination between the state government and army,” said the official. He said the CM assured the Prime Minister of providing all possible help to the Covid-19 affected army personnel and said, “We are in constant touch with the army authorities and providing them with all the facilities required for treatment.”On Saturday, the CM had said, “Contact tracing of the infected army personnel is being done which will not be so difficult as their travel history is specified.”During the conversation with PM Modi, he informed him that in the past few days the number of cases in the state have increased but the “situation is under control”.JC Pandey, public relations officer for the Uttarakhand health department said that the health department is tracing the contacts of army personnel who have tested positive to ensure the virus doesn’t spread further among their families.Ten army personnel had tested positive on July 18, eight on July 1, one army staff tested positive on June 30 and two army personnel tested positive on June 13. In April, an army doctor had tested positive for Covid-19 from Chakrata area in Dehradun.Later on Sunday evening the CM informed about the measures being taken to curb the spread including increasing the number of tests and surveillance.“The surveillance has been increased with the help of ASHA and Aanganwadi workers by moving house to house to check if anyone has any symptoms of the virus,” he said. “In Uttar Kashi district surveillance has been done four times. In other districts including Nainital, Rudraprayag, Almora, Chamoli and Tehri Garhwal, it has been completed three times while in Bageshwar, Champawat, Pauri Garhwal and US Nagar it has been done twice. In the remaining three districts of Dehradun, Haridwar and Pithoragarh, it has been done once,” said Rawat. On increasing the number of tests in the state, he said, “This week 2,487 samples were collected every day for testing in comparison to 1,660 samples taken per day last week.

19-07-2020||India||Congress attacks govt on Rajnath’s remarks||New Delhi: The Congress launched another attack on the Narendra Modi government on Sunday, seeking an explanation on defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s remark that he couldn’t guarantee to what extent tensions along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh could be resolved, and hit back at foreign minister S Jaishankar. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In a tweet, Gandhi said: “BJP has institutionalised lies. 1. Covid19 by restricting testing and misreporting deaths. 2. GDP by using a new calculation method. 3. Chinese aggression by frightening the media. The illusion will break soon and India will pay the price.”The Congress cited Singh’s remarks during his Ladakh tour, where the defence minister said on Friday: “Talks are underway to resolve the border dispute but to what extent it can be resolved I cannot guarantee. I can assure you, not one inch of our land can be taken by any power in the world. If solution can be found by talks, there is nothing better.”Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, “Has Modi government accepted Chinese transgressions and also admitted that they have no solution to push the Chinese back into their own territory behind the LAC between India and China?”While Surjewala emphasized that “national security or territorial integrity of India” can never be compromised, Anand Sharma, senior Congress leader and member of the Rajya Sabha, tweeted that he was “amused” by Jaishankar’s defence of a “directionless foreign policy”. Sharma targeted Jaishankar after the latter’s point-by-point rebuttal of Rahul Gandhi’s video interview on how Modi’s policies had weakened India. “Neighbourhood first has been a priority of India’s foreign policy but sadly derailed by a cavalier approach,” Sharma said, pointing out that: “India & Nepal have historically shared a relationship bases on trust, friendship, and mutual respect. The present drift and tension are a matter of national concern. Foreign minister cannot have the luxury of denial but should answer for the failures.”After Jaishankar compared Balakot and Uri-- instances of cross-border action military against terrorists—to the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks – to show how the latter had gone unpunished, Sharma tweeted, “Dr Jaishankar’s reference to Mumbai terror attack was oddly out of place. As India’s Ambassador and senior diplomat, he was articulating India’s position which, for political expediency, he has chosen to criticize and disown. ““Do I have to remind that Indian Army, Airforce and Navy existed before May 2014 and their heroics and valour respected globally. Army belongs to the nation and fights under the tricolour. Advising in national interest. Do not politicise or monopolise our defence forces,” tweeted Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-attacks-govt-on-rajnath-s-remarks/story-XR59DqyCxuc2v9jFcygqZL.html
19-07-2020||India||On Ladakh visit, Rajnath met soldiers who fought off PLA||NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh met soldiers from the 16th battalion of the Bihar regiment who fought off numerically superior Chinese troops in the remote Galwan Valley on June 15, and acknowledged their bravery in the presence of the military’s top brass, people familiar with the development said on Sunday. Singh returned to Delhi on Saturday after a two-day tour of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir that included visits to forward locations and also saw him interact with soldiers deployed there.A new video from Lukung on the western bank on Ladakh’s Pangong Tso, which has been at the centre of the current border tensions with China, showed the minister having tea with soldiers from 16 Bihar. In the clip, the minister is seen mingling with the soldiers who were introduced to him by 14 Corps commander Lieutenant General Harinder Singh who can be heard telling the minister that the commanding officer killed in the skirmish was from their unit.The infantry battalion’s 37-year-old commanding officer, Colonel B Santosh Babu, was among the 20 Indian soldiers killed in the seven-hour deadly conflict near Patrolling Point 14 in Galwan Valley, where outnumbered Indian troops inflicted heavy casualties on the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA).Beijing has not disclosed the number of fatalities it suffered but according to India’s assessment the PLA suffered twice as many casualties.Apart from 16 Bihar, soldiers from 3 Punjab, 3 Medium Regiment and 81 Field Regiment were involved in the first deadly conflict between Indian and Chinese troops along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in more than five decades. Recalling the Galwan Valley skirmish in his speech, Singh said on Friday that while he was delighted to meet the soldiers at Lukung, he was deeply pained by the loss of 20 Indian soldiers in the clash. Paying tributes to the brave-hearts, he said they not only protected India’s border but also the honour of 1.3 billion Indians and their sacrifice would not go in vain.The first wave of fighting in Galwan Valley erupted around 6 pm on June 15 after Colonel Babu led a squad of 30 soldiers to a location near PP-14 to verify if the PLA had removed some structures erected in the area despite an understanding reached on June 6 by top Indian and Chinese military commanders on a disengagement plan to reduce rising border tensions.The Indian soldiers confronted the Chinese troops, who refused to remove their installations and vacate the area, triggering a violent clash that involved more than 600 rival soldiers at its peak.In Ladakh, Singh said that the progress in negotiations with China should help resolve the ongoing border dispute but he “couldn’t guarantee to what extent the situation will be resolved”, underlining that progress in resolving the tensions along the LAC between the two nuclear powers has been a challenging and arduous process.Singh also said that no power could “touch or grab even an inch of Indian territory”. Lukung is 43 km from Finger 4 on the northern bank of Pangong lake.India last week said the complex disengagement process with China on the LAC is specifically aimed at preventing “face-off situations”, and any unilateral attempts to change the status quo on the disputed border won’t be accepted. Two days after senior military commanders from both sides met at Chushul, the Indian Army on July 16 said complete disengagement is an “intricate process” requiring “constant verification”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-ladakh-visit-rajnath-met-soldiers-who-fought-off-pla/story-JUs6yWeCUg5q55hCB4SwNI.html
19-07-2020||India||India likely to deploy Rafale jets in Ladakh||NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force could deploy its new Rafale fighter jets in the Ladakh sector as part of an overarching plan to strengthen India’s military posture in the region, where Indian and Chinese forces are locked in a tense border confrontation, and disengagement has turned out to be a challenging process, people familiar with the development said on Sunday, ahead of a key IAF commanders’ meeting this week.Acting on a special request by the IAF, France is speeding up the deliveries of Rafale fighters to India and six jets are likely to land at their home base in Ambala on July 27 --- instead of four that were originally planned to be delivered in the first batch.“Air and ground crews have undergone full training on the aircraft including advanced weapons systems over the last one year in France,” one of the officials cited above said on condition of anonymity.The IAF is looking at means to operationalise the Rafale in the quickest possible time and the new fighters could be deployed wherever there is a requirement, including Ladakh, he said.The possible role of Rafale fighters could be discussed at the IAF commanders’ conference in New Delhi from July 22 to 24 where the air force brass is expected to focus on the ongoing border row with China, the IAF’s preparedness and new purchases that have to be made to stay prepared for any eventuality, said a second official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.India-specific enhancements on the jets include cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases.India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016 as an emergency purchase to arrest a worrying slide in the air force’s combat capabilities.The arrival of the Rafale will add punch to the IAF’s capability, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.“For sure, there will be a period of integration with other systems, and it (Rafale) would be put to use as the operational planners deem fit,” Bahadur said.According to the original delivery schedule, the first 18 jets (including the four in the first batch) were to be delivered to the IAF by February 2021, with the rest expected in April-May 2022. Future deliveries will also be accelerated.France handed over to India its first Rafale fighter during a ceremony attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh and his French counterpart, Florence Parly, in Merignac on October 8 last year.In the Ladakh sector, the IAF is projecting its capability to carry out day-and-night, all-weather combat missions, with front-line fighter jets, attack helicopters and multi-mission choppers getting airborne regularly for demanding night-time missions from a forward base in the area.The air force’s MiG-29 fighter jets, Sukhoi-30s, Apache AH-64E attack helicopters and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission helicopters are among the platforms that are undertaking night missions in the mountainous terrain.The Indian Rafales will be equipped with Meteor beyond-visual-range missiles whose no-escape zone is touted to be three times greater than that of current medium range air-to-air missiles....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-likely-to-deploy-rafale-jets-in-ladakh/story-NM1NqjmB2vVdMZxUJZoZPJ.html

19-07-2020||India||Bengal CM’s nephew asks youth to reach out to Covid-19, Amphan victims, draws flak||‘Banglar Jubo Shakti’ (Bengal’s youth power), an ‘apolitical’ platform announced in June by Abhishek Banerjee, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and Trinamool Youth Congress president, has drawn criticism from opposition parties within 24 hours of the young leader’s announcement that more than five lakh young men have registered as members and they will help people in distress.Addressing the members on social media on Saturday, Banerjee, a Lok Sabha member, said they can owe their allegiance to any political party but their sole job would be to serve Bengal. “Take an oath to help people affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and Cyclone Amphan in every possible way,” said Banerjee, citing the life and works of Swami Vivekananda, Subhash Chandra Bose and other prominent Bengalis. Though Banerjee said that it did not matter if the members belonged to the CPI(M), Congress or the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) he reiterated several times that they would have to save the state from “oshubho shakti” (evil force). “Bengal must win. We have to fight till the last drop of our blood. You have to prove that your first allegiance is to this land,” he said, not mentioning the BJP as a political rival or the 2021 assembly elections even once. The platform, TMC leaders said, is the brainchild of political strategist Prashant Kishor, who was roped in by Mamata Banerjee after the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. The poll results indicated that a sizeable chunk of young voters supported the BJP. For the ruling party, this is a cause for concern before the crucial assembly polls where alleged nepotism in distribution of cyclone relief funds and mismanagement in health sector can be raging issues. “Each ‘jubo joddha’ (youth warrior) will have to select 10 families of his or her choice and help them for the next few months. Once you select the families you cannot alter your choice. We will help you in every possible way. We will launch a forum where each member can discuss their problems using their ID and password. I too will look after 10 families,” said Banerjee.He also made it clear that people can join the TMC through the platform.“Those who want to join politics will be given the opportunity. If they show the right potential they can work at any level. I am willing to leave my post for one of them,” said Banerjee.He said members of the platform will have to convince the families why they want to help them and stay connected with them through WhatsApp groups. “Five lakh members can connect to 50 lakh families. There will be more members and thus, more families. I will personally monitor this,” said Banerjee.The BJP leadership has mocked Banerjee for launching the programme.“Where was he in the last four months? Suddenly he has made a comeback with five lakh new youth workers and five lakh old workers decamped with money sent for cyclone relief. This platform is a copy of what the BJP has already done. We have taken food and medicines to people all these months,” said BJP state president Dilip Ghosh. Panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee, who led the state Youth Congress decades before the birth of the TMC, defended Banerjee.“If Dilip Ghosh is criticizing it, it means this is the path to follow. As a young leader Abhishek has said the right things. He has given a call, asking everybody to join the movement,” said Mukherjee.Political analysts, however, feel that an operation of this scale can succeed only if its face is Mamata Banerjee.“This is basically an exercise to overhaul the machinery of the TMC. It is not easy to execute an operation of this scale. It can succeed only if the TMC chief leads it herself,” said political observer and columnist Suvashis Maitra.“Jubo Shakti is the name of the 54-year-old mouthpiece of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (youth front of the CPI-M). Abhishek Banerjee has even stolen the name. We have served a legal notice. It seems there is no end to looting by the TMC,” said Sayandip Mitra, state secretary of DYFI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-cm-s-nephew-asks-youth-to-reach-out-to-covid-19-amphan-victims-draws-flak/story-NoVC4XQQ18BhG1epQyaSuN.html

But police said the post mortem revealed that she died of poisoning.The girl had appeared for the class 10 state board examination this year.Local people torched three government buses and two police vehicles and vandalised a number of other vehicles. Shouting “we want justice,” the mob also attacked policemen while Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders took up the issue alleging that the girl belonged to a family of BJP supporters and thus became a target of goons backed by the ruling Trinamool Congress party. At least 30 people, including some police personnel, were injured in the pitched battles. Tension was palpable in the area till late evening. Watch: Police fire teargas to control violent protests in West Bengal The area where the alleged rape and murder took place comes under the Chaturagaj-Sonapur gram panchayat area of the Darjeeling Lok Sabha constituency. She was found by the roadside early in the morning, around 700 metres away from her home, and taken to Chopra hospital and subsequently to Islampur sub-divisional hospital where doctors pronounced her dead.The family of the victim claimed that a mobile phone and a cycle of the suspected murderer were recovered from the spot but a police officer who requested anonymity said “A bottle of poison was also found.”Local people and BJP supporters blocked the Chopra state highway for hours. In the afternoon, they blockaded NH-31. When police tried to remove the roadblocks, the protesters hurled stones. Several clashes ensued and police had to use baton-charge tear gas shells to bring the situation under control.Kartik Chandra Mondal, additional superintendent of police, Islampur said, “The body has been sent for post mortem examination.”The elder brother of the girl alleged that his sister was raped and murdered because his family supports the BJP. He claimed that he is a local BJP leader and blamed the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) for the incident.Surajit Sen, vice president of the BJP Uttar Dinajpur district committee said “TMC-backed miscreants committed the heinous crime.” Gautam Deb, state tourism minister condemned the murder and blamed the BJP for resorting to dirty politics over her death.Deb said “Two state ministers and a member of Parliament will visit the girl’s house. We are with the family.” Darjeeling’s BJP MP Raju Bista said, “Local people informed me that she was raped and poisoned. In the past few years, Chopra has seen exponential rise in illegal infiltration and crime. This was once a peaceful region.”The West Bengal Police on Sunday night said in a series of tweets that preliminary report of the post mortem examination pointed at death caused by poisoning and did not show any sign of rape. The tweets also said that the girl’s family did not lodge any complaint and police acted on its own. “Today morning Islampur PD received a reliable information about the death of a young girl of Chopra PS area. Family members or any other associated persons didn’t inform Police. Police contacted the family and sent the body for Post Mortem,” said one of the tweets. “Inquest by a magistrate and videography of the Post Mortem was done. As per the PM report cause of death is “effect of poison”. No injury marks anywhere in the body has been found. There is no sign of sexual or physical assault. Though law and order problem has been created over the issue, yet no complaint has been lodged with police,” the police said in another tweet.The incident in Chopra happened six days after Debendranath Roy, a BJP legislator from Hemtabad in North Dinajpour was found hanging around two km away from his home. The BJP has demanded a CBI inquiry, calling it a political murder. Chandima Roy, the legislator’s wife has moved the Calcutta high court demanding CBI enquiry.

19-07-2020||India||Feel motivated after shooting in Varanasi: Chandan Roy Sanyal||After wrapping up his 15-day shoot for the film ‘Woh Teen Din’, actor Chandan Roy Sanyal left Varanasi on Saturday. Now in mandatory 15-day quarantine in his home in Mumbai, the actor feels positive and motivated.Talking about taking up an outstation assignment during the ongoing crisis, Chandan said, “If we don’t step out and take up work then the film industry or any other industry for that matter will die down! Once we step out, then only we will be able to learn how to tackle the problem. It’s not just about a fit body it’s more about our mental health,” said the ‘Jab Harry Met Sejal’ actor over the phone.Supporting his decision to join the shooting, he said, “Post shoot, I’m feeling happy, healthier and content. Now I feel it was a right decision to take. Also in such times we need to work to keep our finances going as we all have EMIs, medical expenses and other responsibilities to take care of. So, I need to earn to be able to meet my expenses.”Chandan was initially skeptical while taking up the offer. “When director Raj Ashoo informed me that Sanjay (Mishra) ji will be joining the shoot it was then I decided to take a chance. But then again when heading for airport, I was all hesitant and doubtful. But once I reached Varanasi and completed the project I felt so motivated and relaxed.”The entire shoot was done in Chunar, one hour drive from Varanasi, with a small crew of 20 people. “Since the story is of a rickshaw puller and two passengers (him and Rajesh Sharma) we shot entirely on roads, highways, bank of Ganga and its basin. This project was a unique and lifetime experience for me. It was tough as we were shooting in hot, sultry and rainy conditions. Also, to keep shooting enthusiasts and selfie lovers at bay was a task for the team.”Initially, he was staying at a hotel but later, that got closed as it was facing a financial crunch. “From the hotel we shifted with Sanjayji who was staying in an ashram. On sets my assistant used to cook for us. We used to eat rice, dal and ghee. Sanjayji’s assistant too prepared simple meals for us.” In UP, Chandan had shot for ‘Mirza Juliet’ in Varanasi, ‘Jabariya Jodi’ in Lucknow and an upcoming series ‘Ashram’ in Ayodhya.After getting an opportunity to be on sets and act after months in lockdown, Chandan said, “After being stamped on airport I’m quarantined here. But I am relaxed that after all said and done the film is completed. Though back of my mind I’m a bit concerned of contracting the virus somewhere along the phase, so I am hoping for the best and keeping positive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/feel-motivated-after-shooting-in-varanasi-chandan-roy-sanyal/story-v8q9LmO3LXsdgy1tXw2SfL.html
19-07-2020||India||From dancer to actor, Ayush sketches his own path!||Actor Ayush Mehra, popular for his numerous stints on the web, feels no career option comes easy. “It’s a fact that whatever career you opt for, at the end of the day, hard work is indispensable and so is the right training to be able to survive and make a mark,” he said.Born and brought up in Mumbai, Ayush had a strong inclination towards performing arts. “For me dance, plays and films were my solace. So, to continue in the same field, I joined Shaimak Davar’s troupe and started doing what I loved the most. But soon, while dancing behind big actors and watching them closely, I realised that this is what I want to be. As a dancer we used to rehearse for 15-20 days but the actor used to join in for just three-four days and still got the centre stage. That’s when I understood that if I have penchant for performing arts than being an actor will be the right choice.” He started auditioning and did some commercials. “I did theatre for a year. Besides, I was doing acting training and attending workshops. I never stopped learning and I still go for workshops and stay connected to the process of learning.”The young actor also took up job of assistant director and last one being ‘Uri’, “Being AD brought me close to the process of film making. By that time, I had no idea web will blow up and become such a flourishing industry. I started doing sketches (small videos) for YouTube channel Filtercopy. My sketches become hit among the audience and gave me much required confidence and happiness. Soon, work from other web channels starting pouring in.” His big break came with the show ‘Mom & Co.’ “Veteran actor Neelima Azeem played the role of my mother. It was a story of a single mother and his son and a well-received series. Then came series ‘Minus One,’ ‘Operation MBBS,’ and ‘Please Find Attached’. Post lockdown I’ll be shooting second season for almost all of them. A lot of work went on hold due to ongoing crisis,” said the young actor who had a webinar in Lucknow recently. During his session with youngsters Ayush stressed on dreaming big and then working as hard. “To dream big is the first step that one takes when you plan your life ahead. Always remember, the bigger the dream more is the hard work it will ask for,” he concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/from-dancer-to-actor-ayush-sketches-his-own-path/story-NXUJObV6nrtseKlM2IOLjP.html

Assam is facing the twin challenge of combating floods and the coronavirus pandemic. Out of 33 districts, 25 remained affected after the current wave of flooding, beginning a fortnight ago.India is grappling with the novel coronavirus, which has infected nearly 1.1 million people and 26,816 have died from the Covid-19 disease, government data showed on Sunday. In neighbouring Nepal, the government asked residents along its southern plains on Sunday to remain alert as heavy monsoon rains were expected to pound the Himalayan nation where more than 100 have died in floods and landslides since June, officials said.Some 110 people were killed and another 100 injured as landslides and flash floods washed or swept away homes, upended roads and bridges and displaced hundreds of others in 26 of the country’s 77 districts, police said.Home ministry official Murari Wasti said the death toll was expected to rise as 48 people were still missing.“Search and rescue teams are looking for those who are missing in different places but chances of finding them alive are slim,” Wasti told Reuters.Barun Paudel of the weather forecasting office in the capital, Kathmandu, said heavy rains were expected to pound much of the mainly mountainous nation in the next four days. “We have urged residents to remain alert against possible landslides and floods,” he said.Landslides and flash floods are common in Nepal, India’s Assam and Bihar states during the June-September annual rainy season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/floods-in-india-nepal-displace-nearly-4-million-people-at-least-189-dead/story-x9UW1O1QE8n3C58sMs3jNO.html

The commanders are also expected to specifically deliberate on deployment of first batch of around six Rafale fighter jets which are expected to join the IAF’s fighter fleet later this month, they said. The main focus of the commanders’ conference will be to deliberate on the overall situation in eastern Ladakh and on ways to enhance the IAF’s combat prowess and surveillance over the country’s air space in all sensitive sectors including in Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Uttarakhand, the sources said. “The commanders will also review the evolving security architecture in the region and ways to boost IAF’s combat capability,” said a source. The conference will be chaired by Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh is also expected to address the IAF commanders. The IAF has been carrying out night time combat air patrols over the eastern Ladakh region in the last few weeks, in an apparent message to China that it was ready to deal with any eventualities in the mountainous region. A number of IAF platforms participated in a military drill in Stakna in eastern Ladakh on Friday during the defence minister’s visit to the region. The exercise showcased integrated combat prowess of the Army and the Indian Air Force in dealing with complex security scenarios in the high altitude terrain. The IAF has deployed almost all its frontline fighter jets like Sukhoi 30 MKI, Jaguar and Mirage 2000 aircraft in key frontier air bases in eastern Ladakh and elsewhere along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China notwithstanding disengagement of troops by Chinese military from a number of friction points. The IAF has also deployed Apache attack choppers as well as Chinook heavy-lift helicopters to transport troops to various forward locations. The IAF has pressed into service a fleet of C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft as well as C-130J Super Hercules in transporting heavy military equipment and weaponry to several forward bases in the region. The sources said the commanders will also deliberate on preparations to received the first batch of the Rafale jets from France. The jets are expected to reach India by end of this month. The first squadron of the aircraft will be stationed at Ambala air force station, considered one of the most strategically located bases of the IAF. The aircraft is capable of carrying a range of potent weapons. European missile maker MBDA’s Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile and Scalp cruise missile will be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jets. The disengagement process between Indian and Chinese militaries began on July 6 after a telephonic conversation between National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi the previous day. Doval and Wang are Special Representatives for the boundary talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-commanders-to-review-air-defence-system-in-view-of-border-row-with-china-at-3-day-meet/story-xfpa6oDd2gUIjJtmkMXSOO.html

In a letter to the Mumbai-based company, Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) Dr V G Somani stated that his office received a representation from an MP that the total cost of the treatment with FabiFlu  (favipiravir) will be around Rs 12,500 and that the “cost proposed by Glenmark is definitely not in the interest of the poor, lower middle class and middle-class people of India.” “Further it has been mentioned in the representation that Glenmark has also claimed that this drug is effective in co-morbid conditions like hypertension, diabetics, whereas in reality, as per protocol summary, this trial was not designed to assess the FabiFlu in comorbid condition,” the letter dated July 17 read. No clinically sufficient data specific to these conditions are available, the DCGI said in its letter. The ‘subject’ of the letter was stated as: “Regarding the false claims and pricing of tab FabiFlu 200 mg (favipiravir) by Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited, India”. “In view of this, you are requested to provide your clarification on the above points for taking further necessary action in the matter,” he said.  There was no immediate comment from the company.   Glenmark Pharmaceuticals had on July 13 said it has cut the price of its antiviral drug Favipiravir, under the brand name FabiFlu, for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate Covid-19 by 27 per cent to Rs 75 per tablet.  The company had launched FabiFlu last month at a price of Rs 103 per tablet. The letter sent to the firm by the DCGI encloses the representation made by the MP which refers to an online press conference by Glenmark Pharmaceuticals and media reports that the cost of FabiFlu per tablet is Rs 103.   “As per the claim by Glenmark, a patient has to take the tablet for 14 days, which means one patient will have to take approximately 122 tablets (18 tablets on Day 1 and 8 tablets per day from day 2 to day 14.)  Total cost of the treatment will be around Rs 12,500,” the representation read. As per statement by the Glenmark and media reports, the DCGI had accelerated the process for clinical trials and reviews considering the pandemic situation, unmet medical conditions and unavailability of specific therapeutic management against Covid-19 for this drug, it said. However, after all positive approach, accelerated processes and efforts by DCGI, health ministry and relevant state FDA departments, the cost proposed by Glenmark is definitely not in the interest of the poor, lower middle class and middle-class people of India, the representation noted. “In such a global pandemic where world is struggling against Covid-19, government of India should ensure affordability of the drug to the common people. In fact, 6/12 centres wherein these clinical trials were conducted are government medical colleges from Maharashtra, Gujrat and Delhi.“This indicates that poor and middle class patients have contributed to the clinical trial as subjects. “Price quoted for this drug is definitely unaffordable to the common people,” it stated.  The drug regulator had on June 19 approved anti-viral drug favipiravir for “restricted emergency use” in mild to moderate cases of Covid-19 in view of the emergency and unmet medical need during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dcgi-queries-pharma-company-on-its-claim-of-fabiflu-use-for-covid-19-patients-with-comorbidities/story-BrJrlXLyDnazSy3YW4uCdL.html

In the photograph, he was seen allegedly being felicitated by Bulandshahr BJP president Anil Sisodia at an event on July 14.The sacking came after his appointment left the BJP red-faced. Agarwal and five others are accused in the Bulandshahr violence case of 2018, in which inspector Subodh Kumar Singh was attacked by an armed mob. The officer had gone to the area to restore calm after violence had erupted over cow slaughter rumours. The accused is currently out on bail.“I came to know from the media that Shikhar was an accused in the violence in which inspector Subodh was killed. The matter was discussed with the organisation’s senior officials and Shikhar was expelled. Now, he has no association with the organisation,” said Priyatam Kumar Prem, district president, PM Jankalyankari Yojna Jagrukta Abhiyan (PMJYJA), Bulandshahr. Prem also claimed that BJP’s Bulandshahar district unit president Anil Sisodia was present in the function as chief guest and the PMJYJA has no link with the BJP.Other BJP leaders also distanced themselves from Agarwal after widespread criticism.BJP’s Bulandshahar district unit general secretary Sanjay Gurjar came forward to defend his president Anil Sisodiya and claimed that PMJYJA was an NGO and it had no association with the BJP and Sisodiya attended the function as chief guest.But the names of members of the advisory panel of PMJYJA belie the claims of BJP leaders.It includes names of senior party leaders and ministers like Shyam Jaju, Ramesh Pokhariyal Nishank, Narendra Tomar, Giriraj Singh, Dharmendra Pradhan and many more.Congress leader and member of party’s strategic and planning committee Imran Masood said, “Appointing a violence accused on an important post was an attempt to glorify him, which can’t be accepted”. He further said that the entire state had been facing anarchy in the rule of BJP.Shikhar Agarwal was associated with the youth wing of the BJP in Syana town of district Bulandshahar and was named one of the accused in Bulandshahr violence along with Yogesh Raj of Bajrang Dal and other leaders of Hindu organisations.A senior BJP leader, on the condition of anonymity, said “I was surprised when I came to know about his appointment. He was sacked from the party after his name figured among the accused in Bulandshahr violence”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-accused-in-bulandshahr-violence-sacked-from-pm-welfare-scheme-body/story-t4fpPktQi1xgtHy52oKj3H.html

Singh returned to Delhi on Saturday after a two-day tour of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir that covered visits to forward locations and also saw him interact with soldiers deployed there.A new video from Lukung on the western bank on Ladakh’s Pangong Tso, which has been at the centre of the current border tensions with China, showed the minister having tea with soldiers from 16 Bihar. In the clip, the minister is seen mingling with the soldiers who were introduced to him by 14 Corps commander Lieutenant General Harinder Singh who can be heard telling the minister that the commanding officer killed in the skirmish was from their unit.  Raksha Mantri Shri @rajnathsingh met the soldiers from Bihar Regiment at Lukung during his visit to forward areas in Ladakh. He had a brief interaction with them. pic.twitter.com/81YS0T960aThe infantry battalion’s 37-year-old commanding officer, Colonel B Santosh Babu, was among the 20 Indian soldiers killed in the seven-hour deadly conflict near Patrolling Point 14 in Galwan Valley, where outnumbered Indian troops inflicted heavy casualties on the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA).Beijing has not disclosed the number of fatalities it suffered but according to India’s assessment the PLA suffered twice as many casualties.Apart from 16 Bihar, soldiers from 3 Punjab, 3 Medium Regiment and 81 Field Regiment were involved in the first deadly conflict between Indian and Chinese troops along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in more than five decades.Also read: Navy’s forward posture against PLA aggression in Ladakh muscles out Chinese threat on high seasRecalling the Galwan Valley skirmish in his speech, Singh said on Friday while he was delighted to meet the soldiers at Lukung, he was deeply pained by the loss of 20 Indian soldiers in the clash. Paying tributes to the brave-hearts, he said they not only protected India’s border but also the honour of 130 crore Indians and their sacrifice would not go in vain.The first wave of fighting in Galwan Valley erupted around 6 pm on June 15 after Colonel Babu led a squad of 30 soldiers to a location near PP-14 to verify if the PLA had removed some structures erected in the area despite an understanding reached on June 6 by top Indian and Chinese military commanders on a disengagement plan to reduce rising border tensions.The Indian soldiers confronted the Chinese troops, who refused to remove their installations and vacate the area, triggering a violent clash that involved more than 600 rival soldiers at its peak.In Ladakh, Singh said that the progress in negotiations with China should help resolve the ongoing border dispute but he “couldn’t guarantee to what extent the situation will be resolved”, underlining that progress in resolving the tensions along the LAC between the two nuclear powers has been a challenging and arduous process.Also read: Eye on China, Modi-Abe Summit could be held in October; Philippines nextSingh also said that no power could “touch or grab even an inch of Indian territory”. Lukung is 43 km from Finger 4 on the northern bank of Pangong lake.India last week said the complex disengagement process with China on the LAC is specifically aimed at preventing “face-off situations”, and any unilateral attempts to change the status quo on the disputed border won’t be accepted. Two days after senior military commanders from both sides met at Chushul, the Indian Army on July 16 said complete disengagement is an “intricate process” requiring “constant verification”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/galwan-braves-get-a-pat-on-the-back-from-rajnath-singh-in-ladakh-s-lukung/story-aJZvEXH60604K37nfhutqK.html

19-07-2020||India||Foreigners holed up in Goa are lending a hand in cleaning beaches, sowing seeds||It’s peak monsoon with Goa witnessing rainfall in excess of 100mm a day on average. The shacks and sea facing hotels have battened down the hatches as the wind howls across. At first, nothing may seem amiss – after all, beach tourism shuttering for the monsoon is an annual affair. But no sooner does the rain abate and people begin to move out a bit, does the odd foreigner stand out in the crowd. Not unusual in coastal villages of Goa, but certainly uncommon during the peak monsoon months when backpackers from Europe and other parts of the world head back home for the summer or to other destinations. The pandemic has meant that there were never so many foreigners in Goa in the monsoons as there are this year, with those who have remained behind -- by choice or by fate -- choosing to make the most of their time here. Pavel Boloyangov, a visitor from Russia, decided to roll up his sleeves and begin collecting garbage at Arambol, a beach village in North Goa that is a popular haunt for foreigners. “I had arrived in India along with my companion to see majestic temples and holy places, when the pandemic hit. I saw a group of guys gathering plastic in bags and bringing them to a designated area. I started doing the same. Fifteen more people joined. More people from around the world came to the next event. There were many Indians who wanted to join it. More people came to the third event. We cleaned Arambol on a regular basis. This time, I collected a list of 40-50 volunteers from 15 countries,” Boloyangov, who is a professional fighter and stunt performer, said.For Coronavirus Live Updates Boloyangov, who is a fitness trainer back in Russia, had first visited Goa in 2017, when he claims to have first noticed unattended piles of garbage in different corners of the tourist paradise. This year offered him the opportunity to do something about it. “A colleague reported our initiative to Dhiraj Vagale, assistant director of tourism, Goa. The Government responded immediately. Sanjeev Joglekar (an official with the environment department) got in touch with me and offered me help. He sent an officer-in-charge who arranged garbage removal. Besides, he instructed an officer whose company is responsible for cleanliness of the Arambol beach to help us clean Sweet Lake. The Panchayat has provided us with special bags and gloves. Approximately 50 volunteers from many countries including India cleaned Sweet Lake. It took exactly 10 days of hard work,” Boloyangov said. The HT Guide to Coronavirus For Nick Chung, an English teacher from Atlanta, Georgia in the USA, a trip to India from China was meant to be only a week long holiday with his girlfriend and colleagues, during the Chinese New Year Holidays. It’s now August and he is pretty sure about not returning to get his teaching job in China back. “It’s actually a great place to be stuck. The weather is perfect and the people are nice,” Chung said. Chung and his friends with the help of local volunteers spent a day in the fields of Taleigao, a village on the outskirts of the state capital Panaji, assisting local farmers with sowing, transplanting and tending to the rice crop. “It was a great experience to understand the trouble it takes to grow your own food and it also helps you come closer to the earth and mother nature,” Chung told HT. There have been a few repatriation flights -- 44 in total that have left from Goa airport carrying around 10,000 tourists to destinations in their home countries. However, many have chosen to stay put out of choice, some have stayed due to the prohibitive cost or unavailability of a repatriation flight to their countries. Locals, too, are happy to host them as they continue to contribute to the tourism industry. “Many home and hotel owners have halved their room rates so that the tourists choose to stay on and are also making sure they are well cared for,” Stephen Fernandes a resident of Arambol village said. “There were many more in June, by July some of them moved out,” he added. Many tourists will leave over the coming weeks as flights are arranged either from Goa or Mumbai. “We came for 3 months as we usually do. We were only here three weeks, when we had the lockdown. Everyone has been so helpful. We went for walks before the rains got really bad to sit and watch the fishermen catching their meals,” said Lorraine Dodd who’s from the UK and is hoping her flight back to the UK scheduled for early August goes through.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foreigners-holed-up-in-goa-are-lending-a-hand-in-cleaning-city-sowing-seeds/story-nqjpT1x2wz44tf4VomWmmN.html

19-07-2020||India||Don’t endorse bills for three capital cities, Chandrababu Naidu tells AP Governor||As the YSR Congress party government’s move to create three capital cities for Andhra Pradesh reached its penultimate stage with the administration sending two crucial bills to Governor Biswabhushan Harichandan for his assent, the opposition parties in the state stepped up their efforts to stall the process.Telugu Desam Party president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Sunday wrote a six-page letter to the Governor, requesting him not to accept the bills in the best interest of the state, keeping in view the aspirations of the people.The two bills – the first one, abolishing AP Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA) which was formed in 2014 to develop Amaravati as the capital city and the second one, to form three capital cities for decentralised administration, were sent to the Raj Bhavan on Saturday.The Jagan government brought in these bills to create executive capital at Visakhapatnam and judicial capital at Kurnool, while retaining the present capital city of Amaravati as the legislative capital.The Governor sought some time to study the bills before giving his consent. “In all probability, the bills might get the Governor’s nod by Monday,” an official in the chief minister’s office familiar with the development said.Once the Governor gives his assent to the two bills, they would be sent to the Centre for Presidential assent, since three capitals have to be notified by the Centre, the official said.Strongly resisting the bills, Naidu wondered how the bills could be sent to the Governor as the state legislative council had referred them to the select committee. “While the government stalled the formation of a select committee, it reintroduced the bills in the legislative assembly and got them passed. When the bills were unlawfully brought before the upper house for a second time, the council did not consider the same,” he pointed out to the Governor.He pointed out that the issue of the shifting of administrative capital from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam was pending before the state high court. “Approval of the two bills at this juncture would amount to contempt of the court,” he said.The TDP chief said the two bills were in violation of Section 6 of AP Reorganisation Act 2014 under which Amaravati was finalised as the capital city through an experts committee. He pointed out that the Act had suggested only one capital for AP.Naidu alleged that YSRC government was bent upon destroying Amaravati in the name of decentralisation only out of political vendetta. “Amaravati had been a long-standing cultural centre and centrally located place for the capital. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who laid the foundation for the capital, had said Amaravati would be developed as a more beautiful city than Delhi,” he said.He further said the Centre had recognised Amaravati as a ‘smart city’ and allocated Rs 700 crore, besides providing Rs 2,500 crore for developing secretariat, assembly, council, high court and other basic facilities. “It has attracted national and international partnerships with prestigious groups like the Singapore Consortium, Japanese engineers, World Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB),” he said.Till now, Rs 10,000 crore has been spent on developing the basic infrastructure in Amaravati. This massive project was built on a unique self-financing model that would create huge wealth for the whole state as the city develops by leaps and bounds over time, Naidu said and requested the Governor to consider all these issues before thinking of giving any assent to the bills.BJP state president Kanna Lakshminarayana and Communist Party of India secretary K Narayana also wrote separate letters the Governor requesting him not to give assent to the three capitals bill.“The decentralisation bill is against the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014, which has a provision for only one capital, and against the wishes of the people,” the BJP leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-endorse-bills-for-three-capital-cities-chandrababu-naidu-tells-ap-governor/story-rxgdwAkECvX2LdIsuKbNpL.html
19-07-2020||India||Covid-19 spread may spike in monsoon, winter with fall in temperatures: IIT-AIIMS study||A study conducted jointly by researchers at IIT-Bhubaneswar and the AIIMS here has shown that the spread of Covid-19 may pick up pace during peak monsoon and winter with a fall in the mercury.The rainfall, decrease in temperatures and cooling of the atmosphere coupled with progression towards winter may environmentally favour the spread of Covid-19 in the country, according to the study led by V Vinoj, Assistant Professor of the School of Earth, Ocean and Climatic Sciences at IIT-Bhubaneswar.The report titled “Covid-19 spread in India and its dependence on temperature and relative humidity” took into account the pattern of the coronavirus outbreak and the number of such cases in 28 states between April and June.The study revealed that the rise in temperatures leads to a decline in the transmission of the virus, Vinoj said.“The study, which is in its pre-print stage, shows that the temperature and relative humidity have a significant impact on the disease growth rate and doubling time.“It suggests that a one-degree-Celsius rise in temperature leads to a 0.99 per cent decrease in cases and increases the doubling time by 1.13 days, implying a slowdown of the virus spread,” he told PTI.The study also found that an increase in relative humidity tends to decrease the growth rate and doubling time of coronavirus cases by 1.18 days.The researchers, however, said since the study was not conducted during the period of high humidity starting from the monsoon and the onset of winter, more research needs to be undertaken to establish its exact impact.Dr Bijayini Behera of the department of Microbiology at AIIMS Bhubaneswar, who was part of the research team, said several studies suggested that a fall in the temperatures and a relatively low humidity facilitated such an outbreak in the past.The study also carried out an analysis of the impact of solar radiation on the spread of Covid-19.“We found that a higher surface-reaching solar radiation leads to a reduction in the number of infections and an increase in the doubling time of cases, similar to that of temperatures,” Vinoj said.There is an average temperature difference of seven degrees Celsius between the winter and summer seasons, he added.According to the study, there is a likelihood of an increased transmission of the coronavirus during winter, which may be a major challenge for health workers and policymakers to enforce mitigation and control measures.The objective of the study is to help authorities bring effective measures to combat the pandemic, Vinoj said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-spread-may-spike-in-monsoon-winter-with-fall-in-temperatures-iit-aiims-study/story-9JLkDszdipguHRR7S659xL.html

Das wrote an emotional letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month, requesting him to visit Ayodhya for the bhumi pujan. It was after this letter that the Prime Minister’s Office sought tentative dates from the trust for Modi’s maiden Ayodhya visit for the bhumi pujan. Now, with the PM likely to visit Ayodhya on August 5 for the ceremony, Nritya Gopal Das is about to see his dream come true. The Mahant wants bhumi pujan of the Ram temple on lines that was held for the Somnath temple in Gujarat.A day after the trust’s meeting in Ayodhya, Nritya Gopal Das interacted with Hindustan Times. Excerpts:Q: You always wanted a grand bhumi pujan for Ram temple. But due to the Covid-19 pandemic, will the ceremony be low-key?A: We had planned a grand bhumi pujan for Ram temple like the one organised for the Somnath temple. Then President of India Rajendra Prasad and home minister Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel attended the Somanth temple bhumi pujan. The ceremony continued for three days. It was a grand and elaborate event. We wanted something like this. But due to the Covid-19 pandemic, this is not possible now. After much effort, we were able to get the PM’s consent to attend the bhumi pujan.Q: The tentative date for bhumi pujan is August 5. But, if due to some unavoidable circumstances, the PM is not able to visit Ayodhya, what will be the trust’s plan?A: We are confident that the PM will definitely come to Ayodhya for the bhumi pujan. However, if due to some unavoidable circumstances and national issues, the PM is not able to come to Ayodhya on August 5 for bhumi pujan then, in the nation’s interest, we will delay the ceremony and will wait for the PM’s visit. Q: Finally, has the trust agreed to make changes in the existing model of the proposed Ram temple?A: The Ram temple model prepared by VHP (Vishva Hindu Parishad) in 1989 will not be changed. It will remain the same. Ram temple will be constructed on the existing model. But some additions have been made to the temple’s model and that is what saints had been demanding. Now, the temple’s height will be 161 ft instead of 128 ft. The number of domes has been increased from three to five. Ram temple’s chief architect Chandrakant Sompura has approved these changes. A grand Ram temple will be constructed. In the meeting (Trust meeting on Saturday), we also discussed these changes.Q: Will the stone slabs lying at Shri Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas Karyashala be used in construction of the Ram temple?A: Yes. All stone slabs carved at the Karyashala will be used in construction of the Ram temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-delay-ram-temple-bhumi-pujan-if-pm-unable-to-attend-ceremony-mahant-nritya-gopal-das/story-LLJpd0zKS0ffOTdorenEFL.html
19-07-2020||India||IT department randomly picks up cases to remove bias from tax scrutiny||The income-tax department, which implemented faceless tax assessment from October 7 last year, has randomly selected 58,319 cases for scrutiny in the first phase and already resolved 7,116 of those, two finance ministry officials said.The objective of the faceless assessment is to completely eliminate physical contact between the taxpayer and the taxman to make tax administration objective, transparent and corruption free, they said requesting anonymity.“The faceless assessment system has been a game changer in the arena of direct taxation. It has empowered the taxpayers and has, as a foremost mechanism, altered the facets and perception of overall tax administration in India,” one official, who holds a senior position, said.The official said this is the future of direct tax administration in India with automated and random allocation of income tax assessment cases without human interface at any stage.Also Read: Stakeholders responsible for the manifold growth of NPAs: Urjit PatelThe second official mentioned above said, 7,116 assessment cases have been already disposed of and assessment orders issued without any additions in the first phase. In 291 cases additions are proposed and the cases have been sent to the risk management unit.“In all the above cases, the grievances of over-pitched assessment or harassment by the taxpayers/tax professional have been almost eliminated. The taxpayers have been advised to check their registered e-filing accounts or emails for notices or updates. Now, all the communications with taxpayers is made electronically by a central cell in Delhi and identity of all the assessing officers remains unknown to the taxpayers at all times,” he added.The faceless system was first proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2017. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced it in her first budget speech on July 5, 2019 and subsequently launched the system on October 7, 2019. The random selection of tax cases are done through artificial Intelligence and machine learning, with a reduced discretion or no human interface from the income-tax department, the officials said.Also Read: At G20, Germany pledges 3 billion euros for poor countries: Finance ministry“Faceless Assessment has further brought in the concept of team based assessment with dynamic jurisdiction and has, thus, induced enhanced transparency, improved efficiency and resulted in superior standardisation of procedures,” the first official said. The system works under National Assessment Center (NeAC) headquartered in Delhi and eight Regional Assessment Centers (ReAC) located in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Pune, Bengaluru and Hyderabad.Now almost 99% returns are e-filed, the second official said. “Out of more than 6 crore returns filed annually, only about 3 lakh returns come under scrutiny on the basis of select risk parameters,” he said. He, however, added that some scrutiny cases are also selected manually on the basis of specified criteria. “Old assessments can also be re-opened if the assessing officer has sufficient reason to believe that some income has escaped assessment,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-department-randomly-picks-up-cases-to-remove-bias-from-tax-scrutiny/story-RR07CXweHJsjxVexPKmdjO.html

On Saturday morning, she gave birth to a stillborn baby girl. The grieving couple wanted to bury the body of the infant after returning to their village.Vali told the police that he had contacted the village elders to request them to make arrangements for the burial, but they allegedly refused to allow the body into the village fearing that she might have contracted the infection, since there were a number of Covid-19 cases in Nandyal Hospital.Having no other option, Vali dumped the body of the infant in the Kurnool-Cuddapah Canal (KC Canal) at Chabolu village on his way back to the village along with his wife. Later in the evening, some locals found the body of the infant floating in the canal water and immediately alerted the police.The police rushed to the spot and retrieved the body and based on the information written on the tag tied to the infant’s body, they could identify the parents. When questioned, Vali informed that his wife had delivered the stillborn baby and he had no other choice but to dump it as the villagers did not agree to bury the body in the village.The police later convinced the villagers and got the body buried at the graveyard. “We have not booked any case as it was a stillborn baby,” the inspector said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shunned-by-villagers-for-suspected-covid-19-man-throws-dead-baby-into-canal-in-kurnool/story-n8UbOnrb7WNusnB3IukwRJ.html

No loss of life has been reported in any of the incidents, officials said on Sunday. Due to heavy rain, the water level of Gori river in the area has risen after which people living near it have been shifted towards safe areas by the local administration, said officials.Girija Shankar Joshi, district information officer Pithoragarh, said, “The heavy rain had started at around 11 pm on Saturday in the Munsiyari area. As the downpour increased, the local station house officer and sub-divisional magistrate concerned reached the area to evacuate the people living near Gori River to a safe place.”Joshi said, “There were four families living in their houses built near the swollen Gori River which were evacuated from there. They were earlier warned and asked to shift from there but they didn’t listen. As a result, their houses collapsed in the night due to heavy rain. However, luckily there was no loss of life.”The official also informed that a bridge was also severely damaged in the heavy rain.“A 120m long bridge en route Jouljibi was also badly damaged. Authorities concerned are constructing a Bailey bridge there which will take about three days. Also, some water pipelines were also damaged in the rain which will be repaired within 24 hours. Senior district officials are keeping an eye on the situation,” said Joshi. Meanwhile, the administration has provided ration to the four affected families who lost their houses in the rain. “All the affected families have been provided 20 kg ration and other essentials besides a sum of Rs 1.19 lakh as compensation for the washed away houses. The administration will provide every possible help to them,” said AK Shukla, SDM, Dharchula. The main roads connecting district headquarters to Bangapani, Munsiyari and Dharchula areas were also damaged due to the incessant rain, disrupting traffic.“The roads towards these places have been closed since night. Repair works are going on and the traffic would be resumed soon,” said Ram Dutt Paliwal, additional district magistrate. Meanwhile, the Dehradun centre of India Meteorological Department (IMD) in its weather forecast has predicted heavy rain in some places of Pithoragarh and Nainital districts in the state.“There would be heavy rain in some isolated places in the two above-mentioned districts but no repetition of Saturday night’s rainfall in Munsiyari area today. On Monday, the heavy rain will occur in some places of Haridwar, Bageshwar, Pauri Garhwal, Nainital and Pithoragarh districts,” said Bikram Singh, Director Dehradun centre IMD.Singh also said, “At present, there are not many showers in the Garhwal region; it is active in Kumaon because the movement of monsoon is not strong in northwest Himalayas. After July 22 or 24, one can expect good showers in Garhwal also.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-houses-collapse-one-bridge-damaged-in-overnight-heavy-rain-in-uttarakhand-s-pithoragarh/story-pr3DVgVH1bS57DExFk9hjO.html
19-07-2020||India||Kerala gold smuggling case unravels, sleuths say 230 kg gold landed in 13 consignments in one year||At least 230 kg of gold was smuggled into the country by using some employees of the United Arab Emirates diplomatic mission since July 2019, said a senior officer familiar with the probe led by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) into the seizure of 30 kg of the yellow metal from the Thiruvananthapuram airport on July 5. “At least 13 such consignments came to the country in one year and they all passed without any check due to diplomatic immunity. Some of them were heavier than the latest consignment which weighed 70 kg. We are also probing some events organised by state government departments,” the official said on Sunday.All these consignments landed in Thiruvananthapuram.The NIA has arrested four persons while the Customs have nabbed 13 people so far in connection with the gold smuggling case.The official also said that people whose names have cropped up during the questioning of the accused will be summoned. This includes Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s former secretary M Sivasankar and the government’s former IT Fellow Arun Balachandran. Last week, the Customs department had grilled Sivasankar for nine hours. Investigators are also likely to question a state minister whose number appeared in the call list of second accused Swapna Suresh which was leaked to the media.Meanwhile there are reports from Dubai that the third accused in the case Faisal Fareed was arrested and will be extradited soon. The NIA ad earlier requested Interpol issue a blue corner notice against him. The NIA has accused him of being a key operative in the smuggling racket. Fareed, who hails from Thrissur, reportedly runs a gym and garage in Dubai.Investigators have also started a massive operation to trace the smuggled gold and seized 10 kg from two jewellers in Kozhikkode on Saturday, the official said.He also said that many who were part of the smuggling syndicate came forward with voluntary disclosure. But he conceded that it was difficult to trace all smuggled gold. In the last two days, investigators have raided two flats of Swapna Suresh and the business establishment of the third accused Sandip Nair in Thiruvananthapuram and seized many documents.The smuggling racket has driven a wedge in the ruling coalition with the CPI, junior partner in the government, expressing serious reservations over “some deviations” in Left ideology and criticising the government’s move to hire multinational consultant agencies. There are allegations that Swapna Suresh came to the corridors of power through some consultant agencies. The party mouthpiece ‘Janayugam’ had warned the Communist government to see through machinations of dubious agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-unravels-sleuths-say-230-kg-gold-landed-in-13-consignments-in-one-year/story-FSCxObPRUEgLKl100PhY9I.html

Till Saturday, there were 1,237 cases in Darjeeling district and 63 in Kalimpong.The notification to upgrade the hospital with immediate effect was issued by West Bengal’s director of health services on Saturday. It was initially started as a hospital for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). Anit Thapa, chairman of board of administrators, GTA said, “From the very beginning we wanted it to be fully functional Covid hospital for hill people. We didn’t get the clearance initially and it started as a SARI hospital in June.”Once a guesthouse for tourists and later turned into a training hub for Gorkhaland activists, the three-storey building was lying in a shambles for years. It was recently restored. The building was built in the 1990s when Subash Ghisingh was chairman of the erstwhile Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council.In Siliguri town, patients have been complaining of shortage of beds at the two designated government hospitals and many people have been sent to safe home facilities set up by the government. All 47 civic wards in SMC area are under complete lockdown till July 23. Ankam Simlandi, superintendent of the hospital, said, “We already have the required infrastructure, including ventilators. We will add more.”Prakas Barui, chief medical officer of health, Kalimpong, said, “We hope the hospital will serve people well and handle critical patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-in-darjeeling-hills-get-their-own-covid-19-hospital/story-TuYuaPgN8zD7CEiIaiAcmL.html

But this year there’s the additional scourge of the coronavirus pandemic as well.Thousands uprooted by floodwaters are taking shelter in relief camps and local administrations are trying to implement a new set of rules which require safety and social distancing among the people housed in them.There have been no reported cases of Covid-19 infection yet from the relief camps, which are usually located in government educational institutions and temporary structures. “In view of Covid-19, we issued fresh guidelines in May itself on the management of flood relief camps. District administrations have followed those rules, but floods this year have been unrelenting making it tougher for them,” said Pankaj Chakraborty, the state project coordinator of Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA).As per the new guidelines, district officials had to identify additional relief camps as per population density of villages to earmark space for social distancing. Unlike earlier when 3.5sq m of space in relief camps was earmarked for each person, the figure was doubled to 7sq m to ensure there’s one-metre distance between two camp inmates.“We have been staying at a relief camp since July 13. Local officials informed us about maintaining hygiene and social distancing and we are trying to follow as much as possible,” Ramen Doley, a farmer in Golaghat, who is staying at a relief camp at Mungilal lower primary school along with 126 others.Adequate toilet facilities, provisions made for hand-wash, sanitizers and face masks for inmates, daily monitoring of the health of inmates and isolation and tests of those showing Covid-19 symptoms were some of the other rules.“We have 52 relief camps at present and over persons are staying in them. Our personnel are ensuring all safety and social distancing protocols are followed. Health workers are visiting camps and conducting tests of those showing symptoms. No one has been found infected yet,” said Nandita Dutta, district project officer of the disaster management authority in Barpeta.According to an ASDMA bulletin on Saturday, more than 27.63 lakh people in 26 of the state’s 33 districts are affected by floods, which have claimed 79 lives this season. Over 47,000 displaced people were taking shelter in 649 relief camps in 21 of the affected districts.“There are 22 relief camps in our district at present and 3240 persons are staying there. We have provided face masks, sanitisers, soaps at the relief camps. Though we have had cases of inmates suffering from cough, cold etc., no one has been found Covid-19 positive yet,” said Ronney Rajkumar, district project officer of the disaster management authority in Golaghat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-s-flood-affected-battle-covid-19-in-relief-camps-none-infected-yet/story-LULpCyj4hmjWTVE58IcVZK.html
19-07-2020||India||OP Dhankar appointed president of BJP’s Haryana unit||OP Dhankar, who was a cabinet minister in the BJP government in Haryana, was on Sunday appointed the president of the party’s state unit.By appointing Dhankar, the BJP has continued with a Jat face, the most dominant caste in the state. The BJP, in a statement, said party chief JP Nadda appointed Dhankar the Haryana unit head.The appointment is also seen as an attempt to balance the caste equations in the state, where politics revolves around Jats and non-Jats.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar is also a non-Jat.Dhankar will replace incumbent Subhash Barala, who was also a Jat.Both Dhankar and Barala had lost the Harayana Assembly elections held in October last year. Dhankar was a cabinet minister in the BJP government in Haryana.The appointment has been delayed by more than eight months as it was expected that a new president would be appointed after the announcement of the state Assembly results. Dhankar has also been the national president of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Kisan Morcha twice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/op-dhankar-appointed-president-of-bjp-s-haryana-unit/story-rhacRnDilPvzaZkAe5cNUK.html
19-07-2020||India||India’s Covid-19 case fatality rate ‘progressively falling’, among lowest in world: Govt||India’s Covid-19 case fatality rate is “progressively falling” and is currently at 2.49 per cent, which is one of the lowest in the world, the Union Health Ministry said on Sunday, crediting efficient clinical management of hospitalised cases for it. There are 29 states and union territories with a case fatality rate (CFR) lower than India’s average, with five of them having a CFR of zero and 14 having fatality rate of less than 1 per cent. The focused efforts of the Centre and state and UT governments on efficient clinical management of hospitalised cases have ensured that India’s case fatality rate has fallen below 2.5 per cent, the ministry said. With effective containment strategy, aggressive testing and standardized clinical management protocols based on holistic standard of care approach, the CFR has significantly dipped, it said. “The CFR is progressively falling and currently, it is 2.49 per cent. India has one of the lowest fatality rates in the world,” the ministry said. From 2.82 per cent over a month earlier, India’s Covid-19 case fatality rate declined to 2.72 per cent on July 10 and has further reduced to 2.49 per cent presently. Under the guidance of the Centre, the state and UT governments have ramped up testing and hospital infrastructure by combining public and private sector efforts, the ministry said. Many states have conducted the population surveys to map and identify the vulnerable population like the elderly, pregnant women and those with co-morbidities. This, with the help of technological solutions like mobile apps, has ensured keeping the high-risk population under continuous observation, thus aiding early identification, timely clinical treatment and reducing fatalities, the ministry said. “At the ground level, frontline health workers like ASHAs (Accredited Social Health Activists) and ANMs (Auxiliary Nursing Midwives) have done a commendable job of managing the migrant population and to enhance awareness at the community level. “As a result, there are 29 States and UTs with CFR lower than India’s average. This shows commendable work done by public health apparatus of the country,” the ministry said. Manipur, Nagaland, Sikkim, Mizoram, Andaman and Nicobar Islands have zero case fatality rate. States and UTs having a CFR below the national average include Tripura (0.19 pc),  Assam (0.23 pc), Kerala (0.34 pc), Odisha (0.51 pc), Goa (0.60 pc), Himachal Pradesh (0.75 pc), Bihar (0.83 pc), Telangana (0.93 pc), Andhra Pradesh (1.31 pc), Tamil Nadu (1.45 pc), Chandigarh (1.71 pc), Rajasthan (1.94 pc), Karnataka (2.08 pc) and Uttar Pradesh (2.36 pc). India saw a record single-day jump of 38,902 Covid-19 cases pushing its tally to 10,77,618 on Sunday, while the total number of recoveries increased to 6,77,422. A total of 23, 672 patients have recuperated in the past 24 hours, the highest so far in a day, according to the health ministry data updated at 8 AM. The death toll due to the disease rose to 26,816 with 543 fatalities being reported in a day. There are 3,73,379 active cases presently in the country, while 6,77,422 people have recovered so far.  According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), a cumulative total of 1,37,91,869 samples have been tested up to July 18 with 3,58,127 samples being tested on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-case-fatality-rate-progressively-falling-among-lowest-in-world-health-ministry/story-ZHhvtQjeOfJsuo1lEvAzOP.html
19-07-2020||India||Kejriwal says not the time for blame game over Delhi waterlogging death||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has stated that he was personally monitoring the work to clear water logging from capital roads that resulted in the death of at least one person, allegedly due to drowning at the Minto road overbridge Sunday morning. Kejriwal said that the civic agencies were busy fighting coronavirus this year and therefore it was not the time for blame game over the issue.“Road under the Minto bridge has been cleared of water logging. I was in contact with agencies since morning and was monitoring the process of removing water. We are keeping an eye on more such places in Delhi. Wherever there is water logging, it is being pumped out immediately,” Kejriwal tweeted.Earlier this morning, the body of a 60-year-old man was found floating under the Minto bridge around 10 am. Police said the man could have drowned while trying to take his tempo through the water logged underpass. Kundan’s body was discovered by a trackman working at New Delhi railway station yard, who fished it out.Delhi fire service officials quoted by the news agency claimed they had saved 10 lives this morning from water logging while responding to distress calls.“Three people were saved in the ITO area, six people were saved near Zakhira Flyover and one person was saved at Lawrence Road,” ANI quoted Delhi fire service as saying.Kundan’s death had earlier raised questions if civic bodies had done enough work to prevent occurrence of such events. North Delhi mayor Jai Prakash had attacked the Delhi government on the issue.“Such incidents will continue to occur until the Delhi government gets rid of its irresponsible attitude,” ANI quoted him as saying. He added that the government should ensure that such incidents don’t happen again.Aam Aadmi Party leader Sanjay Singh later said that the MCD had the largest responsibility for clearing the drains. MCD is controlled by the BJP.“Three agencies-- MCD, PWD and Jal Board—are responsible for clearing drains. The biggest share of responsibility among these lies with the MCD. Nobody had any idea that it would rain so much suddenly. Mistakes should be rectified. This time is not a blame game,” Sanjay Singh said.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, too, reacted little later and said that all agencies including the PWD (public works department), Delhi jal board (DJB), Delhi Municipal Corporation (MCD) and the flood department were working to deal with the problem.“Some part of our management was busy with Coved 19 but we are doing the needful. CM Arvind Kejriwal is monitoring the situation personally,” he was quoted as saying.Kejriwal, too, claimed that preoccupation with battling coronavirus could have left some gaps in preparation for the Monsoon rains.“This year all the agencies, whether under Delhi government or MCD, were busy with Coronavirus containment. They have faced several difficulties due to the Corona crisis. This is not the time for a blame game. All have to come together and act responsibly. We will try to clear up all areas that report water logging,” he tweeted.Three people had to be rescued by the fire service department after it received an SOS call about a DTC bus and two autorickshaws being submerged in the water-logged Minto road underpass this morning.Overnight rains led to water logging at several stretches including Azadpur underpass, South Avenue road, Pul Prahladpur underpass, Paharganj side of New Delhi railway station, Moolchand underpass and near Batra Hospital, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwal-says-not-the-time-for-blame-game-over-delhi-waterlogging-death/story-xZ4FdZ9Vq6Q2SmpdxdeKKL.html
19-07-2020||India||Centre rejects Jharkhand’s drought relief proposal, no compensation for 7 lakh farmers||More than seven lakh Jharkhand farmers would be deprived of compensation for crop loss due to drought last year because the Centre has rejected state’s proposal to declare 55 blocks across seven districts as drought-hit, officials said on Sunday.In April this year, the Jharakhand cabinet had passed a proposal seeking relief according to the drought manual after it approved 55 blocks across seven districts- Bokaro, Chatra, Pakur, Deoghar, Giridih, Godda and Hazaribag, as drought hit. The state disaster management department sent the proposal to the Centre in MayJoint secretary of state disaster management department Manish Tiwary said, “We had sent the proposal to the Centre but it has rejected it.”On farmers’ compensation for crop loss, he said, “Disaster management department cannot give the compensation, as it gets the fund from the Centre. If we don’t get funds from the Centre, how could we give it to farmers?”The state could not devise a relief package because of the Centre’s rejection of its proposal. “The package could not be finalized, as the request to declare drought itself was rejected.”Raju Mahto, 45, a farmer from Bokaro said, “We had already lost hope for the compensation against our crop loss. We faced loss in August-September last year but the government sent its request to the Centre in April this year.” He said he had sown paddy on one two acres of land which was damaged due to scanty rainfall last year.The Centre has rejected the state’s proposal, as the process of declaring drought by the state had already expired on October 31 last year, officials said. As per the Centre’s manual, the state could declare drought following three parameters----Trigger-1 (rainfall parameter), Trigger-2 (impact indicators such as crop, remote sensing, soil moisture and hydrology, and Verification (ground truth). The state had been asked to complete required parameters including cabinet approval for drought declaration and send its recommendation to the Centre by October 31, officials said.As per the norms, the state cabinet has to declare drought and send its request to Centre for assistance. Based on the state’s claim, a team from the Centre visits the state to assess the ground situation of drought and recommend for assistance.The ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) alleged that the previous BJP government neither declared drought nor did it send its request for assistance to the centre even after expiring the deadline for recommending drought.“Since it was election time, the then BJP government was engaged in its branding. Farmers were not in the priority list of the BJP government. Now, lakhs of farmers would suffer due to the anti-farmer approach of the previous government,” said JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattachargya.The BJP, however, blamed the current JMM-Congress government for the farmers’ loss. “Everyone knows that the drought proposal could not be sent to the Centre then due to the model code of conduct coming into effect for the assembly polls. The current government must have pursued it after the model code of conduct was withdrawn in January. Had the Hemant Soren government sent the proposal in January or February, farmers would not have suffered now,” said BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-rejects-jharkhand-s-drought-relief-proposal-no-compensation-for-7-lakh-farmers/story-ZqNr4invKWYPGJzRZiwWUJ.html

19-07-2020||India||Rajasthan crisis: Congress hits back at BJP with demand for Gajendra Singh Shekhawat’s resignation, 5 questions||The Congress on Sunday said Gajendra Singh Shekhawat must step down as the Union minister so that he cannot interfere in any investigation into the leaked audiotapes in which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader is allegedly heard conspiring to topple the Rajasthan government.Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala had briefed the media on Friday about the existence of the tapes where BJP leaders, including Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, can be heard conspiring with rebel MLAs from the Sachin Pilot camp to topple the Ashok Gehlot-led government.Surjewala’s allegations were refuted by Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, who represents Jodhpur in Parliament. He has also demanded a probe to verify the authenticity of the audiotapes that have gone viral on social media.The BJP has also dismissed the tapes as “manufactured” by the Congress, which was “frustrated at its inability to keep its house in order”.On Sunday, senior Congress leader Ajay Maken shot five questions as well as the demand for Gajendra Singh Shekhawat’s removal or resignation. Maken also asked the Union water minister to come forward and give his voice sample to end the row over audio clips. “Now that Gajendra Singh Shekhawat has been named in the FIR and his voice in the audiotape has been recognised by people who know him, why is he holding the post of a Union minister?” Ajay Maken asked during a press conference in Jaipur.“I heard that he is saying that the voice in the audiotape is not his but of another Gajendra Singh. If it is so, he should give his voice sample and step down from the post until the probe is completed,” Maken added.Maken also shot other questions at the BJP, asking why Bhanwarlal Sharma and Vishwendra Singh, rebel Congress MLA and former minister of the Gehlot cabinet respectively, are being stopped from giving their voice samples.He also questioned whether other big leaders of the central government are involved and why it is the party trying to suppress the names by conducting a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).The BJP had on Saturday demanded a probe by CBI into what it called a “saga of illegalities and concocted lies” and wondered whether the state adopted “unconstitutional” methods to tap into the phones of politicians.Ajay Maken also said that the BJP should also talk about the source of the black money when it is talking about bribing leader withs Rs 25-35 crore.The senior Congress leader also asked why are the rebel leaders in Pilot’s camp are being given protection and being forced if the BJP has no role. He also questioned the role of the Centre, the Haryana government, income tax department, Enforcement Directorate and the Delhi Police.Rajasthan Police’s Special Operations Group (SOG) on Friday registered two first information reports alleging a conspiracy to topple the Congress government in the state after the party’s chief whip Mahesh Joshi lodged a complaint on Thursday night citing three audiotapes, purportedly of conversations detailing the plot.The FIR and the charges come in the middle of a raging political battle in the state between Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot, who was also the president of the party’s state unit until he was divested of both posts by the Congress on Tuesday.Gehlot, who has the support of at least 101 MLAs in the 200-member assembly, has blamed Pilot of conspiring with the BJP to bring down his government.Pilot, who has at least 21 MLAs supporting him and are at the ITC Grand Bharat in Manesar, has maintained he and his allies are only opposed to Gehlot’s “dictatorial” ways and have nothing to do with the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-crisis-congress-hits-back-at-bjp-with-demand-for-gajendra-singh-shekhawat-s-resignation-5-questions/story-jtkrIpiNKf8Z5yNKt3AgVO.html

19-07-2020||India||Parliamentary panels have started scrutinising handling of Covid-19 in India: Venkaiah Naidu||Parliamentary panels have started scrutinising the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country a little over three months after Parliament was adjourned ahead of its schedule due to the virus and a shorter timeframe to hold the standing committee meetings would not have been possible given the present situation, Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu said on Sunday.In a Facebook post hailing the media’s role during the pandemic, the vice president also said Parliament is “on course” for holding the Monsoon session.The Rajya Sabha chairman said he has held several rounds of discussions with Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on enabling the meetings of the parliamentary committees and the Monsoon session of Parliament. “Given the corona-induced social distancing norm, the logistics of seating of MPs required detailed deliberation and planning. The government also recently reached out to both the presiding officers (Naidu and Birla) on holding the Monsoon session.“We are on course,” Naidu said.With the easing of restrictions on domestic air travel in May and to a lesser degree on rail travel, the department-related standing committees of both Houses of Parliament have resumed their meetings this month, he pointed out.They have undertaken an examination of various aspects of the management of the pandemic and its fallout, Naidu said.“This, in effect, means the required parliamentary scrutiny of the handling of the pandemic started in about three and half months of the last sitting of the apex legislature of the country. Any other shorter timeframe may have not been possible given the situation prevailing in the country,” he asserted.Some members of Parliament had suggested holding the standing committee meetings online due to the pandemic and the resultant lockdown.But the committees met physically.At least four parliamentary panels have met in the last few days and the ones relating to home affairs and science and technology have discussed various aspects of the pandemic.Naidu pointed out that the Budget session had to be cut short a few days ahead of the schedule as the MPs wanted to be with the people in this hour of crisis.Both Houses were adjourned sine die on March 23. According to the provisions of the Constitution, Parliament has to meet within six months of the last sitting. Normally, the Monsoon session starts in July with some exceptions over the years.“This year, we are living in abnormal times due to the pandemic. The central and state governments are engrossed in handling the pandemic for the last over four months on a day-to-day basis,” Naidu pointed out.Referring to journalists, he said the media, as the fourth pillar of democracy, is often said to be the bridge between parliamentary institutions and people by enabling a two-way communication. “This role has assumed even more significance during the time of the pandemic,” the vice president said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliamentary-panels-have-started-scrutinising-handling-of-covid-19-in-india-venkaiah-naidu/story-9NNcBdtge8cA6xJwJAOIGN.html
19-07-2020||India||Migrant workers slowly returning to cities; locals being trained to fill immediate gap||Migrant labourers who had left for their native places after coronavirus lockdowns are either returning themselves or being brought back by their employers to project sites in cities, according to industry players.Since the country has already entered Unlock 2.0, projects that were stalled due to the lockdown have resumed work, though with just half of their capacity as most of the labourers are yet to return.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageEngineering firms, which have been hit hard due to non-execution of large infrastructure projects, are taking initiatives to bring back the workforce from states such as Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Gujarat.According to recent data by Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, thousands of workers have been brought back by engineering firms to complete the metro projects, including Dahisar East-Andheri East metro 7 line.Among others, real estate players too are taking initiatives to bring back the workforce to complete the stalled projects.“Labourers are coming back as they need jobs. Generally this is the season when they go to their villages for farming or to attend marriages. But they return soon,” a labour contractor told PTI. He said these labourers had left cities amid Covid-19 panic, but now they want to return to work since the construction activities have begun. “While some are returning by trains, others are being brought by contractors,” he added. Indian Railways had said that it transported over 50 lakh migrants to various parts of the country through special Shramik trains. Meanwhile, some states have started looking for local manpower to bridge the deficit created in the workforce requirements in various sectors. Some real estate developers are sponsoring the return of migrant workers and also facilitating their quarantine as per guidelines. “We want to complete our projects and deliver them on time to our customers. For that we are taking steps to bring back the labourers. We are not just taking care of their journey and 14 days quarantine, but we are also paying them their wages for those days,” Puravankara Group managing director Ashish Puravankara recently told PTI.Maharashtra, which has already given a call to the sons of the soil, has undertaken initiatives to invite locals to participate in the infra projects undertaken by the government.Recently, the government’s skill development department conducted an online job fair to hire over 17,000 locals for various projects undertaken by Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA).“We are in constant communications with industry bodies and various government departments to understand if there is a skill gap. We are working on skilling people locally wherever there is a requirement,” Maharashtra Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Minister Nawab Malik had recently said.He further said that according to the information they are getting, many workers who had left the state to go to their home towns due to the panic over the pandemic are slowly coming back from states like Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and other places to Mumbai and Pune where they were working.According to CIEL HR Services Director and CEO Aditya Mishra, around 30-40 per cent of people who have gone back home are returning to Maharashtra and Gujarat.“They left in fear but in their villages they were not able to get the basic facilities there. Also MNREGA was not enough to keep the entire family occupied,” he said. When the Unlock 1.0 was announced and construction work began, people started coming back, Mishra said, adding that many companies facilitated their journey back taking all preventative measures as per government guidelines and gave them a secure and healthy environment as part of their CSR initiatives.Mishra further said that not only unskilled workers but also highly skilled technicians are coming back to their places of work. Even new workforce or first timers are joining.However, people from other sectors like travel and hospitality among others are yet to come back as these segments are not fully open, he noted.Industry insiders said local workers are demanding more wages for the same work as they did in the pre-Covid-19 period when the supply of migrant labourers was more.“We are facing a lot of issues with the local labourers. The restrictions due to the lockdown has added to the woes as the locals are unwilling to travel to far places. They are also demanding more wages. Also, now these locals will go to their villages for the Ganpati festival. We are hopeful that by August, more migrant labourers will return and things will get back to normal,” Dipti Mehta, an architect, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-workers-slowly-returning-to-cities-locals-being-trained-to-fill-immediate-gap/story-XrQu9kSZ4x77tj5oRMybUN.html

He also shook hands of the battalion officers and men while praising them for their bravery against all odds. Raksha Mantri Shri @rajnathsingh met the soldiers from Bihar Regiment at Lukung during his visit to forward areas in Ladakh. He had a brief interaction with them. pic.twitter.com/81YS0T960aIt was this Bihar unit which faced the Chinese troops during the clashes in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15. An attack on the commanding officer of the 16 Bihar Colonel Santosh Babu was reported to be the trigger for the bloody scuffle. With both sides now involved in dis-engagement at Galwan sector, 16 Bihar and the PLA unit from Sichuan it faced on June 15 have been taken out of the frontline as it could spark of conflagration again.India and China have been engaged in talks to east the month-long tension along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Officials of both the countries have held a series of meetings. During one such meeting on June 6, it was decided that China will move its observation post near the junction of Shyok and Galwan rivers. During a routine patrol on June 15, the Indian soldiers found the tents were still there, according to people aware of what unfolded at the border that day.The Chinese observation post was manned by 10-12 soldiers who were told by the Indian patrol to go away. The Chinese refused to do so even as the Indian patrol returned to their unit to inform them about the development.This was when the Indian troops with around 50 people and 16 Bihar Commanding Officer Colonel Santosh Babu in the lead, went on to tell the Chinese to go back further in their territory as they were on Indian soil.Meanwhile, by the time the first Indian patrol returned from the site, the Chinese had called for reinforcements from their rear positions in the Galwan river valley who came with around 300-350 people.As the Indian patrol reached, the sources said, the Chinese had already built up troops on higher ground around the observation post and kept the stones and weapons ready for launching an attack on the Indian troops.As the two sides started talking, the discussion turned into a heated one and the Indian side started uprooting their tents and equipment. The Chinese, who had already prepared themselves for aggression against Indian troops, attacked the Indian side in which their first attack was on the 16 Bihar CO and Havildar Palani. After the CO went down, the Biharis lost control and started attacking the Chinese ferociously despite being heavily outnumbered and stones raining from the higher ground.Twenty Indian soldiers, including Colonel Babu, were killed in the clashes. China also suffered casualties but never announced the exact number.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-meets-soldiers-of-bihar-regiment-which-took-on-chinese-during-galwan-valley-clash/story-T8hZZSlHs7cy9VYy2QQITK.html

He had asked me to meet Vasundhara ji and others. There are other agents like him but they didn’t succeed in their attempts. Sanjay Jain had been active for a long time,” Congress MLA Rajendra Guda was quoted as saying by ANI.Guda, however, didn’t explicitly state the nature of the offer to meet Vasundhara Raje.Also Read: Cooking tips, yoga keep Ashok Gehlot’s MLAs busy at Rajasthan hotelVasundhara Raje has been reticent during the current political turmoil triggered by Congress leader and former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and his follower MLAs’ rebellion against the Gehlot government. Her reaction on Saturday, alleging that the BJP was unfairly being targeted for the discord in the Congress and that the state was paying for it, was her first widely-reported comment on the current situation.Hanuman Beniwal, a Rashtriya Loktantrik Party MP from Nagaur had earlier alleged that Raje was involved in efforts to save the Gehlot government from behind the scenes. RLP’s three MLAs support the BJP in the state assembly.On Saturday, Vasundhara Raje reacted to such allegations and said she was a loyal BJP worker for the last three decades and was committed to the party ideology.“Some people are continuously trying to spread confusion over Rajasthan’s political situation. I have served the people as a loyal BJP worker for over three decades and I stand with the party’s ideology,” she tweeted.The present development comes amid a raging blame game over alleged illegal phone tapping of politicians by the state within the larger tussle for political power between the Congress and the BJP.Also Read: BJP demands CBI probe into Rajasthan phone tapLeader of opposition in Rajasthan assembly and senior BJP leader Gulab Chand Kataria alleged on Sunday that chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s OSD (officer on special duty) could have been involved in illegal phone tapping.“Government has a right to tap phones but only after bringing it into the knowledge of and with approval from the Home Department. No private person is authorised to do it. Some Lokesh Sharma, who is said to be OSD to CM, had done it. He’s not authorised, he violated law,” Kataria was quoted as saying by ANI.Kataria was referring to two audio clips doing the rounds of social media cited by Congress as evidence of BJP’s involvement in alleged inducement of Congress MLAs with an aim to bring down Ashok Gehlot government. The Congress has alleged that union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat is heard on the tape. Both Shekhawat and the party have denied the allegations and demanded a CBI probe in the matter to get to the bottom of “unauthorised” phone tapping by the state.The Congress has responded to the demand by saying it amounted to an admission of guilt by the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-mla-alleges-vasundhara-raje-link-to-arrested-horse-trading-agent/story-P2DRUafkxtVeiYDuQ8SaSJ.html

However, active efforts by authorities aided in recovery of an exhausted rhino who had strayed on to the national highway on Saturday. On Saturday, the carcass of a female rhino that had died due to drowning was found in the central range of the park. Last month, one rhino had died due to natural causes in the western range of the park. All the other deaths are due to drowning, confirmed KNPTR officials.According to a bulletin issued by park authorities on Sunday, nearly 85% area of the park, spread over 430 sq km is under water at present. Forty three of the 223 forest camps inside the park are inundated of which 6 have been vacated.Till now, 60 animals (36 hog deer, eight rhinos, three wild buffalo, one python, seven wild boar, two swamp deer, one Sambar and two porcupines) have died due to drowning. Fifteen hog deer have died after getting hit by vehicles on national highway 37 close to the park, while trying to cross it to escape flood waters.Also Read: Rhino rests on highway as cars pass by in Assam. Officials trying to guide it back to rescue centreFifteen rescued animals died during treatment at the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC), located near the park.According to the KNPTR bulletin, 51 animals have been injured due to floods and one by a speeding vehicle. Till date, 134 animals have been rescued. Of them, 110 have been released into the wild, while 8 others including a one-year-old female rhino calf are under treatment at CWRC.On Saturday, an adult male rhino had strayed out of the park and rested for several hours on NH37. The animal, which was being guarded by police and forest personnel, moved back to the park on Sunday morning.“The animal was very exhausted as it was in water for 3-4 day and we were planning to shift it to the state zoo in Guwahati. But after resting for several hours it moved back inside. We are keeping a watch on it,” said P Sivakumar, director KNPTR.Also Read: Assam floods death toll rises to 79Annual floods are common in Kaziranga, the biggest habitat of one-horned rhinos. The park has around 2,400 rhinos and 121 tigers. Last year, floods had claimed nearly 200 animals in the park, including 18 rhinos.“The rhino which came out of the park had some vision impairment and was extremely exhausted. We gave it treatment as well as multivitamins after which it recovered and started movement,” said wildlife veterinarian Shamshul Ali.Bibhab Talukdar, founder of Aaranyak, a wildlife NGO, stated that though Kaziranga experiences several waves of floods each year, this season it is a bit severe as there has been not much respite in between.“When there’s frequent flooding, the animals don’t get enough time to recover. They are usually exhausted easily and hungry as well. Since the animals move towards higher locations in Karbi Anglong after crossing NH37, it is very crucial to protect that area from human intervention,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nine-rhinos-among-over-100-animal-deaths-in-assam-s-kaziranga-during-floods/story-Nh51CKLJrjRVi59h0BnBeP.html

States come up with new protocols||The state governments across the country are preparing protocols and finding ways to strengthen an already stretched healthcare infrastructure due to Covid-19, in the wake of the onset of dengue season.Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that spreads dengue, is most prevalent in cities, and experts have warned in the past that increased urbanisation and warming temperatures due to climate change means that its range will keep increasing.From Punjab to West Bengal, instructions have been issued to the authorities to ensure dengue does not wreak havoc in the country already grappling with the spread of the coronavirus disease.Also read: Despite record spike, India’s Covid tally 8 times less than 11 other worst affected countries combined togetherThe Punjab government launched a sanitation drive last week. These drives were undertaken by both urban local bodies and panchayati Raj institutions on campaign basis for the prevention of dengue/vector-borne disease.In West Bengal, the health officials have formulated new protocols to help medical professionals distinguish between Covid-19 and dengue, as both have similar symptoms. The protocols will also assist doctors to treat patients diagnosed with both the diseases, according to the health department.“Since early June, we have been witnessing cases of both Covid-19 and dengue from districts like North 24 Parganas, Hooghly and Howrah. In these districts, doctors often find it difficult to differentiate between the two diseases. So, we have decided to form a set of protocols to help them,” news agency PTI quoted a health official as saying.District health workers have been given training for this via video-conference, the health official further said.The ways to prevent spread of dengue include destroying mosquito-breeding sites, like removing trash or old tyres and other objects containing standing water. But coronavirus-era lockdowns and other restrictions have meant that these efforts have been reduced or stopped altogether at many places.According to World Health Organisation (WHO), 2019 was the worst year on record for dengue cases, with every region affected, and some countries were hit for the first time. According to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), 1,36,422 dengue cases were diagnosed in India in 2019 and an estimated 132 people died.Also read: Community spread of Covid-19: IMA sounds alarm, ICMR ramps up testing, states keep tight vigilExperts say that while reduced travel means fewer opportunities for mosquitoes to bite people with dengue to become carriers themselves, the coronavirus pandemic has introduced other variables.Staying home - one way to slow outbreaks of Covid-19, especially in cities - poses greater risks for spreading dengue, said Singapore’s National Environment Agency (NEA). That’s because the Aedes mosquito bites during the day, and with more people staying home, where mosquito populations are high, the more likely they are to be bitten.Both Covid-19 and dengue have symptoms such as high fever, headache and body pain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-to-deal-with-dengue-during-covid-19-states-come-up-with-new-protocols/story-oUJWEVtK6QBEbRNdw1T6OK.html

19-07-2020||India||Despite record spike, India’s Covid tally 8 times less than 11 other worst affected countries combined together||India’s Covid tally may be zooming with record daily spikes being registered regularly but a deeper look at the statistics reveal the contagion situation in the country is better than several others, claimed the union health ministry through release of data comparing India with other 11 worst-affected countries.While India’s 38,902 cases reported on Sunday- the highest for any 24 hours period so far—took the country’s tally to 1,077,618, the health ministry data shows that this is still eight times less than the number of cases recorded so far in 11 other worst-affected countries including the US, Brazil, Russia, Peru, Chile, Mexico, South Africa, U.K, Iran, Pakistan and Spain.India’s total casualties due to coronavirus disease have reached 26,816 with 543 deaths reported over the last 24 hours, however, in comparison with the countries named above, the figure is still 14 times less, says the data released by the health ministry,Also Read: India reports record 38,902 new Covid-19 cases in one day, tally over 10.77 lakh“The 11 most Covid19 affected countries in the world (U.S, Brazil, Russia, Peru, Chile, Mexico, South Africa, U.K, Iran, Pakistan, Spain) together reported 8 times more cases and 14 times more deaths than India,” the tweet posted on central government’s press communication department’s website said.The combined tally of coronavirus cases logged so far in the US, Brazil, Russia, Peru, Chile, Mexico, South Africa, U.K, Iran, Pakistan and Spain stands at 9,178,595 on Sunday morning, as per worldometers.com. These countries’ combined death toll stands at 392,460.According to the health ministry data, India’s containment efforts appear even more credible given the combined population density of these countries being 5 times less than India’s.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe government has often said in the past that judging the success of India’s coronavirus containment efforts by merely looking at the total number of infections—which places the country in the third spot around the globe— will not convey an accurate assessment of the situation. The government has often argued that the nationwide lockdown along with the enhanced focus on surveillance, testing, treatment and isolation has slowed down the growth of the disease, making it possible to save more lives without letting the growth of the infection explode beyond the point of control and realm of effective management.India took about 110 days to go from 1,000 confirmed cases to a million unlike the United States and Brazil, which took 49 and 91 days respectively, to cross the grim milestone after reaching the first 1000 cases.The numbers are also encouraging from the point of view that India is the second most populated country in the world, with a population of at least 1.3 billion, and the caseload of a million means that only about 0.07% of the country’s population has been infected with the coronavirus. This is the lowest share of the infected population among the five countries with the highest number of confirmed cases.In comparison, the United States with nearly 3.7 million confirmed cases and a population of 328 million has 1.13% of its population infected by the disease.However, the number of tests conducted presents a different picture, which may not be very favourable for India. The US with 143,759 tests per million, Brazil--23,096 tests per million, Russia-- 169,092 tests per million, South Africa--40,826 tests per million, Peru-61900 tests per million, Chile--72,596 tests per million, Spain- 128,892 tests per million, UK-193,109 tests per million and Iran- 25,267 tests per million, are far ahead of India’s 9,989 tests per million. Only Pakistan and Mexico among the 12 worst-affected countries have conducted less tests per million—at 7,788 and 6.315 respectively, according to worldometers.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-record-spike-india-s-covid-tally-8-times-less-than-11-other-worst-affected-countries-combined-together/story-XkueHJ4Tt3al3HJ3Uf6H2J.html

ACP Dubey, meanwhile, said that there were no external injuries on Kundan’s body. “It looks like he died of drowning. We are initiating inquest proceedings and are still probing the circumstances under which he died,” said the ACP. The rain on Sunday morning led to water-logging at several stretches of roads across the national capital. According to the Delhi Traffic Police, the affected roads included Azadpur Underpass, South Avenue Road, Pul Prahladpur Underpass, Paharganj side of New Delhi railway station, Moolachand Underpass and near Batra Hospital, among others. The traffic police also issued an advisory asking bus and tempo drivers to avoid wading through submerged roads as manholes could have been swept away or ditches could have flared up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/body-found-under-water-logged-minto-bridge-in-delhi-after-heavy-rain/story-DndxsUge90WHq43t4Lu1cN.html

Covid19 by restricting testing and misreporting deaths. 2. GDP by using a new calculation method. 3. Chinese aggression by frightening the media,” Gandhi posted.He also repeated his warning from Saturday.“The illusion will break soon and India will pay the price,” he said.The Wayanad lawmaker and his party have been raising these issues relentlessly and calling out the government over what they have said is the mishandling of the situations facing the country.Gandhi had issued a video on Twitter to talk about several aspects of the government’s policies that he said the Centre has destroyed over the last six years and resulted in the present action by the Chinese.“Since 2014, the PM’s constant blunders and indiscretions have fundamentally weakened India and left us vulnerable. Empty words don’t suffice in the world of geopolitics,” Gandhi tweeted on Friday.That day he gave three reasons behind China’s aggressive stance against India as both the neighbours have clashed on its border in eastern Ladakh in the last few months taking their ties to a new low.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-chamberlain-comparison-rahul-gandhi-attacks-bjp-over-institutionalised-lies/story-3tTr9qqpkwrimNGSBLlX7I.html

It was decided at the meeting to increase the number of domes from three to five.The temple’s chief architect Chandrakant Sompura spoke to Hindustan Times’ sister publication Hindustan that it had become important to increase the height of the main structure after the number of domes were increased. And accordingly, it was decided to add one more storey to the existing design.According to earlier design, the height of the temple was 128 feet. Sompura further said that the changes in design have been incorporated as per the wishes of the trust and the seers.According to the original design, the temple was to be constructed in 67 acres of land. But now, the proposal is to expand it to 100-120 acres, according to Hindustan. Once the final design of the temple is ready, a new masterplan will be prepared within 15 days, Hindustan reported.It further quoted Sompura to say that the cost of construction was Rs 100 crore according to the current design. But if the design is changed, the cost will increase.He also made it clear that there won’t be any change in the inner sanctum of the temple. Sita Rasoi, Rangmandapam and other places have not been changed. Though the height of the proposed temple has been increased, Sompura said it won’t be the tallest temple in the country.Since there is a proposal to incrase the height of the temple, it will take more construction time, said Sompura. The temple is expected to be complete in three to 3.5 years.Ram Janmabhoomi Tirth Kshetra Trust general secretary Champat Rai said, “Drawing of temple’s foundation will be made on basis of the strength of soil 60 m below. Work to lay down the foundation will begin on the basis of the drawing.”He said that at Saturday’s meeting, it was decided to approach 10 crore families across four lakh localities of the country for financial support to build the temple after the monsoon and when the coronavirus situation eases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-temple-s-height-to-be-increased-more-domes-added-key-changes-discussed-at-ayodhya-meeting/story-kEC6ePOfWFJFu0WscJDsGJ.html

It also said that the situation is pretty bad in the country.The number of Covid-19 positive cases has crossed a million mark, making India the third country after United States and Brazil to reach this grim milestone.“This is now an exponential growth. Every day the number of cases is increasing by more than around 30,000. This is really a bad situation for the country,” Dr VK Monga, the Chairman of IMA Hospital Board of India, told news agency ANI.WHO reports record daily increase in global Covid-19 cases for second day in a rowHe further said that the disease is sreading to the rural areas. “This is a bad sign. It now shows a community spread,” said Dr Monga.The first to sound this alarm was Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan who had said on Friday that there is a community spread in some places in coastal areas of Thiruvananthapuram district.The two hamlets identified by Vijayan are Poonthura and Pulluvila, which have seen a rapid increase in the number of contact cases.The district’s coastal area, stretching from Edava in the north to Pozhiyoor in the south, has been declared as Critical Containment Zone (CCZ) and will be under complete and strict lockdown from Saturday midnight to July 28 midnight, an order from the district Collector Dr Navjot Khosa said.Texas coronavirus cases include more than 80 infantsDr Monga said the cases are penetrating down into towns and villages where it will be very difficult to control the situation. “In Delhi, we were able to contain it, but what about interior parts of the country in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Goa, Madhya Pradesh?”There are concerns in states like Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal but the respective state governments have maintained that community spread has not started.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), meanwhile, said that it is ramping up testing facilities regularly. At present, 885 government laboratories and 368 private laboratory chains are conducting Covid-19 tests across the country.As many as 1,34,33,742 samples have been tested for Covid-19 till July 17.

19-07-2020||India||Long-billed Dowitcher sighted in Sonipat||Gurugram: A rare sighting of a long-billed dowitcher at Mohammedabad village in Sonipat has triggered excitement among birders in Delhi-NCR, with experts saying this is the first sighting of the bird in the region since it was last seen at the Sultanpur National Park in 2013.Suresh Sharma, a veteran birder from Sonipat, spotted the long-billed dowitcher on Friday afternoon in a paddy field. “I saw the bird and took a photograph, realising that it didn’t look like any of the other birds in the marsh. I initially thought it was an Asian dowitcher, but closer scrutiny showed that it was actually a long-billed dowitcher,” Sharma said, adding that the bird was in its brighter, breeding plumage. Breeding adults of the species are known to have orange undersides, with varying black and white stripes around their necks and sides.Nikhil Devasar, a Delhi-based birder, explained that the long-billed dowitcher is a coastal bird that breeds in Central Asia before moving toward the tropics for the winter. “Shorelines are the bird’s natural habitat. The specimen Sharma spotted on Friday is likely a vagrant, as it is rarely seen in the plains. The last sighting in Delhi-NCR is from at least five or six years ago,” he said.The bird’s affinity for a shoreline habitat, birders said, is the reason for multiple sightings in India’s coastal states Kerala, Maharashtra and Gujarat, though it has also been previously seen in Punjab’s Harike region. Describing the sighting as a “lucky find”, Sharma said: “I don’t think I would have spotted the bird if it wasn’t for the rains. A downpour in Sonipat on Saturday has submerged a paddy field, creating the right marshy habitat that dowitchers prefer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/long-billed-dowitcher-sighted-in-sonipat/story-vq3wV7FZaoj15U97JAk5rO.html

Over 68 lives lost and 3.6 million people affected in Assam alone. I appeal to all Indians, to come together, join in the efforts to help support those affected in these extreme flood situations,” Pilot’s tweet read.Pilot’s tweet has come amid the ongoing political drama in Rajasthan, in which the ruling Congress has accused the BJP of horse-trading in an attempt to topple the Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot government.BJP, on the other hand, has raised questions over tapping of phones in Rajasthan saying that authorities have denied giving permission and asked if it was not a violation of civil rights of people to tap phones without authorisation. It also said that if Chief Minister Gehlot thinks he has a majority, he should prove it in the Assembly.At least 79 people have lost their lives in Assam due to severe flooding, informed the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) on Saturday.A Flood Report issued by the ASDMA stated that the river Brahmaputra was flowing above danger level in several places in the state, and a total of 26 districts have been affected so far.

19-07-2020||India||6 terrorists killed in Jammu and Kashmir in 24 hours||Three unidentified terrorists were killed in an encounter in south Kashmir’s Shopian district on Saturday morning, an official said after the second such operation in the past 24 hours.A day after the killing of three Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorists in Kulgam, security forces acted on information about the presence of terrorists in Amshipora village and launched an operation, officials said. The terrorists fired upon the forces, drawing retaliation.An official said the operation was jointly conducted by the army, police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). “As the search-and-cordon operation was underway, it turned into an encounter...three unidentified militants were killed. The militants fired from a cowshed of a house located in an orchard,’’ an army spokesperson said.Officials said they are trying to identify the terrorists and DNA samples have already been collected. Three JeM terrorists, including a Pakistani commander identified as Waleed, were killed in Kulgam district on Friday. Police said Waleed, believed to be an IED expert, had been active in the area for the past 18 months. In the last three months, due to Covid-19, bodies of terrorists killed in gun battles, including that of locals, are not handed over to their family members. They are buried in Baramulla, Kupwara and Ganderbal in the presence of family members.Security forces have stepped up offensive against terrorists in the Kashmir Valley. In June, forces killed 48 terrorists in various encounters; most of them in south Kashmir. Since January, 136 militants have been killed in different encounters across Kashmir. The J&K Police neutralised 162 terrorists in 2019.Among the major successes of security forces this year is the killing of Riyaz Naikoo, a top commander of local group Hizbul Mujahideen, in an operation in Beighpora in May. Top police officials say fresh recruitment by terrorists has come down in the first six months of the year.India protests civilian deaths India on Saturday summoned the charge d’affaires of the Pakistan high commission to lodge a strong protest over the death of three civilians in firing by Pakistani troops along LoC. The Pakistani charge d’affaires was told three civilians, including a child, were killed and another child was injured in an unprovoked ceasefire violation by Pakistani forces in Krishna Ghati sector in Jammu and Kashmir on Friday night. The dead belonged to the same family.“India condemns, in the strongest terms, the deliberate targeting of innocent civilians by Pakistan forces,” the statement said. It called upon Pakistan to adhere to the 2003 ceasefire for maintaining peace and tranquillity along the LoC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-terrorists-killed-in-jammu-and-kashmir-in-24-hours/story-xdiLUU1GwuQQ3AG4He596N.html

The government is not allowing gathering of more than 50 people in view of the pandemic but no such rule is followed here,” BJP state president Satish Poonia said.“There is no governance in the state now. People are looking at the ministers (for relief), but they are busy in the luxury hotel,” he said. The MLAs were shifted to the five-star hotel on the Delhi Highway in Jaipur following a meeting of the Congress Legislature Party at chief minister’s residence on Monday. Sachin Pilot and 18 other MLAs have rebelled against the Ashok Gehlot government. The Congress has sacked Pilot, Vishvenda Singh and Ramesh Meena from the Gehlot cabinet and suspended the party membership of two MLAs -- Vishvendra Singh and Bhanwarlal Sharma -- for their alleged involvement in the “conspiracy to topple the government”. After notices of disqualification were issued to them by the Assembly speaker on the basis of a complaint by government chief whip Mahesh Joshi, 19 MLAs, including Pilot, moved a writ petition in the high court challenging the notices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cooking-tips-yoga-keep-ashok-gehlot-s-mlas-busy-at-rajasthan-hotel/story-XEuCp5rFQdHZMmGCOV6g5J.html

19-07-2020||India||Three held for assault on officer in Shahdara||Three members of a family, including a father-son duo, from Shahdara were arrested late Friday night for allegedly thrashing a Delhi police constable who asked them to return to their house and follow social distancing. The constable was on patrol duty in the area. Senior officers said two of the arrested men also have a previous criminal record of molestation and assault. A fourth family member who was also involved in the altercation fled, police said.According to the police, around 9pm Friday, constable Pradeep was on duty with head constable Akash (both known only by their first names). A senior police officer said that when the two policemen neared the rear of Rahman building in Shahdara, they noticed that a group of people gathered there.“Constable Pradeep asked the group the reason for gathering and requested them to disperse. Because head constable Akash was still a few paces behind Pradeep, the group of men ignored him. When Pradeep threatened them with legal action, they started abusing him. Some of the men surrounded and thrashed him. They even tore his uniform,” the officer said.Akash jumped into the fray and both of them nabbed three of the group, while one fled. “We identified the men caught as Arun Singh, a driver, his father Raghuvir Ram and uncle Ram Pal. Arun’s brother Vishal Singh, also a driver, ran from the spot and efforts to arrest him are underway,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-held-for-assault-on-officer-in-shahdara/story-9BXi4xdkWA2WgVxje5omUP.html

19-07-2020||India||BJP demands CBI probe into Rajasthan phone tap||Two days after the Congress party alleged that it has audio tapes purportedly containing conversations detailing a plot to topple the Rajasthan government, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) demanded on Saturday a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into what it called a “saga of illegalities and concocted lies” and wondered whether the state adopted “unconstitutional” methods to tap into the phones of politicians.The Congress, which rules the desert state, hit back within hours, saying the BJP’s demand for a CBI probe amounted to “admission of guilt” and that it is attempting to “murder” the democracy. It reiterated that the BJP is behind former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot’s rebellion that has triggered a political crisis in the state. Also read: Audio tapes of ‘talks to topple Ashok Gehlot govt’ add to Rajasthan turmoilLater in the day, the ministry of home affairs sought a report from the Rajasthan chief secretary Rajeeva Swaroop on the allegations of phone tapping and asked him to provide details on the audio clips, an official said. At a press conference at the BJP headquarters in Delhi, party spokesperson Sambit Patra threw a volley of questions at the Congress. “Was phone tapping done? The Congress government in Rajasthan must answer. Is it not a sensitive and legal issue..?” he said.“Assuming that you’ve tapped phones, was the SOP [standard operating procedures] followed? The people of Rajasthan want to know whether their privacy has been compromised. Did the Congress government in Rajasthan use unconstitutional ways to save themselves when they found themselves cornered? Is phone of any person who is related to politics is being tapped?” Patra asked.The political tug of war intensified after the Special Operations Group (SOG) of the Rajasthan Police registered two first information reports (FIRs) on Friday on a Congress complaint alleging a conspiracy to dislodge the government. The Congress demanded the arrest of Union water minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, rebel Congress legislator Bhanwarlal Sharma, and suspected middleman Sanjay Jain. Shekhawat denied it was his voice in the audio clips and the BJP dismissed them as “manufactured”. Also read: BJP refutes Congress’ claim of horse trading in Rajasthan, says audio tapes are fakeA court in Jaipur remanded Jain, who was arrested on Friday night, to four-day police custody. The SOG also filed an application seeking his voice samples. The team said it could not locate MLA Sharma. Like Shekhawat, Sharma too rejected the allegations. HT couldn’t independently verify the veracity of the tapes.At the press briefing, Patra reiterated that there is a feud within the Congress party, but the BJP is blamed for Rajasthan’s political crisis that erupted after Pilot and 18 Congress legislators owing allegiance to him rebelled against chief minister Ashok Gehlot. Pilot was removed from the posts of the deputy chief minister and the state Congress president earlier this week.Separately, former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje said it is unfortunate that the state’s people are paying for the discord within the Congress. She added that the Congress is trying to shift the blame on the BJP and the BJP leadership.“There is no point in trying to drag the BJP and BJP leaders’ names through the mud. It is the interest of our people that must remain paramount!” Raje said in a statement posted on Twitter.Hitting back, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera told a virtual press conference that it is clear that the BJP is behind the rebellion by Pilot, whose camp is also believed to have the support of three independent legislators.“We all witnessed over the last week the daylight murder of democracy being attempted by the BJP, and every day a new layer comes out, exposing its direct links in creating a crisis in Rajasthan,” he alleged.“BJP’s only grievance is that when they were murdering democracy, why they were being recorded and if it was legal,” Khera said, in a swift response to Patra.That the rebel legislators were sheltered in a hotel in BJP-ruled Haryana proved the party’s link to the Rajasthan political crisis, Khera said. He also referred to the controversial audio tapes. “Everything is out there. A case was filed based on those recordings. The SOG of Rajasthan Police proceeded to Manesar to collect the voice samples of legislators [on Friday], but was blocked by Haryana police...then the legislators were made to leave quietly from the back door,” he added.Khera alleged that there were attempts to shift rebel Congress legislators to Karnataka, another BJP-ruled state.The state Congress leadership, too, claimed the BJP’s involvement in alleged attempts to topple the state government, and sought a reply from Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Countering Patra, Rajasthan minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas accused him of being “a generator of lies”. “This is clear that BJP is involved in the conspiracy to topple the government. Our chief minister has said that he will quit politics if the audio tapes are proved to be fake..,” he said.Amid the political tussle, Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayawati said: “The governor [Kalraj Mishra] must take cognisance of the political deadlock and instability prevailing in Rajasthan, and should recommend imposition of President’s Rule in the state, so that the condition of democracy in the state does not deteriorate.”(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-demands-cbi-probe-into-rajasthan-phone-tap/story-YsxCwXZ3gam7oPxfQKIajI.html
19-07-2020||India||BJP leader shares dais with Bulandshahr violence accused||The photograph of a person — named in the violence that erupted after rumours of cow slaughter in Uttar Pradesh’s Bulandshahr in 2018 — with a local leader of the state’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has triggered a controversy.Shikhar Agarwal, the accused and a former leader of the BJP’s youth wing Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, has also been appointed the general secretary of the Bulandshahr unit of PM Jankalyankari Yojna Jagrukta Abhiyan (PMJYJA), a non-governmental organisation that works to spreads awareness about welfare schemes of the BJP-led Union government, according to the Opposition. Agarwal, 40, is one of the main accused in the Bulandshahr violence that led to the killing of inspector Subodh Kumar Singh by a mob. As many as 26 named and 60 unnamed persons were booked in the case. Agarwal was released last August after spending seven months in jail.BJP leaders in Bulandshahr have distanced themselves from Agarwal’s appointment. “PMJYJA is an NGO, which has no connection with the BJP...being an independent organisation, they can take their decisions,” said Sanjay Gurjar, general secretary of the BJP’s Bulandshahr district unit.Agarwal has been allegedly pictured with Bulandshahr BJP district unit chief Anil Sisodia on July 14 at an event in which new committee officials, including Agarwal, were handed out appointment letters. HT tried to reach out to PMJYJA’s district president Priytam Singh Prem and western UP president Yatendra Kumar Sain, but there was no response till the filing of this report.Congress leader Imran Masood said: “The appointment of Bulandshahar violence accused Shikhar Agarwal as general secretary of PMJYJA is an attempt to glorify an accused, which is unfortunate...”Violence erupted outside the Chingrawthi police post in Bulandshahr after an alleged incident of cow slaughter in Mahav village early December 2018. Sumit, a resident of Chnigrawthi, was killed in alleged police firing, and inspector Singh of Syana police station was allegedly shot dead. Villagers also set a police post on fire and torched vehicles. A special investigation team was formed to probe the incident and it arrested people by identifying them through available videos and photographs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leader-shares-dais-with-bulandshahr-violence-accused/story-8avE9TTeyPC1j4O79Q3rVK.html
19-07-2020||India||Multiple locations raided in gold smuggling case||The multi- agency team probing the Kerala gold smuggling case on Saturday raided multiple locations in the state and detained many for questioning, a senior officer familiar with the probe said on Saturday, adding the scope of the inquiry will be widened.“Without strong patronage such a thriving syndicate can’t function in the state. Our inquiry will cover terror angle, hawala and political and bureaucratic patronage also. This time we will get to the bottom of the racket,” said the official.The opposition parties in the state slammed the Left Democratic Front government in the state. The BJP said that the chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan was taking anticipatory bail since the probe reached his doors. “Role of two high-ranking officials in the CM’s office, his former secretary M Sivasankar and former IT fellow Arun Balachandran, are out. Now the CM can’t wash off his hands,” said Bharatiya Janata Party state president K Surendran. The state government suspended Sivasankar and Balachandran was also removed from his post as CM’s IT fellow earlier this week.Kerala Congress chief Mullapally Ramachandran also said, “Since powerful aides have gone it time for him to follow.” Facing heat from the opposition parties over the case, Vijayan said, “We have nothing to fear. Let the guilty be punished. Some people are in a race to arrive at a conclusion but their designs will be short-lived,” adding that there was a concerted bid to tarnish the image of the state government. The customs had seized 30 kg gold from a baggage addressed to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on July 5. On July 10, the probe was handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and many other central agencies are assisting it. It filed a First Information Report against four-- P Sarith Kumar , Swapna Suresh, Sandeep Nair and Fazil Fareed, an alleged smuggler from Ernakulum but based in the UAE . On July 15, it added one more name to the FIR: an alleged gold smuggler named KT Ramees.The NIA has so far arrested four people -- Kumar, Suresh, Nair and Ramees-- under sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act while the customs department has arrested 10 persons , the official said adding Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Enforcement Directorate, Intelligence Bureau and Income Tax are part of the ongoing investigation.The NIA on Saturday requested Interpol to issue a blue corner notice against Faisal Fareed, another accused in the high-profile case. Meanwhile, a magistrate took the statement of the gunman of the UAE consulate who was found with his wrist slashed on Friday. But the customs suspect that his suicide bid was aimed at covering up his alleged link with the gold smuggling racket. A senior official of the customs said he will be questioned after his discharge from the hospital and his bank accounts and other details are under scrutiny now.He was working at the consular office for last three years and before this he was posted at the immigration department in Thiruvananthapuram airport. In the leaked call details of Swapna Suresh, second accused in the case, there were many calls to him. The state police had filed a cheating case against Suresh, PricewaterHouseCoopers (PwC) and a placement agency Vision Technology on July 13. During investigation it was found that Suresh had produced a fake degree certificate to secure at job at the Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited, a state government undertaking. PwC and Vision Technology were authorised agencies responsible for verifying her educational documents, said the police. The case was registered under IPC sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating) 465 forgery and 471 (using as genuine a forged document).When the case surfaced the PwC had distanced itself from Swapna Suresh’s appointment saying that they were no way related to her appointment.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/multiple-locations-raided-in-gold-smuggling-case/story-RAcKjuCtkyB89RBDbDaGfI.html
19-07-2020||India||Heavy rainfall may trigger landslides in northeast, Bengal||Extremely heavy rains in the northeast could accentuate existing flood conditions and lead to landslides in some areas of the north-eastern states and sub-Himalayan West Bengal, India Meteorological Department said on Saturday.The met department has issued a red category warning for most of northeast including Assam and Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and sub Himalayan West Bengal on July 19, 20 and 21 and an orange category warning for entire north and northwest India including Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Uttarakhand for the same period. Red category warning indicates that local and disaster control authorities take action to prevent any flooding or landslide disasters. An orange category warning indicates that disaster management and local authorities should prepare for disaster control.“We have started impact based warnings for 12 cities in India including Delhi, Mumbai, Shimla, Dehradun, Shillong, Guwahati and others. When we have a consensus on the likely impact, we issue an impact-based warning. For example, in the northeast particularly Assam, the rivers are already overflowing so landslides and flooding is likely based on our assessments. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has been emphasising that we alert people on the weather will do. The assessment is based on a multi hazard approach,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.According to WMO’s guidelines on multi-hazard impact based forecast, for impact forecast exposure is considered along with the hazard and vulnerability. These types of forecasts and warnings are designed to provide detailed information precisely on who or what is exposed. Jenamani gives the example of UK Met Office which uses past data of 30 years on natural calamities to issue impact based warnings.IMD for the first time this month has started issuing impact-based warning in its daily bulletins so that common people understand the significance of a particular weather forecast and take precautions accordingly. Earlier this month when Mumbai faced extremely heavy rains, IMD had warned of localised flooding; disruption of traffic and utilities. On Saturday, IMD warned of landslides in upper reaches and flooding as the impact of extremely heavy rains in the northeast.IMD in its Saturday bulletin said western part of monsoon trough lies south of its normal position and a cyclonic circulation lies over coastal Saurashtra and neighbourhood. This cyclonic circulation is likely to become less marked during next 24 hours. At the same time, the entire monsoon trough (line of low pressure) is also most likely to shift northwards closer to the foothills of the Himalayas between July 19 and 20. In addition, Interaction between mid-level westerlies and lower level easterlies from the Arabian Sea over northwest India is very likely to start from July 18. Convergence of moist southerly/southwesterly winds from Bay of Bengal over northeast and adjoining east India will also begin from Saturday. The combination of these factors will bring widespread rains to northeast and parts of northwest India, IMD said.“Brahmaputra in Jorhat and Sonitpur districts and River Beki in Barpeta district are flowing in Severe flood situation with rising trend. Since most of the catchments in northeast India, Sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim are already saturated there is likelihood of continuation of floods in Severe to Extreme levels for the next 3-4 days. Maximum vigil has to be maintained along the banks of all rivers,” the Central Water Commission warned on Friday.Monsoon rains in the country are 8% excess as on Saturday; 11% excess over east and northeast India; -17% deficiency over northwest India; 14% excess over central India; 17% excess over south Peninsular India.“Its very good news that IMD has started issuing impact based forecasts. Until now their forecasts were based on meteorological parameters in terms of say how much it’s going to rain or how hot it may be. But now impact based forecast will consider local infrastructure and impact on people,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-rainfall-may-trigger-landslides-in-n-e-bengal/story-fFbQEdhvNK388NjtXTDYdM.html

Politicians, former police officers, and rights groups have demanded a probe into Dubey’s killing, saying the police version of what happened did not add up. Five people linked to Dubey were killed between July 3 and July 9.The officials said senior analyst AK Srivastava headed the experts’ team, whose reconstruction lasted till Saturday evening. A Special Task Force (STF) team, led by its Kanpur unit chief Tej Bahadur Singh, accompanied the experts. Singh and his team demonstrated how Dubey fled after the vehicle carrying him skidded and how he was chased, they added.The officials said the experts were shown the positions the policemen took after spotting Dubey in Sachendi and Mishra in Bhauti. Singh showed the experts how he fired at Dubey and how he fell, they added.Prabhat Mishra, who was one of 22 accused in the Kanpur shoot-out, was arrested from Faridabad before he was killed. Srivastava, who is ballistics experts, told reporters the crime scenes were re-created scientifically to verify the details mentioned in two FIRs the STF has filed and evidence available. “Our local units have already done the groundwork earlier.

A large number of best universities across the world, including [in the] US, UK, Canada, Germany, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong..., have conducted or are conducting examinations by giving various options such as online, offline, blended or other alternative forms of examinations,” UGC secretary Rajnish Jain said in a statement.The statement comes even as states like Punjab, Maharashtra, and Delhi had expressed their inability in conducting the exams in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Institutions like the Delhi University have tried to conduct exams but have faced opposition from students and parents with some citing digital divide in case of online tests.UGC, the higher education regulator, on July 6 asked universities and colleges to hold their final-year, or final-semester examinations, by September 30 after the Union home ministry gave the go-ahead for them.The statement cited the pandemic and said it was difficult to conduct the examinations in July. Therefore, as per the directions of the Union home and human resources development ministers as well as recommendations from an expert panel, UGC issued the revised guidelines for examination and academic calendar on July 6, the statement added.The statement said the universities were accordingly required to chart out plans for completion of the examinations by the end of September.The examinations can be held either online, or offline (pen and paper), or using a combination of both. For students other than those in the final year, universities and colleges can choose their own exam method to close the academic session. Colleges and universities have been closed in the country since March 16 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The guidelines said in case students are unable to appear in the examinations for whatsoever the reasons, they may be given an opportunity to appear in special exams later.The statement said UGC has got responses from 755 universities, including 321 state Universities, on the status of exams and 560 of them have either conducted the examination or are planning to hold them. It said 194 of them have held examinations and 366 are planning to conduct them in August and September. In the case of 27 private universities set up in 2019-20, they do not have final year students yet and do not have to hold the exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exams-contribute-to-lifelong-credibility-ugc/story-iRbRlPpPME51eZy0qg3oEI.html
19-07-2020||India||Old coronavirus infections may boost Covid-19 immunity: Study||Some people who have never been exposed to the new coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 may have an immune system prepared to respond to it because of previous infections from other coronaviruses, according to a new study that can potentially offer clues to building immunity against Covid-19.Published in the journal Nature on July 15, the study by researchers from Singapore reports some people have T-cells that recognise both proteins on the virus called structural or nucleocapsid protein, and non-structural viral proteins (NSP) produced within an infected cell. T-cells are a type of white blood cell that recognise infections within a cell and kill it.“We characterised Sars-CoV2 specific T-cells in Covid-19 and Sars (the 2003 outbreak) convalescents and uninfected healthy individuals,” said study co-author Dr Antonio Bertolleti, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at Duke-Nus Medical School in Singapore, in an email. Those who recovered from Covid-19 had T-cells that recognised structural proteins more efficiently than NSPs. Additionally, those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which is also caused by a coronavirus, 17 years ago also had T-cells that reacted to these proteins, suggesting induced cross reactive cellular immunity. Also read | Chronic liver disease can add risk of death: Study“In our study, more than 50% of (37) uninfected healthy individuals demonstrate the presence of Sars-CoV2 specific T cells. Importantly, these T cells recognize more frequently sequences of non-structural proteins found only in animal coronaviruses. Thus, a large part of the population possess Sars-Cov2-specific T cells, likely induced by other coronaviruses,” said Dr Bertoletti. “One possible implication of our findings is that many subjects might have a level of progress T-cell reactivity that might partially protect them.”Experts, however, say the results are not surprising. “On average, 20% of the common cold is because of coronaviruses already endemic in the human population. Sars-CoV-2 shares about 80% sequence identity with Sars-CoV-1 and 50% with other coronaviruses. So there are proteins made by all of these viruses that have common sequences,” said Shahid Jameel, virologist and CEO of Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance. The Sars outbreak in 2003 largely spared India but more research is needed. “There may have been coronaviruses, maybe innocuous, in the past in the country, but we don’t have research. I have been asking those searching for IgG (antibodies) as to how do they know if it is of Sars-CoV-2 and not of any other coronavirus in the background?” said Sudhanshu Vrati, executive director of the regional centre for biotechnology, Faridabad.Also read: India added last quarter million Covid-19 cases in just 8 days, 3 states added 55.7% patientsThe study has implications on vaccine development. “People who are given inactivated virus vaccines that have fewer viral proteins, are more likely to generate neutralising antibodies and some T-cell response. T-cell response is higher and longer if you use the live virus vaccine. But it is difficult to make a live vaccine,” said Vrati.Noted drug developer Derek Lowe, who reviewed the paper, said vaccine development may have to be driven by T-cell immunity. “(It) is perhaps the way to reconcile the apparent paradox between (1) antibody responses that seem to be dropping week by week in convalescent patients but (2) few (if any) reliable reports of actual re-infection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/old-coronavirus-infections-may-boost-covid-19-immunity-study/story-qt3NBea456RJR1Dcf05x5M.html
19-07-2020||India||Chronic liver disease can add risk of death in Covid-19 patients: Study||Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients with chronic liver conditions such as hepatitis B or C and fatty liver have higher chances of death and prolonged stay in intensive care units, found the Asia Pacific Covid-19 Liver Injury Spectrum Study conducted across 13 countries, including India. Forty-three percent of those who were in the advanced stages of the disease with cirrhosis or scarring due to the ailments died of Covid-19, according to the study recently published in the Hepatology International. This is much higher than the 3 to 5% mortality rate in the general population.Among those with liver disease, the mortality was nearly twice among those with cirrhosis as compared to those without cirrhosis – 33% against 16.3%. About 20% of those with cirrhosis went into liver failure, according to the study.Also read: India added last quarter million Covid-19 cases in just 8 days, 3 states added 55.7% patients“We found that if the bilirubin count is high meaning a patient is jaundiced then they have high mortality. Hence, the treating physicians must account for underlying liver disease other than conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer and heart disease. And, monitor the liver enzymes closely,” said lead author Dr Shiv Sarin, director of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences in Delhi.“Also, the liver enzymes must be checked routinely for Covid-19 patients as many with chronic liver disease are unaware of it. The doctors must watch out for risk factors like obesity, diabetes, gall stones, high triglycerides and alcohol consumption given the high prevalence of metabolism related fatty liver disease – about one in four people in the country has it,” said Dr Sarin.The study which observed the health and mortality in 228 patients with chronic liver diseases over 28 days, also found that these patients are at an increased risk of acute liver injury when they get Covid-19. The observation of the patient records showed that those without cirrhosis or scarring developed acute liver injury in the second week or early third week of the infection, but in the first week itself in cirrhotic patients.Over 32% of the patients with cirrhosis had acute liver injury with Covid-19 as compared to 5.7% to 18% patients without cirrhosis. Along with the liver diseases, diabetes emerged to be one of the main risk factors for developing the liver injury – with 57.7% diabetics getting acute liver injury as compared to 39.7% of those without diabetes.Also read: COVID-19 Statistics for IndiaComplications of the liver and otherwise in Covid-19 patients with chronic liver disease resulted in longer ICU stay, the study found.“Although the liver has ACE2 receptors that are used by the Sars-Cov-2 to enter the cells, the study shows that those with healthy livers are likely to get away with minor changes in their liver enzymes. However, in those already with chronic liver disease, it worsens with about 20% of those with cirrhosis ending up in liver failure,” said Dr AS Soin, one of the co-authors and chairman of the Liver Institute at Medanta hospital in Gurugram.A strict monitoring of the liver parameters could help the doctors in understanding who is progressing towards the severe disease. It showed that the non-survivors had a high liver enzyme ratio of above 1.4 and the bilirubin level remained elevated at more than 9 mg/dl till death in non-survivors, the study showed.While the true burden of liver disease is not known, the study says it accounts for 4.6% of all deaths.“Those who have advanced liver disease and are in need of transplants must not delay it. As the study shows the mortality is extremely high – 43% -- among these patients. Initially, many thought that the infection would go away in a couple of months and had recommended delaying transplants. But, as the study shows, it could be life-saving in such patients. In fact, data from the Asia Pacific Association for the study of the Liver that did the trial and two other registries of liver patients shows that the mortality among those who have undergone transplants is just slightly higher than the general population,” said Dr Soin.“What we have learnt is the dosage of immunosupressants needs to be tapered down in those who get the infection early post transplant; nothing needs to be done who get it months or years after the transplant. All seven of my transplant patients who got it months to years after their transplant and two who got it right after the transplant survived,” he added.Dr Sanjay Negi, liver transplant surgeon at BL Kapur hospital, Delhi, said “Just as this study shows, it is very important to monitor the liver enzymes in Covid-19 patients. This is especially true because liver is the only organ that can regenerate after an injury so patients do not show symptoms of a liver disease till the liver is about 80% damaged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chronic-liver-disease-can-add-risk-of-death-study/story-EmPEA8U9odaruYDZvH6j6H.html
19-07-2020||India||Haven’t spoken to Sachin Pilot in 18 months: Ashok Gehlot||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot has accused Sachin Pilot of plotting to topple his government from day one and said he was not on talking terms with his former deputy since the Congress returned to power in the state 18 months back. He maintained he will welcome Pilot with open arms if he chose to return. “He was three-year-old when I became MP [member of Parliament] for the first time. I have ties with his family going back decades. I will welcome him with a hug.”Gehlot said there was no dialogue between them over the last year and a half. “A minister who does not talk to the chief minister, does not take his advice, keeps no dialogue with him... There can be opposition but the dialogue is necessary for a democracy,” he said in an interview to a TV channel.Gehlot said Pilot initially wanted to join the BJP but the lawmakers loyal to him were unwilling to do so. He added that is when he thought of forming a third front, a new party, and “finish the Congress in Rajasthan”.Gehlot maintained he has the support of over 100 lawmakers in the 200-member Rajasthan assembly while Pilot has just 2-15 with him. “My government is sitting with over 100 MLAs [members of the legislative assembly] but you want to topple that and want to form a government with the support of the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party]. People will never forgive you,” Gehlot said.He called the entire matter unfortunate and added the internal quarrel should have been resolved internally. “If you do politics in connivance with your rivals, then what is left in a democracy?”The Rajasthan police’s Special Operations Group (SOG) on July 11 issued a notice to Pilot to record his statement a day after it registered a case against two BJP members for allegedly trying to bribe legislators to topple the state government. The notice triggered the ongoing political crisis with Pilot calling it Gehlot’s attempt to “humiliate” him.Gehlot said 10 to 12 notices, including one to him, were served but an environment was being created that “poor Pilot” has got a notice. “Our party is the complainant and 10-12 notices have been served. We have not named him. We have said there was a conspiracy by the BJP to topple the government. Why is he going around giving clarifications?” asked Gehlot.Gehlot said Pilot and lawmakers loyal to him planned to rebel on June 10. He added he learnt about their plan, thwarted it, and kept all the lawmakers at a resort. “They were planning to leave at 2 am. I had to save the government. I woke up all collectors at 1 am and I asked all party leaders to reach Jaipur the next day and almost all of them reached. Then these people realised the truth and started saying there was no conspiracy and there was no need for placing MLAs under lockdown. But I had proof then and I have proof now.”He asked the younger leaders to show patience and trust their leaders. “You should not betray the party. The party has given you so much.”Gehlot said he has been a three-time central minister, three-time state party chief, three-time Congress general secretary, and three-time chief minister because he rose through the ranks. “Our generation leaders worked hard and stayed loyal to the party and its ideology and so we are where we are today.”Gehlot said he became the chief minister because people wanted it and eventually the Congress high command backed him. “If I had felt that the public and MLAs were not with me, I would have myself told the high command.”He called the suggestions that the seniors should retire irrelevant. “We too were juniors when we joined and we are still active today. Now people say they should sit at home. If we leave politics, what will we do?” Gehlot said he supports Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s statement that those who want to leave are welcome to go. “Those who want to leave should leave. Those who do not have a commitment towards the party... they are liabilities who are just waiting to grab posts... those who are committed do not get a chance. Those who are opportunists and traitors, if they leave then a new form of the party will come forth.”He rejected suggestions that the departure of leaders perceived to be close to Gandhi put a question mark on the latter’s leadership. “There is no question mark on his leadership but on the thought process of these leaders [who have left].”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haven-t-spoken-to-pilot-in-18-months-gehlot/story-yZbHcbeAnxhTTGd8l8qajK.html
19-07-2020||India||India begins study on BCG vaccine impact on Covid-19||The Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (ICMR-NIRT) has initiated a multi-centric study to see if tuberculosis vaccine, Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG), can reduce the severity of Covid-19 among people aged 60 and above residing in hot spots for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, said the Union health ministry release issued on Saturday.The study will involve around 1,000 healthy volunteers above 60 years of age in six states that have reported a high Covid-19 disease burden so far. “A lot is being talked about the protective effect of BCG vaccine in terms of Covid-19. This study was in the pipeline for some time and now we have begun the process. It is being done to generate India-specific evidence,” said an ICMR official, who did not wish to be identified.Also read| Old coronavirus infections may boost Covid-19 immunity: StudyThe inexpensive and widely used BCG vaccine, which protects against childhood tuberculosis, could also prevent severe infection and deaths in some Covid-19 patients, concluded two peer-reviewed studies released recently. One of the studies was led by researchers from New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). The second study conducted in the US was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It also linked BCG vaccination with reduced Covid-19 deaths.Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Delhi are the states where the ICMR-NIRT study has been planned, and where the trial subjects will be picked from. The study will be done in collaboration with the Greater Chennai Corporation and the public health department In Tamil Nadu.The study will focus on whether the BCG vaccine can prevent the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its progression and deaths associated with Covid-19 in the elderly population. The BCG vaccine administered to newborns as a part of the national immunisation programme for over 50 years in the country will be used for the study.Preset criteria will decide the eligibility of a volunteer to participate in the study and the approximately 1,000 participants enrolled for it will be followed closely for six months post-vaccination.Also read: Centre frames rules for Covid care centres in gated colonies“Those who got BCG vaccination, not just in India but in other countries, are more protected than those who were not [vaccinated], shows this analysis of data for countries with over 1,000 reported cases. We think BCG-mediated immune response would help in lowering both incidence and severity of infection,” said Gobardhan Das, the author of the JNU study. Das is the chairperson of JNU’s Centre for Molecular Medicine.Around 100 million children around the world get the BCG vaccine annually. In India, BCG vaccination of children began in 1949. The vaccine protects against disseminated tuberculosis and meningitis in childhood. But it does not offer protection from adult pulmonary tuberculosis, which has led to several countries discontinuing its use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-begins-study-on-bcg-vaccine-impact-on-covid-19/story-UG70g0qxgu6dp7XWiEVbiN.html
19-07-2020||India||Ashok Gehlot meets governor, sparks speculation; Raj Bhavan terms it courtesy call||Amidst a political tug of war in the state, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot called on governor Kalraj Mishra on Saturday evening in what the Raj Bhavan termed a courtesy call. But a government official, who did not want to be named said, Gehlot apart from discussing the coronavirus disease outbreak and the state’s efforts to contain it, also wanted to take up the possibility of holding a special assembly session in the 45-minute meeting.The official privy to the CM’s meeting with governor said Gehlot apprised Mishra of the current political situation. The agenda of the special session, if it happens, is not known, the official said. As per rules, the governor has to notify holding of the session on the recommendation of the cabinet.The meeting comes on the day two Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) MLAs said they will back Gehlot in the power tussle with former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, who has rebelled with 18 Congress legislators. The Pilot camp also has the support of three independents. These MLAs are believed to be camping in Gurugram.Gehlot, on the other hand, has the support of 101 MLAs (86 from the Congress, 10 independent and 5 from other parties) — the majority mark in the 200-member state assembly. The CM’s supporters are in a hotel on the outskirts of Jaipur. In addition to this, there are two other Congress MLAs — speaker CP Joshi and Bhawarlal Meghwal, who is indisposed.The meeting also comes at a time when the Rajasthan high court is hearing a petition by the Pilot camp, which has challenged the Speaker’s disqualification notices to the dissidents. Pilot and 18 other rebel Congress MLAs got a four-day breather on Friday as the HC directed that no action be taken against them until Tuesday over their failure to attend a Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting.Political analyst Narayan Bareth said the meeting could give a signal to people and Gehlot’s opponents that the CM is confident about his numbers and wants to seek a trust vote. “The meeting indicates that an assembly session might be called to deal with the issue...which could later change in to a floor test. It looks like a strategic move,” he said.The petition by the Pilot camp challenged the speaker’s notice, which was based on a complaint by Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi, that the rebel MLAs should be disqualified from the assembly for defying an order asking all party legislators to be present at CLP meetings on Monday and Tuesday. All 19 MLAs skipped both the meetings. In the high court, the Pilot camp said the whip cannot apply when an assembly session is not in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gehlot-s-meeting-with-guv-sparks-speculation/story-WhcU3WpZdyxoDINIaIszFO.html
19-07-2020||India||India added last quarter million Covid-19 cases in just 8 days, 3 states added 55.7% patients||On July 16, India became only the third country in the world to reach the grim milestone of one million confirmed Covid-19 cases. The United States and Brazil are the other two countries who have crossed this mark. What was the progress of the infection like in India?The journey to a million cases took 137 days since March 2, but each quarter of that million has come at a faster pace. The first 2.5 lakh cases took 98 days. Cases in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Delhi – which have the highest number of cumulative Covid-19 cases in the country – constituted 57% of all cases at the time. This was similar to their share in deaths: 58%.The next quarter of a million cases took less than three weeks (19 days). The case fatality rate (CFR) or the ratio of Covid-19 deaths to cases had climbed from 2.8% at the time of 2.5 lakh cases to 3.1 at this point.The share of the ‘Big Three’ states in total cases stood at 60%, while their share in Covid-19 deaths was 67%. The share of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Delhi in total cases had climbed down slightly (59%) by July 8, when India was 2.5 lakh cases short of hitting the million mark. The country-wide CFR was down too, to 2.8% at this point. The share in deaths of the three states with the most case load, however, was at 68%.On the day India hit the million mark – it took just eight days for the country to record the last quarter of that million – the top three states accounted for 55.7% cases.  States other than the top three are now seeing a rise in cases ,particularly in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. The slowing down of new cases in Delhi or Tamil Nadu of late could be one of the reasons why their share in country-wide deaths, too, has come down from late June and early July. The figure stood at 66% on the morning after India hit the one million mark.Data sourced from How India Lives||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-added-last-quarter-million-covid-19-cases-in-just-8-days-3-states-added-55-7-patients/story-vtbYYBobpxfi5Q0HJY0tMK.html
19-07-2020||India||Follow ‘raj dharma’, speak truth on LAC: Cong to PM||New Delhi: The Congress on Saturday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to follow “raj dharma” and tell people the reality about China’s incursions as it cited satellite images of Ladakh’s Pangong Tso area taken in May and June and added that they showed Chinese structures had come up there.Addressing a digital news briefing, Congress leader Kapil Sibal asked Modi to “at least speak the truth” about it and take steps to protect the Indian territory. He was referring to Modi’s remarks at an all-party meeting on May 19 that no intruder was on Indian territory across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China and that no Indian military post had been captured.The Prime Minister’s Office on June 20 clarified Modi’s remarks and added they were being given a “mischievous interpretation”. It said Modi was clear that India would respond firmly to any attempts to transgress LAC.Sibal said councillors from Ladakh, including those from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), submitted a memorandum to Modi in February, giving details about China’s capture of Indian land. “What action did the Prime Minister take? Had the Prime Minister acted, wouldn’t we have been able to pre-empt the brazen Chinese transgressions?” Modi on Friday made a surprise unscheduled visit to Ladakh, where he said the “era of expansionism” was over, to send a signal to China about India’s determination to defend its borders.Sibal asked Modi to stop the politics of “illusion and delusion” and added India should unequivocally tell China to retreat. He posed five questions to Modi. Sibal asked whether the actual picture of “Chinese occupation of our territory” up to the Finger 4 Ridge in the Pangong Tso area depicts the truth. “They say pictures do not lie. Will the Prime Minister now tell the nation: is this Indian territory on which radars, helipad and other structures have been built by the Chinese in a brazen act of transgression?” asked Sibal. “Have the Chinese occupied our territory in the Galwan Valley, including Patrol Point 14, where our 20 jawans of the 16 Bihar Regiment made the supreme sacrifice [on June 15]? Has China also occupied Indian territory in Hot Springs?”Sibal asked whether China has occupied territory up to Y-Junction in the Depsang plains, threatening India’s strategic Daulat Beg Oldi airstrip, the lifeline for the military supplies to the Siachen Glacier and Karakoram pass. He referred to Modi’s comments about expansionism and that this is not India of 1962 when the two countries fought a war. Sibal added that then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru wrote to China, saying India will never submit to the demand for it to accept the Chinese 1959 line, whatever the consequences and however long and hard the struggle may be. “Paradoxically, the 1959 line clearly depicted the entire Galwan Valley in India and it was only on June 16, a day after the fatal clashes, that China formally laid claim, for the first time ever, to the entire Valley.”Sibal said late former PMs Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri also visited forward locations to boost the morale of Indian soldiers. “But it appears that our Prime Minister stayed 230km away in Nimu, Leh.”Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said patriotic Ladakhis were raising their voice against Chinese intrusion and asked the government to listen to them. “They are screaming a warning. Ignoring their warning will cost India dearly. For India’s sake, please listen to them,” he tweeted. Gandhi shared a media report showing some Ladakhis alleging that the Chinese have been occupying the Indian territory.Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi brushed aside the Congress’s criticism, saying it is indulging in an irresponsible behaviour when the country is facing challenges. “Even people within the Congress would be surprised at this behaviour.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/follow-raj-dharma-speak-truth-on-lac-cong-to-pm/story-NFb48ku5OEnWQ1vIoc9ywN.html
19-07-2020||Editorials||Stop the culture of resort politics||The sight of legislators being packed off in buses, and lodged in comfortable, even luxurious, hotels and resorts, has become a common feature of Indian politics. It usually happens when a state government is in crisis, when a crucial election for a Rajya Sabha seat is underway and numbers are fluid, or when a rebellion is underway to change the regime in a state. A political party — or the rebel faction — then rushes to consolidate the legislators who are in its favour. The objective is to ensure that these legislators don’t succumb to temptations and inducements offered by the other side; and instead remain under constant surveillance. The method then adopted is to lock them in, till the crisis is resolved one way or the other. While Rajasthan is only the most recent example — members loyal to Ashok Gehlot were sent off to a hotel on the outskirts of Jaipur and members loyal to Sachin Pilot were brought to a resort in Haryana — this is neither unique to one party nor to one state. Similar examples of resort politics were witnessed in Madhya Pradesh (rebel legislators went to Karnataka), Karnataka (legislators were brought to Maharashtra), Gujarat (to preserve numbers for a Rajya Sabha poll, legislators were taken to Karnataka), among others. It is important to go back to first principles here, to understand how this growing pattern makes a mockery of Indian democracy, speaks poorly of elected representatives, is a reflection of the distortions in political party structures, and is an insult to the voter. Voters elect representatives, who belong to a political party or who may be an independent, for their ideas, agenda and ideology. These representatives are, within the framework of party discipline, understood to be autonomous leaders who act in public interest. But, instead, what resort politics shows is that these legislators can shift allegiances based on whoever can offer a better prize (either price or position); even parties have little faith in their integrity and so they are locked up; public interest is far-removed in these calculations; and money is an active determinant in how legislators make their choices. Resort politics is, in many ways, a symbol all that is wrong with Indian democratic politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/stop-the-culture-of-resort-politics/story-ACmAEcaE5DvjzRim412pNP.html
