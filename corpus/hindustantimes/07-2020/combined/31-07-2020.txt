31-07-2020||News||The People’s Liberation Army is strong. But it has four weaknesses||The People’s Republic of China (PRC) will be celebrating the 93rd founding anniversary of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) on August 1. Consolidated in 1927 during the Nanchang uprising by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), PLA was formed as an armed wing to counter the Kuomintang’s anti-communist purges during the Chinese civil wars. Since then, PLA has become the world’s largest armed force with around 2.03 million active and 510,000 reserve personnel. In its recent history, it had two important turning points. First, the United States (US)’ use of advanced and sophisticated weaponry in the first Gulf War of the 1990s compelled PLA to pursue technological advancement. Two, the Central Military Commission (CMC) chairman, Xi Jinping’s championing of the Chinese dream to make PLA a world-class force by 2049 led to its restructuring and rapid modernisation. However, despite the technological advances and growing military might, PLA has key weaknesses. Here are the four most important challenges for PLA at 93. Also read: Top Indian, Chinese generals hold crucial talks at Chushul to reduce tension at LACOne, PLA is accused of being infected by the peace disease (Hépíng bìng), peacetime habits (Hépíng jixí) and peace problems (Hépíng jibì), as it has not participated in any war since 1979. This is a condition where a soldier’s casual peacetime approach while training could impact wartime combat readiness. CCP is concerned that PLA doesn’t understand the intensity of modern combat. Xi is aware of this and has introduced changes to PLA’s regime to make it train under “realistic combat conditions”. My research also indicates that the number of PLA’s bilateral-trilateral military exercises with the foreign armies has increased since 2014 to compensate for the lack of combat experience. But the impact of this change cannot be verified until PRC goes to war. Two, PLA has been on a modernisation spree for the last two decades and has made notable progress since Xi took over as the CMC chairman in 2012. This is reflected in its defence budget, which allocates the most significant share of spending on capital expenditure. However, it has realised that the military modernisation doesn’t match with the quality of personnel employed, especially in the technology-centric services such as the navy, air force, rocket force and the strategic support force. Acknowledging these gaps, PLA altered its recruitment strategy by focusing on employing better-qualified students from specialised and technical universities. It felt the need to rework its conscription model to achieve the informatisation goal for the armed forces by 2035, which was announced by Xi in the 2017 party congress. To achieve this, CMC introduced several financial incentives to attract highly educated talent. However, despite positive inducements, recent reports suggest that the gap still exists and PLA is still facing a shortage of skilled expertise to drive its technology-centric services.Also read: China’s People’s Liberation Army holds drills in Tibetan plateauThree, graft in the armed forces undermines its ability on the battlefield, impacts the military’s image and hinders the development of the national defence. Corruption in PLA became widespread when it branched out into business, seeking opportunities from the new market reforms in the 1980s. The then chairman, Jiang Zemin, tried to address this problem by dissolving the military-business complex in 1998, but by then, the rot had set in too deep and had become pervasive. Xi, after becoming CCP general secretary in 2012, expanded the fight against corruption, resulting in more than 4,000 anti-graft investigations. This resulted in the sacking of high-level officers. The most notable cases were Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong; both served as CMC vice-chairmen under former CCP general secretary Hu Jintao. But, some changes such as the introduction of the discipline inspection commissioner within CMC, dismantling the four military-bureaucratic departments and removing service chiefs from CMC developed internal resistance. There were many influential losers due to Xi’s reforms, which probably could have led to resistance within the forces. Many of the senior officers were reassigned to appropriate positions throughout the rank and files of PLA as compensation rather than being removed from duty. Although this has reduced the resistance, the effectiveness of the reforms, which were meant to reduce corruption, can be questioned. Four, consistent military modernisation is one of the most important aspects for realising the Chinese dream of a world-class force by 2049. But increasing revenue expenditure and the cost of maintaining already commissioned weaponry could play spoiler. Of its total defence spending, China’s capital expenditure, used for military modernisation, has increased every year since 2012 and crossed the 40% mark since 2015. But notably, China also has the largest pool of 57 million PLA veterans, demanding post-retirement benefits and better retirement deals. These post-retirement wages, pensions and living subsidies are incurred from China’s defence spending. Rising revenue bills, since 2018, will certainly impact capital expenditure in the near future. Besides, PLA also has to maintain existing weaponry, which it has commissioned over the last few years. The maintenance cost for equipment and vessels, in select cases such as the navy and probably air force, is higher than the manufacturing and commissioning cost. Thus, the twin factor of rising revenue bills and increasing maintenance cost will slow China’s military modernisation drive.Besides these four major problems, there are other operational gaps such as limited strategic airlift and open-sea refuelling capabilities, limited overseas military bases, lack of joint operations capabilities and the lack of a rotational system within the lower-ranked officers of PLA. All these limitations will not only impact the Chinese dream but also alter its capabilities to attain its strategic military guidelines in the future.Suyash Desai Is a research analyst for the China Studies Programme, The Takshashila Institution, BengaluruThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-people-s-liberation-army-is-strong-but-it-has-four-weaknesses/story-4BAJhVDLbfKhq2XEczg2JK.html
31-07-2020||News||Lokmanya Tilak: Father of the Indian renaissance||Identity was once considered a primordial subject by the social science fraternity. But, then, there was a significant change. Many social scientists recognised the importance of identity as a factor that motivates human enterprise. Many stopped using the term melting pot while describing mega cities like Mumbai or New York and, instead, started using the term salad bowl. Melting pot suggests a complete obliteration of smaller identities to have them merged into a larger one; whereas a salad bowl represents the protection of these smaller identities or recognition that smaller identities can coexist. Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak was perhaps the first political leader in modern India to appreciate the importance of identity issues. He realised that these could be a tool to make inroads in the minds of an otherwise docile society. Once that was done, people could be motivated to join the struggle for independence, which explains Tilak’s clarion call for swaraj and swadeshi.In both concepts, swa or self is common. Striving for self-dependence, in Tilak’s strategy, was the stepping-stone for Independence. Tilak wanted to inculcate both collective thinking as well as action. For the cultivation of an enlightened mind, he used the media in the form of two newspapers, Kesari and Maratha, and national education through Deccan Education Society, an institute he established. His formula for preparing the ground for political activism through culture, education and media was so powerful that later on Mahatma Gandhi, Babasaheb Ambedkar and others adopted this path. Tilak belonged to the rare category of philosopher-politician. His ideas of swaraj and swadeshi were anchored in making every Indian conscious of the insults and injustice meted out by the British. He prepared a fertile ground for swaraj through his home-rule movement. He was clear on the aim of the home rule movement. The tone and tenor of his demand were strategically conciliatory. He wrote: “India was like a son who had grown up and attained maturity. It was right now that the trustee or the father should give him what was his due. The people of India must get this effected. They have a right to do so.” Notably, Tilak almost had a blueprint of a post-Independence India in mind. For him, swa-raj was also liked to swa-bhasha and swa-bhusha, i.e. mother tongue and indigenous attire. Perhaps, he was the first national leader who envisioned the formation of linguistic states. He spoke of how we should “form one separate state each for Marathi, Telugu and Kanarese provinces...” The principle that education should be given through the vernaculars is self-evident and clear..” A master strategist, Tilak adroitly used the two things — constitutionalism and democracy — that the British rulers used to boast about, to his maximum advantage. To that end, he used both, his passion and professional acumen as editor and pleader dexterously. His editorials were not only hard hitting, but well-argued and still carefully-worded in order to avoid legal implications. Tilak was also known for not mincing his words. However, a scholar at heart, Tilak used both activism in the field as well as opinion to hasten slowly and attain the goal of swaraj, something his fellow Congressmen were wary of publicly speaking about at that time. Of course, his idea of Swaraj was not confined to political freedom. He was conscious of the need for cultural and economic independence too. Tilak could be rightly described as the Father of the Indian Renaissance. Two other initiatives of his, the public celebration of the Ganesh festival and Shivaji Jayanti, were clearly aimed at cultural assimilation of all caste and community groups. Once, in an editorial of Kesari he wrote, “This (Ganesh) festival is both age old and universal; but this time the new thing about it was that all castes — and not just Brahmins — came together and made it a festival of all Hindus, a thing we must take pride in.” Swadeshi was the other important cause espoused by Tilak. Both Lala Lajpat Rai and Bipin Chandra Pal joined him in popularising the call of swadeshi nationally, which saw the emergence of the famous triumvirate of those days, popularly known as Lal, Bal and Pal. However, his swadeshi was not just about boycotting British goods. Although he used the tools of boycott and bonfire of British goods to provide a window for popular participation, his larger objective was promoting indigenous entrepreneurship. Tilak wanted to promote manufacturing in India. To that end, Tilak started collecting funds for a corpus, known as Paisa Fund. Through this, Tilak supported Ishwar Das Varshney, an entrepreneur who was greatly inspired by Tilak’s speech in the Surat Congress. Varshney later started Paisa Fund Glass Works at Talegaon near Pune. It was the same zeal for promoting swadeshi manufacturing that led to Tilak and Ratanji Jamshedji Tata coming together to open the Bombay Swadeshi Co-operative Stores Co. in order to promote products that were made in India. In Tuticorin, Chidambaram Pillai led a fairly successful swadeshi campaign. His initiative of starting the Indian-owned shipping company, the Swadeshi Shipping Company in October 1906, posed a challenge before the mighty British India Steam Navigation Company. Later, when his seminal work Geetarahasya , which he wrote while under imprisonment at Mandalay was to be published, he ensured that the paper to be used was indigenously manufactured by D Padamji and Sons, a swadeshi paper mill. Today, when we talk about Atmanirbhar Bharat, the legacy of Tilak is carried forward. Reviving the spirit of economic nationalism for indigenously manufactured goods and striving for social integration through culture are the features of Tilak’s strategy and they continue to be relevant even today as we observe his 100th death anniversary on August 1.

Advocate Gaganpreet Singh, president of the NGO, said these so-called leaders have knowingly created an artificial threat, so that police has to deploy security personnel for them. He added that these ‘leaders’ do not require any security cover and are causing loss to the state exchequer unnecessarily. He said that amid the Covid-19 pandemic, a large number of police personnel are required to implement government orders and should be working for the safety of the public instead.He said that some so-called leaders who have been provided security covers are misusing the security personnel by extorting money and land grabbing, creating terror in minds of the general public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ngo-writes-to-punjab-dgp-over-removal-of-security-for-leaders/story-4uqIx1lce6tOMzWWKWTyuN.html

With the new guidelines for “Unlock 3” announcing gyms and yoga centres to reopen from August 5, gym owners in the city have started making preparations to open their doors for customers.Even as they wait for the union health ministry to issue a standard operating procedure (SOP), many gyms in the city have started disinfecting their establishments, improving the ventilation systems, servicing their machines and buying sanitisation and other equipments to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) once they reopen to business.“We all are very happy that gyms will finally be allowed to open. We had been receiving calls from our customers who were missing working out in the gym, even though we had been in touch with many of them guiding them with working out at home,” said Deepa Ahuja, who owns the Sector 108 branch of Anytime Fitness gym – an American Fitness chains of health and fitness clubs. “We have already started planning safety measures to ensure sanitisation and social distancing. We will make the use of Aarogya Setu mobile application compulsory for our members who will be asked to carry their own wipes and gloves. We have also started installing HEPA (high-efficiency particulate) filters in the air conditioners, and hired an agency to sanitise the gym every 24-hours. Every machine will be coated with approved chemicals so that the surface stays virus-free for 14 days. We are also planning to install disinfection tunnels stations at the entrance of the gym.”Adding that the gym authorities are also working on plans to extend the membership programmes to make it up to the customers who lost more than four months of exercising at the gym, Ahuja said that she will only begin contacting the members once the SOP is released.Some gym owners in the city also said they are working on plans such as mandatory booking of slots to avoid too many people working out at the same time. “We have already started cleaning and sanitising the gym, and have bought new machines. Once the SOP is out, we will ask our members to choose a time slot so that we can avoid overcrowding at the fitness club,” said Bharat (goes by a single name), owner, The Fitness Bar, a gym at Sector 120.“Yoga institutes and gymnasiums will be allowed to open from August 5, 2020. In this regard standard operating Procedure (SOP) will be issued by the ministry of health & family welfare (MoHFW) for ensuring social distancing and to contain the spread of Covid-19,” stated the government order on Unlock 3.The Uttar Pradesh government has also given its nod for opening of gyms in the state. “We are waiting for the detailed SOP to be issued by the health ministry, based on which we will issue instructions to the gyms in the district,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh NagarMany fitness enthusiasts are looking forward to the reopening of gyms. “I’m excited that the gyms will finally be open, as working out at home is good but it’s not the same as working out at a gym where we have instructors to guide and help us. The pandemic will stay for some more time and we will have to deal with it no matter what. I just hope that my gym makes up for the lost months, as my membership expired in June,” Kartik Kumar, a Noida-based techie who goes to a gym in Sector 77.Gymnasiums in Noida were ordered to shut on March 15. There are about 400 gyms in the district.Gym owners said they are making all arrangements to ensure the risk of getting exposed to the infection is minimised. “We are working on plans to ensure customers maintain social distance, so on our mobile application, we have already given an option for members to fix time slots. Meanwhile, some facilities like showers and steam will be closed for the time being. Every member has to wear the face masks, gloves, and needs to be covered fully and not wear shorts,” Ranjan Ghosh, senior regional manager of Golds gym, who also operates a branch in Sector 30. “ Plastic sheets are being installed between treadmills as it would be difficult to run with masks but we are also insuring to improve the ventilation of the gyms, “ he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/fixed-slots-improved-ventilation-sanitising-machines-how-noida-gyms-are-gearing-up-for-business-again/story-IYno4qU6VZlg4s9LdqLhLN.html

31-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Man pushes neighbour’s minor children off fourth floor, arrested||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad police on Friday arrested a 23-year-old man who allegedly pushed his neighbour’s two minor children from the fourth floor of his residence in Ghaziabad’s Raj Nagar. The police said the suspect was arrested on the basis of statements of one of the children.An FIR was lodged under IPC Section 307 (attempt to murder) against Harendra Kumar, who stays in a rented apartment over the third floor of the building where the incident took place. The family of children stays on the fourth floor.The incident took place around 11am on Friday, in Guldhar, near Sector 23. “The two boys had gone to the terrace of the building and were flying a kite when they fell, under mysterious circumstances, on to the roof of an adjacent house and were injured. The boundary wall was quite high and the children could not have toppled over by themselves while playing. So, when they were asked, one of them revealed that they were pushed by their neighbour,” said Mohammad Aslam, station house officer of Kavi Nagar police station. “After the suspect was arrested, he allegedly narrated to us that an uncle of the two minors had fled with his wife a couple of months ago, and since then he had been annoyed with the family. His wife returned but she is living with her parents for the past 20 to 25 days. When the suspect found the two children alone on the terrace, he pushed them in order to seek revenge,” SHO added.The two children, aged eight and nine years, are recuperating in a private hospital near the Delhi-Meerut road and are stated to be out of danger.“We spoke to the doctors who told us that CT scan reports of the two did not indicate any critical injuries, but they will remain under observation for 24 hours and are under treatment. The children fell about 15 to 20 feet off the terrace, on to the adjacent house. There, we found a broken cable wire. So it is assumed that both fell on the cable wire first and did not hit the roof directly, which broke their fall. This is why they did not suffer any major critical injury,” said Avnish Kumar, circle officer (city 2). The father of the two, who works as a driver, said he and his wife were away at work when the children went to the terrace. “My wife and I were not at home. When we heard of the incident from neighbours who called us, we rushed back. The children told us that the suspect came up to the terrace and pushed them. After I submitted a police complaint, the suspect was arrested,” he added.The family has been living on rent for the past six years in the building. He stays with his wife and five children, including the two boys in question.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-man-pushes-neighbour-s-minor-children-off-fourth-floor-arrested/story-yvuPeOmUlagzmOF8450DBO.html
31-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad finally begins uploading Covid death details online||More than three months after the Uttar Pradesh government had announced it will conduct audits of patients who have succumbed to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Ghaziabad health department has finally started uploading the case details of Covid-19 related deaths on the state Covid portal.On April 15, the state government had announced that it will undertake death audits to ascertain the exact cause of deaths attributed to Covid-19.“We have started uploading the case details of each death on the state portal. Once the complete case details are uploaded, a committee will screen the documents and ascertain the exact cause of death. As per our assessment, the majority of people who succumbed to the infection had co-morbid conditions,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.Chief medical officer, Dr NK Gupta, did not comment over the reason behind the delay in uploading the case details but said that the health department is now expediting the process. “There has been a delay in uploading the case details of the deaths, but now we are expediting the process,” he added.In Ghaziabad, till July 31, 64 deaths have been reported out of 4,937 total cases in the district. The case-fatality ratio hence stands at 1.29% which is slightly lower than the state’s fatality ratio of 1.90% ( 1,630 deaths out of 85, 461 Covid-19 cases). The first Covid-related death in the district was reported on April 30 when a 62-year-old woman had died at a private hospital. Officials had attributed the death of the Covid-19 positive woman to a heart attack. While four Covid-19 related deaths were reported till May 31, as many as 51 deaths were recorded in June alone. Nine deaths have been reported in the month of July.“Our prime focus is to reduce the number of fatalities and trace contacts of positive patients for early detection of infected persons that can be sent for treatment to appropriate Covid hospitals. We have already put in mechanisms for early detection of cases, early testing, and speedy referral. As a result, a lower number of deaths have been reported in July,” the DM said.Officials of the district health department said after the audit is over, four or five deaths will be excluded from the district’s death toll.“These are cases where the subsequent Covid-19 test reports of the patients declaring them negative for the virus were received after their deaths. Of the total 64 deaths, 16 deaths (six women and 10 men) were related to patients who suffered from influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and SARI symptoms. Overall, 24 women patients and 40 men have died so far. At 30 deaths, most fatalities were in the age group of 41-60 years,” said a senior official from the district health department who did not wish to be identified.“At least 10 private hospitals are providing paid Covid treatment in the hospital. These hospitals have a total of 598 beds, and 120 of these beds have been reserved for patients, being treated in government-run hospitals, who might need to be looked after at an advanced facility. Of these 120 reserved beds, 20 are ICU beds, and in cases when a patient in government facility needs critical care, we can immediately refer them to these hospitals with reserved ICU beds, and the treatment will be free of cost,” the official quoted above said.The officials said that apart from the reserved ICU beds in private hospitals, they also have 33 ICU beds in government’s L2 (for patients with mild symptoms) and L3 (critical patients) facilities.“For early detection of cases, we have opened testing facilities in Indirapuram, Vaishali, MMG Hospital, and Women Hospital. Apart from these, we have also come up with static testing booths at four of our community health centers in Loni, Muradnagar, Modinagar, and Dasna besides one testing facility at our primary health center in Bhojpur. We have also roped in three mobile testing vans which will visit different localities. Apart from these, we have 10 private hospitals who have been supplied with rapid antigen kits for quick testing,” he addedAccording to the records of the health department, till July 31, about 101,262 samples have been tested in the district of which reports of 100,904 have been received so far.

31-07-2020||Mumbai||‘International fliers can undergo Covid test 15 days before departure date’||The national Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism and Hospitality (FAITH) has written to civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri suggesting ways to ease travel restrictions for inbound international passengers as a way to save the tourism industry.In its letter sent on Tuesday, the federation, which represents 10 travel, tourism and hospitality organisations, stated that international passengers should undergo Covid-19 test 15 days prior to their departure date. It also suggested that passengers with no symptoms be allowed to continue their journey while those found with symptoms during screening by airport authorities be sent to 14-day quarantine. The letter was also sent to Union health and home ministries.Currently, all international passengers have to mandatorily undergo institutional quarantine for seven days and home quarantine in the following week.The government on Thursday decided to extend the suspension on the scheduled international commercial passenger services to and from India up to 11.59pm on August 31. However, the restriction will not apply to international all-cargo operations and flights specifically approved by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). The letter read, “All passengers arriving in India do not want to be quarantined. You can make it mandatory that they take a Covid test in their respective countries 15 days before their departure to India and that they show the report while boarding and landing. On arrival, we should test every passenger and only those who are found positive should be quarantined and rest of the passengers should be allowed to go to their respective hotels or homes. All airports in India should follow the same procedure for both domestic and international passengers.”The federation also suggested that the cost of Covid-19 test on arrival should be included in the air tickets. Subhash Goyal, secretary of FAITH, said, “Travel industry will never be able to recover until the current mandatory quarantine rules are worked upon.” The federation’s suggestion assumes importance in light of the findings of a survey by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade association of the world’s airlines since 1945, conducted in mid-March and early June. The study revealed that as many as 83% of the 4,700 respondents from 11 countries, including India and the US, said they wouldn’t travel by air if it involves a mandatory 14-day quarantine period.A former DGCA official said, “Decisions on mandatory quarantine period is decided by the health ministry which is being followed by the all other relevant ministries. Hence, aviation ministry has no role in deciding quarantine period.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/international-fliers-can-undergo-covid-test-15-days-before-departure-date/story-3cJPu4XBI7GmOHxdUI0J8O.html

The DCW in a statement said the minister has ordered a probe into the functioning of the home. “The senior citizens have also alleged they are being held captive and beaten up often,” the statement read. A DCW member said the elderly have been housed in a cramped space, and men and women are forced to share beds. The room has around 10 beds. “The washrooms are filthy. The elderly citizens are frail and weak suffering multiple ailments. However, no records of their medical history have been kept by the owner of the old age home,” the member said, asking not to be named. The cramped spaces leave little room for social distancing, an essential to curb the spread of Covid-19.The home also doesn’t have any open spaces to sit or move around for its occupants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-minister-dcw-chief-inspect-old-age-home-order-probe-into-its-functioning/story-SJD9b50ds90s4PXJw9OkaL.html

SRL Diagnostics had stood by its results.Their counsel, R S Rai, told the court that if at all, an error has crept in, though not admitted, it would be unreasonable on the part of the authorities to allege mala fide intent. It was argued that the FIR has been registered in haste and without any application of mind. The alleged misreporting was based upon the result of PGI, Rohtak testing, which had conducted the same at a different point of time and by using different kits, they argued. The high court bench of Justice Manjari Nehru Kaul, while seeking response from Haryana by August 25, ordered that though probe would continue, challan would not be filed till next date of hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-restrains-haryana-police-from-penalising-pvt-lab/story-gIxKVn4rT2l3IvvZe1QFTP.html
31-07-2020||Gurugram||2 Delhi-based pharmacists questioned for illegal supply of Covid-19 drugs||The police on Friday questioned two pharmacists from Delhi for several hours regarding their alleged involvement in supplying Covid-19 and cancer treatment drugs to other pharmacists and four Iraqi nationals, who were arrested for allegedly smuggling such drugs to their country. On Tuesday, the police had arrested four Iraqi nationals in two separate raids from Sector 47 and Sector 57 after the drug control department had received a tip-off. Forty eight vials of remdesivir, 55 strips of favipiravir and 18 packs of Lopikast — the three drugs which are used in Covid-19 treatment — were recovered along with a large cache of antibiotics, antacids, antiallergic drugs and cancer treatment medicines in the raids. One SUV and ₹74.55 lakh cash were also seized. Senior police officials privy to the investigation said that the names of the pharmacists who were questioned on Friday had cropped up in the investigation after the arrest of another pharmacist named Pradeep from Jharsa, Sector 38, on Wednesday, who revealed that he had procured remdesivir from a supplier in Delhi.Chander Mohan, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), east, said, “The pharmacists from Delhi were questioned about the alleged nexus and how they were able to source drugs used to treat Covid-19, since these are directly sold by manufacturing companies to hospitals. We are also carrying out raids at several places in Delhi-NCR to identify more suspects.” Police said Pardeep, who had allegedly hidden 84 vials of remdesivir in a room next to a tube well in his village in Pataudi, told them that he had been in touch with the Iraqi nationals or one year. A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “Pardeep was earlier supplying medicines to Iraqi nationals, who worked with private hospitals as interpreters and were acquainted with medical tourism patients. After the pandemic broke out, he decided to source drugs used to treat Covid-19 and sell them for a mark up. The first consignment of remdesivir injections that he had procured from Delhi was sold to the Iraqi nationals.” On Thursday, the police had said that the names of several pharmacists had come up during questioning and the role of some hospitals had come under scanner. The police probe has found that the suspects had been smuggling medicines to Iraq for at least two years and, since the pandemic, they had started dealing in drugs used to treat Covid-19 patients. These drugs, which are in short supply, are sold at exorbitant prices in Iraq.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/2-delhi-based-pharmacists-questioned-for-illegal-supply-of-covid-19-drugs/story-eZ28RSsvmSZqnwR2RDSL0M.html

A notice was first served in 2017, and since then three other notices were also issued to them, including a demolition order, but no action was eventually taken,” said Attri. He said that recently the matter was also brought up before the Lokayukta who then directed MCG to re-initiate action on the matter. “We had given the owners the last opportunity and served them a final notice. Even then they did not remove the encroachment. Hence, we demolished the boundary walls today and recovered our land,” Attri said. Despite repeated attempts, the developer of the business park could not be contacted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-recovers-one-acre-prime-land/story-SBXhnrJh3L3aF79DHE33FJ.html

The protesters claimed that the administration and police forcibly took the sarpanch, Amrik Kaur, and a few others to the sub-tehsil office, Koom Kalan, on Thursday evening, and forced them to give consent for acquisition of 407 acres.They alleged the sarpanch’s signatures were forcibly taken for acquisition of the panchayat land, where the state government has proposed to establish an industrial park. The villagers claimed they will not let go of the land as it was the source of income of around 70 families of the village, adding that they will protest till the government rolls back the decision to acquire the panchayat land.The state government has proposed to establish the industrial park on 1,000 acres in Haidar Nagar, Sekhowal, Salempur, Sailkiana and Machian Kalan villages.“I, along with former sarpanch Dhir Singh and panchayat member Khjaan Singh, were taken to the sub-tehsil office on Thursday evening after office hours. When the authorities started forcing us, we raised a protest. We will not let the government acquire the panchayat land. The gram sabha of the village already approved a resolution regarding this on July 21,” said sarpanch Amrik Kaur.Former sarpanch Dhir Singh said, “Now, we are left with no option but to move court, as the government is not paying heed to our concerns.” On his part, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), Ludhiana East, Baljinder Singh Dhillon said, “No one was forced for anything. The sarpanch was asked to visit the office so that she could be apprised of the project. The industrial park is beneficial for the village and its residents and we are working to make them aware about this.” Supporting the villagers’ cause, AAP leader Pardeep Singh Khalsa said the party will stand by the villagers and oppose acquisition of the land, as it will also cause damage to the adjacent Mattewara forest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/villagers-protest-forcible-acquisition-of-land-at-sekhowal/story-HQrdobGblNfoSUyEVWeACJ.html
31-07-2020||Gurugram||HSVP prepares a list of 294 oustees, one more in the works||The Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) is preparing lists of oustees and residential plots under its possession to ensure the early allotment of plots to applicants under the oustee quota. The exercise will also enable the authority to seek permission from the Punjab and Haryana High Court, which has barred it from auctioning plots unless the process of allotment to the oustees is completed. A oustee is a person whose land has been acquired for the construction of roads or other infrastructure projects. As per the HSVP policy, the oustee is entitled to a plot in lieu of the one that has been acquired from him by the authority. In 2018, a land owner, whose land was acquired by the HSVP, filed a petition in the Punjab and Haryana High Court, complaining that the authority was selling away its plot but not allotting the same to the oustees. Following the petition, the court directed the authority to first complete the process of allotting plots to the oustees before auctioning the remaining ones. HSVP officials said that they have already identified 294 oustees in estate office -1 while a similar exercise is being carried out in estate office- 2, which will ensure that claims of oustees are settled before plots can be auctioned. Bharat Bhushan Gogia, estate officer-I, said that information pertaining to the oustees and their claims have been compiled on a sector-wise basis and these would be sent to the headquarters in Chandigarh. “These reports once approved will be submitted in the court, which is hearing currently the matter,” he said. As per details shared by Gogia, 294 applicants have applied for plots under the oustee quota in sectors 4,5,6,7, 7 extension, 9, 9A, 10, 10A, 12A, 14, 15 parts 1 and 2, 17, 21, 23, 23A. Officials said that HSVP was planning to auction the residential plots under its possession in the coming months and this was the reason that they wanted to settle the claims of the oustees at the earliest. As reported by HT earlier, the authority has been facing an acute cash crunch and pressure of repaying loans for a while, and, as such, has decided to sell some of its commercial and residential plots to generate revenue. The authority is facing a loan burden of ₹20,000 crore, which were taken to pay off the landowners as enhancement charges. The authority has recently conducted an auction and managed to garner ₹14 crore by selling five commercial sites across various sectors in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hsvp-prepares-a-list-of-294-oustees-one-more-in-the-works/story-SddD2zWB0Fsu2oyTIq78gP.html
31-07-2020||City||MCG puts on hold its plan to set up isolation centre||Gurugram The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has halted its plans for setting up a 100-bed isolation centre in Sector 27, officials said on Friday.The move comes after divisional commissioner Ashok Sangwan said that the number of Covid-19 cases in Gurugram has “stabilized” and hence, there is no need for starting any new facility.As per the MCG officials privy to the matter, Sangwan had also told senior officials of the civic body that currently there is little scope for using the isolation centre and there is no point spending government funds unnecessarily. In the last week of June, MCG had finalised a community centre in Sector 27 as a potential site for establishing an isolation centre where Covid-19 patients, who need oxygen support, could be given treatment free of cost. For the project, the civic body that had received 50 beds from a private company under corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds was looking at tying up with doctors. Overall, the facility was to have more than 100 beds and would have cost MCG around Rs 30 lakh. MCG was aiming at starting the facility from mid-August. Depending on the success of its pilot project, the civic body had decided to replicate this model in other parts of the city.“Adhering to the divisional commissioner’s direction, we have halted the isolation centre project for the interim. Since there is low occupancy in Covid-19 hospitals, it was felt that the facility would have little purpose presently. However, we have kept 50 beds in the facility so that it can be quickly converted into a full-fledged isolation centre whenever required,” said Hariom Attri, joint commissioner, MCG. During a visit to the facility early this week, Sangwan had said, “On most days, the city is registering less than 100 new cases. The number of overall cases is also coming down. There is also low occupancy of Covid-19 beds in hospitals, so there is little requirement of any new facility at the moment.” He further said that the facility would serve as a good standby whenever there is a requirement. “We have a plan for 400-500 beds to be kept as backup and this facility would be a part of them,” said Sangwan.As per official figures, only 22% of the city’s Covid-19 beds -- 335 out of total 1,486 -- were occupied till July 23.An MCG official said that another reason for putting the project on halt was that Haryana government is facing a shortage of funds. “The Haryana government is currently under a monetary crisis, and so austerity measures are adopted. Besides spending Rs 30 lakh in infrastructure and medical equipment, MCG would also have to bear expenses for day-to-day operations and consulting fees of doctors. So, the project has been put on hold indefinitely,” said the MCG official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mcg-puts-on-hold-its-plan-to-set-up-isolation-centre/story-ePVwmirgHVMURvdQINv1rL.html

The authorities must treat these issues on priority or else thid system will lose its purpose,” he said, adding that he has pursued the matter with senior officials.HSVP has appointed a team of officials to resolve these pending complaints, said officials. “I have appointed two persons whose job is to look into these complaints and resolve the matter at the earliest. In other wings of the authority a similar strategy is being implemented and this pendency will be reduced within a month,” said Bharat Bhushan Gogia, estate officer, I.

The committee of the working group office of the dean international students has proposed to offer short term online courses to international students in the same way as many other institutions across the world do.Nandita Singh, Dean International Students, PU, said, “We will ask departments to design short term courses which can be offered to foreign students.”“We will run only a few courses initially and charge nominal fees. This will be an opportunity for our departments to showcase our strength and expand the profile of the varsity,” she said.PU’s office of the dean international students has also asked heads of the departments to send proposals for starting an online course in their departments. The proposal from each department should mention the details about the courses to be offered including fee structure, duration, and number of seats, etc.PU senator Rajat Sandhir said, “I think this is a much-needed initiative. ‘Study in India’ programs are much required as they would increase PU’s visibility as a global player. Programs such as India studies, Indian culture and languages are in demand internationally.”SUMMER SCHOOLS GO ONLINEThe varsity is also planning to offer summer schools online to international students since summer schools can’t be organised physically amid the Covid-19 pandemic.“Since foreign students can’t visit this year, we are planning to offer summer school online as well.

Police said the victim suffered severe injuries and was rescued by a police team who rushed him to the Civil Hospital. He was later referred to a private hospital in Sector 38 where his condition is said to be stable. The suspects allegedly also damaged a police vehicle before escaping. Police said the reason for the attack was still not clear.In a video of the incident shot by someone from the crowd, which HT has seen, a man can purportedly be seen arguing with the police and then breaking the windshield of the truck as several policemen try to hold back the crowd which had gathered. In another video shared on social media, which HT has seen, the victim can purportedly be seen sitting cross-legged on the ground while a man kicks him in the face, before he is restrained by a police official.In the videos, the suspects can purportedly also be seen trying to pull the victim out of the police vehicle after the cops took him inside to protect him. They can purportedly be seen trying to push the cops even as a group of about 15 policemen try to control the situation.According to the police, the incident took place around 9.30am when the victim, 25-year-old Lukman, was on his way in a pickup truck from Ghasera in Nuh to deliver buffalo meat to a meat shop owner, Tahir, near Jama Masjid in Gurugram. In the FIR registered at Badshahpur police station, Lukman states that he was near a traffic signal in Badshahpur when several men on at least four motorcyclists started following him.“They tried to stop my vehicle but I sped towards Jama Masjid. A few lanes away from the mosque, near the Trunk Market, the men cornered me and assaulted me with rods. They broke the window panes of the truck and forced me into the truck. They took me to Jail road in Badshahpur and assaulted me, before a police team rescued me,” he said in the FIR. Officers said three policemen deputed at a post near Jail Chowk noticed the commotion and confronted the suspects, who manhandled the policemen and broke the window panes of the police vehicle, before fleeing. The victim suffered at least seven injuries. Sandeep Malik, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Sohna, said, “The victim was rescued and taken in a police vehicle by the policemen deputed at the check post. Since they were outnumbered, additional force was sent and the victim was taken to Civil Hospital. It is not certain if the victim was attacked on suspicion of transporting beef or some other reason. The reason would be known after suspects are arrested.” The arrested suspect has been identified as Pradeep Yadav, 26, a resident of Rajiv Nagar.According to Tahir, the meat shop owner, “Lukman has been supplying meat in the market for a few years. I received a call from him around 9.30am when he informed me that he was being chased. I immediately made several calls to the police but the team arrived an hour late. Lukman was beaten up in the Trunk Market and then he was bundled in his pick-up truck and taken to Badshahpur, where he was again beaten up. This attack has happened a day before Eid and it is an attempt to disturb communal harmony.”The ACP, however, denied the police team reached late. “One of the teams was deployed at a check post nearby and reached within minutes. These allegations are not correct. Our team took the victim to the hospital after rescuing him. No communal link has yet been found yet in the investigation,” said ACP Malik.A team from the City police station also visited the lane near the Trunk Market near Jama Masjid, the police said.The meat from the pick-up truck has been to a laboratory for testing, they added. An FIR was registered against the unidentified suspects under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 427 (mischief causing damage) of Indian Penal Code at Badshahpur police station on Friday, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/truck-driver-transporting-meat-beaten-up-by-several-men-in-gurugram-fir-lodged/story-yraklQHt4Sc17vDiItheuM.html

Health officials said this was due to several patients not disclosing their contacts, citing social stigma and other reasons, which increased the risk of the virus spreading further.“Some patients do not even reveal the places they have visited. We encourage patients to provide as much information as possible to help track their contacts, who are at risk of contracting the virus and spreading it further. But sometimes, patients do not cooperate as they don’t want more relatives to be hospitalised,” said the official.Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said patients needed to cooperate to help contain the pandemic. “Health department teams are regularly visiting the affected areas, especially micro-containment zones, and motivate residents to share information about their contacts to aid the department’s efforts,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-health-teams-at-a-loss-about-source-of-infection-in-277-cases/story-lXTjOQydagtuQQINPH4c0N.html

Chairing the core group meeting of officers, the DC said that it was in the best interest of public as well as public servants all avoidable influx of public to government offices be restrained. He said that the directorate of governance reforms (DGR), Punjab has developed a PGRS which is an integrated system for grievance redressal pertaining to all government departments via a single technology interface. So, as far as possible, complaints would be entertained through the PGRS. Sharing details, Harkirat Channe, assistant commissioner (grievances), said that the PGRS is accessible to citizens via four modes – web, mobile, Sewa Kendra, and a call centre. Using the online portal, an aggrieved citizen can conveniently file a grievance and receive an assured response to his complaint, she added. She said earlier every department had its grievance redressal mechanism without a standardised workflow for redressal and no defined timeline for resolution and accountability. In contrast, online PGRS has a clear, standardised workflow for grievance redressal, Channe added. She said that it assigns timelines to each officer in the workflow for resolution of the grievance, enables citizens to submit their feedback, and allows escalation of grievances to higher authorities. Channe added that the PGRS portal will provide a 24x7 platform to the public to communicate with the administration and that people will be able to lodge complaints without visiting different offices amid the pandemic outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-district-to-adopt-online-public-grievance-redressal-system-girish-dayalan/story-YcRGogSjmuYh5ptYWIwGhN.html

31-07-2020||Chandigarh||Parents unwilling to send children to schools till October: Chandigarh education dept||: Most parents are unwilling to send their wards to schools even in September and October as per feedback collected by Chandigarh education department till now regarding reopening of schools.The ministry of human resource development (MHRD) had sought a reply from education secretaries of all states and union territories regarding the likely period between August and October when parents will be most comfortable with reopening of schools. The expectations of parents from schools and other feedback were also asked. Schools have sent feedback forms to parents online through Google forms seeking their response.The department is still in the process of conducting the survey, however, according to district education officer (DEO) Harbir Singh Anand, most parents aren’t willing to send their wards to school even in September and October. “In most responses we have received, parents say they are unwilling to send their children to schools till October if the Covid situation isn’t brought under control. Even parents with children studying in board classes aren’t in favour of reopening schools,” the DEO said. However, Anand added that since results hadn’t been compiled properly, it wasn’t possible to quantify it as of now.Earlier, on July 20, the education department had sent a reply that parents of board classes will be willing to send their children to schools from August 15 onwards. However, the feedback wasn’t collected directly from the parents, but, from principals. As per the guidelines of Unlock 3.0, schools will remain closed in August. Officials of the education department confirmed that if the situation remains the same in the city, it is unlikely that schools will reopen in September as well.The department had set the last date for collecting these responses by Thursday. However, following the Unlock 3.0 announcement, the deadline has been extended. Director of school education (DSE), Rubinderjit Singh Brar, said, that the department will have an additional month now before new orders regarding reopening of schools are issued so the department will seek more responses before sending a final response to the ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/parents-unwilling-to-send-children-to-schools-till-october-chandigarh-education-dept/story-G1mowEx3iev367N8bdpGTJ.html
31-07-2020||Chandigarh||46-year-old woman becomes 15th Covid fatality in Chandigarh||A 46-year-old woman tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, two days after she was brought dead to Government Multi Specialty Hospital in Sector 16, Chandigarh.This took the number of fatalities due to the disease in the city to 15, a day after the total number of cases crossed the 1000 mark. As many as nine people have died in July alone. Meanwhile, 35 more cases were added to the UT’s tally on Friday, taking the number of infections to 1,051, of which 369 are active. The number of people cured has climbed to 667 as 20 more patients were discharged.According to the UT health department’s Covid-19 bulletin the deceased woman had a “past history of complaints of acute abdominal pain radiating towards the back. She had no history of fever, cough or any co-morbid conditions”. Her three family contacts and four community contacts have been sampled. Their results are awaited.

31-07-2020||City||Govt tells hospitals to use N-95 masks only during aerosol procedures||New Delhi: The Delhi government has asked its hospitals and the private ones to rationalise the use of N-95 masks in non-Covid areas, with only those performing aerosol generating procedures using it. All others have been asked to use triple layer medical masks “which has almost equal efficacy of protection from droplet particulate matter,” reads a letter from Dr ZSK Marak, the additional director, public health–IV. Referencing the union health ministry guidelines on rational use of personal protective gear, the letter said, “N-95 masks need to be used only during aerosol generating procedures viz. non-invasive ventilation, tracheostomy, intubation, suction etc. All other categories of personnel, not involved in the above procedures, only need to use triple layer medical masks.” It also said that the N-95 masks are “scarce commodity and also much more costlier as compared to triple layer medical mask”. The letter also states that the face shields may be used by frontline staff in certain areas as mentioned in guidelines of the ministry of home affairs. The resident doctors, however, say that this is not enough. “Ideally, everyone in the screening areas should wear N-95 masks because they are directly interacting with people suspected to have the infection. Also, when it comes to the OPDs and general wards, the patient might come to the hospital for other ailments but there is community transmission and anyone can be an asymptomatic carrier,” said Dr Kuch Sharma, member of the Covid resident task force at Lok Nayak hospital and a resident from the department of anaesthesia that treats the most critical Covid-19 patients. Dr Srinivas Rajkumar T, a resident doctor from All India Institute of Medical Sciences who has been raising concerns about the quality of mask at the institute, said, “Even the N-95 mask is not protective against aerosolised viral particles because the pore size is bigger than the size of the viral particle. It works well against larger droplets with the virus. When it comes to the triple layer mask, it filtration efficiency is about 65% against the large droplets and it has air leaks. So, inside a hospital setting it should absolutely not be used. All healthcare workers should get at least an N-95 mask to protect against the infection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-tells-hospitals-to-use-n-95-masks-only-during-aerosol-procedures/story-AmG17N5RtL2Jfv1K2JBeDN.html
31-07-2020||Chandigarh||Guest column: Once Chandigarh MC had fixed deposits of ₹500 crore, writes Pawan Kumar Bansal||The Seventy-fourth Amendment added significant provisions to the Constitution of India for enabling municipalities to function as vibrant tools of local self-government by transfer of funds, functions and functionaries to them. The State Finance Commission, inter-alia, reviews the financial position of the municipalities and makes recommendations to the governor for distribution, between the states and the municipalities, of the net proceeds of taxes, duties, tolls and fees leviable by the state, assignment of these to the municipalities and for provision of grants-in-aid from the Consolidated Fund of the State.On the basis of recommendation the fourth Delhi Finance Commission, which also functions as such for UT Chandigarh, Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) had hoped for a grant of Rs 1,073 crore in the current year but was allocated a meagre Rs 425 crore. This has been further slashed by 20% last month, bringing down the allocation to Rs 340 crore. As a result, the MC, today, is unable even to undertake basic functions assigned to it under the Twelfth Schedule. There was a time when the Chandigarh MC had a fixed deposit of over Rs 500 cr; in the last six years it has completely dried up.Today, roads are in a state of utter disrepair with wide potholes seen all around. Expenditure on much-flaunted cycle tracks and walkways have gone down the drain with glaring missing links and perfusive tufts of grass and weeds taking over. Only a few sector parks with RWAs have a semblance of maintenance. The city has gone without bus queue shelters, which had been demolished because of some anonymous whimsical brainwave. Segregation, collection and disposal of garbage have failed to take off and the dumping ground at Dadumajra continues to rise higher and higher with the much acclaimed legacy mining only seeing its inauguration. Meanwhile the residents see no respite from the stench and health hazards.Primary schools and health facilities transferred to the MC are a shambles. Its contractual employees have to do without salaries for months. In this situation, the UT administration is only content with issuing directions to the corporation, to raise commensurate funds for its activities and the latter has set up a committee to suggest means to augment its resources. Any such exercise only ends up suggesting levy of additional taxes and fees.Residents already pay a one-time heavy road tax which entirely goes to the UT administration and the Consolidated Fund of India. The MC recently jacked up the house-tax besides levying sewerage cess at the rate of 30% of the water bill. Other recent levies include a cess of nine paise per unit of electricity consumed and imposition of cow cess and liquor cess.Any further levy, by whatever name called, will increase financial burden on the citizens with no commensurate services offered to them. Any such adventurism is, therefore, better avoided. Payment of its dues as per the recommendation of the fourth Delhi Finance Commission, will provide MC adequate funds for performing its mandated functions.It is time for the MC to monetise some of the land that vests with it. The land in Shivalik Enclave (originally falling in the revenue estate of Mauli Jagran) up to the Haryana border can be profitably used in the first instance for building a housing-cum-commercial complex. Besides generating substantial funds, it will beautify the area, which today presents an unseemly sight. Sufficient land is available at different locations for building at least three spacious modern marriage halls with adequate parking. Besides the land price, it will also rake in additional regular revenue.Shops built in Mauli Jagran, AC Fish Market in Sector 43 and those under the second bridge in Sector-17 have remained unallotted all these years. Repeated failure of auctions highlights the urgency of bringing down their reserve prices. An idea mooted at the ‘resources committee’ to permit eateries to temporarily use spaces outside in front for lunch and dinner facilities and charge them appropriately for the same deserves a go-ahead signal. It will generate revenue and also add vive to the otherwise drab market scenes. Leasing out spaces for putting up advertisements and also permitting neon signs on shops can be another source of good revenue. An earlier scheme of handing over of greening and upkeep of road berms and roundabouts to private parties (under CSR) with the permission to display their names now seems to have been forgotten.It is imperative that the UT administration or the MC do not resort to the easy way out of taxing the people further on specious grounds but to undertake an effective exercise to cut all wasteful expenditure like that on shoddy laying of the ubiquitous paver blocks and realise full potential of the existing assets to build a substantial corpus of funds to draw upon for the Corporation’s effective discharge of its functions.pkbchd@gmail.com(The writer is former Union minister and Lok Sabha MP from Chandigarh).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/guest-column-once-chandigarh-mc-had-fixed-deposits-of-500-crore-writes-pawan-kumar-bansal/story-Ou3W0ayA6X0BcYnQ7uyGqM.html

The hospital, however, claimed the body had been mutilated by rats. Jasjot Kaur, 52, wife of Colonel Amarjit Singh Chandok (retired) of Panchkula, was a heart patient and was admitted to the hospital on Wednesday. She died on Thursday and her body was moved to the mortuary. When the family arrived to collect the body for funeral on Friday, they found blood dripping from the sheet in which it was wrapped. Colonel Chandok said on enquiring about it from the hospital management, he got “no satisfactory answer”. Suspecting that his wife’s organs had been removed illegally, he informed police.Dera Bassi tehsildar Navpreet Singh Shergill rushed to the spot along with the local police and moved Kaur’s body to the mortuary of the Dera Bassi civil hospital. Hospital director Surinderpal Singh Bedi said: “The woman’s cheek was bitten off by rats. We have sacked the mortuary caretaker and are trying to find out how it happened. Allegations made by the family are baseless.”The tehsildar said an inquiry has been initiated. “A board of doctors will conduct an autopsy to establish the truth,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/inquiry-marked-as-woman-s-body-found-partially-mutilated-at-private-hospital-s-morgue-in-mohali/story-LwqJoag3hw3HShPIj2oCZP.html
31-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots: Court denies bail to men accused of killing man near Farooqia Masjid||A Delhi court has denied bail to four persons accused of murdering a man near Farooqia Masjid during the north-east Delhi riots on February 25, while stating that “it is common knowledge that namaz can be offered even in an open place” even as their counsel contended that the deceased man had not gone to the mosque since it was under construction.Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav rejected the bail pleas of Ashok Kumar, Ajay alias Monu, Jitender and Shubham, accused of the murder of one Zakir, who was killed in Dayalpur during the riots.Appearing for the accused persons, advocate Rakshpal Singh contended that his clients were falsely implicated in this matter as he is the resident of the same locality. He said that one of the witnesses was “planted” and although one of the accused persons was seen in the CCTV camera footage, he was merely trying to defend himself by an attack from the riotous mob of other community. He also stated that the deceased person had not gone to offer namaz at Farooqia Masjid as contended by his brother, also a witness in the case, as it was under construction and there was no roof on it.He had also said that the statement of his brother is contradictory as there are two different times when the deceased person had gone to the mosque.However, the court said, “As regards the argument of learned counsel for the applicant that deceased could not have gone to Farooqia Masjid to offer namaz because it was under construction, it is common knowledge that the namaz can be offered even in an open place”.It also noted that there was an “apparent time difference of about two hours when the deceased had gone to offer namaz at Farooqia Masjid”.However, it said that it was clearly evident that the witness was not present at the scene of the crime when the murder had taken place and his statement was recorded almost after two months of the incident and as such, “this minor variation at this stage was insignificant”.The judge, while rejecting the bail plea on July 29, said that the offence was very grave. It said that the autopsy report of the deceased showed that he received as many as 22 injuries, out of which seven were so grave in nature that each one was sufficient to cause the death of any person.It said that such finding speaks volumes about the intensity of the dastardly act committed by the riotous mob during the communal riots.It also said that the accused persons were present with the riotous mob at the spot at the time of the incident and thus the riots appeared to have been caused in an organised manner.“It is also common knowledge that communal riots create fear in the mind of the public at large and also affect the persons who suffer the loss of life or property, which cannot be compensated in any way,” the court said in a six-page order.The police contended that the accused persons were arrested for the murder of one Zakir (mentioned only by his first name). He was brutally attacked and stabbed by the riotous mob on February 25.It also said that during the analysis of the CCTV camera footage of a shop in the area, it found that the riotous mob had caught and severely beaten three Muslim boys; and the accused Ashok Kumar was seen carrying scissors tied to a stick while Ajay alias Monu was carrying a sword.The Special Public Prosecutor said that Shubham was seen carrying a stick (palta) and Jitender was seen pelting stones and as such the riotous mob was armed with “deadly weapons”. He further contended that the accused persons were part of the unlawful assembly/riotous mob that had inflicted severe injuries upon Zakir, which ultimately resulted in his death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-court-denies-bail-to-men-accused-of-killing-man-near-farooqia-masjid/story-SCyNZhk91uz4HwN2wPbBRL.html
31-07-2020||City||North-east Delhi riots: HC quizzes officer over circular to investigators||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Friday asked the Delhi Police to produce before it “five communications issued on receipt of any intelligence input” after special commissioner Praveer Ranjan told the court that directing personnel to be “careful” while making arrests in connection with the north-east Delhi riots was a “routine practice”. The court was hearing a plea by the families of two victims of the February riots, challenging the July 8 circular by Ranjan. The plea, filed by advocate Mehmood Pracha on the basis of a news report, had sought quashing of the circular. “According to the news report, the special commissioner had given out a circular that there was a degree of resentment in the Hindu community against the arrest of certain Hindu persons, and directing investigating officers that they should be careful in the future when making arrests, and that arrests of persons should be made only after discussion of the evidence with special public prosecutors who have been appointed to represent the police in these cases,” the plea had said. Justice Suresh Kait, who is hearing the plea, also asked Ranjan to explain the need for issuing such a circular, while terming the communication “mischievous”. Kait said officers already know what is to be done and how the investigation should be carried out and noted that there was no provision in the CrPC for issuing such an order. “People are arrested and due action is taken in accordance with law. Police officers know their job and no instruction is required to them for the investigation,” the court remarked. On Friday, the court queried if the police issued such orders in other cases as well. Replying to this, Ranjan said this was a normal practice to sensitise personnel. He said whenever any complaint or input comes to his knowledge, such a communication is issued, as was done on July 8. He said all riot-related cases had been registered before the July 8 letter, so no prejudice was caused to the members of any community. “An intelligence input was received by the agency and whenever such input is received, we sensitise our officers so that they exercise due care and precaution during the investigation,” he said. Following this, the court directed Ranjan to place before it within two days five such orders or letters, which he or his predecessor has issued, and listed the matter for further hearing on August 7. When advocate Amit Mahajan, representing the Delhi Police, contended that the petition was “highly mischievous”, the judge shot back “this letter (of special CP) is also mischievous. Tell me what was the need to issue this letter?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/north-east-delhi-riots-hc-quizzes-officer-over-circular-to-investigators/story-CjSSmtcHp3uNbn0qEhH3ZP.html

Also, three under-construction illegal colonies at Jassiyan road were razed during the drive conducted in the areas falling under Zone D of the civic body. MC officials said that two complexes have been sealed as the owner of one building failed to submit the change of land use (CLU) charges, while the other building has been constructed by ignoring the parking norms.Further illegal portions of three buildings were razed including an ice cream booth which was constructed on a road portion. Assistant Town Planner (ATP), Zone D, Mohan Singh said, “Notices were issued to the owners asking them to take corrective steps but they failed to do so, following which a drive was conducted against illegal constructions on Friday. Three under construction colonies that were being constructed illegally have also been razed.

31-07-2020||Delhi||North-east Delhi riot accused gets bail||A Delhi court granted bail to a man accused in two cases related to the north-east Delhi riots, while stating that “the complainants have been made to identify the accused persons as per their own convenience by the police and he was not seen in the video footage”. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav granted bail to Deepak (single name), arrested in connection with the violence that happened under the Shastri Park police station, on a personal bond of ₹20,000. “Multiple statements of complainants were recorded in the matter from time to time. It was only on June 2 --i.e at the time of arrest of the applicant (Deepak) -- that the complainants were called by the police to the spot and for the first time that they identified him. Whether that identification is enough to connect the accused in the matter is a matter for trial as the complainants have been made to identify the accused persons as per their own convenience by the police,” the judge said in his order on July 29. Deepak was arrested on June 2 for allegedly being a part of unlawful assembly, rioting and arson. Appearing for the accused, his counsel had contended that in both cases, the charge sheet had been filed but his client has not been named as an accused. He also contended that there was a delay in lodging the FIR. On the contrary, the special public prosecutor contended that the call detail records location of the accused has been found to be of the scene of crime. He has been identified by complainant on June 2 --at the time of his arrest -- and he was also identified by constable Amit the same day. The court also said the identification of the accused by beat constable Amit (single name) is also a “weak kind of evidence”. It noted that the other three accused in the case, who have been released on bail, are from the same locality and till date, no complaint against them has been recorded in any police station regarding them threatening witnesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/north-east-delhi-riot-accused-gets-bail/story-Ig7uv4FGLMkmohfOMn8BNI.html

31-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s Sukhna Lake to remain shut on weekends||Alarmed over 600 Covid-19 cases reported in July, the UT administration on Friday finally put in place a slew of fresh restrictions to control overcrowding and congestion in public places, including Sukhna Lake and markets, in Chandigarh.Even as it kept night curfew timings unchanged, the administration banned the entry of visitors to Sukhna Lake on Saturdays and Sundays and decided to bring back odd-even rule for opening shops in crowded markets besides restricting timings for market operations across the city.UT administrator VPS Badnore took the decision after detailed discussions with medical experts, senior officers and public representatives.The administration was facing flak for its inability to ensure social distancing as crowds swelled at Sukhna Lake after lockdown restrictions were lifted, particularly on weekends. The administration had earlier too considered imposing restrictions, such as entry fee and token system, but in the Friday’s war room meeting, it decided to go for weekend closure of the lake.NIGHT CURFEW STAYS, MARKET TIMINGS CURTAILEDUnder the ‘Unlock 3’ guidelines, announced on July 29, the ministry of home affairs removed restrictions on the movement of individuals during night. However, the UT administration has decided that night curfew will continue from 10pm to 5am. Modifying its July 1 decision to allow opening of markets and restaurants from 10am to 9pm, the administration curtailed the timings by an hour. The new timings will be 10am to 8pm. For the eateries, the timings will continue from 10am to 9pm.COMMITTEE TO DECIDE ON ODD-EVENThe administration has constituted a committee under the UT finance secretary to examine crowded markets where the odd-even rule could be reimposed. Under it, odd-numbered shops are opened on odd dates and even ones alternately.In earlier phases of the lockdown, the administration had imposed the formula in all congested markets, including Patel Market in Sector 15, Gandhi Market in Sector 18, Sadar Bazar and Palika Bazar in Sector 19, Shastri Market in Sector 22, Janata Market in Sector 27, Krishna Market in Sector 41 and Rehri Market in Sector 46.Questioning the move, Charanjiv Singh, chairman, Chandigarh Beopar Mandal, said: “It is better to enforce social distancing norms rather than opening shops alternately.” UT adviser Manoj Parida said the odd-even rule will be introduced only in those markets where social distancing norms are flagrantly violated. “The committee will make surprise inspections and decide. Market associations can join hands to avoid this hardship by strictly following norms.”THREE MICRO-CONTAINMENT ZONESUT adviser Manoj Parida said keeping in view spike in cases, three new micro-containment zones are under consideration. Under the new policy, even three to four houses can be declared as containment zones. The affected area committee will identify these zones.Meanwhile, deputy commissioner Mandip Singh Brar said the drive against people found without masks has been intensified. Over 8,000 challans have been issued and nearly ₹45 lakh have been recovered from the violators, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-sukhna-lake-to-remain-shut-on-weekends/story-B9tYlOErip0AMR9y6tLA3J.html
31-07-2020||City||In separate accidents, two cyclists killed in Delhi||New Delhi: Two persons travelling by bicycles were killed in separate accidents in Delhi on Wednesday. One of the victims was a 23-year-old woman riding pillion behind her husband in north Delhi’s Majnu Ka Tilla and the other was a 51-year-old man cycling home in West Delhi.While the Delhi traffic Police are yet to analyse the number of bicyclists killed in road accidents this year or 2019, at least 56 people riding bicycles were killed in accidents in the national capital in 2018, as per data compiled by the ministry of road transport and highways. WOMAN RIDING PILLION ON CYCLEIdentified by her first name, Baby, the 23-year-old woman, lived with her husband in Ghaziabad and worked as a mason. “They would cycle to their workplace. She would sit on the carrier and her husband, Prince Kumar, would ride the bicycle,” a senior police officer said. Late Wednesday afternoon, the couple was returning from Sadar Bazar home when their bicycle was hit by a truck near Majnu Ka Tilla on Outer Ring Road. In his police complaint, Kumar said the truck was being driven rashly, which led to his wife’s death. “My wife and the bicycle got caught in the truck’s front wheel and were dragged for a distance,” Kumar told the police. The truck driver, 51-year-old Sabir, stopped the vehicle and came to check on the victim, but she was declared dead on arrival at the Sushrut Trauma Centre.While Sabir was arrested after being booked for causing death due to negligence and rash driving, Monika Bhardwaj, deputy commissioner of police (north), said an initial probe has revealed that Baby’s stole got entangled with the truck, causing her to come under the vehicle’s wheel. HIT AND RUNThe exact timing of the other mishap remains unclear, but it took place under the Mayapuri Metro station on Wednesday while the 51-year-old man, Harcharan, was riding back home to a slum in Kirti Nagar. The police had received a call from a passerby Hemant Kumar who saw Harcharan, a labour worker, injured on the road while the mangled remains of his bicycle lay nearby. Before Hemant took the injured man to a hospital where he was declared brought dead, he spoke to an eyewitness who had apparently seen the accident take place. “According to the eyewitness who described the accident to Kumar, the offending vehicle was an orange bus plying on route number 73. We don’t know either the eyewitness, or the registration number of the bus, but we are checking the list of all such route number buses that plied on that road around that time,” said Deepak Purohit, DCP (west). Amit Bhatt, a road safety expert and the executive director of World Research Institute, said that while the epidemic offered a chance to revive cycling, such accidents involving cyclists could lead to new cyclists shifting away from this mode of transport. “Those who have to cycle out of necessity rather than by choice will continue to suffer,” said Bhatt, adding that there was an urgent need to have dedicated lanes for cyclists. “Whether these lanes can be arranged or not, it all depends on government’s priorities,” said Bhatt. The traffic police said that they have been writing regularly to civic agencies to construct more rumble strips and reduce speed limits. Taj Hassan, special commissioner, Delhi traffic police, said there are innumerable points of clash between cyclists and other motorists in the city. “There is a constant conflict between them due to lack of space on the roads. But we are doing our best by keeping the overall speed on the roads low by issuing thousands of fines,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-separate-accidents-two-cyclists-killed-in-delhi/story-I5Iz2B1o9GKr04ldpMCIwK.html

The accused, identified as Santosh Tivrekar, had been arrested for attempted murder by RCF police on June 29.

Tivrekar escaped from the quarantine centre on July 13, and the police have been on the look-out for him. “We asked the security guards to keep an eye on him. However, due to safety issues, the guards were asked to stay outside the isolation centre.

On June 23, Ajit Kishori, a manager at the State Bank of India’s (SBI) local head office in Bank Square close by was walking on the cycle track after lunch when he spotted a severed foot wrapped in a newspaper. Another one was found soon with a foetus in a polythene bag nearby when police searched the area for clues.Autopsies revealed that the body parts had been severed after death. The foetus, estimated to be eight months old, had injury marks around its head and neck and death had occurred due to haemorrhagic shock (extreme blood loss due to broken blood vessels). Police, however, were not able to ascertain if the foetus was discarded after delivery or forcible abortion. Three-month records of pregnant women were also sought by police from hospitals to identify the deceased.The body parts and the foetus had been sent for DNA profiling, but despite reminders reports had not been received, said deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and UT police spokesperson Charanjit Singh. Robbery/ ATM thefts remain unsolved No headway by the police was also made in the July 27 daylight robbery of ₹3lakh from a Western Union branch owner in Sector 27, even as the accused were caught on camera walking through the corridor with the cash.On the intervening night of June 24 and June 25 an attempt was made to break open an SBI ATM at the Sector 44 market. The miscreants had sprayed paint on a CCTV camera installed inside the ATM booth and had cut the alarm wire. Not just this, on June 18, an unidentified man with his face covered stole ₹7.65 lakh from a Union Bank of India ATM in Kishangarh.Temple theft On June 4, two masked men broke into the Shri Sanatan Dharam Pracheen Shiv Mandir in Sector 8 and decamped with gold and silver jewellery and ₹7,000 in cash. Though CCTV cameras captured the act, no arrests were made. Snatchings yet be checked After a lull during lockdown, the number of snatchings too went up, with 10 incidents reported this month from city including one attempt. Motorcycle borne miscreants are with impunity targeting women out on walks and escaping. Police were also unable to identify a masked man who on July 21 attempted to snatch a bag with ₹10 lakh from two cashiers of Bitta petrol pump opposite Kalagram who had gone to NAC Manimajra to deposit the money. One of the employees had also sustained injuries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/severed-human-feet-atm-thefts-crimes-spike-after-lockdown-but-police-clueless/story-yKGVpyUva232o8MlH2e9bL.html

Alleging that only six out of the 76 beds earmarked for critical patients in the district were available on July 29, Manuke and other AAP leaders demanded that the administration should increase the number of beds for such patients. The AAP leaders said that there are 761 beds in the district (including 450 in government facilities and 311 in private hospitals) of which 685 have been reserved for level 1 and 2 patients.“The situation is serious and worrisome as maximum coronavirus cases and covid-related fatalities are being reported from the district. Under these circumstances, shortage of beds for vulnerable patients is a cause for concern. This scenario has resulted in tragic deaths of patients who were in dire need of care but didn’t receive it on time. On July 24, a 45-year old businessman was in need of critical care but couldn’t avail it as there were no beds available in Dayanand Medical College and hospital. He was later taken to the civil hospital where he succumbed to the disease,” Manuke said.Ludhiana civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said, “The administration is already working to increase the number of beds in the district. While DMC hospital is increasing its capacity with 150 more beds, the facility is also being arranged at Lord Mahavira Homeopathic College in Haibowal area. We are working to increase the number of beds for level-2 and 3 patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/increase-beds-for-critical-covid-patients-in-ludhiana-dist-mla-manuke/story-UuFJRNoyaOcm9Nsw19ilLO.html

The rest remained unspent,” the AG notedThe report added that in these circumstances, the purpose of ULBs to provide basic amenities to residents had been forfeited, despite taxes being collected from them. The MC had also failed to utilise the taxpayer’s money, deprived the poor of benefits and did not build community toilets, the report read.No EWS flat, plot allottedThough the civic body approved 50 building plans for group housing projects and licenses to colonies in the past two years, not even a single EWS flat/ plot had been allotted to EWS category, the report said. This happened, it added, even as the civic body collected ₹13 crore for approval of building plans.The MC authorities failed to collect ₹6 crore including arrears of past three years for water supply and sewerage charges. It also failed to recover Rs 5 crore as annual and installation charges of 102 mobile towers from 12 mobile companies till March 2019.When contacted, MC executive officer Sandeep Tewari said, “I joined office two months back and these issues are old issues, but I will try to streamline them and make sure proper basic amenities are provided to the residents,” he said.Community toilets not builtThough the Zirakpur civic body received ₹8 lakh for the construction of community toilets/public toilets within the city under the Swachh Bharat Mission (U) in March 2018, no work was done, according to the AG’s audit. The civic body also collected ₹15 crore as compounding/regularisation charges by regularising unauthorised plots/buildings and unauthorised colonies but it had not deposited ₹75.2 lakh (5%) under the social infrastructure fund meant to create better planning, the report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ag-report-slams-zirakpur-mc-for-failing-to-spend-58-funds/story-SQlZ24namvHNuQ4BWYqmwM.html

31-07-2020||Chandigarh||Readers’ take: What’s the harm in being driven by creativity?||Distraction on roads not recommendedGood artwork is worth admiration, which is why the vehicles with artwork should not be registered. The human brain is created in such a way that it automatically shifts its attention to something attractive. However, this distraction while driving is not recommended, especially in traffic. The beauty of art is that it has no boundaries. An artist can do wonders with the available resources to spread his or her message. In order to promote artwork in Chandigarh, the UT administration should think of painting the sides of the showrooms with social messages.Pranav SharmaArt should be displayed in public placesCommon sense is behind every act by the legislatures and rules framed thereunder. Going by the spirit behind Section 52 of the Motor Vehicle Act, the learned high court judge did not see any violation in allowing registration of a car with artwork. Public transport, including rail coaches, bear huge advertisements in colour. Senior officers should not blindly support dealing clerks and let them bother the public on flimsy grounds, forcing them to approach courts for grievance redressal, thereby adding to their work overload. Art is the expression or application of creative skill and imagination, especially through a visual medium like painting or sculpture. ‘Omnis ars naturae imitatio est’(all art is imitation of nature) and onus is on one and all to promote it. Art should be displayed at public places/buildings, as has been done at the Chandigarh railway station. Artwork on private and public vehicles should be incentivised to add to the vibrancy of the city. District level art competitions should be organised and winning entries displayed.Lalit Bharadwaj, PanchkulaOrganise exhibitions to display artworkln the name of some novel artwork on their flashy cars in peculiar colours, the owners will distract the attention of other drivers of vehicles on roads and cause accidents. Registration of such cars is like allowing distracting billboards at traffic crossings appear again. Such artwork should be promoted only at art exhibitions and not on moving cars. SC Luthra Art galleries, kala kendras right forumsAny vehicle displaying art could pose increased risk of accidents as other drivers on the roads could get distracted. Roads are not meant for showcasing artwork but for smooth and safe movement of vehicles and its occupants. As transport authorities are not permitting hoardings and billboards along highways, roads as these distract drivers, HC’s reference to buses and trucks plying intracity can’t be the basis for its order as they represent a minuscule number of vehicles in comparison to the numbers of cars in the city and on main roads, which pose higher risks. Art galleries, kala kendras and air theatres are the right forums for promotion of arts and artists.Anil Vinayak, Amritsar Administration needs to encourage artistsArt, as Brazilian artist Romero Britto puts it, is too important not to share. Art comes to the rescue when words are rendered useless. A car or perhaps any other vehicle, insofar as it displays artwork within the confines of the provisions of law and which, in fact, does not dilute its base colour as appearing in the registration certificate, warrants registration. Automobile and art make a nonpareil combination which, if given effect to, can contribute to the aesthetic value of roads, in addition to endorsing art and expressiveness. The UT administration ought to foster artists by encouraging skill-development courses at concessional rates. Art competitions and showcasing can further facilitate visually appealing work of people. Walls, on which ‘grey’ has become the colour norm, should be used for art exhibitions that render meaning to the term City Beautiful. After all, art is not what one sees but is what one makes others see! Gagandeep SinghCreative expression should be encouragedArt is something that brings colours to life. Creativity is expressed for various reasons, including evoking a response from others or depicting an idea or belief. Why can’t art and cars go together? After all, a car is a masterpiece of mechanical art showcased by the manufacturers. It’s something we own and is a part of our daily life. So, if someone wishes to modify it with art that should be okay. Loving what we have is after all what gives us happiness and calm. It’s time rules should be modified to allow cars with artwork. With regard to administrative purposes, some modifications must be made in the motor vehicles rules to promote art on vehicles. The artwork by the Mexican artist on the Ambassador car in question is simply amazing. Last but not least, Chandigarh has wonderful architectural artwork, thanks to Le Corbusier, so why not take the legacy forward?Komal Sharma, ChandigarhDon’t distract driversCars with artwork should not be registered because these will distract others driving on the roads, which could lead to accidents. Dr Susheela Hooda, Panchkula If ho-ho buses can have art, why not cars? Chandigarh administration, from its very inception, has two laws in all spheres of life. One law is for itself and the other for common people. If the registration authority can register the administration’s double-decker hop on-hop off tourist bus with art work, then what’s wrong with an Ambassador car? Why can’t the same authority register a personal car with same sort of artwork on it? When Chandigarh was planned by Le Corbusier in the 1950s. It was too small then with Madhya Marg as its centre. See how the city has grown. But our administration is blindly following the same old rules framed years ago. Change is a must with the passage of time. Gurpreet S Malhotra, Kansal In India, follow the country’s rulesCreative expressions or fancy dress shows are to be held in art galleries and auditoriums, not on the road. These are distractions for other vehicle owners, and can raise road safety issues. The Motor Vehicles Act, as also the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, prohibit change of any, or all, particulars, as mentioned in the certificate of registration, as provided by the manufacturer. Art cars have a substantial following in the Western world, but when in India, the owner needs to follow the laws of the country. Nowhere in our vehicle ownership laws is there a provision for relaxation in laws. Delhiwallahas may love artist Senkoe for the vibrant murals in Lodhi Colony and the Jamia Millia Islamia University, but the roads are not the right place to display creativity. Art in Chandigarh should only be promoted in designated halls. Art always has a place in people’s hearts, but cannot be publicly displayed on the streets, and create chaos.Rajiv Boolchand Jain, Zirakpur, PunjabDon’t discriminate between residents and othersIf UT police cars have paintwork , why not other cars? Does artwork on a white police car not mean the vehicle is altered? One cannot discriminate between citizens and others. Vintage cars in Chandigarh are repainted and run at car rallies in festivals sponsored by the UT administration. Are such vehicles in Chandigarh impounded? Do vehicles of hotels or institutions with artwork or slogans painted on them, amount to altering a vehicle? Likewise, if a public building in UT has a mural or paint displayed on it , does it amount to altering the building? Colour or design improves aesthetic sense. it is time that colour choice blends into the fabric of the City Beautiful as it is not a historic relic. Creative expression must be allowed.Anil Malhotra||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/readers-take-what-s-the-harm-in-being-driven-by-creativity/story-gxCHhS7n9GlCAEL5rA8FxO.html

The DSMB is an independent panel of experts, constituted by the Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL). The DSMB has been approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO). The ICMR is partnering the BBIL in the trials of Covaxin (BBV152 Covid vaccine). “We were advised to close ‘recruitment’ (enrolment of volunteers for the trial) yesterday after the 12 sites, selected for the trials, achieved the sample size of the first phase of trials. We will wait for DSMB nod before embarking on the second phase of trials,” said Dr CM Singh, professor of community and family medicine, also the principal investigator of the trial at AIIMS-Patna. The institute is among 12 other sites the ICMR has approved for the human trial of the vaccine. “We administered the vaccine on 46 people, of which nine have been given its second dose on the 14th day after the first shot of the vaccine. Only three volunteers complained of slight pain at the point of injection. There were no side-effects, which is an indication that the vaccine is safe,” said Dr Singh. “Vaccine is to be given on 0 day and 14. The follow-up sampling to see the level of immunogenicity (ability of a foreign substance, such as an antigen, to provoke an immune response in the body of a human) has to be done on day 14, 28, 42, 104 and 194,” he added. The second phase of the trial will be on 750 people that will be to check the vaccine’s safety and immunogenicity. The ICMR has selected 12 institutes for the trial. They are AIIMS-Delhi, Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad; PGMIS Rohtak; SRM Medical College Hospital and Research Centre, Chennai; AIIMS-Patna, Redkar Hospital, Goa; Gillurkar Multi-specialty Hospital and Research Centre, Nagpur; Sum Hospital, Bhubaneswar; Jeevan Rekha Hospital, Belagavi (Karnataka); King George Hospital, Visakhapatnam; Prakhar Hospital, Kanpur; and Rana Hospital, Gorakhpur.

The women would commit theft early in the morning between 2 am and 4 am and mostly target garments shops. They would lift the shutter of a shop up to 1-2 feet to gain entry, while the pregnant women would keep a watch outside, as they don’t raise immediate suspicion. Chhoti, who is the main conspirator and is six months pregnant hired an auto-rickshaw for ₹1,500, which ferried her to several markets to recce shops.Chhoti then involved other women to commit thefts. The women would lift the shutter of a shop to gain entry while pregnant women would keep a watch outside to trick the police.As per the statements given by these women to the police, they used to sell the stolen items as their husbands are unemployed. These women are slum dwellers who reside in shanties near the railway station in Mullanpur. Auto driver Paras Kumar led to the arrest of the women thieves.Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (ADCP, city 1) Deepak Pareek said that Paras Kumar would pick the women from Mullanpur Dakha in the morning and ferry them around the city to find their target. “The accused had stolen garments worth ₹80,000 from a shop in Salem Tabri area on the intervening night of July 25 and 26. The police have recovered 22 suits from their possession including ₹4,650 in cash, which they had earned by selling the garments,” he added. He added that the accused were captured in the CCTVs installed near the shop. The police circulated the video on social networking sites for the identification of the accused. On Friday the police got information about the gang. The gang had committed a similar crime in November 2019 in Model Town. The accused have confessed their involvement in four such incidents in Ludhiana, Dakha, and Khanna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/garment-shop-robbery-three-pregnant-women-thieves-conned-cops/story-u4QWRwULt2PamXWGgyQ9YO.html
31-07-2020||Delhi||Tablighi Jamaat: HC seeks Centre, police’s response on foreigners’ pleas to quash FIRs||The Delhi high court Friday sought the response of the Centre and the Delhi Polie on pleas by 24 foreigners seeking the quashing of FIRs against them for attending a Tablighi Jamaat congregation in south Delhi’s Nizamuddin in March and allegedly carrying out missionary activities in violation of visa norms and breaching the prevalent Cvoid-19 restrictions.Justice Anuj Jairam Bhambhani asked the authorities to file their status reports before the next date of hearing, August 10.The court was informed senior advocate Rebecca John that these 24 foreigners, who have filed two separate petitions, have already admitted their guilt in the FIR lodged by the crime branch of Delhi Police and pleaded for lenient punishment under the provisions of plea bargaining.John told the court that they were allowed to walk free on payment of varying fines and pleading guilty for minor offences related to the Covid-19 lockdown violations. However, they are not able to return to their countries due to the pendency of other FIRs lodged at the Seelampur police station.She contended that the police cannot lodge separate FIRs for the same alleged offence and they are unable to go back due to look out circulars (LOCs) against them. She said while the first FIR was lodged on March 31, this second FIR by the Seelampur police was registered on April 1, as they were staying in a masjid there and the police then took them to a quarantine centre.The petitioners have sought quashing of two FIRs registered at police station Seelampur under various sections of IPC and the Epidemic Diseases Act.The petitioners said the FIRs registered at Seelampur are untenable in law in light of foreign nationals having entered plea bargaining.At least 9,000 people, including the foreign nationals participated in the religious congregation in Nizamuddin. Later, the tablighi headquarters became a Covid-19 hot spot many of the attendees had by then travelled to various parts of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/tablighi-jamaat-hc-seeks-centre-police-s-response-on-foreigners-pleas-to-quash-firs/story-idf4vBvSjo24LWTK0mtAUL.html

The judge also asked him not to leave the city without prior intimation to the police.The court had earlier granted him interim relief, asking the police not to take any coercive measure against him till July 31.Khan sought anticipatory bail on the grounds that he is a public servant and a senior citizen aged 72 years, who suffers from heart disease and hypertension and is highly susceptible to Covid-19, which can have fatal consequences for a person of his age.The plea has sought directions to the police that in the event of his arrest, he be immediately released on bail and that no coercive measures be taken against him.

Instead, they have demanded a judicial probe by a sitting judge of the Punjab and Haryana high court. Congress MP Partap Singh Bajwa tweeted, “Captain Amarinder ji. If you really want to unearth the truth behind the demise of 21 people due to spurious liquor and bring justice to their families, nothing other than a time-bound inquiry by a sitting judge from the Punjab and Haryana high court will suffice.”Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said, “The CM should not only hand over the responsibility of inquiring into the hooch tragedy to the high court, but also include the Rs 5,600 crore excise revenue loss, the sale of illegal liquor directly from distilleries, sale of spurious liquor from illegal distilleries and bottling plants patronised by Congress leaders and inter-state liquor smuggling too.”Cheema added the present inquiry ordered by the CM also did not have the required terms of reference to book the real culprits. “Vague terms of reference, which are limited to the incidents have been given. In such a situation no officer will go after Congress leaders who patronise liquor smuggling and sale of spurious liquor,” he claimed.Leader of opposition in Punjab assembly and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Harpal Singh Cheema has held the CM responsible for the tragedy. “Thanks to the freedom given by the state government, the liquor mafia is not only damaging the state exchequer, but also playing with the precious lives of the people,” he said, adding that his party demanded a time-bound probe by a sitting judge of the high court. “Apart from shifting the probe to a sitting judge, we demand the grieving families be given relief of at least Rs 5 lakh per family,” said Ranjit Singh Brahmpura, president, Shiromani Akali Dal (Taksali).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/political-parties-reject-magisterial-inquiry-into-hooch-deaths-seek-judicial-probe-by-hc-judge/story-y7iUZK7WV7YklIqCECSm4M.html
31-07-2020||City||Bir theft: Pre-arrest bail plea of two dera followers rejected||Faridkot The court of additional district and sessions judge Harbans Singh Lekhi on Friday dismissed the anticipatory bail plea of two accused dera followers in newly-added offences in the case of theft of a bir of the Guru Granth Sahib in 2015. A ‘bir’ was stolen from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village gurdwara on June 1, 2015. A First Information Report (FIR) was registered the next day under sections 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) and 380 (theft) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Bajakhana police station. On July 4 this year, the special investigation team (SIT) probing sacrilege cases arrested seven dera followers in the case. Two of these accused, Sukhjinder Singh and Shakti Singh, were released as they had already got bail from a Mohali court. On July 6, the SIT filed a charge-sheet in court, adding sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 414 (assisting in concealing stolen property) 451 (trespassing in order to commit an offence) and 201(causing disappearance of evidence) of the IPC against eleven accused.As the Mohali court had granted bail to Shakti and Sukhjinder in only two sections, they moved court, fearing arrest in the newly-added sections. Five other accused have been granted bail. Vinod Monga, the counsel for dera followers, argued that accused applicants were not required for custodial interrogation for the newly-added offences, but they are were ready to join investigation. The judge said, “I do not consider it a fit case for grant of pre-arrest bail to accused applicants, because if the concession of the anticipatory bail is granted to them, then certainly it will hamper the investigation, as some other co-accused are yet to be arrested. In such a scenario, the rulings referred to by the learned counsel for the accused applicants are not applicable to the facts of the present case.” “We will initiate the legal process to take custody of Shakti and Sukhjinder as their custodial interrogation is required for the newly-added offences,” said deputy inspector general of police Ranbir Singh Khatra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bir-theft-pre-arrest-bail-plea-of-two-dera-followers-rejected/story-ksght7Bp13hP1TOgW3JjcP.html

Excited much? But opening any public space amid the pandemic means taking extra care and ensuring safety regulations for visitors and staff alike. And it certainly means more precautions. So when you visit the museum next, be sure to wear a face mask, which is mandatory for everyone visiting the museum!   Friends Museocamera is opening soon. Today we were absolutely honoured and privileged to welcome one of the most celebrated Indian sculptor K. S.Radhakrishnan #special guest during lockdownA post shared by  Museo Camera 📸 (@museo_camera) on Jul 21, 2020 at 7:57am PDTSome of the other measures include daily temperature screening of all the staff members, and visitors. Hand sanitisers have been placed at convenient spots across the museum. UV-C sanitising of all common areas is taking place twice, and for restrooms it’s scheduled thrice, every day. This is being done to ensure that no visitor or staff is present during the treatment. Group tours have been limited to six or less. And there are even restrictions on the number of visitors to the museum and the galleries, so that social distancing can be followed.Museums and cultural spaces have been one of the worst hit as they were always in a precarious financial situation, opines Aditya Arya, founder of the museum. “The Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown could not have come at a worse time for the museum. After the public opening in August last year, we were just beginning to establish ourselves as an important institution for photography and art lovers in this part of the world. The closure of the museum brought all our revenue generating activities to a grinding halt. It is a challenging time for us but we are optimistic that we will be back to normal.” And visitors are kicked, too. As soon as the news of reopening was up, social media became abuzz with excited visitors expressing their joy. “This is a world class museum that India can actually boast of. So happy to see it starting again,” says Dilshad Master Kumar, a Gurugrammer. And Gayatri Singh, another Gurugrammer, adds, “Looking forward to engaging shows at this amazing museum that we all are proud of!” Manisha Seam, a Gurugram resident and a professional, says, “I’m very willing to visit the museum with friends and fellow photo enthusiasts. It’s re-opening is a boon. We must preserve heritage of all kinds, and this museum is a class apart in its offerings and experiences.”The museum, dedicated to the art and history of photography, was formed as a partnership between India Photo Archive Foundation and Municipal Corporation of Gurugram. Arya adds, “I don’t want the future generations to read about our initiative in history books as one the most important and significant museum which was created by crowdfunding and a unique public private partnership which did not survive the pandemic. It will be sad not only for Gurugram but the art community to loose this iconic landmark museum. Museo Camera also holds the unique distinction of being one-of-its-kind crowd funded museum in India. The museum interior was funded with donations received from well-wishers.” Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/unlock-3-0-gurugram-s-camera-museum-to-reopen-albeit-with-mandatory-safety-norms/story-7qSDIHYQt2wifTX6k4SHaJ.html

He asked residents to not pay bogus electricity bills and file a criminal case against the Maharashtra State Electricity Board instead. After receiving complaints from residents about the increased bills, Somaiya held a press conference in Thane asking residents to not pay the bills. “If they cancel your electricity connection for not paying the bills, file a criminal offence against the Electricity Board.

MLC Niranjan Davkhare and Somaiya have put forth some demands for the electricity board, “The hike in bills implemented from April 1 need to be taken back. The first 100 units should be waived off and the next 300 units should be at a 50% discount. During this lockdown period a time frame of six months should be given to pay the bill,” said Davkhare. Somaiya also took potshots against Sanjay Raut and Nitin Raut, “Both Sanjay Raut and Nitin Raut indulge in dramatics, Nitin Raut himself had requested for ₹20,000 crores to pay salaries of the electricity board staff.

The petitioner society approached the court seeking a restraint on members from slaughtering animals on the premise in light of previous high court orders that ban slaughtering of animals outside the abattoir at Deonar or any other place designated by the BMC during the festival. After the BMC informed the court that it had not issued any permission to the members, the court directed the police to depute constables. A division bench of justice R D Dhanuka and justice V G Bisht while hearing a petition filed by Lingam Battula and other members of Unnati Cooperative Housing Society at Mahim (W) was informed by advocates Siddh Vidya and Ashish Verma that despite high court orders restricting slaughtering of animals in private properties, the society had an apprehension that some members may carry out slaughtering on the occasion of Bakri Eid. Vidya informed the court that as the festival was observed over a period of three days the court should direct the authorities to restrict slaughtering of animals in the society on all three days. The advocates also sought similar orders for the entire city. On its part senior counsel, Anil Sakhare for the BMC informed the court that the civic body which is responsible for issuing licenses for the slaughtering of animals on festive occasions had not issued any license to any of the society members. Following an order by a previous bench of the HC in 2017, the BMC had made it mandatory for devotees to secure a license before undertaking to slaughter of sacrificial animals. The order was further beefed up by another bench in 2019 wherein slaughtering in homes and private properties were restricted due to health and hygiene issues. The bench had directed that slaughtering of sacrificial animals could take place only in the Deonar abattoir but after it was informed that such an arrangement would lead to chaos, it had directed the BMC to identify areas in each ward where slaughtering could take place under the supervision of civic officials. After hearing the submissions, the court directed the Mumbai police to depute two constables at the society during the duration of the festival to ensure that the members do not violate court orders. The bench, however, refused to pass orders on the prayer seeking a blanket order for the entire city and directed the petitioners to resort to appropriate proceedings in the form of public interest litigation for the same and disposed of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-directs-mumbai-police-to-deoute-cops-at-mahim-society-to-curb-slaughtering/story-Qk7Ea2gyh3NZDa7n1C5W2M.html

They are aware that numbers of participants can’t be fudged on a live social media programme,” he said. “The decision to call it off is just a face-saving exercise.”Bihar continues to reel under floods, which has now engulfed 108 blocks of 14 districts, affecting 40 lakh people. It is also battling the surge in the Covid-19 cases.The JD(U) has been under fire from the opposition for low testing rate for Covid-19 and also for aping the BJP in deciding to hold virtual rallies. “The BJP started it. But their efforts led to the spread of coronavirus infecting 75 out of the 100 office bearers who were tested at the party office. Now, JD(U) has followed suit, but conditions are not favourable,” leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav had said while pushing for postponement of polls.While the JD(U)-BJP want polls as scheduled, NDA ally and LJP chief Chirag Paswan has also echoed Tejashwi’s concerns and cautioned the Election Commission to take a considered decision. On July 17, the opposition parties jointly petitioned the EC, pointing out that Covid-19 cases were likely to touch 1 million mark by October-November and the election exercise could just turn into a “super spreader event”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/face-saving-exercise-rjd-after-jd-u-cancels-nitish-kumar-s-virtual-rally/story-CnGVxsypQELjebm5HxTKmM.html

The strike, seeking regularisation, has been on since June 19, with the doctors working with isolation wards, covid-testing, flu corners and district covid control rooms (etc) since the outbreak of the coronavirus.“There are no doctors and pharmacy officers in our dispensary.

Lasoi has a population of 6,500.Similarly, Shabir, husband of Rubina sarpanch Sherwani Kot village near Malerkotla, said, “Women are more the worst-affected.

We will have a look at the situation by August-end. The pandemic has transformed the centuries-old, chalk–talk teaching model to one driven by technology. It is essential to continue learning. Open-source digital learning solutions and Learning Management Software will be adopted, so that teachers can go online. Building capacity of students is essential.PARENTS ARE SEEKING REFUND OF EXAM FEE. Neither the board nor the parents are at fault, and exams have been cancelled across the country. I will hold a meeting with the officers before any decision. HOW WILL YOU INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE EXAMINATION SYSTEM? Digital tools can help in achieving transparency, efficiency and accountability in the examination system, but public access to information is key. I will make sure that with open data, officials and the public-at-large can monitor educational progress. Bottlenecks and malpractices will be dealt with. HOW DO YOU SEE THE NEW EDUCATION POLICY? I have not read it in detail. I believe it is the state government’s prerogative on how to implement it. DO YOU FORESEE ANY PROBLEMS IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION? I will not like to comment. CURRICULUM NEEDS CONSTANT REVISION AND SOMETIMES CONTROVERSIES ARISE. WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS? Information and experiences should be added, deleted or adjusted to the curriculum to reflect prevailing beliefs or findings. PUNJAB HAS ADARSH SCHOOLS, THEN NORMAL GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS AND MERITORIOUS SCHOOLS. IS THIS MULTIPLICITY DESIRABLE? The idea is to cater to children, according to caliber. Adarsh schools provide admission to brilliant students, even if they are poor. I will check on these schools. On handing these schools back to the government, I will consult my officers. PSEB IS IN A FINANCIAL MESS. RECENTLY, IT PROPOSED SCRAPPING OF 400 POSTS. ANY REVIVAL PLAN IN MIND? I will first assess our finances and then control expenses. I will take up the matter with the state government and request for financial assistance. We will not compromise with the future of students. After approval from the government, any recruitment we do will be transparent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/interview-pseb-chairman-yog-raj-says-going-digital-is-part-of-effective-education-today/story-SdnKVGWIT40JwqoQKXxmeI.html

During the meeting with the representatives and officials, Thackeray instructed the administration to keep bed information updated and to work to bring down the Covid-19 case rate, along with the case fatality rate in Pune. The city, as of Wednesday recorded 55,035 progressive positive cases and 1,358 Covid-related deaths. This was Thackeray’s first visit to the city after becoming chief minister and many hoped that he would make an announcement about additional facilities for the city’s Covid-19 battle. The chief minister suggested the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) take the lead in increasing the number of beds considering the rising number of cases. He also called for the expediting of the process to build jumbo facilities, on the lines of Mumbai. He asked private laboratories to first give the test reports of patients to the civic body, so as to ensure the concerned authorities treat the patients. “In some cases, it was seen that patients died due to non-availability of beds as they were initially reluctant to go to hospital. To avoid this, private labs should first hand over reports of every positive person to the municipal corporation, which can ensure availability of beds for patients,” said Thackeray. On the PMC’s demand for funds, the chief minister said: “It is natural that municipal corporations are asking for funds. Not only Pune, but the demand is coming from all the municipal corporations. The state government is also asking the centre to help Maharashtra. On behalf of the state government, I will definitely give financial help to Pune and other all the cities.” During the meeting, MLAs and MPs mainly raised problem of bed management and inadequate infrastructure in fighting the Covid crisis.Questions asked, questions remain “There were multiple issues we raised in front of chief minister. While he has asked the administration to improve coordination, there was nothing substantial that emerged out of his visit to the city,” said Pune’s member of Parliament Girish Bapat. BJP state unit president Chandrakant Patil, who represents Kothrud, urged Thackeray to instruct the administration to ensure better coordination among all agencies, while Pune mayor, Murlidhar Mohol, said private hospitals are not co-operating by not updating the proper information about the vacant beds. “Even the municipal corporation is short of money and the Maharashtra government must co-operate with the municipal corporation,” Mohol said.BJP MLA Siddhartha Shirole, who was vocal about the CM not visiting the city in its hour of crisis, said “The chief minister visited Pune for the first time during the pandemic, but not much has come out of the visit. During the meeting, I raised the question of the jumbo facility as the administration has not completed the process of tendering yet. There was no answer, though.”NCP MLA Sunil Tingre also raised the issue of overcharging by hospitals, a common complaint by patients in Pune. “Private hospitals are charging exorbitant rates from patients as there are more patients and less number of beds in the city. Some housing societies have showed an interest in offering their clubhouses, which we need, as Covid care centres,” said Tingre.

Nandini was born at the Peshwe Park zoo in the city in 2004. . “Tigers draw a lot of visitors to the zoo and are very popular with children as well as adults. At least 16 lakh people visit the zoo to see the animals each year, but due Covid, the zoo is closed since March 14, 2020,” said Dr Rajkumar Jadhav, director of the Rajiv Gandhi zoo. “She died due to old age at 9.30 am.

31-07-2020||Pune||Pune mayor alleges 400 unaccounted suspected Covid deaths||Mayor Murlidhar Mohol, on Thursday, alleged that there are at least 400 suspected Covid deaths in July, that have gone unaccounted for. Mohol’s allegation came on the day chief minister Uddhav Thackeray visited the city. According to Mohol, as per ICMR guidelines, there is no need to conduct the Covid-19 test on a deceased person. “As per my information, every day, almost 12 suspected deaths are being recorded at Sassoon Hospital alone and there are many such cases in other hospitals. Post the death, when doctors carry out an X-ray test on the body, there are clear symptoms of Covid,” the mayor said. The city, till Wednesday, recorded 55,035 positive cases and 1,358 Covid-related deaths. Mohol said he needed to put this in front of the authorities to save lives. “I don’t want to blame anyone for this situation, but I need to put this fact before the authorities and steps should be taken to save lives. It is also negligence at the citizens’ level as they are rushing to hospital at the last stage,” the mayor said.Reacting to Mohol’s allegations, doctors in the city while the fact may be true, the numbers quoted look exaggerated. Dr Sunil Rao, medical director of Sahyadri hospital, said, “It is true that such suspected deaths are occurring, but the number quoted by the mayor is looking a little exaggerated. We have six Covid hospitals in the city and such suspected deaths are hardly two or three in a month. Suspected Covid deaths are there, but the numbers will be less.” Despite repeated attempts divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar, municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar and PMC health chief Ramchandra Hankare did not respond to calls and messages till the time of this report going to press. Another officer from PMC requesting anonymity said, “There are suspected deaths, but the number would be lower. As the number of critical cases increased in last two to three weeks, such cases have increased mainly in this period.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-mayor-alleges-400-unaccounted-suspected-covid-deaths/story-aofrb0X64QMsiObz5yu7kK.html
31-07-2020||Pune||Pune police solve senior citizen’s lockdown woes with just a phone call; 838 calls in just 4 months||Pune police’s senior citizen helpline number 1090 has received 838 calls over the past four months (April 1 to July 15) to seek counselling, help or even just casual chats.The lockdown necessitated due to the Covid-19 infection, has been tough for many senior citizens in the city, whose population, the Pune police estimates to be around 19,000. Doctors have been stressing on senior citizens, above 65 years, as Covid-19 high-risk groups and with measures such as staying indoors and physical social distancing key to their health, the isolation has taken a toll on their mental well being, say senior citizens. This has led to many senior citizens relying on such helpline numbers to fight the loneliness.“We have received over 838 calls from senior citizens between April 1 and July 15, of which 513 calls were simply because they want to talk to someone and spend some time fighting the loneliness,” said assistant police inspector (API) Swati Kedar, who works for the Bharosa cell, where they have a dedicated number for senior citizens. The Pune police have identified and provided 18,050 photo identity cards to senior citizens in the city, each with the emergency number, blood group, and address.The senior citizen helpline number 1090 has been buzzing since April with many of the senior citizens calling to seek household help, getting medicines, requesting for food delivery, medicines and aiding them with the bank or pension-related work, according to police officials. The police recently held a training session on emotional intelligence for all the staff at Bharosa Cell, to understand the psychology of the senior citizens during the pandemic.“The police office call centre for old age people is a very good and noble initiative. When officers speak with affection with parental people their morale gets boosted, this definitely acts as an immuno booster and helps in fighting the present pandemic,” said Dr Ravindra Chhajed , consulting physician and intensivist at Harsh hospital, Bibwewadi and Ruby hall Wanowrie.Head constable Jayashree Jadhav, who devotes some time to answering such calls, is back to work after a seven-month break after an accident. “I have been getting calls on my personal number since I was on medical leave, and I simply could not turn these senior members away. They need someone to speak to them when they feel lonely. I remember a conversation with 84-year-old former army personnel, who had lost his wife recently and his son was also serving in the army. He kept on insisting to speak with my superiors, but I tried to explain to him that she was busy with another assignment. We ended up speaking for over an hour and then, he thanked me for keeping him company.”Jadhav also narrates how the work from home culture is also alienating people, even when they stay in the same house. “While at work, I received a call from a 76-year-old man who needed help with the e-pass. He wanted to travel to his place in Mangalvedha as his son with whom he lived had no time to even talk to him and he was bored. I spent more than an hour talking to him about his favourite things and eased him out of his boredom.”“Loneliness is something that all senior citizens find difficult to deal with, among other things like living arrangements, finance, and health. This causes them a lot of anxiety and isolation, especially among those living alone,” said Swati Kedar.Some senior citizens, with police help, have also learnt to rely on technology or are adapting and evolving with the changing times. Sunita Khandekar, an 81-year–old living near Karnatak School, Erandwane, said, “Though I live alone, I have several friends. However, I am stuck at home due to this pandemic. I needed help to go to my sister-in-law’s place as she had fractured her leg and her 91-year–old husband was taking care of her,” said the retired teacher. The police, as well as the local politicians, came to her rescue and she spent part of her time looking after her sister– in –law. She also learned things like downloading and watching interesting videos on Youtube. “I enjoy watching videos on interesting topics and spend long hours chatting on the phone nowadays during this pandemic, which has helped me get out of my boredom,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-police-solve-senior-citizen-s-lockdown-woes-with-just-a-phone-call-838-calls-in-just-4-months/story-ARuF3qciHVwPiV6rTYgyYJ.html
31-07-2020||Pune||Businesses in Pune Camp limp back to normalcy after heavy losses||Businesses in the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) are slowly limping back to normal after suffering huge losses in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The businesses are continuing to report an average daily loss of 10 to 15 per cent after the 10-day lockdown was lifted by PCB administration on July 19. The establishments on the popular MG road, East Street, Chhatrapati Shivaji market have opened, the business is lacklustre with not many buyers stepping out for shopping. Kayani Bakery owner Rustom Kayani said, travel restrictions are still at 50 per cent of what they were previously. “However I am happy and grateful that even during this situation globally, we have survived not just as business but retention of all staff and workers, adapting to the safety precautionary norms. We have now accepted the new world after Covid,” Kayani said. Even local residents have preferred to stay indoors and not many people are seen on the roads. The hotels, malls, fashion street and other entertainment-related businesses are yet to re-open in the Pune cantonment area. The commercial establishments on MG Road, East street, Clover centre, Aurora Towers, Centre got some respite after consumers were seen visiting readymade cloth shops, hosiery and cutlery shops, sweetmeat and wafer shops. However, shopkeepers claim that the business is not enough after re-opening. Similarly, the goldsmiths and jewellers also opened their shops eagerly waiting for customers but complained that it would take another four to five months for the businesses to see normalcy. “The business was impacted during previous lockdowns but it had come on track a month ago when the unlocking began. However, the recent 10-day closure has led to problems. We had booked air tickets and called our staffers but because of the unannounced lockdown, we had to cancel the booking. Festivals are around the corner but the business is very low and we are hopeful that things will change in the next four to five months,” said Mahavir Oswal of Kalyani jewellers, and Centre street. Raju Abhang, a prominent vegetable vendor at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Market said, “Eighty per cent of shops are closed. We had customers from Kharadi, Kalyani nagar and other places who used to come to buy exotic vegetables here in Camp. Now, they are no longer coming leading to losses and whatever income is being generated is paltry and making survival difficult.” “The lockdown has destroyed the market. We pay a license fee, GST, power bills, professional tax, income tax to the government and the board administration but the illegal hawkers who are occupying the road outside do not pay taxes and take away our business. In the Covid-19 crisis, their numbers have multiplied and we are sustaining huge losses. PCB must act against them at the earliest,” said Sharad Borate, former president of Chhatrapati Shivaji market stallholders association who owns a 100-year old shop at the iconic market. Wahid Momin, a chicken wholesaler said, “The entire market was shut down when fly night chicken sellers set up shops in lanes and by lanes. They looted the public and charged them extra for chicken. Such illegal hawkers must be booked under the essential services act. Currently, we are operating at 20 per cent of our capacity as the business has taken a hit.” However, strict social distancing norms are being maintained at the Chhatrapati Shivaji market and the board administration has appointed special uniform guards to check buyers at the entry and exits to prevent the spread of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/businesses-in-pune-camp-limp-back-to-normalcy-after-heavy-losses/story-a4nFG1cirNvXxkGuwBIlDN.html

31-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC dismisses ex-Cong councillor Ishrat Jahan’s plea in UAPA case||Delhi High Court on Friday dismissed the plea of former Congress councillor Ishrat Jahan challenging a trial court order that granted an extension of 60 days’ time for filing a charge sheet against her in a case related to northeast Delhi violence. The court finds no merit in the petition, it said.A bench of Justice Suresh Kumar Kait while passing the order stated, “I am of the view that Public Prosecutor had moved an application, for extension of time to file a charge sheet, after going through the whole matrix of the case and after satisfying himself as per the law as enumerated in the second limb of Section 43(D)(2)(b) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. Learned Judge also after going through the facts and circumstances and mandate of provisions of the law of the Act mentioned above and after recording his satisfaction had passed the impugned order. Therefore, I am of the view that there is no illegality or perversity in the said order.” Representing police, Delhi Government’s senior standing counsel Rahul Mehra had earlier told the court that the investigators have enough material evidence to show that the extension given by the court was lawfully correct.Delhi Police, in the status report, submitted that the reasons for extension only means there was good and sufficient cause for the same and added that it is intended to check a casual or off-hand approach in seeking the extension.A bare look at the record suggests that the requisite conditions are sufficiently and satisfactorily attracted and there is a concrete and definite reason for the extension, the police said and added that the petitioner fails to demonstrate how the stated reasons did not meet the test.Jahan, through advocates Lalit Valecha and Manu Sharma, approached the High Court seeking to set aside the trial court order dated June 15 which has granted an extension of 60 days to the police to file a charge sheet in the matter.Jahan, in her plea, said that the order is erroneous, bad in law, and wrong on facts and the same is based on surmises and conjectures and dehorns the settled principle of law.“The same is against the democratic and fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India. And the order deserves to be set aside on this ground alone. Speedy and fair investigation are fundamental tenets of the criminal justice system,” the plea said.It said that the application filed by Delhi Police is an abuse of the legal process as the same fails to make out any legal or factual basis that justifies the extension of time.The petition also raised questions over the addition of serious sections against Jahan as she has been falsely implicated in the matter and she was only a supporter of the ongoing peaceful protest.According to the FIR and investigation agency, Jahan was allegedly trying to incite people during the violence that took place in northeast Delhi in February this year by giving out provocative speeches during the protests against the Citizen Amendment Act (CAA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-dismisses-ex-cong-councillor-ishrat-jahan-s-plea-in-uapa-case/story-2S1ndDbhhVWo0o5TWK6rnJ.html

31-07-2020||Chandigarh||SC junks RInfra petition against appointment of sole arbitrator||The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed a special leave petition filed by Reliance Infrastructure Limited (RInfra), the engineering procurement and construction contractor for two thermal power stations in Haryana, challenging the appointment of former Haryana chief secretary Promilla Issar as the sole arbitrator. The former chief secretary was appointed as the sole arbitrator by the state government in July 2016 for adjudication of disputes between RInfra and Haryana Power Generation Corporation Limited (HPGCL). Since the former chief secretary was also appointed as the arbitrator by the state government for the ongoing arbitration between HPGCL and RInfra against the contract for Yamunanagar thermal power plant, the former recommended her name for appointment as the sole arbitrator for Hisar thermal power plant. “It is submitted that the contract for Yamunanagar and Hisar power plants are quite similar and the contractual provisions are almost the same. Promilla Issar has gained sufficient background of the contractual provisions and has obtained a fair knowledge of the complex issues involved in the arbitration matter. It would be preferable to appoint her as the sole arbitrator in this case,” HPGCL managing director had written in July 2016. RInfra challenged her appointment before the Punjab and Haryana high court on the grounds that the appointment of a former chief secretary was violative of fifth and seventh schedules of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. The schedules pertained to arbitrator’s relationship with the parties or counsel. Dismissing the petition, the HC quoted from an arbitration case order of the high court to hold that the appointment of former chief secretary is not void ab-initio for the reason being that there was no financial, business, or professional relationship among a former chief secretary and the state of Haryana or HPGCL. The HC in its order said that a disclosure was required to be made by the arbitrator as she was a former Haryana chief secretary. “A disclosure would be required for that engagement constituted the existence of a direct past relationship between the arbitrator and the state of Haryana which relationship even if not financial, business or professional would fall within the ambit of the category constituted by the words other kind. The disclosure, however, was not necessary in view of the circumstances mentioned in the fifth schedule. It is necessary for an arbitrator to disclose a relationship past or present as an employee, consultant or advisor,” HC said. The arbitrator as well as the state of Haryana has expressly disclosed their past relationship. Subsequently, RInfra had challenged the HC order before the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sc-junks-rinfra-petition-against-appointment-of-sole-arbitrator/story-VVSBGoIG5OknRxELY8gunI.html
31-07-2020||Chandigarh||SYL canal completion: Haryana may consult attorney general on SC observations regarding CM’s meeting||The Haryana government may consult attorney general KK Venugopal to decide further course of action with regards to the implementation of Supreme Court’s January 15, 2002, and June 4, 2004, orders to complete the remaining portion of the Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal by Punjab. While the apex court during a July 28 hearing observed that “let the chief ministers of both the states meet to find out the solution if any, else there is a decree which has to be executed”, the written SC orders, made public on Thursday, stating that “a meeting of various stakeholders be convened at the high level and the outcome of the same, if any, be informed to this court” has created a predicament for the state government. “Since there seems to be some variance in the oral and written orders of the apex court, we are contemplating taking the advice of the attorney general who represented the Centre in the virtual court to clarify the SC order,” said an official. Advocate general BR Mahajan, however, said that Haryana’s law officer Anish Gupta who was present in the virtual court during the July 28 hearing has clearly conveyed the oral observations of the apex court regarding convening of a meeting of chief ministers of both the states. Mahajan said in his opinion, a meeting of chief ministers of Haryana and Punjab has to be convened to find out a solution. The outcome of the meeting has to be indicated to the apex court on the next date of hearing in the third week of August so that matter can proceed further for execution of the decree.Additional advocate general (AAG) Anish Gupta in a communication to the advocate general said that during the virtual hearing, the attorney general informed the court that three meetings have taken place between Central, Haryana and Punjab government officials since the order of July 9, 2019. He also sought three more months for negotiations. Senior advocate Shyam Divan, who appeared for Haryana, however, opposed the adjournment and said the attorney general is repeatedly seeking time since 2017 and no further progress with regard to construction of SYL has been made. “The court made a query as to who had participated in the last three meetings. The attorney general informed that the chief secretaries of both the states and the secretary, Union ministry of water resources, had participated in the meeting along with other officials. Then the court observed that let the chief ministers of both the states meet to find out the solution, if any, else there is a decree that has to be executed. List the matter in the third week of August. In the meanwhile, CMs of both the states meet and try to find out a solution, if possible,” the law officer has communicated to the advocate general. When the court asked the counsels appearing for the parties whether they should record the aforesaid observation in the order, senior advocate Shyam Divan, attorney general and Punjab’s counsel, said there was no need to record the same as they will convey the observation to the states concerned, the AAG has conveyed to the AG.Meanwhile, the Union water resources ministry has recorded Punjab government’s unwillingness to complete the canal after several rounds of meetings between central, Haryana and Punjab governments in 2019 remained inconclusive. Parleys were held on the orders of the Supreme Court to work out a solution to implement apex court’s judgments to complete the remaining portion of the SYL canal in Punjab. Top Haryana officials who attended the meetings said the Central ministry has recorded Punjab’s refusal to complete the canal in the minutes of the meetings held between the officials of the two states and the Centre. “Punjab has clearly refused to complete the canal on the pretext of non-availability of spare water,” said a Haryana official. Punjab’s water resources minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, meanwhile, said, “The matter is in the knowledge our chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and he will take it up with his Haryana counterpart. Our government is fixing up a schedule for a meeting with the neighbouring state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/syl-canal-completion-haryana-may-consult-attorney-general-on-sc-observations-regarding-cm-s-meeting/story-fQjyndG3bYVwAfKbOzP1uO.html

31-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt owes us Rs 1,181 crore, says North DMC mayor||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Thursday alleged that the Delhi government did not release Rs 1,181 crore to the corporation despite several communications and “deliberately pushed the civic body into a financial crisis”. Addressing a press conference, Jai Prakash, mayor, North Delhi Municipal Corporation, alleged that files pertaining to clearance of “Basic Tax Assignment” are pending with the government since May 25. The corporation was owed Rs 240 crore under BTA “but those files are not being cleared”, he said. Basic Tax Assignment is a segment where the state government collects tax on behalf of municipal corporations and pays the share of the civic body later.Several phone calls and text messages to both the Delhi government and the Aam Aadmi Party were not answered. Earlier, a media advisor to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said, “The court made it clear last month that Delhi government has no dues left.” The mayor said as per recommendations of fifth Delhi finance commission the Delhi government has to give around Rs 3,000 crore to the north civic body in an year. In the financial year 2018-19, the corporation got only Rs 1,600 crore from the government while in 2019-20 only Rs 1,500 crore was given by the government, Prakash said.“It is a deliberate attempt to create a financial problem. This BTA fund of Rs 240 crore is used to pay salaries of sanitation employees and DBC workers. This year as of now the Delhi government has released only Rs 387 crore to the north corporation and we are yet to get Rs 1,181 crore from them,” Prakash said.According to north corporation officials, other than getting money from the government, the civic body generates revenue of Rs 2200 crore from its own resources such as property tax, advertisements, parking contracts, stamp duty tax among others. “This year the income of the corporation has gone down drastically due to Covid-19 pandemic so we need funds from the government to sail through the crisis,” the official said.Cow shelter fundsSenior AAP leader Durgesh Pathak at a press conference on Thursday alleged that the municipal corporations had not released funds for the maintenance of cow shelters for last three years. Pathak said that there were around four cow shelters which are jointly maintained by the government and the civic bodies. The government and the corporation both give Rs 20 per cow per day to the cow shelter every year. “The government paid it’s share of around Rs 10.5 crore to Rs 11 crore to cow shelters but the civic bodies have not paid their share of money for the last three years. Their councillors are engaged in fodder corruption,” Pathak alleged.Responding to the allegations north corporation mayor Jai Prakash said, “The allegations of corruption are baseless. We have had a meeting with the managers of cow shelters and we are arranging funds for them. It could not be released as the government is not paying our dues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-owes-us-rs-1-181-crore-says-north-dmc-mayor/story-KSgxCT3Oq7teim87lWWQkJ.html
31-07-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Now say it in Tamil||Wow, she speaks such free-flowing Hindi!Now, this might sound like an awkward compliment in the Hindi-speaking Delhi region. But then Hindi is not Veena’s first language.“Main Tamil Nadu ki hoon,” she says, giving away her origins in Hindi. This afternoon Veena is chatting on WhatsApp video from the isolation of her ground-floor home in Gurugram’s Sector 51, which she shares with her husband and their two daughters. During the coronavirus-triggered lockdown, Veena, 39, launched a multi-lingual YouTube channel called Gurugram Sisters, which basically consists of the dance and song performances etc. of two young sisters. “They are my daughters, Shivli and Aditri,” reveals Veena, effortlessly switching into an equally fluent English.Veena grew up in Coimbatore’s Kuniamuthur neighbourhood. While a computer engineer student in a college of the same city, she met Visheshwar Dayal, a student hailing from Delhi’s Kamla Nagar neighbourhood. Their friendship evolved into love and a few years later Veena Jayam stepped into the Hindi speaking world by becoming Veena Mathur. “I was the first one in my entire khandaan to marry a non-Tamilian.”Veena was 24.It is considered relatively easy to learn a new language as a child, but not so as an adult when one’s first language has already taken over much of the linguistic mind space. Veena agrees with this theory and gratefully credits her husband’s parents in helping her with Hindi. “They gently nudged me to chat with them in whatever Hindi phrases I could manage.” At first the Tamilian was quite shy to speak outside—they were living in Indore then—fearing that people might laugh at her attempts. “But almost everyone would praise me for being so good with a language that wasn’t my own.”Truth be told, Veena confides that learning Tamil is slightly more tough than Hindi. “After all, Sanskrit came much after Tamil... and some pronunciations in Tamil take time to master.”Anyhow, the Tamil-Hindi speaker has been living in the Delhi region—Gurugram specifically—since 2010 where she hardly gets an opportunity to speak in her native tongue outside her home. “I personally know only one or two Tamil families here.” Veena says she talks to her husband mostly in Hindi and English—“He understands Tamil but he never talks to me in Tamil out of shyness... though I have heard him speaking it with others.” She engages with her daughters mostly in Hindi, but makes it a point to also converse with them in Tamil, “because it is good to be proficient in many languages.”The lady insists that she can do all the North Indian Hindi-language prayers of her Mathur family “but when I’m praying from my inner heart, the prayers instinctively come out in Tamil.” She laughs confessing it.Even so, nobody is perfect. Veena still has to learn the numbers in Hindi. “I can say do sau (200) and teen sau (300) but I don’t know how to say the beech-wale (middle) numbers.” And now the lady calls her daughters to the living room, where they often shoot their YouTube videos. “All that’s needed for a good recording is a tripod stand and a camera, and a mike for my elder daughter who loves to sing; the younger one is more into dancing.”Speaking of their next performance, Veena says, “Engaludaya adutha video janmashtamiyai munnitu Lagaan padathulirindu ‘Radha kaise na jale’ paadalil oru arumayana nadanam.”What, you don’t get it? Go, learn Tamil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/now-say-it-in-tamil/story-AUVFNHoXuAbWezZgGNr9lJ.html
31-07-2020||Lifestyle||Hand sanitiser in Covid-19 pandemic: How much is too much?||Excess of anything is bad and the same holds true for hand sanitisers as well. Although sanitisers have ruled our lives amid the pandemic, and have become a necessity in the ‘new normal’ world — blame it on the paranoia, or stress owing to the spread of the virus — there have been times where people have used sanitisers excessively. And this has reportedly lead to breathing problems and hand allergies, among other health concerns. Often, just one trip to the market leaves one with sore hands due to copious amounts of sanitisers poured, at the entry of most stores. So, how much is too much? And how can one be wary of excessive usage of sanitisers? Yatin Wadhwa, a Gurugram-based businessman, says he has developed an allergy on his hands due to an increased use of sanitisers. “I was using sanitisers about 10 to 15 times a day, and slowly developed an allergy on my hands. I went to the doctor and he gave me medicines to eat, and to apply on the skin. That was the lesson for me to restrict my usage of sanitisers!” Some like Ritika Pahwa Sharma, a Faridabad resident, was using sanitiser almost throughout the day and subsequently developed breathing issues. She has now taken to washing hands more often than sanitising them. “I was rubbing sanitisers in my hands every 30 minutes, starting right from the time when corona entered India. Last month, when I discovered an allergy on my hands, I visited a doctor and after tests he confirmed that it’s due to excess use of hand sanitisers. I have been prescribed anti-histamine, and for immediate relief I need to take bronchodilator (inhaler) about thrice a day because of my breathlessness. But I can’t restrict the use of sanitisers! So now, I ensure that I wash my hands whenever possible than sanitising them.” Alcohol-based hand sanitisers are extremely effective in killing bacteria and viruses, but they also kill the “good protective bacteria on your hands” informs Gurugram-based Dr Nehal Shah Vora, adding, “This leads to Allergic Dermatitis or Eczema on the hands, and you may experience dryness, burning, redness and even bleeding. Inhaling the sanitiser can lead to allergic bronchitis or cough. And in children, who accidentally ingest it, it can cause alcohol poisoning as well. Excessive use can also lead to conjunctivitis, hormonal issues, fertility issues, abdominal pain and metabolic disorders and even reduced immunity!” B085LPXF93, B07VN7T85TThe best resort is to use a sanitiser sparingly. “Also, after washing or sanitising your hands, must use moisturising creams that contain petroleum jelly or oil,” advises Dr Vora adding, “When a staff at the entrance of shopping stores mandatorily gives you dollops of sanitiser, use it sparingly and then use a petroleum jelly or oil-based moisturiser or moisturising hand wipe after that.” Excessive use of hand sanitisers is turning out to be a “real medical problem now”, says Delhi-based psychiatrist, Dr Sanjay Chugh. He opines, “The need was warranted because of risk of contamination. And when people started using it initially, it definitely had a positive effect. Now we are seeing a lot of case of sanitiser induced dermatitis or dryness and inflammation of the skin. The more you use it, the more inflammation increases. I have cases of patients with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), who know that it’s irrational to keep rubbing hands with sanitisers, yet are unable to stop themselves. Also, when you use sanitisers, they not only kill the unhealthy pathogens, but even kill the healthy ones,” There is also a risk of alcohol intoxication because sanitisers are 99% alcohol based. “So if you keep putting them, and your hand goes to the nose, and you keep sniffing it then you can actually get a buzz that can possibly lay the seeds for further addiction,” he adds. Dr Anupam Sibal, a Delhi-based paediatrician, says, “We need to realise that we need just soap and water to clean our hands, and get rid of the SARS COV-2 viruses. Sanitisers serve the purpose as well but we don’t need to rely on them if we have access to soap and water. However, during the unavailability of soap, sanitisers are very useful for example while entering buildings, offices and malls. As we get used to the new normal in Covid-19 times, we need to remember that hand washing, masks and social distancing need to become a part of our daily existence.” Author Tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and TwitterAt Hindustan Times, we help you stay up-to-date with latest trends and products.

31-07-2020||Mumbai||BMC sees 200% rise in calls, with many queries about home quarantine||The civic body’s Covid-19 helpline (1916) recorded a sharp rise in the number of calls in July, with most of the queries relating to hospital admission and ambulances. Until May 22, the helpline had received 69,407 calls. As of July 29, the total number of calls received were 210,694. On an average, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) receives 2,172 calls every day on the helpline. The disaster response helpline (1916) has been dedicated to fielding citizens’ queries regarding Covid-19 since the third week of April. Since then, data from BMC shows that the helpline received 69,407 calls till May 22. The number rose to 210,694 as of July 29. Of these calls, 98,985 comprised Covid-19-related queries including availability of beds at hospitals and treatment centres, rules of home quarantine, and food supply. Inquiries about ambulance services made up 28,652 of the calls.Initially, the centralised helpline number was manned by doctors and their teams, which led to crises in the civic body’s disaster control room. As HT had reported earlier, many called went unattended and patients were left waiting for hours, following which BMC decentralised the system. Since June, calls are diverted to the relevant ward, each of which have their own control centre, or war room. “Now, the calls get diverted to the respective civic ward’s war rooms, resulting in a better response rate. On a daily basis, each ward gets around 100 calls of which 20% pertain to ambulances,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. According to BMC, the number of calls received daily decreased in early June. “Earlier, we used to record over 4,000 daily calls, which declined to around 3,000 calls. At present, most of the calls are related to home quarantine and measures to be taken,” said Kakani. A ward officer from G (North) ward, which covers Dadar and Dharavi, said that till the beginning of July, the war room received an average of 70 calls daily. The number has now come down to 40. “Now, due to fewer patients, more beds are available. This has helped stop panic calls from patients seeking beds. Also, the public is more aware of procedures and precautions,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-sees-200-rise-in-calls-with-many-queries-about-home-quarantine/story-ehm2fu3fu4cKfGhWhpLIdN.html

As per the civic body, four private hospitals are under scrutiny for overcharging and other irregularities. “Since there are several complaints of overcharging and denial of admission, we have initiated probes into the hospitals. As of now, four hospitals are under scrutiny,” said Yuvraj Badhane, public relations officer, UMC. The civic body is checking 108 bills of these four hospitals, for irregularities and charges over the rates set by the state government to treat Covid patients. As per UMC, six private hospitals in the city have been permitted to treat Covid patients. “We have formed a committee to look into the complaints against these hospitals. Once the scrutiny is completed, we will serve a show-cause notice, and action will be taken after receiving their explanation. Also, we will ask the hospitals to return the overcharged amount, if any, to the patients,” said Badhane. On Tuesday, the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) had cancelled the Covid status, and suspended the registration of A and G Hospital in Kalyan, as it overcharged ₹9.36 lakh from Covid patients, and did not follow directions of the civic body on bed availability and other treatment procedures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/4-private-hospitals-in-ulhasnagar-under-the-scanner-for-overcharging-covid-patients/story-S7Aj7aZHuUVrgLhm2OjfYM.html

The fresh cases include a specially-abled minor.Last week, 30 residents of the MDCH tested positive for Covid-19, including four minors. HT had first reported the spread of infection at the children’s home in its July 26 edition.On Wednesday a minor boy, cook, cleaner, and another staff member tested positive. “The four new patients are asymptomatic and have been admitted to the Covid care centre at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC). Twenty-seven patients who tested positive earlier, are also undergoing treatment at the same centre, while three are receiving treatment at Sion hospital,” said Vikrant Gondane, in-charge designated at the facility by the commissionerate for persons with disabilities, for Covid management.The authority at the children’s home is conducting an internal inquiry, to identify how the infection spread there.It is suspected that the Sars-Cov2 virus, which causes Covid-19, spread from staffers who share residential quarters with staff for other state-funded children’s institutions. Three staffers from one of these other facilities had tested positive earlier and one of them succumbed to the infection.Former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member of parliament (MP) Kirit Somaiya had taken up the matter with the state human rights commission. “The government and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) have been slapped with notices in this regard by the commission. The commission will hear the matter on August 6,” Somaiya said.Mankhurd MDCH, which is run by the NGO Children Aid Society with funding from the state, houses 268 individuals with mental disabilities up to 70 years of age.

The number of sealed buildings has risen to 5,960 (July 28) from 4,538 (June 9), and the cases, too, have surged to 22,381, from 9,956.When a slum pocket is declared a containment zone or a building is sealed after Covid cases are detected, the areas witness strict lockdown, allowing minimal movement for essential services. The easing of lockdown curbs to allow non-essential movement and visitors might have increased cases in high-rises, a senior civic official said. “Also, people have started commuting to offices and there are more people on the road than earlier. This exposes them to virus transmission,” he said. Speaking on the new trend, Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state Covid-19 task force, said, “The virus came from international travellers, who gave it to their domestic help and drivers. From the slums, it then moved to high-rises and housing societies. This also shows that social distancing was not followed in slums and a localised transmission occurred there, but now they have got immune to it as several of them have developed antibodies.” The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) recent sero survey of three wards revealed that 57% people from slums had overcome the virus by developing antibodies. On July 3, BMC, in collaboration with Niti Aayog and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, started the survey to identify the spread of Covid-19. The survey of 6,936 people from R-North (Dahisar), M-West (Chembur) and F-North (Sion) wards found 57% from slums and 16% from other residential areas had the antibodies, suggesting they had been exposed to Covid-19 and recovered. BMC officials said that even chronic hot spots of Covid cases in slums, where more than 20 positive cases were detected on a daily basis, have now come down to zero. For instance, several slum pockets in Govandi, Dharavi, Worli and Bandra have zero cases being reported on a daily basis. Joshi said, “We need to note that vertical high-rises are as bad as slums when it comes to susceptibility of transmission of the virus. This virus has taught us is everyone has to take strict precautions. We can’t get complacent that the cases in slum pockets have declined.” Meanwhile, on Thursday, Mumbai recorded 1,208 cases and 53 deaths, taking the total to 113,199 and toll to 6,300. According to BMC’s data, of the 53 deaths, one was of a patient below 40 years, 32 were patients above 60 years, and 20 were between 40 and 60 years.A total of 1,120 patients were recovered and discharged on Thursday, bringing the total to 86,447. The number of active patients in the city was 20,158. The recovery rate was 76%. The number of tests was 5.16 lakh and doubling rate 75 days. Meanwhile, Dharavi reported six new cases on Thursday, taking the total to 2,551.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/22-fewer-containment-zones-in-mumbai-since-june/story-3CSyykFHo9k3KQCeexBVQJ.html

The decision comes after SpiceJet wrote to AAI seeking more time to work out the modalities to pay pending dues. The airlines had announced a net loss of ₹934.8 crore for the year 2019-2020.SpiceJet spokesperson said, “The AAI has deferred its decision to put SpiceJet on cash and carry. We continue to have normal operations at all AAI-run airports as before without any impediments.”The development comes after AAI issued a letter to all regional executive directors and all its other necessary department heads, along with SpiceJet’s chairman and managing director (CMD) informing that the low-cost carrier will have to pay before operating each of their flight in all the airports managed by AAI across the country. The letter had stated that the airline will have to pay in cash, from midnight on Thursday, to operate its flights as it had failed to clear dues towards parking and landing charges at various airports despite being reminded repeatedly.The AAI letter dated July 29, a copy of which is with HT, states that it had sent various emails to the airline as a reminder to clear its dues, but since the airline had failed to pay its pending charges, it was implementing cash and carry policy for the airline.After a request from SpiceJet, AAI issued a statement which read, “The decision to put the all India operation of M/s SpiceJet on cash and carry with effect from 0001 hrs of 30th July 2020 is deferred till further orders.”On Wednesday, SpiceJet had announced a loss of ₹807.1 crore in the March quarter of the 2019-20 financial year as against a net profit of ₹56.3 crore a year ago. For the whole of 2019-20, net loss stood at ₹934.8 crore against a net loss of ₹316.1 crore in 2018-19.In the first week of July, Air India too was announced to be put on cash and carry mode by the AAI in Ahmedabad, Bhubaneswar, Chennai and Kolkata airports from July 7. The decision was taken owing to their long-pending dues. However, this decision too was deferred after Air India paid a small amount of the total dues and even wrote to the AAI to allow them more time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/aai-allows-spicejet-to-fly-despite-pending-dues-loss-of-934-8-crores/story-uqTfPgFIBE4S1l4fGQGHwL.html
31-07-2020||Chandigarh||PSPCL hears no word from state govt on Centre’s appeal to revive Bathinda plant||A week after the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) expressed interest in reviving the defunct Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant (GNDTP) as a non-conventional fuel facility, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has not received any communication from the state government on reviewing its decision to dismantle the Bathinda-based unit. PSPCL chief managing director A Venu Prasad said the process to dismantle four units of GNDTP is underway and e-auctioning to disassemble the power generation facility will be held on August 20 as per the schedule. “It was a state cabinet decision to scrap the plant as it was no longer economically viable to run it. The PSPCL has not received any communiqué from PMO on the possibility to run it on unconventional fuel. In fact, Punjab is solar power surplus and biomass energy plant can be set up at any place,” said Prasad.A team of state government technocrats attended a webinar on July 24 to discuss the possibilities of converting one unit of the plant as a biomass facility corporation officials said. PSPCL director (generation) Jatinder Goyal said, “The state has planned a mega pharmaceutical industry park at the site and finance minister Manpreet Badal has even met the Union ministeron this. The coal-run plant was closed after it was found that re-operationalising it on conventional or non-conventional fuels was not economically viable. Power demand in Punjab increases only for four months of summers to meet requirement mainly for the agriculture sector. For the rest of the year, the state produces more power to cater to all sectors. Therefore, it is not wise to invest more on a plant with a little utilization.”Opposition parties like the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) besides employees of state electricity department and farmer unions have been protesting against the decision to wind up the plant that was set up in 1974.The PSPCL board of directors in August last year had recommended to the state government to upgrade the plant infrastructure to start alternative energy generation projects.Manpreet Badal, who has been under fire of the opposition for pushing the plant closure to establish an industrial hub in his assembly segment, was unavailable for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pspcl-hears-no-word-from-state-govt-on-centre-s-appeal-to-revive-bathinda-plant/story-ZRdud0ZgEenRoTrOsUwxfP.html
31-07-2020||Chandigarh||HSGMC writes to Khattar on separate accounts for Gurdwaras||In a letter sent to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Thursday, the acting president of the Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (HSGMC) Didar Singh Nalvi has asked for compliance of Supreme Court orders of 2014 in which it had asked the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) for opening separate bank accounts of gurdwaras that the committee manages in Haryana. These gurdwaras include: Nada Sahib in Panchkula; Panjokhra Sahib and Manji Sahib in Ambala; Dhamtan Sahib and Gurdwara Guru Teg Bahadur Sahib in Jind; a Gurdwara Sahib in Thanesar and another in Yamunanagar. Nalvi claimed that the apex court order six years ago, SGPC had transferred at least Rs 70 crore from gurdwaras in Haryana to Punjab, exhibiting non-compliance of the order. Referring to the annual budget for this fiscal, Nalvi said that for seven gurdwaras in Haryana, it is Rs 12 crore. “Why is the donation reaching in cash and kind in gurdwaras of Haryana not being spend on the causes of the community within the state. If this is being spent elsewhere, the SGPC should justify it,” adding that Haryana government must make compliance of SC orders binding on the SGPC. After the Haryana government passed an act for a separate gurdwara body for the state, the SGPC had moved the SC, which ordered status quo on a separate gurdwara body, however, asking for accounting of donations received in Haryana gurdwaras, separately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hsgmc-writes-to-khattar-on-separate-accounts-for-gurdwaras/story-SpBKEISAtiu6YBG5nz9a1N.html
31-07-2020||Chandigarh||Amritsar Dussehra train tragedy: Main accused, 5 others get anticipatory bail||A court in Amritsar on Thursday granted anticipatory bail to six of the seven accused, including former Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu’s close aide Saurabh Madan alias Mithu Madan, in the 2018 Dussehra train tragedy case.The special investigation team (SIT) of the Government Railway Police (GRP), formed to fix responsibility for the tragedy, had filed a chargesheet against seven organisers of the event before duty magistrate Harpreet Singh on June 6.In the chargesheet, the SIT has named Dussehra committee office-bearers Mithu Madan, Rahul Kalyan, Deepak Kumar, Karan Bhandari, Kabal Singh, Deepak Gupta and Bhupinder Singh as accused under Sections 304-A, 337 and 338 of the Indian Penal Code. Mithu is son of a Congress councilor.All the accused, barring Rahul Kalyan, had filed for bail application. The matter was heard in the court of judicial magistrate (first class) Rajan Aneja.“It was expected that the accused would get bail easily as the SIT submitted the chargesheet before making their arrests. Even the charges were diluted in the chargesheet. Filing of the weak chargesheet has helped the accused secure the bail, said Verka,” said advocate Sarabjit Singh Verka of the Punjab Human Rights Organisation (PHRO).The SIT had filed the chargesheet without arresting the accused, and by removing Section 304 (imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years and shall also be liable to fine) of the IPC against them. The court has fixed the next date of the hearing on September 3.On October 19, 2018, a speeding train mowed down 61 persons and injured more than 100 people who had gathered for Dussehra celebrations at Dhobi Ghat near Jaura Phatak in Amritsar.The magisterial inquiry conducted by Jalandhar divisional commissioner B Purushartha on the orders of Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh had held the event organisers accountable for various acts of omission and commission that led to the tragedy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amritsar-dussehra-train-tragedy-main-accused-5-others-get-anticipatory-bail/story-B5TkxuoPweLqiS31UuCjKL.html
31-07-2020||City||Punjabi University row: V-C’s adviser puts in papers over delay in joining||Former bureaucrat Manjit Singh Narang, who was recently appointed as the honorary adviser to Punjabi University vice-chancellor Prof B S Ghuman, put down his papers on Thursday, accusing the V-C of deliberately delaying his joining.Earlier this month, the varsity had appointed retired IAS officer Narang to the post to help it tide over its acute financial crisis, after consultation with the state government.However, in his letter to the V-C, Narang openly blamed Ghuman and his team of senior officials for delaying his joining and creating unnecessary hurdles following his appointment. “It appears that the V-C appointed me under some pressure, but actually did not want me to take over the charge. This is why Prof Ghuman always made lame excuses whenever I asked him about formal joining,” Narang said.Narang had sent his attendance report to the V-C through email on July 24, but the varsity administration has failed to acknowledge it till date.“I was told by the V-C that it was not the right time to join as the employee unions were protesting his appointment,” he said.The former bureaucrat said he was appointed for the financial upliftment of the varsity. “However, it seems that the university does not require my services, therefore there is no point of becoming a part of its administration,” he said.V-C Ghuman could not be reached despite repeated calls and text messages.Meanwhile, higher education department secretary Rahul Bhandari said it is sad on the part of university administration that Narang was not made to join till now. “He was appointed for the betterment of the varsity both financially and administratively,” Bhandari said.It may be mentioned that this is for the first time since the university’s inception that an adviser has been appointed to assist the V-C in financial matters.Meanwhile, a senior varsity official revealed that V-C Ghuman was reluctant to have an adviser over him, as it would demean his position in the teaching lobby and bureaucracy. “Even the protest against Narang’s appointment was sponsored by the protégés of the varsity administration,” the official said.Narang, who changed the fortunes of Pepsu Road Transport Corporation three years ago, was not to charge any money and even gave up all the perks and official vehicle for his new assignment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjabi-university-row-v-c-s-adviser-puts-in-papers-over-delay-in-joining/story-628udcn0opS6wVc14HAsNN.html

It is the highest passing percentage of the state in last decade and the good performance will impact the cut-off lists of prominent colleges for Class 11 (first year junior college) admissions in the city. A total of 15,466 students have scored more than 90 per cent marks in Pune division. “This year’s SSC results are excellent and it will certainly have an impact on the Class 11 admissions. The cut-off list for admission will increase by around 5 per cent and students will have to fare well in tests and interviews to get a seat in colleges of their wish. The office of deputy director of education (DYDE), Pune should allow colleges for “extra intake” of students for this year. Last year, some colleges were allowed to take 10 per cent extra intake of students,” said Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal of Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, Shivajinagar. Fergusson College principal Ravindrasinh Pardeshi said, “Every student wants to get admission in good colleges. It will be a tough competition to get admission in prominent colleges in the city this year because of record SSC results.” Deputy director of education, Pune, has started the Class 11 admission process online from July 16. From August 1, passed students of Class 10 from any board can fill Part 1 form online. From a total of 301 junior colleges in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, 1,05,732 seats are available. Till date, more than 57,000 students have registered online for the Class 11 admission. “While filling the admission form students need to only upload Class 10 marksheet.“If other documents are not attached during the admission process by students due to technical reasons, then colleges need to take self-declaration from students and three months’ time will be given to them. There are enough number of seats available in Pune division for students. The Part 2 form filling schedule will soon be declared.” said Meena Shendkar, assistant director of education, Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/record-class-10-result-raises-cut-off-lists-for-first-year-junior-college-admissions/story-NtCsVLXlPuYQigV4AEfMIJ.html
31-07-2020||Mumbai||1.44L SSC students got bonus marks for drawing: Maha data||Of the 188,131 students who were awarded bonus marks in their Secondary School Certificate (SSC) exams, results of which were announced on Wednesday, 144,183 (77%) got them for drawing, according to data from the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE). In Mumbai division, 32,007 students were awarded bonus marks, of which 26,182 (82%) got it for drawing. The state education department introduced the bonus marks (up to 25 marks) in 2017, for students excelling in art and cultural activities, in addition to sports. In 2018, after scores soared with the bonus marks, the department amended the rules and reduced the maximum bonus scores up to 15 marks. Those who clear the intermediate drawing grade exam conducted by the Directorate of Art in Maharashtra get three to seven bonus marks depending on the grade. Schools said the number of students showing interest in arts and culture has increased after the bonus facility was introduced. “Students should get an incentive to take up extracurricular activities. Sadly, students need some motivation to do something apart from their studies. Students are consciously trying to secure bonus marks by taking up these exams,” said Prashant Redij, spokesperson of the Mumbai Principals’ Association. Asha Keer, an art teacher from an Andheri-based school, said she has a sharp rise in enrolments over the past four years. “For music, dance etc one needs training for several years. While the same is true for fine art and drawing, grade exams can be cleared with just a year’s preparation if the child has basic interest in drawing. This is something that parents also realise and often push their children to take up the exams,” she said. Teachers said bonus marks are especially useful for students who are already brilliant. For instance, all three top scorers in the city this year – Vidhi Chheda (100%), Saee Nimkar (99.8%) and Sameera Surve (99.6%) have got bonus marks. While Vidhi and Sameera got marks for excelling in classical dance, Saee got them for clearing the intermediate examinations with an A grade. “Every year, the number of requests coming to the board sees a surge. This year, owing to the lockdown, the verification process for these claims was done online. We are happy that we could still complete it and students got the scores they deserved,” said an official from the Mumbai divisional board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/1-44l-ssc-students-got-bonus-marks-for-drawing-maha-data/story-JxFiiorel2a0RKzfuaxFfP.html

31-07-2020||Chandigarh||Captain painting Sikhs as anti-India, says Sukhbir||SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Thursday said that it was a great and tragic irony that Capt Amarinder Singh is talking about the people of his state in terms of “anti-India” forces in Punjab at a time when the entire country was standing up to salute their patriotic heroics and sacrifices in defending the national borders against China and Pakistan. In a rejoinder to chief minister’s statement on UAPA, the SAD president scoffed at Amarinder’s “fake bravado against outfits like SFJ”, saying that history was witness that in the past the origins of all such outfits had been traced to the Congress. “First, you send your right hand men to the so-called “Sarbat Khalsa” at Chabba where Khalistan resolutions are passed, and then you start your shallow-dramatic breast-beating on threats to national unity and integrity,” he said. Sukhbir said that the people of Punjab, especially the Sikhs, have seen through these hypocritical games. “The community that you shrewdly and cunningly want to defame as anti-India just because they support the SAD has seen these games by you and your party bosses in Delhi in the past and will not be befooled,” he said. The former deputy CM said he was surprised that instead of retracting his steps and desisting from creating the anti-national bogey against the Sikhs and disowning the Indira Gandhi narrative which he had suddenly pulled out of archives, Captain has gone one step farther and has suddenly started seeing “a threat to the country from “anti-India forces” in Punjab. The SAD chief reiterated that Amarinder was deliberately reviving the anti-Sikh Congress slogans of the 1980s in a familiar Congress strategy to divide Punjabis on religious grounds and divert their attention from the abysmal failures of the Congress government over the past almost four years. “Having failed to deliver on any of the promises he had made on oath of the sacred Sikh scriptures, Captain is now looking to present himself in some dramatic role as a champion and defender of the nation,” he added. Sukhbir also said that he had cautioned the CM against the repressive misuse of UAPA by his police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/captain-painting-sikhs-as-anti-india-says-sukhbir/story-Kbydilk9m3DScUGDERcM3J.html

31-07-2020||Chandigarh||ROW OVER UAPA: Capt asks Sukhbir to stop political drama||As UK joined the ranks of major countries that have openly rejected the SFJ’s ‘Referendum 2020’, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday called upon SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal to open his eyes to the secessionist threat of anti-Indian forces instead of indulging in political theatrics over the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act or UAPA, which their own government had used extensively during their tenure. Welcoming UK’s statement on ‘Referendum 2020’, Amarinder expressed surprise that Sukhbir continues to turn a blind eye to the threat posed by Pakistan-backed Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), and other terrorist and radical forces working to destabilise India, particularly Punjab. “Can’t he (Sukhbir) see that the arrests under the UAPA, which he is opposing, are part of the state government’s strategy to combat this threat?” he questioned. “After Canada, the UK has now come out with a categorical statement that “it is not involved in any way in this unofficial and non-binding referendum…and considers Indian Punjab as part of India,” according to a state government release. Amarinder reminded the SAD chief of his earlier offer to look into any case of misuse of the UAPA and wrongful arrest under the same. “Why don’t you send me the list of cases which you claim the police have registered wrongfully?” he asked SAD chief, while seeking a list of the names of those arrested under UAPA during the SAD-BJP rule. The CM said the Badal government had registered more than 60 cases under the UAPA during their term. Of the 225 persons arrested in these cases, 120 were either acquitted or discharged. “Should the large number of acquittals/discharges not be construed to mean you had applied the Act indiscriminately?” Captain Amarinder asked Sukhbir, questioning his motives in giving a communal twist to some of the recent arrests made by the Punjab Police under UAPA. Amarinder said that if the Akalis believed the UAPA to be anti-people and divisive, then Sukhbir, as deputy CM and home minister in the erstwhile SAD-BJP government, should not have applied it in so many cases. The Congress, which was in opposition then, had assumed that the UAPA was being used to keep terror in check in the state, he added. He also accused the Akali leader of trying to create a divide between communities with his senseless attack on the state government’s attempts to check the anti-Punjab forces from succeeding in their game plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/row-over-uapa-capt-asks-sukhbir-to-stop-political-drama/story-mDxIB6XTuWXOp3XXy9PbZI.html

31-07-2020||Chandigarh||Missing 267 saroops: Former HC judge opts out of probe||The probe into the case of missing 267 holy saroops (copies) of Guru Granth Sahib has got hampered once again as former Punjab and Haryana High Court judge Navita Singh on Thursday disassociated herself from the matter. Navita Singh was already out of the scene ever since the head priest of the Akal Takht, the highest Sikh temporal seat, assigned her the task to look into the matter in a month. She did not even visit the Shiromani Gurdwara parbandhak Committee (SGPC) publishing house at Gurdwara Ramsar Sahib, Amritsar, from where the holy saroops went missing. She has not met any of the witnesses either.The matter was highlighted by the Punjab Human Rights Organization (PHRO), a non-government rights advocacy group. Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh said Navita Singh sent them a communiqué in which she has expressed her inability to carry out the probe citing her domestic obligations.The Takht announced her name for the probe on July 17 after a section of the community expressed doubts over the fairness of the panel constituted by the SGPC to enquire into the case. In her place, the jathedar appointed Telangana High Court lawyer Ishar Singh who was earlier asked to assist her in the probe, as chief investigator. Harpreet Kaur, a lawyer at the Punjab and Haryana High Court, and Harleen Kaur, a chartered accountant, have been deputed to assist him in the probe panel. “This will not hinder the probe which will be carried out in a fair and impartial manner and completed within the stipulated time. Those found guilty in the probe report will not be spared,” said Giani Harpreet Singh.Ishar Singh is learnt to have grilled the key witnesses and recorded their statements at the SGPC office. So far, statements of two dozen persons have been recorded. Records of the publishing house were shifted to the Akal Takht secretariat.NEW PANEL A MERE EYEWASH: PHROTerming the move of Navita Singh as unfortunate, the PHRO rejected the new probe panel. “The probe is mere an eyewash,” PHRO investigator Sarabjit Singh Verka said.“It was demanded that the probe be handed over to a retired judge. Actually, the SGPC functionaries are trying their best to influence the probe being carried out by Ishar Singh. The incumbent and former employees were grilled in the presence of officials whose role is under scanner. The evidences are being tempering with,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/missing-267-saroops-former-hc-judge-opts-out-of-probe/story-5HOBf0TZvE3EqsfwcZ6lSM.html
31-07-2020||Mumbai||Highest 1-day spike of 11,147 cases takes Maha tally to 411,798||Maharashtra on Thursday recorded its highest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases with 11,147 new infections, taking the tally to 411,798. The daily caseload crossed the 10,000 mark for the second time, with the first being on July 22, when the tally jumped by 10,576.As of Thursday, the state has 148,150 active cases with 248,615 patients having recovered so far, including 8,860 in the past 24 hours. The state’s recovery rate stood at 60.37%, below the national rate of 64.41%.After ramping up testing capacity over the past couple of weeks, the state conducted 53,894 tests on Thursday —highest ever in a day — and also saw a rise in the positivity rate to 20.68%, from Wednesday’s rate of 19.32%. Mumbai reported 1,208 cases and 53 deaths, taking the tally to 113,199 and toll to 6,300. Of the fatalities reported in the past 24 hours, Pune district saw 83, including 52 in Pune city, 21 in Pune rural and 10 in Pimpri-Chinchwad. Navi Mumbai reported 10 fatalities, Thane city, Kalyan-Dombivli and Raigad rural reported six each. The case fatality rate (CFR) of the state stood at 3.58%, above the national rate of 2.23% on Wednesday. Pune city topped the chart of daily infections in the state with 1,889 cases in the past 24 hours. Pune reported 3,309 cases, including 433 in Pune rural and 987 in Pimpri-Chinchwad. Although state authorities are expecting a downward trend of the virus curve in the next few weeks, they are also wary about a surge, owing to the easing of relaxations. The state government on Wednesday had announced it would allow malls to open and non-team sports like golf course, tennis, mallakhamb to happen from August 5. The capacity of passengers in taxi and private cars has also been increased to three, although they still remain restricted for essential services. Two wheelers, too, have been allowed with pillion rider, albeit with mandatory mask and helmet. “Whenever the relaxations from lockdown curbs were extended, we have witnessed a surge in cases. With activities in malls and at playgrounds allowed and expected crowding during Eid and Ganpati, there could be another spike in cases over next few weeks. Chief minister is wary about the second wave of the outbreak if the lockdown is not handled properly. The civic bodies and district administration have been asked to tighten vigilance in containment zones,” said a state government official, requesting anonymity. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said in Pune on Thursday that the strict implementation of the lockdown curbs were being done, while lifting the restrictions in a phased manner. He said that keeping the growth rate and fatality rate in control was a challenge. “Citizens need to be alert in the first wave of the coronavirus outbreak we are going through. The civic bodies and district collectors should implement an awareness drive for social distancing and hygiene protocols that need to be observed. The local bodies should also ensure that patients are not inconvenienced.” Thackeray has also directed the private laboratories to inform the municipal corporations first about the test reports, so that the patients are attended to immediately by doing appropriate arrangements. “Patients with positive reports most of the time avoid admitting themselves to hospitals, leading to the rise in the death rate. Proper coordination could avoid this. The civic bodies in Aurangabad, Nashik and Pune need to ramp up the health infrastructure for which the state government would provide financial assistance,” he said.Eight municipal corporations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) still report a high number of cases. Mira-Bhayander commissioner Vijay Rathod said, “We traced 2.90 lakh people over the last few weeks to ensure that every high-risk contact was tested and treated. We have ramped up tests to the rate of 400 tests per day per million against the Central guideline of 140 tests.”Jalgaon, one of the districts with high fatality rate, reported a spike in cases over the last couple of days. Nagoji Chavan, civil surgeon of Jalgaon district said the rise was owing to the rise in tests. “We have been aggressively tracking and tracing contacts in our bid to contain the spread by tracing around 20 people per patient to arrest the spread and treat them early. This has helped us in bringing down the CFR to 4.6%, which was more than 13 few weeks ago. We have also strengthened our infrastructure by ramping up the bed capacity in the city to 13,000 beds, so as to tackle the rise in cases. Inspite of this, we are expecting the cases to rise for the next few weeks,” he said.State currently has 9,04,141 people under home quarantine and 50,456 people in institutional quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/highest-1-day-spike-of-11-147-cases-takes-maha-tally-to-411-798/story-uJc9JeTMgiauuZMhclye4L.html

31-07-2020||Chandigarh||Fraudster posing as food supplies officer lands in police net||A fraudster posing as a food supplies officer was arrested on Thursday by the police for extorting money from shopkeepers by threatening to fine them.In an FIR against Manpreet Singh of Guru Teg Bahadur Nagar on the statement of grocery shop owner Sanjiv Kumar of New Moti Nagar, it was alleged that Singh turned up at the market on July 27 posing as a food supplies official. Singh then told the shopkeepers that he would collect samples of eatables from their shops and send these to a laboratory to be tested for adulteration and slap hefty fines on them.The accused demanded ₹5,000 from those who did not want the food samples collected. However, when asked for identity proof he quickly left the spot and the shopkeepers informed the police.Sanjiv Kumar added that Singh had extorted Rs 1,500 from him six months ago from him using the same tactics.Inspector Mohamad Jamil, station house officer at the Focal Point police station said Manpreet Singh had been arrested and a case under Sections 419, 420 and 170 of Indian Penal Code had been lodged against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fraudster-posing-as-food-supplies-officer-lands-in-police-net/story-IXP9VHmgTZpWaKIm8gTt6L.html
31-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC to rent out booths under Sector 17/22 subways, Sec 39-D and Mauli Jagran||The Chandigarh municipal corporation will be offering vacant booths on rent at the Sector 17/22 subway, Sector 39-D and Mauli Jagran after failing to auction these on leasehold basis.The move follows MC’s failure to get the UT administration’s nod to sell these booths on freehold basis.Earlier in a bid to attract buyers, the MC house had decided to auction the shops but did not get a response from the administration and so decided to change its strategy at Thursday’s general house meeting.A cash-strapped MC has been failing to sell properties in most locations and spending money on their upkeep even as buyers have expressed no interest in leasehold properties. COMPREHENSIVE POLICY ON RENTING MC PROPERTIESDuring its meeting the house decided to formulate a policy to rent out the booths and shops, but said it should be leased out for three years with an extension for two additional years instead of a year as proposed.Commercial properties under MC that could not be sold or leased will also be included.A sub-committee will be formed to assess market costs and finalise rates.However, 40 booths under the new overbridge in Sector 17 will be excluded as MC has started the process toe-auction them for rent.MC Commissioner KK Yadav has said that the committee will table its report at the next general house meeting. “It will asses the prevailing market rent and accordingly compile its report.”SURVEY OF EATERIESThe MC general house approved the agenda to allow eateries to put out chairs and tables outside during lunch and dinner hours. Directing MC officials to conduct a survey of the eateries and report on the demand, it said the enforcing wing should start a drive against people running eateries without permissions.Earlier, BJP city chief and councilor Arun Sood suggested that the proposed increase in monthly rentals should be reviewed and imposed on the basis of location of the units.MALOYA GAUSHALA OPERATIONS TO BE OUTSOURCEDThe MC decided that an expression of interest (EoI) will be invited for the running of the Maloya Gaushala (cow shelter). “It will be open for all. Whosoever is in the trade can apply and those eligible will be allowed to run the gaushala,” said MC commissioner KK Yadav at the house meeting.The development came after a request for additional funds for the gaushala was rejected by the house. Some councillors suggested that instead of paying more for gaushala operations it should be handed over to NGOs who could run it free of cost.The MC will also come up with a policy to check handing over of stray cattle caught by MC to their owners. “Other than villages, there is only one locality where cattle rearing is allowed. The MC should stop handing over stray cattle caught in areas other than this locality,” said BJP Councilor Shakti Prakash Devshali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mc-to-rent-out-booths-under-sector-17-22-subways-sec-39-d-and-mauli-jagran/story-EHCmTf6tPVmjkxBw4IkMWO.html
31-07-2020||Delhi||Better segregation of biomedical waste needed: EPCA||The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Protection (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA), in its report released on Thursday highlighting the status of handling of biomedical waste in Delhi-NCR, said that in July, Delhi generated around 350 tonnes of medical waste from Covid-19 patients daily.The report also suggested the need for better segregation of biomedical waste in households and quarantine centres housing Covid-19 patients.The report stated that the volume of waste generated in June was marginally higher, 372.47 tonnes per day, but this was because biomedical waste from patients in home isolation and quarantine centres was not segregated and so general waste was mixed with it. In May, the quantum of biomedical waste generated was 25.187 tonnes per day.Also, it said that due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there was an increase in the amount of plastic waste being generated in the form of PPE kits, gloves and face shields, among others, which in turn was adding to the problems of general solid waste management in the city. “The collection of such waste—which is not from infected households or quarantine centres—is a huge challenge as it increases the need for segregation at the household level so that general waste can be recycled and is not sent to landfills,” the report stated.The report is based on the data shared by the Central Pollution Control Board and state pollution control boards of Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Rajasthan.“CPCB assesses that at the current rate of biomedical waste generation and if there is adequate segregation, then the Common Biomedical Waste Treatment Facilities (CBWTFs) are adequate in the region,” it said.Data shows that at this rate of waste generation, Delhi can treat 2,220 tonnes of waste per month while Haryana can treat 288 tonnes per month, UP 1,656 tonnes per month and Rajasthan can treat 72 tonnes per month.It further said that while the system for the collection of biomedical waste from healthcare facilities and registered laboratories is well established, the biomedical waste generated in homes and quarantine centres is where the key complication arises, as urban local bodies (and increasingly village panchayats, as positive cases increase in rural areas) have to track patients in realtime and then set up systems for the collection of waste from individual households located in different parts of the city.The municipal corporations—North, East, South, New Delhi, Gurgaon, Faridabad and Ghaziabad—have told the SC panel that they had set up systems to collect the waste from individual households and quarantine centres and send it to CBWTFs.However, the report pointed out that the South and North Delhi municipal corporations were sending the biomedical waste to Waste-To-Energy plants instead of CBWTFs.“WTEs are not designed to incinerate biomedical waste, which needs a double insulator and protocols for storage and emission control,” the report highlights.To this, a senior North Corporation official, who didn’t wish to be named, said, “We are investigating the possibility of sending the waste to a CBWTF and will try to ensure the same.”In its recommendations, Epca also urged the SC to direct the ministry of forests and environment (MoEF) and CPCB to work out a national bar-coding system (a portal) for tracking of biomedical waste. “The task must not be left to CBWTFs, as it will not allow for good management,” it said.Epca chairman Bhure Lal said that so far the handling of biomedical waste has been satisfactory, however, all states need to maintain a strict vigil. “An issue with the collection and segregation of waste was observed in houses under isolation as well as at quarantine centres. Households must be educated about the same and must cooperate in the task for better management of such waste and not allowing infection to spread at all,” said Lal.Experts said that there could be a waste crisis if proactive steps are not taken by government agencies to handle the biomedical waste.They said considering the scale of the Covid-19 infection, the government will need to come up with a detailed plan to tackle biomedical waste generated in hospitals, quarantine centres and households. Sirajuddin Ahmed, a professor at the civil engineering department in Jamia Milia Islamia, said that either the government needs to make arrangements of dedicated trash bins for the disposal of hazardous waste such as masks and gloves, or it should be made mandatory that residents’ welfare associations, market associations and other commercial establishments place such bins on their premises for segregating this category of waste.“We are seeing a surge of not only biomedical waste in hospitals but also in households now. The key to tackling this waste is to provide people with the facility to dispose of this gear safely. The government will also need to create more awareness among citizens on the need for segregating such waste,” Ahmed said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/better-segregation-of-biomedical-waste-needed-epca/story-kFPfSxdkGZEbaHNs12DVZM.html
31-07-2020||Delhi||Patients with SARI to not be tested via rapid antigen method, orders govt||The Delhi government on Thursday removed patients admitted to hospitals with Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) from the list of high-risk individuals to be tested for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) via the rapid antigen method. This comes after the Delhi high court directed the state government to adhere to the guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research, which does not include it in its criteria for using the point-of-care tests that can give results within 15 minutes. “…testing strategies… using Rapid Antigen Detection test are hereby amended by deleting ‘All patients admitted with SARI’ from the list of high risk group of individuals who are compulsorily required to be tested for Covid-19 using Rapid Antigen Detection test with immediate effect,” the order by principal health secretary Vikram Dev Dutt read. The category has been removed from the government orders of July 5 and 7, which will now use rapid antigen tests only for those with influenza-like illnesses, hospitalised patients undergoing chemotherapy, those who are immunocompromised, including those living with HIV, patients who have cancer, transplant patients, and those above the age of 65 with comorbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/patients-with-sari-to-not-be-tested-via-rapid-antigen-method-orders-govt/story-cN38OeiWdifBBkym5OkUPN.html
31-07-2020||Delhi||Discontinuation of MPhil may affect research at PhD level: Scholars||Academicians and research scholars in several Delhi universities have raised concerns over the discontinuation of the MPhil programme under the New Education Policy (NEP), saying that it will affect the quality of research at PhD level as well as put a question mark over the validity of degrees of the researchers who are currently pursuing the programme.The Union Human Resource Development (HRD) ministry on Wednesday announced the NEP under which the two-year M.Phil programme shall be discontinued. Students will now be allowed to take admission in PhD directly after postgraduation or a four-year undergraduate degree with research.Academicians said that MPhil creates a “stronger base” for PhD. Moushumi Basu, an associate professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University’s (JNU) Centre for International Politics, Organization and Disarmament, said, “In a University like JNU, which is research-based, MPhil is very useful. It provides research scholars with breathing space for learning skills. Most postgraduate programmes in our country do not provide students with opportunities to write independently. They mostly have term papers, and the jump from term papers to thesis writing is too big. MPhil helps settle people into the rigour of research.” JNU offers over 300 MPhil seats in various subjects.Sheema Aleem, an associate professor in the Department of Psychology in Jamia Millia Islamia said that students do pursue PhD without an MPhil, but the latter makes a “huge difference” in developing their understanding for research. “The main reason why we recommend an MPhil before PhD is because it helps students understand the research methodologies well. It is like a stepping stone towards a PhD,” she said.Several academicians said that the master’s courses should be overhauled and more research components added. “Till now, MPhil has been playing the role of the first research-based degree. The universities will now have to completely change the structure of postgraduate courses by adding a research component at least for those who want to pursue a PhD in the future. Otherwise, the quality of PhD researches in the country will be compromised,” said Rekha Saxena, a professor at Delhi University’s Department of Political Science. DU offers around 200 MPhil seats in different subjects.Several research scholars pursuing MPhil said that the government should issue some clarity over the validity of their degrees now. Anuj Borboruah, 25, a resident of Assam’s Tezpur and a first-year student of MPhil in law and governance at JNU, said that he has learned the basics of research in the last year only. “There was no focus on research in our master’s programme. MPhil has given me some time to think about how to explore my area of interest in research. But now I am really scared whether my degree will remain valid even after the discontinuation of the programme,” he said.Kuldeep Singh, 28, a final-year MPhil scholar at Ambedkar University, said that discontinuation of the programme might reduce the number of job opportunities for many. “It was really shocking for me. I do not know if MPhil will help us get a job now. We will have to do a PhD even for applying for a teaching job. We just don’t know what’s going to happen now. The move will also affect the higher studies aspirations of students like me who cannot afford to pursue courses continuously and have to take breaks to work and earn,” he said.Some academicians, however, said that the move will not make much difference. JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar said that the move will save students’ time. “The advantage of applying directly to PhD after MA and MSc is that they can do their course work in the first year and in the next two or three years, they can complete their research work. Under this system, students have the opportunity to complete their PhD within four years. It will save a lot of time,” he said.Malabika Sarkar, the vice-chancellor of Ashoka University, said that MPhil does not hold any significance internationally. “Pursuing a PhD after completion of a master’s degree is better. It should be mandatory for students to complete a mini-thesis within five years of their undergraduate and postgraduate programmers before pursuing a PhD,” she said.Meanwhile, confusion prevailed over admissions to the MPhil programmes this year. Almost all universities, including DU and JNU, have already received thousands of applications for admission to MPhil for the session 2020-21. Shobha Bagai, the dean of admissions in DU, said, “We are yet to get any clarity over admission to MPhil this year from the government. Till then we cannot stop accepting applications,” she said.A spokesperson at MHRD said that a notification will be issued in this regard soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/discontinuation-of-mphil-may-affect-research-at-phd-level-scholars/story-sJV8ZwsLQtgki2zzeHICyL.html
31-07-2020||Delhi||Health ministry to replicate Delhi’s Covid-19 model in other states||The Union health ministry intends to replicate the “successful Delhi model” in other states with large outbreaks of Covid-19, a Union health ministry official said on Thursday, citing the example of how authorities in the national capital were able to bring down a key metric – the case positivity rate – from 37% in June to 6% this week.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageCase positivity rate refers to the number of people found positive among all people who are tested for Covid-19 on a particular day – a proportion that determines how prevalent the disease is and how well health officials are able to catch and isolate patients. “The improved numbers show that test, trace and treat strategy has worked very well and Delhi is a prime example before us as it managed to successfully contain the disease spread with the help of the centre. The situation is being managed in two ways: keeping the infection low, and also keeping the mortality low. Experts have shown that in 80% of the positive cases it is possible to trace close contacts within 72 hours. This model will have to be adopted in other states also,” said Rajesh Bhushan, officer on special duty, health ministry. In an interview to HT on July 18, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal credited a five-point “Delhi Model” – increased testing, home isolation of mild cases, availability of hospital beds, transparency of data, and plasma therapy – for helping the region become one of the few in the country to be able to rein in the outbreak.On Thursday, the health ministry’s Bhushan reiterated there was no community transmission in the country. “In India, there are clusters of cases and pockets of localised transmission, and the solution to contain it lies in aggressive testing, effective surveillance, contact tracing and clinical management of those infected to be able to fight it successfully,” he said. Bhushan also referred to the one million recoveries, a milestone India passed on Wednesday and said it “shows how much effort has been put in by our doctors, nurses, paramedic and other frontline workers in managing the outbreak”. India’s case fatality rate also declined from 3.33% on June 18 to 2.21% on July 30, he said, adding: “Our target is to bring the case fatality rate to 1% or less, and case positivity rate to 10% in first phase, and later to 5% in states with high case load as per the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines,” said Bhushan. Eight states have achieved a case fatality rate of 1% and below. “The ultimate aim is to save lives and it is a positive trend that we are losing fewer patients as compared to other Covid-19 affected countries,” says Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/health-ministry-to-replicate-delhi-s-covid-19-model-in-other-states/story-sh1gIPVs2mK4nWxqdh7qaJ.html
31-07-2020||City||Manish Sisodia hits out at new education policy||Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday said that the New Education Policy (NEP) endorses a “highly regulated” and “poorly funded” model of education, which is silent about the means required to reach the targets it aimed to achieve.“The new education policy states that 6% of the total GDP will be spent on the education sector. However, it is silent on how this will be implemented. There should be a law ensuring mandatory 6% expenditure of the GDP on education. The government should bring the law. This was said in 1966 by the Kothari Commission but never implemented till date despite demands,” Sisodia said during a media briefing on Thursday. Sisodia’s remarks came a day after the union Human Resource Development (HRD) ministry, which has now been renamed as the education ministry, introduced the policy to bring in wide-ranging reforms aimed at making the Indian education system more contemporary and skill-oriented.The Union education ministry did not respond to requests for comment.Sisodia said the NEP recognises the flaws in the current education system but was unable to break free of the pressures of traditions. “The nation was waiting for a new education policy for 34 years. It is here now. It is a forward-looking document, which accepts the flaws of today’s education system but has two issues with it — it was unable to break free of the pressures of education’s old traditions and does not say how the reforms that it aims to bring in will be achieved,” he said. Sisodia said the NEP mentions setting up a regulatory body at every level but it can create a lot of “confusion” in the functioning of the education ministry. The Delhi education minister said that the new policy is ambiguous about bringing classes up to 12 under the ambit of the Right to Education (RTE) Act that currently mandates free and compulsory education till Class 8. “In six years of deliberations, if you could not resolve the issue of funding and bringing entire school education under the Right to Education Act, how do you propose to implement the policy?” Sisodia said.Expressing apprehensions over the two models of Early Childhood Education -- Anganwadi model and the pre-school model -- proposed in NEP, Sisodia said, “In such a situation, while one set of children will receive ECE through anganwadi workers another will be through trained Nursery teachers. What kind of equity are we securing if we have discrimination so early in the life of a child?”Sisodia said the NEP does not touch upon how the central government is planning to improve the education system in its schools. “It is the responsibility of the government to provide quality education to children. The policy has no direct emphasis on the government school system. It rather seeks to encourage private philanthropists. The policy should have been explicit on committing to provide quality education by the government instead of encouraging private education,” he said.Sisodia also said that the policy does not talk about the training of teachers and promotion of sports in educational institutions. “The policy talks about making the board examination easier but it misses the point by saying so. It is not about a hard or easy exam, it is about assessing the learning, understanding and application,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sisodia-hits-out-at-new-education-policy/story-05d7m9gNQJAom4EF9b2b1K.html
31-07-2020||Delhi||Unlock 3: Hotels, banquets in Delhi can open, no decision on gyms||The Delhi government has decided to allow hotels, hospitality services, street hawkers to operate and do away with the night curfew hours applicable between 10pm and 5am under the Centre’s Unlock 3 plan, the third phase of the gradual lifting of curbs announced to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe Delhi government will allow weekly bazars to operate for a week on a trial basis to check if social distancing norms are adhered to. An official order to implement the relaxations in Delhi is likely to be issued by Saturday, said a senior government official.However, even though the Centre has allowed gymnasiums and yoga centres to operate, the Delhi government is yet to take a call on it. Senior government officials said that L-G Anil Baijal in his meeting with Kejriwal on Wednesday had expressed his unwillingness to open gyms and yoga centres as of now. “So, the chief minister has said that a decision on this will be taken in a week’s time after consulting with al stakeholders,” an official said. A media advisor to the chief minister said marriages/events with the restriction of 50 people can now be held in banquet halls, which come under the hospitality services.The Union home ministry issued the plan, “Unlock 3”, on Wednesday prepared after receiving feedback from states and in consultation held with central ministries and departments, to open up more activities outside containment zones.“These decisions are in continuation of several important decisions taken by CM Arvind Kejriwal in the past few days to ensure Delhi’s economy, which was impacted severely by the lockdown, gets back on track,” said a a statement issued by the office of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday.Regarding hotels, the statement said, “Since hotels of Delhi are no longer linked to hospitals, Delhi government has also decided to allow normal functioning of hotels and hospitality services, as already permitted under Centre’s unlock guidelines.”The Delhi government had on Wednesday de-linked around 40 hotels and 77 banquet halls attached to different hospitals to augment the city’s Covid-19 bed capacity.Sandeep Khandelwal, president of Delhi Hotel and Restaurant Owners’ Association, said: “It is a great relief for thousands of people who are directly or indirectly employed with the hotel industry – from managers, housekeeping staff, chefs and waiters to plumbers, electricians and scores of other people engaged in different roles. Now that the economy is reviving, it may take a month or two, but business will get back to normal very soon.”Gym owners said they expect the government to allow them to operate soon. Chirag Sethi, vice-president Delhi Gym Association, said: “This is a very tough situation for us. We expect the government to allow gyms to open as soon as possible because livelihood of over a lakh people in Delhi depend on fitness industry. More wait will cause more revenue loss for the industry which had been completely shut for over 120 days. Gym owners have already started sanitisation of their gyms and are preparing SOPs (standard operating procedures) to operate gyms and fitness centres. We will meet the CM tomorrow and appeal the government to open gyms without any further delay.”Arbind Singh, national convener of National Association of Street Vendors in India, said: “It is a welcome move because street vendors are struggling since the lockdown was implemented. Now, the government should urgently implement the street vendor law so that designated spots can be earmarked for them. That would help ensuring better safety norms and social distancing in the days to come.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/unlock-3-hotels-banquets-in-delhi-can-open-no-decision-on-gyms/story-wnNVlhw3h8EQ4ZtPgpJtyL.html
31-07-2020||Delhi||Containment zones can now be de-notified in 14 days instead of 28||Containment zones in Delhi can now be de-notified in two weeks — down from 28 days, from the day the last Covid-19 patient in the area recovers, the state health department said on Thursday, a move that will bring significant relief to residents of some red zones in the city that have been contained for months. The decision to relax containment norms, taken by the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoH&FW) on Wednesday, had been a long-standing demand of the Delhi government, with several containment zones in the national capital having been under complete lockdown for more than three months now.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe health ministry had on Wednesday issued an office memorandum to all states and union territories, saying a few states had experienced continuing outbreaks in some containment zones (CZs) and buffer zones (that encircle the CZs), keeping them under lockdown for months. “In such cases, to have another period of 28 days, to de-notify such CZs brings hardships to its residents. Hence, some states have requested to review the same,” it said.The Delhi government on Thursday welcomed the move and said all district administrations have been asked to now follow the new rules issued by the health ministry. “Delhi was one the first states to urge the Centre to reduce the number of days it takes to de-seal a containment zone. The new guidelines will be strictly followed in Delhi. Aggressive contact tracing and active surveillance of high risk groups and symptomatic persons will continue in such areas,” the chief minister’s office said. The union health ministry’s document mentioned that states which have CZs with prolonged lockdowns may choose to de-notify a containment zone “14 days after discharge of the last confirmed case (instead of 28 days)”.Also read: Health ministry to replicate Delhi’s Covid-19 model in other states“The surveillance operations will be scaled down if no laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 case is reported from the containment zone for at least 14 days after the last confirmed case has been isolated and all the contacts of the confirmed case have been followed up for 14 days,” the document seen by HT read. However, the central government also made it clear that surveillance for influenza-like illnesses (ILI), severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) and rigorous testing for these will continue in de-notified containment and buffer zones. “If further positive cases emerge in the de-notified containment or buffer zone, the area will again be declared as a containment zone and the containment process shall begin afresh,” the memorandum read.A city/district/state can be declared “free from the disease outbreak” only after 28 days have passed since the last confirmed case has been tested negative through an RT-PCR diagnosis.The Centre, however, also came down on states and union territories for not being able to break the chain of transmission for prolonged periods in some containment zones. “It is noted that such continuing outbreaks in CZ/BZs reflect less than satisfactory active surveillance, contact testing, testing and inadequate adherence to home isolation guidelines. Hence, to avoid such a situation, the CZ needs to be redefined, surveillance strengthened and testing increased manifold,” it said.As on Thursday, Delhi had 694 containment zones and at least 300,000 people live in such areas. There were at least five areas in Delhi that had been contained for over three months, including GTB Enclave’s E-block, K and G blocks in Jahangirpuri, Majlis Park in Adarsh Nagar and Hauz Rani. Apart from this, two lanes in southeast Delhi’s Chandni Mahal were under lockdown for at least 88 days.In an interview with HT on July 18, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the Centre’s rules on containment zones needed serious reconsideration, adding that the Delhi government had made multiple requests to the Central government to relax containment norms in the city. “The Centre’s rule says that if there is no new Covid case for 28 days straight then that area can be de-contained. But if even a single new Covid case emerges in a containment zone then it will remain under lockdown for 28 more days. As a result there are some containment zones which are under lockdown for 3-4 months. People are very distressed in these zones because they are completely locked down in their houses.“We have spoken to the Central government, to the Union health and family welfare ministry and have requested them to fix an outer time limit as well. Just like a country cannot be under a permanent lockdown, localities too cannot operate that way. Permanent lockdown cannot be a long-term solution. The Central government has appreciated our feedback and said that similar complaints have come from other states too. They are now revising the guidelines,” Kejriwal had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/containment-zones-can-now-be-de-notified-in-14-days-instead-of-28/story-egIGZEEI1B5ki2lnoxlLsO.html
31-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt sets up 4 panels to monitor deaths in hospitals with higher fatality rates||Even as the number of deaths due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Delhi has dropped, the government has set up four committees of four members each to inspect hospitals and wards that are reporting the highest number of deaths. The panels have been asked to submit their suggestions on reducing deaths by August 3 to principal health secretary Vikram Dev Dutt, the order states. “It has been observed that the percentage of deaths vis-à-vis admissions and the percentage of Covid-19 deaths in wards in 11 hospitals, government and private, is on the higher side during the period July 1 to July 23, 2020. Four committee comprising of specialists, two from internal medicine and another two from anaesthesia, have been constituted for inspecting the allotted hospitals to examine whether the standard treatment protocols for treating Covid patients are being followed,” an order from the health secretary Padmini Singla read. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe hospitals to be inspected include private ones like Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, Max Hospital (Saket), St Stephen’s hospital, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Jaipur Golden hospital and Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute, and government facilities such as Ram Manohar Lohia, Safdarjung, Lok Nayak, and GTB hospitals. Some of the Capital’s major Covid-19 treatment facilities, these hospitals often receive many patients with severe symptoms.The committee consists of doctors from hospitals managing Covid-19 like Lok Nayak and Safdarjung as well as non-Covid hospitals like Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital, Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital, and Aruna Asaf Ali government hospital. “There has been a reduction in the number of deaths due to corona, however, we need to reduce it further. Today, we constituted four committees that will inspect hospitals and provide suggestion --- 1. Where there have been more deaths, 2. Where there have been more deaths in the wards, meaning patients were not moved to the ICU on time,” said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a tweet. On Thursday, Delhi recorded 29 deaths due to Covid-19 across the city, taking the total toll to 3,936. On average, the city recorded about 27 deaths during the previous week. This is almost one-fifth of the 101 deaths – the highest number of deaths recorded in the city on one day, according to data shared by the CM office earlier. This puts the city’s case fatality rate – percentage of people who have died among the number of infections detected – at 2.9%. This comes after the government had asked a 12-member court-appointed committee — that had been tasked with providing suggestions about patient care — to look into reducing deaths as well. “I haven’t received the orders yet. Once we do, we will decide along with other committee members what aspects we have to observe. Most likely we have to see whether they have adequate facilities and whether the standard of care was followed. However, from what I have seen at our hospital, the mortality has actually gone down significantly now and the patients who do die are the ones who have multiple co-morbid conditions such as uncontrolled diabetes with kidney disease etc. The young or relatively healthy people who do die sometimes are those who reach the hospital late when their oxygen saturation is already very low,” said one of the committee members from Lok Nayak hospital, on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-sets-up-4-panels-to-monitor-deaths-in-hospitals-with-higher-fatality-rates/story-KGaxIwEkk4QJCu5sK75TwN.html

Five recovered Covid-19 patients donated their plasma to the blood bank, including 37-year-old Krishna Murari, a resident of Sector 10, who was the first person to donate plasma. Out of the eight people who reached the blood bank, only five could donate plasma, after fulfilling all the criteria for donation, as per the doctors present at the blood bank. Till the first half of the day no activity took place, while in the evening, five people gave their plasma after going through screening and blood tests, which included the antibody test for Covid-19.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Detected Covid-19 positive on June 10 after having fever-like symptoms, Murari was under home isolation till June 28. “During that period, I received calls regarding plasma donation. But as told by doctors, plasma can only be donated after 14 days of recovery. So I had to wait for it. I was comfortable donating my plasma as I have been donating blood for a long time,” said Murari. Dr Mahima Kilhor, medical officer at Rotary Blood Bank, who is also the nodal in-charge of the plasma bank, said, “Only those patients who have recovered from the illness can donate plasma 14 days of their recovery. One unit of plasma collected can be used for two patients. The bank can store over 1000 units of plasma, which can be used on Covid-19 patients admitted in private and government hospitals. The bank has one plasmapheresis machine that separates plasma from the blood and transfuses the blood back into the body of the donor.” Currently, the bank has 10 units of plasma for Covid-19 patients. Convalescent plasma therapy uses antibodies generated in the body against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Plasma, a component of blood, contains these antibodies. When the plasma is administered to a Covid-19 patients, it boosts their immunity to fight against the infection. It is still an experimental therapy approved by the Central health ministry. The plasma therapy has previously been used during the SARS and MERS outbreaks, which were also caused by viruses from the same family as the Sars-CoV-2.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Doctors said that nearly 70 Covid-19 recovered patient have given confirmation for donation. Till date, 8,989 coronavirus cases have been reported in Gurugram, with 77 new cases on Thursday. Out of the total cases, 991 are active patients while 7,876 have recovered. The Covid-19 toll stands at 122. As reported by HT on Thursday, convalescent plasma for Covid-19 patients will be issued on a signed request of the authorised nodal officer of the hospital where the patient is undergoing treatment, along with the medical superintendent of the district health department. The cost of plasma unit has been fixed at ₹8,500 and it will be free for BPL card holders and pregnant women. In July, PGIMS-Rohtak became the first government hospitals in the state to start plasma therapy. Dr Dhruv Chaudhary, head, pulmonary and critical care medicine department, PGIMS-Rohtak, who is also Haryana’s nodal officer for Covid-19, said, “Plasma has been collected from 15 recovered Covid-19 patients. Since one unit can suffice two patients, we have stock for 30 patients. But as a part of the trial study, we have transfused plasma in eight patients. It is difficult to share the inferences as the sample size is small. Some of them have responded to the plasma therapy while a few of them succumbed to the illness.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-s-first-plasma-bank-becomes-operational-5-recovered-patients-donate-plasma/story-ggTbqulyvjov4KvUDu8uiN.html
31-07-2020||Mumbai||Tiger ranges across south Konkan need protection, says forest department||The Maharashtra forest department has suggested the retention of 33 villages in the Western Ghats ranges of Kolhapur and Sindhudurg districts as a part of an eco-sensitive area (ESA). The forest department has highlighted the presence of tigers and the importance of connectivity of wildlife corridors. It is learnt that a formal communication has been sent to the state government. “These villages in the Sahyadri-Konkan wildlife corridor are critically important and should be part of the ESA. It will improve the ecosystem and boost tiger conservation along with the conservation of its rich biodiversity. Deliberations are underway at the state level,” said a senior state forest officer. While 25 of these 33 villages are located in the Sawantwadi-Dodamarg talukas of Sindhudurg, the remaining villages are in Kolhapur district. Though some of these villages were included in the Western Ghats draft eco-sensitive zone (ESZ), the majority including the entire Dodamarg taluka where seven tigers were photographed from 2014 to 2019 was left out. The suggestion was shared by the forest department during a webinar organised on the occasion of International Tiger Day on Wednesday. The Bombay high court (HC) in 2013 and reiterated in 2018 had directed the state and Union environment ministry to ensure the corridor is protected as an ESZ.However, orders have not been complied with for the past seven years. “During this time, 1,500 acres of forests have already been lost despite a ban on tree felling in the area. Most of Sindhudurg’s forests are privately owned and such areas have been either sold or leased to mining companies making matters worse. The government needs to act immediately,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti and one of the petitioners. Sumaira Abdulali, convener, Awaaz Foundation that filed the first petition in the matter said, “There is a need to implement the existing court order directing the declaration of 52 villages in Dodamarg as part of the ESA.” The suggestion comes at a time when the Karnataka forest department indicated that a male tiger (T-31), whose camera trap image was recorded in 2018 from Sahyadri Tiger Reserve (STR), had travelled 300 km, covering 150 sq. km, and photographed multiple times at the Kali Tiger Reserve earlier this year. “It indicates that though the corridor may be fragmented but its functional connectivity is intact, and efforts are needed to ensure it is protected from human-induced pressures,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Maharashtra. The details follow a day after a Centre’s report on the status of tigers, co-predators and prey in India 2018 highlighted low tiger density at STR due to fragmented corridor connectivity along the north Western Ghats all the way from Kali Tiger Reserve in Karnataka to Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary in Goa further to the recently designated Tillari Conservation Reserve in Sindhudurg district and further north to Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary and Chandoli National Park encompassing STR. The report suggested that linear infrastructure projects, mining and allied development activities should be avoided and in case projects are of national importance, appropriate mitigation measures be implemented. If this was done, then tigers could steadily make their way to STR over the next 10 years. Sunil Limaye, additional principal chief conservator of the forest said, “STR has an appropriate habitat, adequate connectivity, and is large enough (over 1,400sqkm) for conservation and translocation of tigers. Over the next year, we will be undertaking augmentation of the prey population followed by a proposal for translocation of tigers from the Vidarbha landscape. 25 villages of Dodamarg-Sawantwadi, their ecological significance List of villages: Kesari, Phansavde, Udeli, Dabhil- Nevli, Sarambale, Otavne, Gharpi, Asniye, Fukeri, Tamboli, Konshi, Bhalaval, Bhekurli, Kumbhavde, Khadpade, Talkat, Zolambi, Kolzhar, Shirwal, Kumbhral, Panturli, Bhike Konal, Kalane, Ugade, Padve Majgaon. Biodiversity at these villages: A rapid biodiversity assessment of the area had recorded 19 species of mammals, 12 species of amphibians, 71 species of birds, 60 species of butterflies, 2 species of damselflies, 16 species of reptiles, 4 species of scorpions, 4 species of spiders and 5 species of other invertebrates over six days. What’s at stake: Tiger corridor, villages, perennial rivers, waterfalls, streams, dense forests, swamps, wildlife in this landscape. Threats: Mining, red category industries, linear infrastructure projects, private forest areas, and tree felling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tiger-ranges-across-south-konkan-need-protection-says-forest-department/story-4Xl0EnPOxlUTnXGQs0avWM.html

It’s better not to think about Covid. One should always look forward in live. I think that’s how I have lived so long. Tomorrow, I am going to offer namaaz on Eid-ul-Juha,” says Rabia Ahmadi, who tested positive for Covid on July 15 and was admitted to L-3 facility in Sharda hospital Rabia, who suffers from Alzheimer’s, was not able to recognise any of her relatives at the time of her admission to the hospital.Click here for the latest updates on the pandemic from India and around the world “The biggest challenges in her treatment were her age and the language barrier. The chronic case of Alzheimer’s. made matters worse. Taking cognisance of her critical condition, she was directly shifted to intensive care unit (ICU) and an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) dedicated team appointed to take her care. According to Covid protocols, she remained on non-invasive ventilator support for seven days, and was given adequate high protein diet, which resulted in her showing sign of recovery,” said Dr Abhishek Deswal, the in-charge of Covid ICU unit at Sharda hospital. He added that as the patient’s non-invasive ventilation (NIV) requirement decreased, she was shifted to a oxygen mask.”Now, she has a very low oxygen requirement and is responding well,” Dr Deswal said.. Sharing more insights, Dr Ashutosh Niranjan, the medical superintendent of the hospital, said that due to dementia, Rabia often used to forget that she had been admitted to a hospital. “Instead, while sitting in her wheelchair, she often thought that she was at the airport, Dr Niranjan said. Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreak“The doctors overcame this by changing her bed frequently to keep her wavering mind steady and to keep her comfortable, while giving her the medical attention needed,” he said. He said that since Ahmadi has tested negative for Covid-19 now and doesn’t require oxygen support anymore, she will be discharged from the hospital on Friday. “She is stable now. It was an enriching and challenging experience, but the whole Covid team finally did it,” he said. When contacted, Rabia’s son Zuhib Ahmadi, with whom she stays in sector 27 here, said that his mother’s recovery was nothing less than a miracle. “Tomorrow will be the real Eid for our family. We are making sweets and sewaiyaans for her,” he said. Meanwhile, Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that the 105-year-old woman has proved that with strong will power, Covid can be defeated easily. “We’ll salute the lady tomorrow while she is being discharged from the hospital.

31-07-2020||Pune||Alum Ganesh idols for a greener tomorrow||Pune: In the past couple of years, Punekars are actively supporting eco-friendly Ganesh idols. Along with clay, this year they will be opting for idols made up of alum.Mayur Dhake of Dolphin Chemicals [Bhusawal] and manufacturer of alum has also started making alum idols.“We made 500 small idols last year and distributed it to residents in our neighbourhood in Jalgaon. The response was good as it is also eco-friendly and does not cause water pollution. We had planned to make more idols this year, but settled for 3,000 due to the Covid-19 lockdown situation,” said Dhake.According to him, one idol takes 5-6 hours to be completed and more demands are coming from Pune, Jalgaon, Nashik, Satara, Aurangabad, Mumbai and Nagpur.The distribution of idols is looked after by MRP Green Window Solution – a firm that deals with eco-friendly Ganesh idols.“We are into alum industry since the last 10 years. In 2019, we tried to make Ganesh idols out of alum as it will not have adverse effect on the environment. Our aim was to add to the green efforts carried about many responsible citizens,” said Dhake.MRP Green Window Solution is busy taking orders as the transport of idols have to be monitored because of the lockdown restrictions in place at many areas.“People generally opt for clay [shadu] idols, but it does not dissolve completely in water.

31-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC to remove legacy waste from Dadumajra plant||The municipal corporation will shift 25,000 metric tonnes of legacy waste from the waste processing plant to a dumping site in Dadumajra. This was approved in the MC General House meeting on Thursday. Legacy waste comprises garbage collecting for years. Work to clear 5 lakh metric tonnes of legacy waste at the dumping site is already underway as part of a Rs 35-crore project. MC commissioner KK Yadav said, “The committee that examined the issue earlier will decide how to go about the process.”On the demand of adding councillors to the committee, Yadav said, “There are already three councillors in the committee in addition to MC officials.”MC took over the plant from Jaypee Group on June 19 and has been running the plant since. It had signed an agreement with Jaypee in 2005 for setting up a garbage processing plant. But in February this year, the MC House had ordered a takeover because it observed that the plant was not being operated to its optimum capacity.“Legacy waste has to be shifted so that the waste processing plant can run properly. We will shift the legacy waste to the dumping site in phases so that it does not burden the removal process,” said a senior MC official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mc-to-remove-25m-legacy-waste-from-waste-processing-plant/story-6G0gQ7XU0yiniakeStx6jO.html
31-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh tricity gyms gear up to get back on the fitness track after four months||With apps to book workout sessions and sanitisation of equipment after each use, work has begun on a war footing to put Covid-19 safety measures in place in gyms, which are opening up from August 5 after a four-month shutdown. Temperature checks at entrances and sanitisation of equipment after every session will be done.As per Unlock 3 guidelines issued by the Union home ministry on Wednesday, yoga institutions and gyms reopen from August 5.Manu Sharma, manager of Bodyscapes Fitness Temple, Sector 34-A, says, “We have received a positive response from our clients. Many of them are looking forward to rejoining the gym. We are hiring extra staff to ensure temperature checks at the entrance and regular sanitisation of equipment. A mobile application will also be developed to help clients book sessions.”Though the ministry of health and family welfare has yet to issue standard operating procedures for gyms, Abhishek Gagneja, owner of Ultimate Fitness Gyms, which has branches in Chandigarh, Mohali and Zirakpur, says they have worked out their safety routine. “Workout slots will be issued and only 10 persons will attend a session. We will not provide mats and water to clients and steam baths will not be allowed. Trainers will also not be allowed to physically touch the clients.”CLIENTS TO GIVE UNDERTAKING Jaspreet Soni, founder of Ohio gym and spa, which has branches in Mohali, Kharar and Ludhiana, says they will be taking an undertaking from clients that they have not shown any symptoms of Covid-19 in the last month. “Clients will book sessions through a mobile application and after every session equipment will be sanitised. No physical sessions will be held with trainers. They will provide training online.”However, some gym regulars are not too keen to visit, with Navneet Sharma of Mohali’s Phase 3B2, saying, “I would prefer to exercise at home as one could contract infection at the gym.”Sanjeev Kumar, president, Tricity Gym Owners’ Association, says he was waiting for detailed operating procedures to see how many people will be allowed in the gyms at a time.”The government should consider allowing a good number of people per session so that gyms can sustain themselves,” he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/apps-to-book-sessions-equipment-cleaned-after-each-use-tricity-gyms-gear-up-to-get-back-on-the-fitness-track-after-4-months/story-EZJj0sgirXwZCRloeMP6DK.html
31-07-2020||Chandigarh||Rise in snatching cases alarming, no leniency for perpetrators: High court||Expressing concern over the “alarming” rise in snatching cases in Chandigarh, the Punjab and Haryana high court has said perpetrators deserve no leniency as the public will lose faith in the criminal justice system.Dismissing the bail plea of Ajay, a 22-year-old man accused of chain snatching in Burail on March 15, the bench of justice HS Madaan said on Thursday: “Normal people, especially women and children, are afraid of going out of their houses... in the evening and at late night hours. In the process of snatching valuables from the common people, the criminals cause harm to them physically, especially when some resistance is offered.”People had started suffering from a fear psychosis, the bench added.According to an FIR lodged at the Sector 34 police station, Ajay was accused of attacking and robbing two persons at 11 pm, when they were out for a walk. The stolen articles were later recovered by the police.The Chandigarh administration had informed the court that the accused had been involved in two similar crimes in April 2020 and one in September 2017. “That means he is a habitual offender. If granted the concession of bail, there is every likelihood of his trying to tamper with the prosecution evidence by giving threat or inducement to the prosecution witnesses or even to abscond to delay the trial,” the bench said.There was probability of his taking to the path of crime again, resulting in a rise in the crime graph in the area, the bench added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rise-in-snatching-cases-alarming-no-leniency-for-perpetrators-hc/story-mMWzj7XjBrBV5Bi4pjz6xJ.html
31-07-2020||Pune||New education policy is children-friendly, says Vasudha Kamat||Pune: The New Education Policy (NEP) approved by the Union cabinet on Wednesday is based on the draft prepared by an eight-member committee led by former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chief K Kasturirangan. Professor Vasudha Kamat, former vice-chancellor of SNDT University [Mumbai] and one of the members of the committee, speaks extensively about NEP and her experience while working in the committee that was formed in 2017. Reactions on the announcement of NEP and the ministry’s name change? Change in the name of ministry is important, because human resource development is a part of education. Education is beyond human resource development, as it covers many other aspects; hence we suggested a change in the name of the ministry from HRD to education. We interacted and discussed with many people related to higher and school education while drafting the policy. So, it is the country’s policy and the credit goes to all citizens who have made their contributions. I think the policy document is extensive and has given a lot of thought on quality education. We also suggested that the Right to Education (RTE) should be extended from age 3 to 18. A lot of changes have been suggested in NEP till 2030 and we look forward to its implementations. The new education policy is children-friendly. You open any page and will find that our central thrust is on children’s learning without being burdensome. Your experience on working in the committee I am fortunate to be a part of this committee. Working with Dr Kasturirangan is a learning experience as he is a great leader and inspiration. The way he led the committee comprising educators from different backgrounds was commendable as we were working on focus points and strengths. He motivated us to share our experiences.What are the important changes in NEP? There are several highlights of the policy, one of which is “New Pedagogical and curricular structure”. We discarded the current 10 + 2 structure in school and junior college. We suggested that education should start at age three and anganwadi workers are presently teaching these children. As per the draft, each student should be taught by Bachelor of Education (BEd) teachers. We have suggested a modified new pedagogical and curricular restructuring of 5+3+3+4 covering ages 3-18. To reduce Class 10 and 12 exam stress, under the new structure, students of Classes 9 to 12 can appear for any three subjects. I think it will be a great game changer in education field. In higher education, we have suggested to discard the “affiliated” system. We have 40,000 affiliated colleges, 11,000 standalone institutions and 900 universities in the country. We suggested that these colleges should be accredited by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) and become autonomous. All universities should be multi-disciplinary and vocational and professional education should be given equal weightage.The Covid situation has shifted education more towards online learning and it is also reflected in NEP. What would you say about it? We have one of the chapters in the policy draft called “educational technology”. It means education comes first and technology to support it. So, learning is the central idea. Lot of tools are available today and people are opting for online learning, but learning should be the central idea. We have suggested how technology can be used for various purposes, including training, assessment and management. Technology infrastructure will be strengthened to help education reach the remote parts of the country. It will happen phase-wise and, by 2025, we hope that technology and facilities will reach all the students of our country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-education-policy-is-children-friendly-says-vasudha-kamat/story-VVGdtzc2uZGGHFgizSNbsK.html
31-07-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana gym owners heave sigh of relief after 4 months||Gym owners in the district can finally heave a sigh of relief after the Union ministry of home affairs on Thursday allowed the establishments to reopen from August 5 after four months. Many owners and staff members who were rendered unemployed during the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19 had to change their vocation to make ends meet. They are now waiting for the standard operating procedure (SOP) that is yet to be announced. Gym owners are hopeful that they will at least be able to meet fixed charges such as rent and electricity, which owners had to pay though the business’ were closed.A gym owner, Monu Bhardwaj, said, “There are over 800 gyms in Ludhiana and this decision has given them hope. The industry was struggling to make ends meet. Trainers were forced to do odd jobs in the interim and have welcomed the announced.”‘CUSTOMERS MIGHT CHOOSE TO STAY AWAY’A gym owner in Ramgarh village, Baljinder Singh, who had rejoined an auto parts company as a design engineer after six years, said, “This was a major relief for the industry, which was reeling under losses. Apart from running the gymnasium, I will continue to work as a design engineer as it is due to my job that I was able to earn a livelihood at this time of crises. Also, the future is uncertain as the number of cases are rising and customers may choose to stay away from gyms.”Gym Ekta Welfare Association director Ramesh Bangar said, “Gym owners have started cleaning and sanitising the premises but we are concerned over the SOP. The government should not announce an SOP that will reduce footfall in the gyms otherwise owners will not even be able to meet fixed charges. We would, however, follow all regulations, including social distancing, wearing masks and using hand sanitisers.”Aura Gym owner Navneet Singh said,”The future of the industry is bright due to increasing awareness among residents about their health. The government has agreed to our demand to open gyms and we will follow all guidelines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/unlock-3-0-ludhiana-owners-heave-a-sigh-of-relief-concerned-over-sops/story-mCVtlWdlxupMBtPyu3hoeL.html

31-07-2020||World||‘Don’t want to see crooked election’: Donald Trump retraces steps on delaying November polls||President Donald Trump has walked back his controversial suggestion to delay the November 3 elections in the face of fierce opposition from even Republicans.“Do I want to see a date change? No,” Trump said to reporters at the daily White House briefing on the Covid-19 epidemic. “But I don’t want to see a crooked election.”The US president mooted election delay in a tweet Thursday as an alternative to the use of mail-in voting in the November 3 elections, arguing it will lead to fraud and abuse. It is being considered by many states in view of the ongoing Covid-19 epidemic and some of them tried it in the primaries.Trump brought copies of news articles to the briefing about specific cases of problems facing mail-in voting in Democratic primaries in New York and New Jersey. “Mail-in ballots will lead to the greatest fraud,” he said.Subsequently, the election-delay tweet that was pinned at the top post on his Twitter feed for more than 84 million followers to see, had been taken down by the end of the day.Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, made the point with a tweet quoting the constitution: “Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution states:’The Congress may determine the Time of choosing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States’.”And others, including many senior Republicans, pointed to the fact that elections had been held in the midst of even the most dire of times such as the Civil War, and World War I and the Spanish Flu epidemic in 1918.“Never in the history of the country, through wars and depressions and the Civil War, have we ever not had a federally scheduled election on time, and we’ll find a way to do that again this November 3,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, told a local TV stations in his home state Kentucky.Kevin McCarthy, the top top Republican in the House, told reporters at a news briefing that “never in the history of the federal elections have we ever not held an election and we should go forward with our election”.Former President Barack Obama weighed in as well making a broader point of voting rights at the funeral of John Lewis, the civil rights leader who passed away last week. “Even as we sit here, there are those in power are doing their darnedest to discourage people from voting – by closing polling locations, and targeting minorities and students with restrictive ID laws, and attacking our voting rights with surgical precision, even undermining the postal service in the run-up to an election that is going to be dependent on mailed-in ballots so people don’t get sick.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-want-to-see-crooked-election-donald-trump-retraces-steps-on-delaying-november-polls/story-07Kn1lX04IkHMVdobavv8M.html
31-07-2020||World||Anthony Fauci ‘cautiously optimistic’ about Covid-19 vaccine||Anthony Fauci, the top US epidemiologist, told lawmakers Friday he is “cautiously optimistic” that a vaccine for Covid-19 will be available by the end of the year.“There’s never a guarantee that you’re going to get a safe and effective vaccine, but from everything we’ve seen now in the animal data, as well as the early human data, we feel cautiously optimistic that we will have a vaccine by the end of this year and as we go into 2021,” Fauci said at a congressional hearing.The National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which Fauci heads, is participating in five of the many projects underway in the United States as part of Operation Warp Speed, the federally supported effort to find a vaccine.One of these candidate vaccines, being developed by Moderna, went into Phase 3 clinical trial past Monday.“I believe, ultimately, over a period of time in 2021, if we have it, and I think we will have a safe and effective vaccine, that Americans will be able to get it,” Fauci went on to say.Asked about its distribution he said, “I don’t think that they will have everybody getting it immediately in the beginning. It probably will be phased in.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-cautiously-optimistic-about-covid-19-vaccine/story-CQnyFJf2HTZ88romL7H7HN.html
31-07-2020||World||Nepal seeks talks with India as soon as possible on Kalapani border row||Nepal’s foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali on Friday called on India to start negotiations as soon as possible to resolve the border row over the Kalapani region, saying New Delhi hadn’t responded to several requests from Kathmandu for talks on the issue. Gyawali also described a tripartite agreement signed by India, Nepal and the UK in 1947 for the recruitment of Nepalese Gorkha soldiers as “redundant” and said Kathmandu would prefer to handle this issue bilaterally with the two countries. Participating in a webinar organised by the Nepal Institute of International Relations, the minister responded to a question on the border row with India by saying that the issue was one of the “unresolved questions left by history”. “We are still requesting India to start negotiations at the earliest so that the problems would not go to the streets,” he said. “Formal diplomatic engagement [on the issue] is extremely critical,” he added. Nepal had formally asked several times to start diplomatic negotiations to settle problems over the Kalapani region, and proposed dates for talks but there was “no timely response” from New Delhi, Gyawali said. Though New Delhi cited the Covid-19 pandemic as a factor for the talks not being held at the current juncture, India has had diplomatic engagements with countries such as Australia, China and the US in recent months, he noted. There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Gyawali’s remarks. The border row over Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura became a major irritant in bilateral ties after India opened a new road to Lipulekh to facilitate pilgrims going to Kailash Mansarovar. Nepal responded by publishing a new map that included the disputed territories. Nepal continues to be in touch with India on the issue through informal channels though no dates have been decided for talks, Gyawali said. He also acknowledged that the rest of the relationship with India “is okay” as critical supply chains were unaffected and India-funded development projects were carrying on. “We have been able to differentiate the boundary issue from other broader engagements and I think it is the right way to deal with a close neighbour,” he said. Referring to the tripartite agreement on the recruitment of Nepalese Gorkha soldiers in the armies of India and the UK, he said this was a “legacy of the past” and the pact “has become redundant”. “[The agreement] had created a lot of jobs in the past, but in the changed context, some of its provisions are questionable,” he said, adding Nepal would prefer to handle the matter bilaterally with India and the UK. Responding to a question about Nepal’s position on the India-China border standoff, Gyawali said: “Being a close friend and a close neighbour of both countries, we urge both nations to de-escalate the tensions, to start negotiations, to solve peacefully the problems, engage constructively to solve the problems and to play a bigger role for the betterment of both countries, the region and the globe.” “When the tensions escalate, naturally Nepal becomes very worried because it will create a bigger and wider impact in the region,” he said, adding it is important for India and China to continue their engagements to reduce tensions. Gyawali also said a recent virtual meeting of the foreign ministers of Afghanistan, Nepal and Pakistan hosted by Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi was focused solely on the response to Covid-19 and wasn’t an attempt to create a new sub-regional grouping.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-seeks-talks-with-india-as-soon-as-possible-on-kalapani-border-row/story-wOA6Nn1VT7FFxruX829yPL.html
31-07-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine will be widely available, optimistic Fauci tells lawmakers||Once a coronavirus vaccine is approved as safe and effective, Americans should have widespread access within a reasonable time, Dr. Anthony Fauci assured lawmakers Friday.Appearing before a House panel investigating the nation’s response to the pandemic, Fauci expressed “cautious” optimism that a vaccine would be available, particularly by next year.“I believe, ultimately, over a period of time in 2021, that Americans will be able to get it,” Fauci said, referring to the vaccine.There will be a priority list for who gets early vaccinations. “I don’t think we will have everybody getting it immediately,” Fauci explained.But “ultimately, within a reasonable time, the plans allow for any American who needs the vaccine to get it,” he added.Under direction from the White House, federal health authorities are carrying out a plan dubbed Operation Warp Speed to manufacture 300 million doses of a vaccine on a compressed timeline.Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease official, said a quarter-million people have expressed interest in taking part in studies of experimental vaccines for the coronavirus.He said that 250,000 people have registered on a government website to take part in vaccine trials, which are pivotal for establishing safety and effectiveness. Not all patients who volunteer to take part in clinical trials are eligible to participate.Fauci was joined by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention head Dr. Robert Redfield and Health and Human Services testing czar Adm. Brett Giroir.At a time when early progress seems to have been lost and uncertainty clouds the nation’s path forward, Fauci is calling on lawmakers — and all other Americans — to go back to public health basics such as social distancing and wearing masks.The panel, the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, is divided about how to reopen schools and businesses, mirroring divisions among Americans. Committee Chairman Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., said the White House must come up with a comprehensive national plan to contain the virus. Ranking Republican Steve Scalise of Louisiana said the Trump administration has plans already on vaccines, testing, nursing homes and other coronavirus-related issues.A rebound of cases across the South and the West has dashed hopes for a quick return to normal life. Problems with the availability and timeliness of testing continue to be reported. And the race for a vaccine, though progressing rapidly, has yet to deliver a breakthrough.Fauci’s public message in recent days has been that Americans can’t afford a devil-may-care attitude toward Covid-19 and need to double down on basic measures such as wearing masks in public, keeping their distance from others and avoiding crowds and indoor spaces such as bars. That’s echoed by Redfield and Giroir, though they are far less prominent.Fauci’s dogged persistence has drawn the ire of some of President Donald Trump’s supporters and prompted a new round of calls for his firing. But the veteran of battles against AIDS and Ebola has stuck to his message, while carefully avoiding open confrontations with the Trump White House.In an interview with The Associated Press earlier this week, Fauci said he was “disturbed” by the flat-out opposition in parts of the country to wearing masks as a public health protective measure.“There are certain fundamentals,” he said, “the staples of what you need to do ... one is universal wearing of masks.”Public health experts say masks help prevent an infected person who has yet to develop symptoms from passing the virus to others. For mask wearers, there’s also some evidence that they can offer a degree of protection from an infected person nearby.Fauci said in his AP interview that he’s concerned because the U.S. has not followed the track of Asian and European nations also hit hard by the coronavirus.Other countries that shut down their economies knocked back uncontrolled spread and settled into a pattern of relatively few new cases, although they continued to experience local outbreaks.The U.S. also knocked back the initial spread, but it never got the background level of new cases quite as low. And the resurgence of Covid-19 in the Sunbelt in recent weeks has driven the number of new daily cases back up into the 60,000-70,000 range. It coincided with economic reopening and a return to social gatherings, particularly among younger adults. Growing numbers of emergency room visits, hospitalizations and deaths have followed as grim consequences.Nearly 4.5 million Americans have been been infected since the start of the pandemic, and more than 150,000 have died, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.Fauci said there’s evidence the surge across the South may be peaking, but upticks in the Midwest are now a concern.“They’ve really got to jump all over that because if they don’t then you might see the surge we saw in some of the Southern states,” he told the AP.Though Fauci gets push-back from White House officials, other medical experts in the administration are on the same page when it comes to the public health message.Giroir, the testing czar, told reporters Thursday: “I think it’s very important to make sure that we all spread the public health message that we can control all the outbreaks occurring right now.”He said controlling the outbreaks will require people to wear masks, avoid crowded indoor spaces and wash their hands frequently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-will-be-widely-available-optimistic-fauci-tells-lawmakers/story-eQm1LQr3pO6J9RjVU99RRJ.html
31-07-2020||World||US imposes human rights sanctions on Chinese company, individuals||The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on a Chinese company and two officials related to the company for what it said were human rights abuses against Uighurs and other ethnic minority people in China’s Xinjiang province, the Treasury Department said.The move was yet another step in the deteriorating relations between the United States and China and came a week after US President Donald Trump closed the Chinese consulate in Houston, prompting Beijing to shutter the US consulate in Chengdu.Friday’s move blacklisted the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, also known as XPCC, along with Sun Jinlong, former party secretary of the XPCC, and Peng Jiarui, deputy party secretary and commander of the XPCC, “for their connection to serious human rights abuse against ethnic minorities in Xinjiang,” the Treasury said in a statement.The Treasury identified the company as a paramilitary organization in the Xinjiang region that is subordinate to the Chinese Communist Party and “enhances internal control over the region by advancing China’s vision of economic development.”Washington’s action freezes any US assets of the company and officials and generally prohibits Americans from dealing with them. The Treasury also issued a license on Friday, authorizing certain wind down and divestment transactions and activities related to blocked subsidiaries of the XPCC until Sept. 30.The new move comes three weeks after Washington imposed sanctions on the autonomous region of Xinjiang’s Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, a member of China’s powerful Politburo, and three other officials. Chen was described as the highest ranking Chinese official that the United States has sanctioned.The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps is a quasi-military group created in 1954 and initially made up of demobilized soldiers, who spent part of their time in military training and the rest turning the region’s arid land into farms.Civilian members from eastern China later joined the corps, and it now numbers 3.11 million people, or more than 12% of the region’s population. It is almost entirely made up of Han Chinese in a region that is home to the Muslim Uighur people.Experts have said the group is like a “state within a state” and has established new cities in the region with schools and universities and jurisdiction over police and courts.China denies that Uighurs are unfairly marginalized, and says it is addressing underdevelopment and lack of jobs in heavily Uighur areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-imposes-human-rights-sanctions-on-chinese-company-individuals/story-icf5IGMvMhGBaNJJ7j72LM.html

Iran later responded by slowly abandoning nearly every aspect of the agreement, though it still allows U.N. inspectors access to its nuclear sites.Trump has maintained that the deal needs to be renegotiated because it didn’t address Iran’s ballistic missile program or its involvement in regional conflicts. The other signatories to the nuclear deal — Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia — have been struggling to keep it alive.Khamenei said the U.S. wants Iran to give up its nuclear program, defense facilities and regional authority at the negotiating table.He said economic sanctions imposed on Iran by the U.S. are a crime against Iran. “The sanctions are apparently against Iran’s ruling system, but (in fact) they are against the Iranian people inside.” He said Iranians suffering under the sanctions affecting the economy inevitably would stand up against the ruling system.A sharp rise in subsidized gasoline prices led to four days of unrest in cities and towns across Iran in November, in which Amnesty International said more than 300 people were killed in clashes with police and security forces.Tehran has yet to release any official statistics about the scale of the unrest, though in June the government acknowledged that security forces shot and killed protesters. A lawmaker said 230 people were killed in the anti-government protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-would-benefit-from-talks-iran-s-supreme-leader-says-won-t-negotiate-with-us/story-eDXoIIORw86GsR94YokngI.html

Nathan wrote in her ruling in the case facing Ghislaine Maxwell.“Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different matter than simply making a public statement ‘relating to’ Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in this case.”She said the women “still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be safeguarded.”Prosecutors had asked Nathan to block Maxwell’s lawyers from publicly identifying the women unless they identified themselves as participants in the criminal case. Otherwise, prosecutors said, the women may be harassed or intimidated and become reluctant to cooperate with the government.Nathan’s order came hours after newly unsealed court documents provided a fresh glimpse into a fierce civil court fight between Maxwell, who was Epstein’s former girlfriend, and one of the women who accused the couple of sexual abuse.The documents released late Thursday were from a now-settled defamation lawsuit filed by one of Epstein’s alleged victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre.Giuffre claimed in the suit and other litigation that Maxwell recruited her in 2000 to be a sexual servant to Epstein. She said the couple subsequently pressured her into having sex with numerous rich or notable men, including Britain’s Prince Andrew, U.S. politicians, wealthy entrepreneurs, a famous scientist and fashion designer.Maxwell, and all of the accused men, have denied those allegations for years.Among the newly released documents were emails Maxwell and Epstein exchanged in January 2015, when Giuffre’s allegations were getting a new round of media attention.One email, sent from Epstein’s email address but written in Maxwell’s voice, appeared to be a draft statement or set of talking points for Maxwell to use in defending herself. It said she had been the target of “false allegations of impropriety and offensive behavior that I abhor and have never ever been party to.”Responding to a Maxwell email a few days later, Epstein wrote: “You have done nothing wrong and I (would) urge you to start acting like it.” He suggested she go outside and hold her head high, “not as an (escaping) convict.”Epstein killed himself last summer while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell was recently arrested on federal charges that she recruited at least three girls, including one as young as 14, for Epstein to sexually abuse in the 1990s. Prosecutors said she also joined in the abuse.Maxwell is jailed awaiting trial in New York.Many of the documents unsealed by the court Thursday had been available publicly before.They included a deposition in which Giuffre described the alleged abuse, and also answered questions about errors she’d made previously in telling her story, including originally telling a court she was 15 when she met Epstein, when records showed she was at least a year older.Giuffre over the years has told her story to the FBI, but no charges were brought based on her allegations and she is not one of the three alleged victims in the current criminal case against Maxwell.Two documents that were not released as scheduled Thursday were depositions Maxwell gave in the civil lawsuit in 2016.U.S. District Judge Loretta A. Preska had ordered them released, but Maxwell’s lawyers appealed her ruling to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.Her lawyers said they should be blocked because she now faces criminal charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-bans-lawyers-from-identifying-epstein-abuse-victims/story-LoyvQUV2Vc3QsTS944Uc1O.html

Many of them face job losses with the aviation industry suffering a major hit.Sharma, who is MP for Ealing Southall, said: “Thousands face being made redundant because of falls in revenue for many businesses and certain industries almost completely drying up. Aviation is one of the hardest hit, almost no long haul routes are open and passenger numbers are down to tiny fractions compared to the start of the year.”The MPs wrote to Sunak that airports in England and Wales are expected to pay business rates as though they are functioning normally. Airports in Scotland and Northern Ireland have received support from their local governments, but those in England and Wales have not had such relief.The MPs wrote to the chancellor: “Under the current system while a business such as Tesco which has seen growth during Covid-19 has received £585 million in business rate relief, our airports have seen not a penny”.“We call on you to provide support to all English and Welsh airports in line with that afforded by Scotland and Northern Ireland. This will allow airports to continue to employ people, pay other taxes and support the Covid recovery we all so badly need”.Passenger numbers have fallen by 99% in some cases and more than 100,000 in the industry are facing the risk of unemployment. The aviation industry lost nearly £2 billion in the four-month period between March and June, which is equivalent to around £15 million each day, Sharma noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-labour-mp-virendra-sharma-leads-campaign-to-save-heathrow-jobs/story-ckoEyo6pWcS2B8TK70WyBL.html
31-07-2020||World||China’s aggression in Ladakh, claims in Bhutan indicative of its intentions: Mike Pompeo||China’s recent aggression in India’s eastern Ladakh and claims for the real estate in Bhutan are indicative of its intentions, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said, asserting that Beijing under President Xi Jinping is testing the world to see if anyone is going to stand up to its threats and bullying. Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a bitter standoff in several areas along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh since May 5. The situation deteriorated last month following the Galwan Valley clashes in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed. China recently staked claim over the Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary in Bhutan at the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Council and opposed funding to the project. Pompeo, during a Congressional hearing on Thursday, told the members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee that “the actions are entirely consistent with what they have been signalling to the world for decades you might even argue since 1989, but certainly since General Secretary Xi came to power”. The Secretary of State said China has the desire to expand its power and reach. “They talk about bringing socialism with Chinese characteristics to the world. Claims that they have now made for real estate in Bhutan, the incursion that took place in India, these are indicative of Chinese intentions, and they are testing, they are probing the world to see if we are going to stand up to their threats and their bullying,” Pompeo said. “I am more confident than I was even a year ago that the world is prepared to do that. There’s a lot more work to do, and we need to be serious about it,” said the top American diplomat. In his testimony, Pompeo told lawmakers that India has banned 106 Chinese applications that threatened its citizens’ privacy and security. “Our diplomatic efforts are working and momentum is building to mitigate the threats that the Chinese Communist Party presents. All 10 ASEAN nations have insisted that the South China Sea disputes be settled on the basis of international law, including UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea). Japan led the G-7’s condemnation of China’s national security law targeting Hong Kong,” he said. The European Union condemned the law too and also declared China a systemic rival to us, he said. At the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Secretary General Stoltenberg has called to make China a greater part of that alliance’s focus. “We led a multilateral effort to ensure that the United Nations World Intellectual Property Organisation elected a director from a country that cared about intellectual property. “Our QUAD (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue) -- the US, Australia, India, and Japan -- has been reinvigorated. We’ve worked hard at this. Our diplomats have done wonderful work. I’m very proud of the progress we are making. In addition to these multilateral efforts, Department of Justice is cracking down on Chinese intellectual property threats,” he said. The US has sanctioned Chinese leaders for their treatment of Uyghur minorities in Xinjiang province, imposed export controls on companies that supported, and warned US businesses against using slave labour in their supply chains, he said. The US has terminated special treatment agreements with Hong Kong in response to the Communist Party of China’s actions to deny freedom to the people of Hong Kong, he said. “We closed our consulate in Houston because it was a den of spies,” Pompeo added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-aggression-in-ladakh-claims-in-bhutan-indicative-of-its-intentions-mike-pompeo/story-kKJ4WnqtTi6jOW7E61vmQK.html

Official daily data on Thursday showed 846 new positive tests in Britain - the highest number of daily infections since June 28. The ONS said that between July 20-26 there were an estimated 4,200 new cases per day in the community, or 0.78 new Covid-19 infections per 10,000 people, up from an estimated 2,800 new cases a day the previous week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-infections-on-the-rise-in-england-survey-shows/story-jEan0amwNK28MHxOO7ljMK.html

For example, in April there were more than 3,000 coronavirus patients in mechanical ventilation beds, but the latest figure is 87.As part of the easing, the government was to allow some cricket matches, casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks, indoor performances and pilots of large crowds in sports venues and conference centres under Covid-secure conditions from Saturday.But Johnson announced in a briefing from Downing Street that these will not happen for at least another fortnight. Wedding receptions of up to 30 people will also not be permitted, but ceremonies can continue to take place.Health officials announced a return of restrictions on people mixing with other households in north England, including the Greater Manchester area, Pendle, Hyndburn, Burnley, Rossendale, Blackburn with Darwen, Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees and Leicester city,Muslim organisations criticised lack of adequate notice while re-imposing the restrictions before Eid celebrations.Johnson said: “At every point I have said our plan to reopen society and the economy is conditional – that it relies on continued progress against the virus, and that we would not hesitate to put on the brakes if required”.“With those numbers creeping up, our assessment is that we should now squeeze that brake pedal in order to keep the virus under control. On Saturday 1 August, you’ll remember, we had hoped to reopen in England a number of higher risk settings that had remained closed”.“Today, I am afraid we are postponing these changes for at least a fortnight. That means that, until 15 August at the earliest”.The new figures from the Office for National Statistics showed an increase in the number of people in England testing positive on a nose-and-throat swab in recent weeks. The figures show that about 1 in 1,500 people in homes in England are infected (roughly 36,000 people in total) with 4,200 new infections each day; the figures are up on last week, when it was estimated there were 2,800 new infections each day and that one in 2,000 people (28,000 total) were infected in homes in England.Health secretary Matt Hancock said: “We’re constantly looking at the latest data on the spread of coronavirus, and unfortunately we’ve seen an increasing rate of transmission in parts of Northern England”.“The spread is largely due to households meeting and not abiding to social distancing. So from midnight tonight, people from different households will not be allowed to meet each other indoors in these areas”.“We take this action with a heavy heart, but we can see increasing rates of coronavirus across Europe and are determined to do whatever is necessary to keep people safe”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rising-covid-19-infections-in-uk-prompt-halt-to-lockdown-easing/story-qYbjJgogpSO8oGZxxVbVzM.html

Deaths in July rose at least 19% to over 152,000 total.The biggest increases were in Florida, with over 300,000 new cases in July, followed by California and Texas with about 250,000 each. Those three states also saw cases double in June. Cases also more than doubled in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia, according to the tally.Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York had the lowest increases, with cases rising 7% or less.The United States shattered single day global records in July by reporting over 77,000 new cases on July 16. During the month, 33 out of 50 states had one-day record increases in cases and 19 set records for how much deaths rose in 24 hours, according to a Reuters tally.After a rapid acceleration in cases, the outbreak appears to be stabilizing in Arizona, Florida and Texas. Health officials are now concerned the outbreak has migrated to the Midwest from summer travel. The news that more states could be hard hit by the virus comes a day after the US gross domestic product collapsed at a 32.9% annualized rate last quarter, the nation’s worst economic performance since the Great Depression.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-records-nearly-25-000-covid-19-deaths-in-july-cases-rise-by-1-8-mn/story-0mhv8UfmDDhUlintzBnJhK.html
31-07-2020||World||UK imposes new restrictions for 4 million amid coronavirus spread||Britain’s health secretary defended the government’s abrupt re-imposition of restrictions on social life across a swath of northern England on Friday, saying it was important to clamp down quickly on new outbreaks of Covid-19.Matt Hancock said that while it’s not the “sort of decision that anybody would want to take,’’ the government had no choice.“It is important to move quickly because the virus spreads and you’ve got to make sure you do everything you can do keep ahead of it,” he told Sky News.Under the new restrictions, people from different households in Greater Manchester, England’s second largest metropolitan area, have been asked to not meet indoors. The order also applies to the surrounding areas of Lancashire and West Yorkshire counties, affecting more than 4 million people in all.Hancock said data showed the coronavirus was being spread primarily between households.He told the BBC that “one of the terrible things about this virus is it thrives on the sort of social contact that makes life worth living.”Opposition politicians supported the latest move but criticized the government for announcing the restrictions in a tweet from Hancock late Thursday, just two hours before they came into force at midnight.Labour Party business spokeswoman Lucy Powell said the “bolt out of the blue” approach was “not the way to build confidence and to take people with you and maximize compliance with these steps.”The affected region has a large Muslim population, and the restrictions coincide with the Eid al-Adha holiday, where many people would normally gather in each other’s homes.Hancock said “my heart goes out to the Muslim communities in these areas because I know how important the Eid celebrations are.”“I’m very grateful to the local Muslim leaders, the imams in fact, across the country who’ve been working so hard to find a way to have Covid-secure celebrations,” he said. “For instance, celebrating Eid in parks where there’s more space available and, of course, outdoors is safer than indoors.”The measures are the second batch of regional restrictions imposed to try to curb a second wave of the virus in Britain, following a stricter local lockdown in the central England city of Leicester. The government said restaurants, pubs, shops and hairdressers in Leicester could reopen from Monday, more than a month after they were closed amid a surge in cases.Britain’s official coronavirus death toll stands at just over 46,000, the third-highest total in the world after the United States and Brazil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-imposes-new-restrictions-for-4-million-amid-coronavirus-spread/story-k3qW1finNu08icPTbPPJQO.html
31-07-2020||World||WHO’s emergency panel reviews coronavirus pandemic||Six months after sounding its top alarm over the new coronavirus outbreak, the WHO’s emergency committee meets for a fourth time Friday to assess the raging pandemic.The World Health Organization grouping, comprising around 20 members and advisers, can propose new recommendations or amend existing ones.However, there is little doubt that the WHO will maintain the pandemic’s status as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) -- its highest level of alarm.At least 17 million people have caught the virus, more than 660,000 have died, and infections are still rampant.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has stressed that the UN health agency had declared a top-level public health emergency on January 30, when there were fewer than 100 cases and no deaths outside China, where the virus first emerged.The WHO has been sharply criticised for the length of time it took to declare a PHEIC.The United States, which accused the organisation of being too close to China, officially began its withdrawal from the organisation in July.The agency has also been criticised for recommendations deemed late or contradictory, in particular on wearing masks, or the modes of transmission of the virus.The WHO’s COVID-19 technical lead Maria Van Kerkhove said Thursday that the organisation had reacted immediately to the first signs of the pandemic, mobilising its forces to act and inform.Alongside her, the WHO’s emergencies director Michael Ryan said he had been surprised by how slowly some countries reacted.“We did focus in the early days of this crisis on really driving our technical and operational assistance to countries that we would traditionally feel that need that assistance,” he said.“If I could go back and change anything, I think we would have also been better served to be offering that operational and technical assistance to countries where I think we made some assumptions about capacities that existed,” he said.cf/rjm/ach||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-s-emergency-panel-reviews-coronavirus-pandemic/story-2OhkuQ8W6Jxi0oGrmvOX8M.html

The United States has signed a similar deal with Pfizer and BioNtech for 100 million doses for nearly $2 billion, which amounts to a $39 price tag for what is likely to be a two dose treatment course.There is no current vaccine for Covid-19. The disease has claimed 670,000 lives and upended economies, and there are over 150 vaccines in various stages of development against the still fast-spreading virus. BioNTech and Pfizer on Monday began a large, late-stage trial of their vaccine candidate to demonstrate its efficacy.Daiichi Sankyo Co is in discussions to provide supplies of a potential coronavirus vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca Plc and the University of Oxford for use in Japan.Assuming clinical success of the vaccines, Pfizer and BioNtech said they are on track to seek regulatory review for the vaccine as early as October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-get-120-mn-doses-of-covid-19-vaccine-from-pfizer-biontech/story-CdXK0RB0CqpAJKdQfL8yPN.html

31-07-2020||World||Supreme leader says Iran won’t negotiate with US||Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Friday his country will not negotiate with the United States because America would only use talks for propaganda purposes.The Trump administration has said it is willing to talk with Iran “with no preconditions,” but that the U.S. will continue its campaign of pressure against the Islamic Republic.In a televise speech marking the Eid al-Adha holiday, Khamenei said President Donald Trump would benefit from talks, saying Trump wants to “use negotiations with us for propaganda like negotiations with North Korea.” Khamenei was referring to talks between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong un.Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the nuclear accord between Iran and Western powers in May 2018. Iran later responded by slowly abandoning nearly every aspect of the agreement, though it still allows U.N. inspectors access to its nuclear sites.Trump has maintained that the deal needs to be renegotiated because it didn’t address Iran’s ballistic missile program or its involvement in regional conflicts. The other signatories to the nuclear deal — Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia — have been struggling to keep it alive.Khamenei said the U.S. wants Iran to give up its nuclear program, defense facilities and regional authority at the negotiating table.He said economic sanctions imposed on Iran by the U.S. are a crime against Iran. “The sanctions are apparently against Iran’s ruling system, but (in fact) they are against the Iranian people inside.” He said Iranians suffering under the sanctions affecting the economy inevitable would stand up against the ruling system.A sharp rise in subsidized gasoline prices led to four days of unrest in cities and towns across Iran in November, in which Amnesty International said more than 300 people were killed in clashes with police and security forces.Tehran has yet to release any official statistics about the scale of the unrest, though in June the government acknowledged that security forces shot and killed protesters. A lawmaker said 230 people were killed in the anti-government protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/supreme-leader-says-iran-won-t-negotiate-with-us/story-ITdDorrWvRywrl8Nmllw3I.html
31-07-2020||World||400 Taliban prisoners to remain in custody, says Afghan president||Afghan President Ashraf Ghani dashed hopes Friday for a start to negotiations with Taliban insurgents, announcing the final 400 Taliban prisoners whose release is a prerequisite to start talks, will remain jailed. The announcement frustrates U.S. efforts to find an end to Afghanistan’s years of relentless war.Addressing the nation on the Muslim holy day of Eid ul Adha, Ghani said the 400 Taliban are convicted of crimes he has no authority to forgive. Instead, he will call a loya jirga — or traditional grand council of elders — to decide whether they should go free. He said the council would meet “shortly.”Ghani’s announcement was certain to delay the start of negotiations between the warring sides and frustrate Washington’s efforts to bring an early end to hostilities, even as they scale down their presence in Afghanistan.It also comes at the start of a three-day cease-fire announced by the Taliban for the Eid holidays.The prisoner releases were part of a deal the United States signed in February with the Taliban aimed at ending Afghanistan’s endless wars and sending U.S. troops home after nearly 20 years in Afghanistan, ending America’s longest war.That deal, touted at the time as Afghanistan’s best chance at peace in four decades, called for the Afghan government to free 5,000 Taliban held in jails across the country and the Taliban to free 1,000 government and military personnel. The releases were to be a sign of good will and a prerequisite to the start of negotiations between the warring sides.On Thursday, the Taliban concluded the release of the 1,000 they were holding, according to Taliban’s political spokesman Suhail Shaheen. He also said the insurgent group was ready to hold talks with Kabul’s political leadership within a week if the remaining Taliban still in jails in Afghanistan were freed.But Shaheen told The Associated Press the Taliban would not accept substitutes to the 5,000 Taliban on the list agreed upon during the one-and-a-half years of negotiations with Washington.Ghani in his speech said his government would free 500 Taliban who are not on the list saying it was a gesture of good will.In response to Ghani’s announcement, Shaheen called his administration “an obstacle to peace.”Shaheen told The Associated Press the Taliban freed 1,005 government personnel, militia members, military personnel and police. The last of the prisoners was freed Thursday.“We freed all of them as a good will gesture so that they may pass their Eid days with their families and also we announced the cease-fire in order to create a conducive atmosphere for the start of intra-Afghan negotiations,” Shaheen said. “But on the other hand the head of the Kabul administration, instead of removing hurdles in the way of peace and intra-Afghan negotiations, is creating ... hurdles and obstacles.”The U.N. had expressed hopes for a start to negotiations within weeks, suggesting they may have begun in July, and called on both sides not to squander an opportunity at peace.The U.S. Embassy in Kabul on Thursday issued a statement at the end of Khalilzad’s round of meetings with Afghan leaders in the capital repeating a call for an end to fighting and bloodshed and urged both sides to “seize this historic opportunity for peace.A meeting of the loya jirga would require weeks to collect elders from throughout the country and it wasn’t clear how they would be chosen or whether Ghani’s political opponent and the current head of the High Council for National Reconciliation Abdulllah Abdullah supported the move.Abdullah was tasked with overseeing the peace talks with the Taliban as part of a power sharing deal with Ghani earlier this year following disputed presidential election results.There was no immediate comment from Abdullah to Ghani’s refusal to release the remaining Taliban prisoners._____Gannon reported from Islamabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/400-taliban-prisoners-to-remain-in-custody-says-afghan-president/story-6eCPTV1SqiMn4DpxEh6WcM.html

31-07-2020||World||Final days of hajj and Eid festival impacted by coronavirus||Small groups of pilgrims performed one of the final rites of the Islamic hajj on Friday as Muslims worldwide marked the start of the Eid al-Adha holiday amid a global pandemic that has impacted nearly every aspect of this year’s pilgrimage and celebrations.The last days of the annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia coincide with the four-day Eid al-Adha, or “Feast of Sacrifice,” in which Muslims slaughter livestock and distribute the meat to the poor.The pandemic has pushed millions of people around the world closer to the brink of poverty, making it harder for many to fulfill the religious tradition of purchasing livestock.In Somalia, the price of meat has slightly increased. Abdishakur Dahir, a civil servant in Mogadishu, said that for the first time he won’t be able to afford goat for Eid because of the impact of the virus on work.“I could hardly buy food for my family,” Dahir said. “We are just surviving for now. Life is getting tougher by the day.”In some parts of West Africa, the price for a ram has doubled. Livestock sellers, used to doing brisk business in the days before the holiday, say sales have dwindled and those who are buying can’t afford much.“The situation is really complicated by the coronavirus, it’s a tough market,” Oumar Maiga, a livestock trader in Ivory Coast said. “We are in a situation we’ve never seen in other years.”The hajj pilgrimage has also been drastically impacted by the virus. Last year, some 2.5 million pilgrims took part, but this year as few as 1,000 pilgrims already residing in Saudi Arabia were allowed to preform the hajj.The Saudi Health Ministry said there have been no cases of the Covid-19 illness among this year’s pilgrims. The government took numerous precautions, including testing pilgrims for the virus, monitoring their movement with electronic wristbands and requiring them to quarantine before and after the hajj. Pilgrims were selected after applying through an online portal, and all had to be between the ages of 20 and 50 years-old.Just after dawn on Friday, small groups of pilgrims — masked and physically distancing — made their way toward the massive multi-story Jamarat Complex in the Saudi valley area of Mina. There, the pilgrims cast pebbles at three large columns. It is here where Muslims believe the devil tried to talk the Prophet Ibrahim, or Abraham, out of submitting to God’s will.Muslims commemorate the prophet Ibrahim’s test of faith by slaughtering livestock and animals and distributing the meat to the poor.During the last days of hajj, male pilgrims shave their heads and remove the terrycloth white garments worn during the pilgrimage. Women cut off a small lock of hair in a sign of spiritual rebirth and renewal.The hajj, both physically and spiritually demanding, intends to bring about greater humility and unity among Muslims. It is required of all Muslims to perform once in a lifetime.Sheikh Abdullah al-Manea, member of the Supreme Council of Senior Scholars of Saudi Arabia, used the hajj sermon Friday to praise the kingdom’s leadership for their “wise decision” to limit the number of pilgrims and protect human life.“We thank the positive role of Muslims around the world that have complied with the regulations of the country to protect them from the spread of this virus, which leads to the protection of Mecca and Medina,” the sheikh said.Around the world, Muslims gathered with relatives or remained at home to mark the start of Eid.In the Iraqi capital Baghdad, streets were largely empty due to a 10-day lockdown imposed by authorities to prevent further spread of the virus. Eid prayers in mosques were canceled.“We had hoped that the curfew would be lifted during the Eid period ... we were surprised that the lockdown period included the Eid holiday and more,” said Marwan Madhat, a Baghdad cafe owner. “This will cause losses.”Kosovo and the United Arab Emirates have also closed mosques to limit the spread of the virus.In Lebanon, Muslim worshipers prayed in mosques under tight security, despite a partial lockdown imposed Thursday that will continue through Aug. 10. Worshipers at the Mohammad al-Amin Mosque in the capital, Beirut, spilled onto the street outside to maintain social distancing rules.In Indonesia, home to the world’s largest population of Muslims, people were allowed to attend Eid prayers in mosques under strict health guidelines, including that they bring their own prayer mats and pray several feet apart from one another. Worshipers must wear masks and are not allowed to shake hands or hug.Authorities in Indonesia also ordered that meat be delivered door-to-door to the poor to avoid long lines.“This outbreak has not only changed our tradition entirely, but has also made more and more people fall into poverty,” said Agus Supriatna, an Indonesian factory worker who was laid off this year because of the pandemic.Muslim leaders in Albania and Kosovo called on people “to be careful” in their festivities to avoid transmission of the virus, including limiting family visits.A few days ahead of Eid, Alioune Ndong in Senegal said he did not know how he’d come up with the money for his family’s feast He called on Senegal’s government to help struggling families like his.“Covid-19 has drained my money,” said Ndong, a tailor based in the town of Mbour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/final-days-of-hajj-and-eid-festival-impacted-by-coronavirus/story-mwOWZaLf09XbI92NfUGSbJ.html
31-07-2020||World||France, Italy, Spain see startling coronavirus hits to economies||France, Italy and Spain reported precipitous contractions Friday for their coronavirus-battered economies, with the pandemic wiping out years of growth in a matter of weeks as the lockdowns closed shops, factories, and restaurants.The Spanish economy shrank by 18.5% in the April-June period from the previous quarter, the French economy nearly 14% and Italy 12.4%.The Spanish contraction was by far the sharpest slump since the country’s national statistics agency began collecting data. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez was meeting later Friday with the leaders of Spain’s regions to discuss how to rebuild the economy and where to deploy billions of euros in European Union aid for recovery.Spain in mid-March went into a more than three-month lockdown, bringing much economic activity to a halt, as Covid-19 cases and deaths surged. The lockdown ended June 21.In France, the startling plunge of 13.8% in April-June from the previous three-month period also starkly illustrated the punishing economic cost of its two-month lockdown. It was the third consecutive quarter of economic contraction in France’s worsening recession. The pain has been so damaging to jobs and industries that the government is talking down the possibility of another nationwide lockdown as infections tick upward again.France’s economy was already shrinking in the last quarter of 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic hit with full force. For France and other major economies, it caused a head-spinning decline.“All the growth in GDP seen in the 2010-2019 decade has been wiped out in five months,” said Marc Ostwald, chief economist at ADM Investor Services International. In Italy’s case, economists said it wiped out about 30 years of growth.As lockdowns have eased and many businesses reopened, there are hopes the recession will be short-lived, though an uptick in contagions in many countries remains a risk.France is faring worse than Germany, Europe’s largest economy, which on Thursday reported a 10.1% plunge in GDP during the April-June period as its exports and business investment collapsed. Germany’s drop was also the biggest since quarterly growth figures began being compiled in 1970, the official statistics agency said.In March, the health crisis prompted the French government to introduce what was one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns, halting much activity in the second-largest economy of the countries that use the euro currency. In France, Covid-19 has now killed more than 30,000 people and infected more than 186,000.In releasing its morose figures Friday, Insee said the economic low point was in April, when only workers deemed essential were able to leave their homes. Activity started to pick up again from May as authorities began to ease lockdown restrictions, Insee added.Friday’s figures showed that the construction industry was among the hardest-hit in France, as worksites stood idle, with laborers forced to stay home.Locked-down families, many surviving on government handouts and job-preservation schemes, tightened their purse strings amid fears for jobs but also because shops were closed. Household spending plunged 11% in April-June, following a drop of 5.8% in the first quarter.Trade was also battered, as global lockdowns grounded flights, closed borders and factories, and threw transport into disarray. French imports, already down by 5.5% in the first quarter, shrank further in the second quarter, down 17.3%.The damage to exports was even more pronounced, down by a whopping 25.5% in the second quarter after retreating by 6.1% in the first quarter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-italy-spain-see-startling-virus-hits-to-economies/story-K4lYLSOTELcbhnJo8zNRMI.html

It was the largest drop on record.Spain, which suffered a severe virus outbreak that devastated its tourism industry, was the hardest hit with a 18.5% drop. Italy and Portugal were also hard hit but no country escaped. It was the biggest decline since the records started in 1995.The decline in Europe compares to a 9.5% quarter on quarter decline for the United States.European governments are countering the downturn with massive stimulus measures at the national and European Union level. EU leaders have agreed on a 750 billion-euro recovery fund backed by common borrowing to support the recovery from 2021.National governments have stepped in with loans to keep businesses afloat and wage support programs that pay workers salaries while they are furloughed. The European Central Bank is pumping 1.35 trillion euros in newly printed money into the economy through bond purchases, a step which helps keep borrowing costs low.The Spanish contraction was by far the sharpest slump since the country’s national statistics agency began collecting data. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez was meeting later Friday with the leaders of Spain’s regions to discuss how to rebuild the economy and where to deploy billions of euros in European Union aid for recovery.In France, the startling plunge of 13.8% in April-June from the previous three-month period also starkly illustrated the punishing economic cost of its two-month lockdown.

China’s envoy to India Sun Weidong said the remarks are “disregarding facts”.“Noted remarks by Australian HC to India on #SouthChinaSea disregarding facts. #China’s territorial sovereignty & maritime rights & interests are in conformity w/ int’l law incl UNCLOS. It’s clear who safeguard peace & stability & who destablize & provoke escalation in the region,” Sun said on Twitter. Noted remarks by Australian HC to India on #SouthChinaSea disregarding facts. #China's territorial sovereignty & maritime rights&interests are in conformity w/ int'l law incl UNCLOS. It's clear who safeguard peace&stability & who destablize&provoke escalation in the region.Australian High Commissioner to India Barry O’Farrell had said on Thursday that his country is deeply concerned by destabilising actions in the South China Sea.“We remain deeply concerned by actions in the South China Sea that are destabilising and could provoke escalation. Last week, Australia launched a note with UN Secretary-General refusing China’s unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea,” he had told news agency ANI.The Australian government has rejected any claims by China that are not consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).In a veiled criticism of China, the envoy said Australia opposes any attempts to unilaterally alter status-quo as it only increases tension and instability.The US and Australian leaders had held a meeting in Washington on Tuesday where they expressed serious concerns about China’s “recent coercive and destabilising actions across the Indo-Pacific”.The meeting was held between US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and defence secretary Mark Esper and their Australian counterparts Marise Payne and Linda Reynolds. They discussed about strengthening partnerships in the Indian Ocean region and discussed the key role India will play in defence cooperation.On Thursday, Pompeo said that US efforts to lead an “international awakening” against the Chinese government is working and the “tide is turning” as a result. He went on to cite Indian ban on Chinese apps as a manifestation of it along with the closer interactions of the Quad, and separate actions by other countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clear-who-safeguards-peace-and-who-destabilises-region-china-slams-australian-hc-s-remarks-on-south-china-sea/story-VJUzZAp4edPJxpM4wQ5SWM.html
31-07-2020||World||Vietnam reports first Covid-19 death after months of successful countermeasures||Vietnam recorded its first death from Covid-19 on Friday after winning plaudits worldwide for one of the most successful pandemic responses to containing the novel coronavirus outbreak.The country of 96 million had gone 100 days without infection before an unexpected cluster of new cases surfaced in the central and popular resort city of Danang a week ago. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Vietnam’s health ministry on Friday reported 45 new infections in the city, marking the Southeast Asian country’s biggest single-day jump in cases since the beginning of the pandemic.The capital, Hanoi, has started mass coronavirus testing, shut bars and nightclubs, banned large gatherings, and urged tens of thousands of domestic travellers to report to authorities as the country scrambled to contain the fresh spread of the virus.Patient 428, a 70-year-old man who appears to have contracted the disease in Danang, died on Friday, the official Vietnam News Agency (VNA) said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The 45 latest patients, aged between 27 and 87, are linked to three hospitals and two clinics in Danang, according to the health ministry, which overnight sent a special task force of health experts, along with more than 1,000 health workers, to the city to help handle the deteriorating situation there.The task force includes 65 health experts who had previously helped fight coronavirus at other epicentres in Vietnam, the ministry said. Authorities in Danang are building a 1,000-bed field hospital to ease the burden on the city’s hospitals, four of which are under lockdown following a series of cases there. The newly confirmed infections in Danang have lifted the total number of cases in Vietnam to 509.Some experts say Vietnam could be paying for complacency after its initial success stopping the virus, with normal service quickly resuming, facemasks used less and domestic travel activity surging. Danang had been inundated with visitors taking advantage of promotions to revitalise a tourism sector hurt by border closures and international flight bans designed to stamp out the virus.The current wave is traced to Danang, but the source is unclear.

31-07-2020||World||China says its Beidou system now fully operational, to challenge US’s GPS||China on Friday said its fully operational home-made Beidou navigation satellite system is ready to provide global services, joining an elite group providing space-based systems comprising the US’s GPS, Russia’s GLONASS and the European Union’s Galileo.Experts told Chinese state media that the “…completion of BeiDou-3 was due to the fact that core technologies cannot be bought or begged from other countries”.More than 100 countries including Pakistan and countries part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) are already using the system. Also Read: In China’s troop movements in Ladakh’s depth areas, a hint about its real planOver 300,000 scientists, engineers and technicians from more than 400 domestic institutes, universities and enterprises have been involved in Beidou’s development since the 1990s, official media reported Friday after President Xi Jinping commissioned the system at a ceremony held at the Great Hall of the People.The Communist Party of China (CPC)-ruled government approved the research and development of a space-based navigation and positioning system, aiming to mitigate the country’s heavy reliance on foreign networks – the US GPS system – in February 1994.The system was named “Beidou” after the Chinese term for the Big Dipper constellation.“By the end of 2019 in the Chinese mainland, more than 6.5 million road vehicles, 40,000 postal and express delivery vehicles, 80,000 buses in 36 major cities, 3,200 inland navigation facilities, and 2,900 marine navigation facilities had adopted the BDS, forming the world’s largest dynamic monitoring system for road vehicles,” the tabloid Global Times said in a report on Friday.Also Read: Security agencies red-flag Chinese fronts in education, not just power and telecomIn late June, the final satellite to complete Beidou’s third-generation network was lifted by a Long March 3B carrier rocket at the Xichang satellite launch centre in the southwestern province of Sichuan province to be placed into a geostationary orbit about 36000 km above the Earth.According to state media, it was the 30th satellite to be launched as part of the third-generation series – 59 have been launched in all since the 2000s.“The civil signal from Beidou is no better than GPS or Galileo,” said Alexandra Stickings, a research analyst at the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies, a Britain-based think-tank told Reuters news agency in June.India is developing its own navigation satellite system called the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System.“IRNSS is an independent regional navigation satellite system being developed by India. It is designed to provide accurate position information service to users in India as well as the region extending up to 1500 km from its boundary, which is its primary service area,” the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) says on its website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-its-beidou-system-now-fully-operational-to-challenge-us-s-gps/story-IfrxT8gHy0QUgBFHNX5F3H.html

31-07-2020||World||China-backed hackers targeted Covid-19 vaccine firm Moderna: US official||Chinese government-linked hackers targeted biotech company Moderna Inc, a leading US-based coronavirus vaccine research developer, earlier this year in a bid to steal valuable data, according to a US security official tracking Chinese hacking activity.Last week, the US Justice Department made public an indictment of two Chinese nationals accused of spying on the United States, including three unnamed US-based targets involved in medical research to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. The indictment states the Chinese hackers “conducted reconnaissance” against the computer network of a Massachusetts biotech firm known to be working on a coronavirus vaccine in January. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Moderna, which is based in Massachusetts and announced its Covid-19 vaccine candidate in January, confirmed to Reuters that the company had been in contact with the FBI and was made aware of the suspected “information reconnaissance activities” by the hacking group mentioned in last week’s indictment. Reconnaissance activities can include a wide range of actions, including probing public websites for vulnerabilities to scouting out important accounts after entering a network, cybersecurity experts say. “Moderna remains highly vigilant to potential cybersecurity threats, maintaining an internal team, external support services and good working relationships with outside authorities to continuously assess threats and protect our valuable information,” spokesman Ray Jordan said, declining to provide further detail. The US security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not provide further details. The FBI and the US Department of Health and Human Services declined to disclose the identities of companies targeted by Chinese hackers. Moderna’s vaccine candidate is one of the earliest and biggest bets by the Trump administration to fight the pandemic. The federal government is supporting development of the company’s vaccine with nearly half a billion dollars and helping Moderna launch a clinical trial of up to 30,000 people beginning this month. China is also racing to develop a vaccine, bringing together its state, military and private sectors to combat a disease that has killed over 660,000 people worldwide. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage A July 7 indictment released last week alleges that the two Chinese hackers, Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi, conducted a decade-long hacking spree that most recently included the targeting of Covid-19 medical research groups.Prosecutors said Li and Dong acted as contractors for China’s Ministry of State Security, a state intelligence agency. Messages left with several accounts registered under Li’s digital alias, oro0lxy, were not returned. Contact details for Dong were not available.The Chinese Embassy in Washington referred Reuters to recent Chinese Foreign Ministry comments that said: “China has long been a major victim of cyber thefts and attacks” and its officials “firmly oppose and fight” such activities. The Chinese government has consistently denied any role in hacking incidents across the globe. The embassy spokesperson did not address specific questions sent via email. The two other unnamed medical research companies mentioned in the Justice Department indictment are described as biotech companies based in California and Maryland. Prosecutors said the hackers “searched for vulnerabilities” and “conducted reconnaissance” against them. The court filing describes the California firm as working on antiviral drug research and suggested the Maryland company had publicly announced efforts to develop a vaccine in January. Two companies that could match those descriptions: Gilead Sciences Inc and Novavax Inc .Gilead spokesperson Chris Ridley said the firm does not comment on cybersecurity matters. Novavax would not comment on specific cyber security activities but said: “Our cyber security team has been alerted to the alleged foreign threats identified in the news.” A security consultant familiar with multiple hacking investigations involving premier biotech firms over the last year said Chinese hacking groups believed to be broadly associated with China’s Ministry of State security are one of the primary forces targeting Covid-19 research, globally. This matches the description of the indicted hackers, as MSS contractors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-backed-hackers-targeted-covid-19-vaccine-firm-moderna-us-official/story-3M3o542iVAZpthBtdBSCUP.html
31-07-2020||World||Donald Trump may be only world leader to attend UN General Assembly session in person||US President Donald Trump is likely to travel to New York to attend the annual UN General Assembly session in September, the only world leader to address this year’s virtual high-level week in person, the US envoy to the UN said. “We’re hoping that President Trump will actually be speaking in person in the General Assembly. He will be the only world leader to be speaking in person,” US ambassador Kelly Craft said Thursday at a virtual briefing.Craft added that with the UN commemorating its 75th anniversary this year, “that makes it even more special that we really take the virtual and amplify it to be able to celebrate the 75th and obviously we’re going to be focused on human rights issues, on transparency, accountability because anytime during COVID where the American taxpayers have really stepped up on a personal level, it’s now.” For the first time in the UN’s 75-year history, the annual General Assembly session will be held virtually and Heads of state and government will not be physically attending the annual gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic.World leaders will submit pre-recorded video statements for the high-level week, the 193-member organisation had decided last week.US is the host country of the United Nations and there is a possibility that Trump could travel to New York to address the General Debate of the 75th session of the Assembly on September 22. The US is traditionally the second speaker at the debate after Brazil. This would be Trump’s final address to the General Assembly of the first term of his presidency before the US heads into elections in November and Trump could use the UN platform to highlight his foreign policy achievements while also tout his campaign agenda. In taking the decision for a virtual UNGA, the General Assembly had noted “with concern” the situation regarding the coronavirus pandemic and the “limitations recommended on meetings within the United Nations premises as precautionary measures aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19.” The new format will mean that it will be for the first time in the world organisation’s 75-year history that Heads of State and Government and Ministers will not gather here for the high-level week that annually brings thousands of diplomats, government officials, civil society members and media persons from around the world to New York City.Addressing a virtual press conference in June, General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande had said that world leaders cannot come to New York for the annual UN General Assembly session in September because of the Covid-19 pandemic.“World leaders cannot come to New York because they cannot come as single individuals. A president doesn’t travel alone. We don’t expect therefore to have presidents here,” Muhammad-Bande had said.Farhan Haq, Deputy Deputy Spokesman for the Secretary-General, responding to a question on Trump addressing the UNGA session in person, said that the UN Secretariat will be in touch, through the Office of the President of the General Assembly, with the member states on their representation.“When it comes to it, we have made clear what the conditions in the building are, what the need is for a scaled back ceremony….the member states are aware that they have different options, including recorded messages, or in some cases, appearances. We trust and expect that all member states will abide by the need to keep the numbers low, and we’ll see what they do in terms of their preparations.” Haq added that the UN has made clear to all member states the need to keep the delegations’ number low during the high-level week. “There is an absolute upper limit of how many people we can safely accommodate, and all Member States have been made aware of that. How they will adjust is a matter ultimately of discussion between the Member States and the United Nations.” Along with the General Debate and 75th anniversary commemoration, key high-level sessions will also be held virtually at the UN.The Summit on Biodiversity will be held on September 30, high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women on October 1 and the high-level meeting to commemorate and promote the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons on October 2. Member states will submit their pre-recorded video statements for these high-level meetings as well.Each country would be encouraged to observe the time limit of 15 minutes in the General Debate that would include remarks in the Assembly Hall to introduce the pre-recorded video and the video itself.Muhammad-Bande has told Member States that with a view to limit the footprint and the number of people into the UN building, physical access and presence will be limited to one or, if the situation allows, two delegates in the General Assembly hall. Further, he said member states “are encouraged to move all side events to virtual platforms to limit the footprint and number of people in the UN building.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-may-be-only-world-leader-to-attend-un-general-assembly-session-in-person/story-Xea344PDgZuKQVsTfxHciO.html
31-07-2020||World||India praises Canada for disavowing SFJ’s Punjab Referendum||India praised Canada for disavowing the Punjab Referendum 2020 organised by the secessionist group Sikhs for Justice or SFJ. India believes that in clearly disavowing the referendum the Canadian Government has set a precedent that should be emulated by other countries, particularly in the West.“Canada taking a lead is good start,” a senior official told the Hindustan Times, adding that the position was that this stand now “put pressure” on others to follow suit.Also Read: Faces of terror: Why India banned 9 Khalistan-linked terrorists in 5 countriesA spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada, the country’s Foreign Ministry, stated in an email that “Canada respects the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of India, and the Government of Canada will not recognize the referendum.”Following this statement from Ottawa, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had also voiced the hope that other nations would also follow Canada’s example and reject the referendum.In effect, India is hopeful that a similar stance will emerge from other nations in the Five Eyes group, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. SFJ has also been active in other European nations like Germany and Italy.The Canadian position came even as contacts between New Delhi and Ottawa have increased since Trudeau came back to power in October 2019. Since then, he has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the G7 summit and has recently spoken on the phone twice. The two foreign ministers, S Jaishankar and François-Philippe Champagne have been frequently in touch, most recently last week over the Covid-19 pandemic and coordinated efforts to tackle the outbreak. Similarly, Canada’s Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade Mary Ng has been in regular communication with Commerce, Industry and Railways Minister Piyush Goyal. They spoke again on Wednesday on several issues including ongoing negotiations related to the Canada-India Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement and the Canada-India Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement.SFJ has already attacked the Justin Trudeau’s government for the stand and asserted it will go ahead with its plans in Canada and elsewhere.Its general counsel Gurpatwant Pannun in a statement said, “Canadian Sikhs will not let the Trudeau regime trump their right to peacefully express and propagate the political opinion of Khalistan by holding Referendum 2020. Trudeau government should find some other way to please India.”The Canadian statement appears to have rattled pro-Khalistani groups in Canada. A statement from the Shiromani Akali Dal Amritsar Canada attacked Hindustan Times’ reporting on this matter and said that the Indian Government has “admittedly started their phase 2 of its anti-referendum campaign to ensure any foreign Government do not recognize the results of the Sikh Referendum 2020”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/won-t-recognize-punjab-2020-referendum-india-praises-canada-s-bold-move/story-4LRpyrv5o38ygDcwrv9uGJ.html
31-07-2020||World||First-ever EU cyber sanctions hit Russian, Chinese, North Koreans||The European Union has imposed its first-ever sanctions over cyberattacks, slapping them on alleged Russian military agents, Chinese cyber spies and organisations including a North Korean firm.The six people and three groups hit with sanctions include Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency. EU headquarters blamed them in a statement for the 2017 “WannaCry” ransomware and “NotPetya” malware attacks and the “Cloud Hopper” cyberespionage campaign.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Thursday the sanctions “are a travel ban and asset freeze to natural persons and an asset freeze to entities or bodies. It is also prohibited to directly or indirectly make funds available to listed individuals and entities or bodies.” Four Russians identified as GRU members were accused of trying to hack the Wi-Fi network of the Netherlands-based Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or OPCW, which has probed the use of chemical weapons in Syria. The 2018 attack was foiled by Dutch authorities.The GRU was also sanctioned for NotPetya, which targeted companies that do business with Ukraine and caused billions of dollars in damage globally, and cyberattacks on Ukraine’s power grid in 2015 and 2016.The two sanctioned Chinese nationals were accused of involvement in “Operation Cloud Hopper,” which the EU said hit companies on six continents, including Europe, through cloud services providers and “gained unauthorised access to commercially sensitive data, resulting in significant economic loss.” One of the two, Zhang Shilong, was indicted in the United States in December 2018 for his alleged role in the operation, which US authorities said at the time targeted a wide array of industries including aviation, biotechnology and satellite and maritime technology. Also sanctioned by the EU was the Chinese company Huaying Haitai, listed as Zhang’s employer.The North Korean firm sanctioned is Chosun Expo, which the EU said backed cyberattacks including WannaCry, the hacking of Sony Pictures and cyber robberies of Vietnamese and Bangladeshi banks.A leading US cybersecurity expert noted that the attempt to hack the chemical weapons group involved a rare physical visit to its organization’s facilities in The Hague, Netherlands.“The consistent use of physical human intelligence teams to supplement its intrusion efforts makes the GRU a particularly effective adversary,” said John Hultquist, director of threat intelligence at FireEye.“Sanctions may be particularly effective for disrupting this activity as they may hinder the free movement of this unit,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-ever-eu-cyber-sanctions-hit-russian-chinese-north-koreans/story-uZCG87yfs8dZHNBifZQrJK.html

By misleading workers and exploiting human vulnerabilities, the hackers were able to obtain credentials and access 130 accounts.Forty-five of those put out tweets -- including from the accounts of Barack Obama, Elon Musk and Bill Gates touting a Bitcoin scam -- and seven of them had their full set of Twitter data downloaded. Twitter had previously indicated that eight accounts had their data downloaded.Read more: Twitter’s Security Woes Included Broad Access to User AccountsBloomberg News reported this week that the attackers contacted at least one Twitter employee over the phone in an attempt to gain access to user-support tools. The company required employees to take an online security training course last week, which covered a number of phishing techniques including phone calls, people familiar with the matter said.The company continues to operate with “significantly limited access” to its internal tools and systems as a precautionary measure two weeks after the hack, the company said.“Until we can safely resume normal operations, our response times to some support needs and reports will be slower,” the company said in a series of update tweets. “We’re accelerating several of our pre-existing security workstreams and improvements to our tools.”As the US president’s go-to social media platform, Twitter bears additional responsibility for ensuring that its security protocols are robust. While Donald Trump’s account was not among those compromised in the July hack, his Democratic opponent in the upcoming November election, former vice president Joe Biden, was.Twitter’s latest communication acknowledges “how important each person on our team is in protecting our service. We take that responsibility seriously and everyone at Twitter is committed to keeping your information safe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-says-hackers-broke-into-system-by-calling-employees/story-iHcori0G4lmeGQVcfOCpEN.html
31-07-2020||World||UK scientists to immunize hundreds with experimental Covid-19 vaccine||Scientists at Imperial College London say they are immunizing hundreds of people with an experimental coronavirus vaccine in an early trial after seeing no worrying safety problems in a small number vaccinated so far. Dr Robin Shattock, a professor at the college, told The Associated Press that he and colleagues had just finished a very slow and arduous process of testing the vaccine at a low dose in the initial participants and would now expand the trial to about 300 people, including some over age 75.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  “It’s well tolerated. There aren’t any side effects,” he said, adding it was still very early in the study. Shattock, who is leading the vaccine research at Imperial, said he hopes to have enough safety data to start inoculating several thousand people in October.Since Covid-19 infections have dropped dramatically in Britain, making it difficult to determine whether or not the vaccine works, Shattock said he and his colleagues are also looking to test their vaccine elsewhere. “We’re looking very carefully at the pandemic, at the numbers where the hot spots are and talking to collaborators that have the facilities to do these kinds of studies,” he said. The Imperial vaccine uses synthetic strands of genetic code based on the virus. Once injected into a muscle, the body’s own cells are instructed to make copies of a spiky protein on the coronavirus. That should in turn trigger an immune response so the body can fight off any future Covid-19 infection. Earlier this week, the world’s biggest coronavirus vaccine study started in the United States, with the first of 30,000 planned volunteers getting immunized with shots created by the US National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  Several other vaccines made by China and by Britain’s Oxford University, based on different vaccine technologies, began smaller final-stage tests in Brazil and other hard-hit countries earlier this month. The World Health Organization has said multiple vaccine approaches are necessary for Covid-19, noting that the usual success rate for vaccine development is about 10 per cent. Shattock said there were numerous coronavirus vaccines now in clinical trials, and he predicted that at least some of them would prove to be effective. “We have 20 vaccines in clinical trials, (so) we can be pretty confident that at least two of those will work,” he said. “It really depends on how strong the immune response needs to be to provide protection.” Shattock said he was optimistic the Imperial vaccine would work, but must await the scientific data from the trial. “I’m just going to hold my breath and wait to see,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-scientists-to-immunize-hundreds-with-experimental-covid-19-vaccine/story-TM2TTbJZkIh6o9elulzrvJ.html

But in a pandemic a single-shot vaccine has a significant advantage, sidestepping a lot of the logistical issues involved in getting people to come back for their second dose.The company plans to take up the question of one or two doses in its phase 1 trial.Depending on those results, J&J plans to start large-scale, phase 3 testing with a single-shot regimen in the second half of September. Around the same time, the company will start a parallel phase 3 study testing a two-shot regimen of the vaccine, Stoffels said.“The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is exciting because it’s a single dose,” White House Coronavirus Task Force Coordinator Deborah Birx said in an interview with Fox News. Having one dose “show protection in monkeys like the other vaccines have shown with two doses does shorten the time period for development because your readout becomes 30 days quicker,” she said. J&J’s vaccine uses a common cold virus known as adenovirus type 26, or Ad26, to ferry coronavirus proteins into cells in the body, causing the body to mount an immune defense against the virus.In the monkey study, scientists from J&J and Harvard’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center studied seven different potential vaccines in 32 animals and compared the results to 20 control animals who got placebo shots.Six weeks later, all of the animals were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. All 20 animals that received the placebo developed high levels of virus in their lungs and nasal swabs. In the best-performing candidate, which J&J selected for human testing, none of the animals had virus in their lungs and only one showed low levels of virus in nasal swabs. Lab tests showed they all had developed antibodies capable of neutralizing the virus after a single shot.“This study shows that even just a single immunization with the Ad26 vaccine leads to neutralizing antibody responses and robust protection of monkeys against Covid-19,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, a vaccine researcher at Beth Israel Deaconness who led the research in collaboration with J&J.J&J shares were up nearly 2% at $149.93 before the market open on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/j-j-starts-human-study-of-covid-19-vaccine-after-promising-monkey-data/story-jKd3A4kXUt1pweY0us9q1I.html

We have had good data so far. We need to show the efficacy in the clinical programme, but so far, so good,” chief executive Pascal Soriot said on a media call on Thursday.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAstraZeneca, Britain’s most valuable listed company, has already reached deals with countries to make more than 2 billion doses of its experimental Covid-19 vaccine and says it could be approved by the end of this year.The Anglo-Swedish company recently completed agreements with the United States, Britain, the European Union, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a public-private-charitable partnership based in Norway, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, another public-private partnership headquartered in Geneva.The deals cover 700 million doses.Also Read: Herd immunity far away, Covid-19 vaccine only option: Health ministryIt has also reached a licensing agreement with Serum Institute of India to supply low-and-middle-income countries and agreements with R-Pharm in Russia and SK Biopharmaceuticals Co Ltd in the Republic of Korea “to manufacture and export for other global markets.”Serum Institute, the Pune-based largest vaccine manufacturer in the world, has said it would start making the vaccine before the last order was received so that it could be ready in sufficient quantities by the time all permissions were granted.Soriot said the company was on track to make 2 billion doses of the vaccine at a few dollars a dose. It also concluded three more deals for distribution - should the vaccine work. The cost of making the vaccine is expected to be offset by funding from the governments.AstraZeneca also repeated its promise not to profit from the Covid-19 vaccine during the pandemic as it reported it was on track with late-stage trials for the treatment.Also Read: Deliberations being held to identify first group of people to receive Covid-19 vaccine: Officials“We felt, there (is) a time in life when companies need to step up and make a contribution. This is the kind of time in history when humanity, humankind is really threatened as a whole,’’ Soriot said, adding that a vaccine needed to be accessible to as many people as possible.Such promises were boosted by strong sales across its range of treatments during the lockdown.Sales jumped by 14% to $12.6 billion in the first six months of 2020 and were helped by strong trading in new medicines, as well as cancer and respiratory medication.Soriot said he remained cautious amid the uncertainty of the pandemic despite the good earnings. “If we have learned one thing with this virus, it is that it is unpredictable. And so we need to remain cautious,” he said. AstraZeneca also announced second quarter results that beat its sales and profit estimates, thanks to strong sales from a diverse product line-up.Also Read: Oxford vaccine shows protection against Covid-19 in monkeys: StudyAmong drugs with better-than-expected revenues, sales of respiratory drug Symbicort rose 12% to $653 million, about $90 million above consensus, while revenue from cancer drug Lynparza jumped 62% to $554 million.Newer drugs for diabetes, heart conditions and cancer, including its top-selling lung cancer drug Tagrisso, performed well in the quarter and AstraZeneca remains on track for a third consecutive year of growth.The company stuck by its 2020 outlook on Thursday and its shares were up about 3% at 88.6 pounds after product sales of $6.05 billion in the three months to June surpassed consensus of $6.01 billion. The figure excludes payments from tie-ups.Core earnings of 96 cents per share beat analysts’ expectation of 93 cents.

In fact, he stressed that he had asked the public service, the Canadian bureaucrats dealing with the matter, to exercise due diligence because of the connections he personally had with the organisation WE Charity.Speaking in French, Trudeau told the Committee that he had “apologized because of the perception” of ties to his “family”. He said he “should have recused” himself from the Cabinet meeting where the decision was taken to give the contract to WE Charity. Trudeau appeared for about an hour-and-a-half for questioning by members of the Finance Committee and was followed by his Chief of Staff Katie Telford.The contract given to WE Charity was cancelled after furor erupted citing links between Trudeau, his family and WE Charity. His wife, mother and brother had been paid fees by the organisation several times.Trudeau denied knowledge of these activities. He said, “My mother and my brother are professionals in their own right who have engagements and have for many, many years, with many different organizations across the country, and I don’t have the details of their work experiences or expenses.”Trudeau also said he believed that the Canada Service Corps would be able to deliver the youth volunteership programme but was informed by the public service that it would not be able to scale up to deliver at that time.“In fact, they said if we wanted this program to happen, it could only be with WE Charity. The choice was not between providers. It was between going ahead with WE Charity to deliver the program or not going ahead with the program at all,” he added. The controversy has roiled Canadian politics in recent weeks and severely dented Trudeau’s popularity. He is also being investigated by the country’s Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-in-a-position-of-conflict-of-interest-trudeau-on-we-charity-controversy/story-OGTYP7hEZCkuQ1B7DxN5VN.html

But I also don’t want to have wait for three months and then find out that the ballots were all missing and election doesn’t mean anything,” said the US President at a press conference.“Do I want to see a date change? No. But I don’t want to see a crooked election. This election will be the most rigged election in history if that happens,” Trump was quoted as saying by The Hill, referencing widespread mail-in voting.“With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???” Trump had earlier said in a tweet.The US President, speaking of Covid-19 pandemic said this could have been stopped in China.“We can never ever forget the people whom we have lost. We will never forget what happened. This could have been stopped in China, they should have stopped it and they didn’t,” he said.The US President said the scientific path forward is to protect those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to carefully return to work and to school with appropriate precautions.Trump while expressing grief over the passing away of Herman Cain, said: “Let me begin by expressing sadness at the passing of a wonderful man and a dear friend of mine, Herman Cain.

31-07-2020||World||Donald Trump, GOP suggest temporary fix for $600 jobless benefit||The White House and some of its Republican allies in the Senate are signalling they want to extend, at least temporarily, a $600-per-week expanded jobless benefit that has helped keep families and the economy afloat during the Covid-19 pandemic. The move looks to be too little, too late to prevent the lapse of the benefit officially on Friday. Republicans have been fighting to trim back the $600 jobless benefit in the next coronavirus package, but President Donald Trump and some Senate Republicans suggested they could accept keeping the full USD 600 benefit for now. Late-night talks were expected at the Capitol. “We want a temporary extension of enhanced unemployment benefits,” Trump said at the White House. “This will provide a critical bridge for Americans who lost their jobs to the pandemic through no fault of their own.” He added: “It has to be substantial.” But Democrats have so far rejected a piecemeal approach, saying the next relief bill needs to move as a complete package. Before Trump spoke, top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell adjourned the chamber for the weekend while taking a procedural step that could allow voting on a potential compromise next week. Talks so far have yielded little progress. “I’m not very optimistic that we will have any kind of an agreement on a comprehensive bill in the near future,” said White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. He said he even doubted a deal could be struck next week.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  Talks on the relief bill are at a standstill with few reasons for optimism despite sweeping agreement among Washington’s top power players that Congress must pass further relief in coming days and weeks. Trump is eager for another round of relief, and it’s also a priority for GOP allies like McConnell, as well as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer. Democrats hold a strong negotiating hand, with Republicans badly divided over their own proposal. Raising the stakes, a bleak government report released Thursday said the economy shrank at a 33 per cent annualized rate in the second quarter of the year, a stark reminder of the economic damage afflicting the country as lawmakers debate the size and scope of new relief. “This jarring news should compel Congress to move swiftly to provide targeted and temporary assistance to unemployed Americans, employers, and state and local governments, and liability protections for businesses who follow public health guidelines,” said Neal Bradley of the US Chamber of Commerce, the powerful business group. But bipartisan talks have yet to reach a serious, productive phase. Democrats are playing hardball, insisting on a package that’s far larger than the $1 trillion-plus measure unveiled by McConnell on Monday. Thursday brought more tit-for-tat. “They won’t engage. Period,” McConnell said as he opened the Senate. “The Democrats are saying, my way or the highway.” Pelosi and McConnell have an extensive history, however. They often find ways to reach deals, though the process involves intense maneuvering and plenty of cross-talk. In an interview late Wednesday, McConnell showed a willingness to consider some Democratic priorities, like additional food aid. He and Trump have made plain they are intent on getting a bill. “The economy does need more help. We have divided government. We have to talk to each other,” McConnell said on the PBS NewsHour. “And we have to try to get an outcome.” Schumer continued his daily fusillade against McConnell and Republicans controlling the Senate, noting that McConnell “refuses to go in the room” and join the talks in person, instead transferring ownership of the talks to Meadows, along with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been a key architect of previous accords. “We’re trying to negotiate,” Schumer said. “Who’s holding things up?” In another signal that Republicans are preparing to yield on the USD 600 jobless benefit, Arizona Republican Martha McSally, who is facing a tough reelection race this fall, offered a one-week extension of the benefit on the Senate floor. Schumer blocked the move. Pelosi was dashing back to Washington after having travelled to Atlanta for the funeral of Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights icon. Pelosi’s office announced a meeting for Thursday night with the White House negotiators. Other stark differences remain between the $3 trillion proposal from Democrats and $1 trillion counter from Republicans. Money for states and cities is a crucial dividing line as local governments plead for help to shore up budgets and prevent deeper layoffs as they incur Covid-19 costs and lost tax revenue in shutdown economies. Democrats proposed nearly $1 trillion for the local governments, but Trump and Republicans are resisting sending the states and cities more cash. Instead, the GOP offers states flexibility to use $150 billion previously allotted for the virus on other needs. It’s clear that Democrats are trying to push an advantage in the negotiations because Republicans are so split over the prospect of additional government spending and jobless benefits. Among the issues sure to gather momentum is a Democratic demand for a 15 per cent increase in food stamp benefits. Trump has dismissed the GOP bill as “semi-irrelevant” since it leaves out so many Democratic items. Trump appears worried about the expiration of the $600 unemployment benefit boost as well as an expiring federal eviction moratorium on millions of rental units, potentially sending households into devastating turmoil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-gop-suggest-temporary-fix-for-600-jobless-benefit/story-3mKtAJBvNSJlOTCvMlQdVK.html
31-07-2020||World||New York City steels itself for Covid-19 to return in the fall||New York City has kept its Covid-19 infection rates low, but the risk of a resurgence looms over the Big Apple as fall approaches.The city has been a success story in combating Covid-19 since March and April, when the pandemic swept through its boroughs killing thousands of people. Yet the strategies that helped suppress the first surge -- dropping the infection rate to just 1% statewide -- will be tested as cooler weather pushes people together indoors.Melbourne, Australia, with 5 million people, offers a case in point. With the Fahrenheit dropping into the 50s, Melbourne has seen an upswing in cases, a foreboding indicator of how tough it may be for cities like New York to control infections as the mercury drops. With fall and winter approaching, it’s “inevitable” Covid-19 cases will tick up, said Ashish Jha, director of Harvard University’s Global Health Institute.“I am worried about complacency,” Jha said in an interview. “New York went through such a difficult few months, and I am worried that people are tired. A lot of people are looking at New York over the next six months and saying: ‘Could we possibly see a spike?’”New York’s success is seen as somewhat of a beacon for the rest of the country. If the city can keep its rate low as it reopens through the fall and winter, then epidemiologists say its efforts can serve as a model for other big cities nationwide.The city entered Phase 4 of the state’s reopening plan on July 20. Stores are open, though with capacity limited, and New Yorkers can enjoy outdoor dining at restaurants. However, indoor dining, bars and gyms remain closed while the wearing of masks, social distancing and aggressive hygiene practices are still being pushed as imperative.When the U.S. passed a grim milestone with more than 150,000 Americans having died from the pandemic, New York reported just 59 new cases citywide on Tuesday. Meanwhile, on Thursday, Florida and Arizona reported record death tallies.State ActionsThe state is already taking steps to head off any uptick. On Thursday, Governor Andrew Cuomo said New York is making $30 million available to counties to increase contact tracing as well as testing for the coming flu season, which generally hits in the fall and winter.Influenza will pose problems, he said, since symptoms will look like those of Covid-19. Tests must be done at the same lab facilities that already are busy conducting coronavirus testing, according to Cuomo. “That could affect the turnaround time on the Covid tests, so we want the counties to be ready,” he said.The city has also developed a testing and contact-tracing initiative called NYC Test & Trace Corps. Contact tracing is key in finding suspected cases, identifying clusters and isolating the sick. Though it must be paired with a quick turnaround for test results.“You’ve got to have testing in order to have contact tracing,” said Ted Long, executive director of NYC Test & Trace Corps. “Moving forward we’re going to watch like a hawk the turnaround times for each of the individual labs to figure out what we need to do to improve the turnaround times overall for the city.”Pooled TestingTaking advantage of available testing methods is a crucial strategy in containing the virus’ spread, said Lorna Thorpe, professor and director of the Division of Epidemiology in the Department of Population Health at NYU Langone.For one, the city’s current infection rate of approximately 1%-to-2% is within the threshold for pooled testing, which is most effective in areas with very low infection rates. The strategy combines multiple tests together in a single batch. If the pool comes back negative every person in that pool is considered cleared. If the pool is positive, each sample will need to be tested individually.“Pooled testing is critically important to have in New York City,” Thorpe said. “To have the ability to do it, and to have the systems well designed to do it so that we can increase our testing capacity in particular populations as needed to be on top of the spread of the virus.”Quest Diagnostics Inc. was the first lab to gain emergency authorization for pooled testing this month. Laboratory Corp of America Holdings was approved for emergency use shortly after.Mass use of point-of-care rapid tests will also prove useful in containing the virus. The tests which can be processed on site without needing to be sent to a lab can yield results within 15 minutes. However, scaling production to meet the needs of a pandemic have been difficult and so far unsuccessful.“Ensuring that testing is widely available, making testing available and accessible to the groups that are at higher risk for infection,” and having a vigorous contact-tracing program are all crucial to avoid a new surge of the virus, Thorpe said.As the city moves into fall and winter, the public needs to acknowledge that in order to keep infection rates low, New Yorkers all need to accept that life has entered a new normal and keep protections like masks, and social distancing in mind.It is “highly unlikely” New York City will go through another lock down, according to Jha. “The level of mismanagement that you would need to have a city-wide lockdown like what happened in March is pretty substantial,” Jha said. But he added that it’s not out of the realm of possibility.While low case counts and improved testing capacity give New York a leg up in combating a potential second wave, residents must stay vigilant and not put their guard down or they could lose that advantage, according to Jha.“The most important thing is to not squander that by letting up too much and relaxing too much over the next couple of months,” Jha said. “You don’t want to go into the fall with rising infections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-steels-itself-for-covid-19-to-return-in-the-fall/story-yWErCe5G2CzOup7Ika4xNK.html

31-07-2020||India||Students must start exam preparations: UGC tells SC||Students should continue with their preparation for the final-year university examinations scheduled to be held by the end of September 30 and should not harbour any misconception that the Supreme Court will stay them, the University Grants Commission (UGC) told the top court on Friday. UGC was defending its July 6 directive asking universities across the country to hold final-year or final-semester examinations by the end of September. “My request is that nobody should remain under the impression the final exams will be stayed because the Supreme Court is hearing the case. Students should continue to prepare for the exams,” solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for UGC, said. The Supreme Court was hearing a batch of petitions by several students and organisations challenging the guidelines issued by UGC on July 6 to hold final-year examinations by September 30. A student who was found to be Covid-19 positive was one of the petitioners, asking for the exams to be cancelled in view of the pandemic. The Shiv Sena’s youth wing, Yuva Sena, was also a petitioner before the Court. The petitioners have urged the apex court to consider scrapping online/offline tests, and instead direct UGC to declare results by July 31 based on students’ past performance or internal assessment. During the hearing of the case on Friday, senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for the petitioners, said the states of Maharashtra and Delhi have already decided to cancel final-year exams in view of the Covid-19 situation. The UGC, too, highlighted this fact in its affidavit filed before the top court on Thursday, stating that the decision by the two states was contrary to the UGC guidelines. The bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan asked Maharashtra and Delhi to submit their response to the same. The case will be taken up for hearing next on August 10. “All universities/institutions in the country are obligated to conduct terminal semester/ final year examination by the end of September 2020. The UGC took the decision to protect the academic future of students across the country while also keeping in mind their health and safety,” the UGC affidavit stated.

The July 15 report, which was submitted to the Union environment ministry earlier this month, said one dolphin was found dead from poisoning from the oil spill.The well, which has been on fire since June 9, is located near Dibru Saikhowa National Park, the Maguri-Motapung wetlands, and the forest villages of Barekuri, which are home to endangered hoolock gibbons and Gangetic dolphins.The report said oil wells in and around the national park will be detrimental to the region’s unique ecosystem and that it is also extremely vulnerable to earthquakes. The environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee, which met in December and January, recommended environmental clearance for drilling and testing of hydrocarbons at seven locations under the national park.“’[Given] the potential of oil blowout and oil spill disaster like this...such oil wells in the vicinity of Dibru-Saikhowa National park and important bird area complex...will be detrimental to the conservation value of this unique ecosystem,” the report said. It called for an assessment for a cumulative impact of the existing gas wells.The report said bird species richness was found to increase with an increase in distance from the site possibly due to oil spill and intense noise from the blowout. The bird species decline is highest in grasslands (59%) and wetland (85%) compared to areas located away from the site, it added. The report said the fish species have also declined in wetland and river tributaries, where dissolved oxygen levels have fallen due to the oil spill. It added the concentration of toxic polyaromatic hydrocarbons in fish samples from the wetland was found to be 10- to 100-fold higher than normal.The report said there has been a massive decrease in the Gangetic Dolphin presence in Lohit, Dibru, and Maguri-Motapung after the blowout. It added the loud noise due to the blowout can be heard as far as 12 km and beyond, making the area extremely unhealthy for humans, animals, and birds. “The impact is significant and will have a long term effect, as many of these pollutants will leach into the ground and contaminate groundwater.”The report said the 65-70 ha burnt-out area mapped includes crop fields, grasslands, and swamps. “There was a visible oil spill [oil and sediment] on June 16, downstream of the well.” The report underlined the wetland and surrounding lowland forests are unique and hence extremely vulnerable to more oil spill disasters.“The Brahmaputra and the Ganges floodplain landscape is unique in its morphology and fragility, and is responsible for shaping the unique community of plants and animals…the landscape [in Baghjan] is fragile and is engineered by flooding. The dynamic nature of wetland creates mosaics of habitat which are in perpetual flux. In India as well as the world over, there are only a handful of Protected Areas where this system and unique biodiversity is surviving, among them Dibru-Saikhowa National Park and Kaziranga Orang National Park tops the list,” the report said.The report is based on a study WII scientist Qamar Qureshi led. It has asked the government to initiate a study to monitor the long term impact on the ecology of Maguri-Motapung and DibruSaikhowa National Park as well as the health and socio-economic conditions of local communities.Soumitra Dasgupta, additional director general (wildlife), environment ministry, said it is a voluminous report and they were trying to get more details. “We are sending the findings to the Assam government to begin mitigation and restoration work. I understand that the situation is still grim.”Tridiv Hazarika, an OIL spokesman, said they will need time to respond. “Since it is a technical report, we will also have to get it reviewed by our independent experts. Our focus is presently on resolving the blowout.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-baghjan-oil-blowout-site-endangered-species-at-risk-report/story-BXMhhMYBmXTfedPGxwsTxO.html
31-07-2020||India||Andhra guv’s nod to bills for 3 capitals||Hyderabad: Governor Biswabhushan Harichandan on Friday gave his assent to two bills passed for the creation of three capitals for Andhra Pradesh and to abolish the development authority formed in 2014 to develop Amaravati as the capital even as Opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP) called the legislation invalid, saying the process for it was yet to be completed.The government on July 18 sent the AP Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Bill and the AP Capital Region Development Authority (Repeal) Bill for Harichandan’s approval even as the state legislative council, where the ruling YSR Congress Party does not have a majority on its own, did not clear them. The 175-member legislative assembly, where the ruling party has 151 members, passed them twice. The council’s chairman, Muhammad Ahmed Sharif, used his discretionary powers and referred the two bills to a select committee for wider examinations. The governor approved the bills for creating the executive, legislative and judicial capitals in Visakhapatnam, Amaravati, and Kurnool and repealing the AP Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA) even as the committee is yet to constituted. The state government issued two separate gazette notifications related to the bills. “As such Amaravati ceases to be the capital city of Andhra Pradesh,” an official in chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy’s office said, requesting anonymity. The bills were passed for a second time on June 16 but were stalled in the council, which was adjourned sine die without discussing them. Since the council did not take any decision within one month, the bills were deemed to have been passed and were sent to Harichandan for his assent, officials aware of the matter said. Officials cited a Constitutional provision and said a bill is deemed to have been passed if the legislative council does not take any decision on it following its passage in the assembly within one month.Harichandan held several rounds of consultations with legal experts before approving the bills to pave the way for the formation of the three capitals, the official cited above said. TDP leader Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said the bills have no legal sanctity as they are pending for study by the select committee. He added the government gave an undertaking to the high court over having the bills scrutinised. “Though the constitution of select committees could not take place due to bureaucratic hurdles, the process is still on. So, the reintroduction of the same bills again in the state legislature in June cannot be legally tenable.” The high court has been hearing a batch of petitions by farmers of Amaravati, who have opposed the trifurcation of the capital and abolition of APCRDA. The next hearing is scheduled for August 6. A Siva Reddy, convenor of Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi, which is a petitioner in the case, said they would fight a legal battle as long as they get justice. “We have no other option as we cannot take to the streets because of the Covid-19 pandemic. We are confident that justice would prevail and Amaravati will remain the capital.”APCRDA was created for the development of the state’s capital after Andhra Pradesh lost Hyderabad with the creation of Telangana in 2014. Andhra Pradesh minister Botsa Satyanarayana said the governor had given his assent after going through all legal angles. “Everything has gone as per the procedure. Our intention of creating three capital cities is to ensure development of all the three regions of the state,” Satyanarayana said. He added chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy would soon lay foundation for the executive capital city at Visakhapatnam. Andhra Pradesh Bar Council member Muppalla Nageswara Rao said the laws might not stand legal scrutiny. “The government has no power to relocate the high court from Amaravati to Kurnool, as it was decided by the judiciary and the President of India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-guv-s-nod-to-bills-for-3-capitals/story-ZBJ2EAxNqvTeVlRyRAJIMI.html
31-07-2020||India||In NEP, focus on critical thinking and creativity: Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’||Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ speaks to Amandeep Shukla on the National Education Policy (NEP) . Edited excerpts:What effect will the National Education Policy (NEP) have on the education system of the country in the short run and the long run? With the NEP 2020 coming into effect, we are hoping to transform education and putting a significant thrust on learning about how to think critically and solve problems, how to be creative and multidisciplinary, and how to innovate, adapt, and absorb new material in novel and changing fields. The new curriculum will include basic arts, crafts, humanities, games, sports and fitness, languages, literature, culture, and values, in addition to science and mathematics, to develop all aspects and capabilities of learners, and make education more well-rounded, useful, and fulfilling to the learner.The education system talks of providing quality education to children in schools as well as universities. However, there are lakhs of vacancies for teachers. What do you plan on this? Teachers’ vacancies will be filled at the earliest, especially in disadvantaged areas and areas with large pupil-to-teacher ratios or high rates of illiteracy. A technology-based comprehensive teacher-requirement forecasting exercise will be conducted by each state to assess expected subject-wise teacher vacancies over the next two decades.At higher education level, the policy states that leadership positions shall not remain vacant, but rather an overlapping time period during transitions in leadership shall be the norm.One of the highlights of this policy has been its focus on mother tongue as a medium of instruction… Young children learn and grasp nontrivial concepts more quickly in their home language/mother tongue. Wherever possible, the medium of instruction until at least Grade 5, but preferably till Grade 8 and beyond, will be the home language/mother tongue/local language/regional language.However, there will be a greater flexibility in the three-language formula, and no language will be imposed on any state. The three languages learned by children will be the choices of states, regions, and of course the students themselves, so long as at least two of them are native to India.Nowhere the policy talks about shedding the English language; instead it emphasizes on the importance of multilingualism which has great cognitive benefit for young children.Will it be possible to make regional language the medium of instruction in centrally run Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) or Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs)? What is the ministry’s view on this? KVs and JNVs have students from all over India, not from a particular region or state. Therefore, NEP has proposed that wherever possible, the medium of instruction until at least Grade 5, but preferably till Grade 8 and beyond, will be the home language/mother tongue/local language/regional language. Thereafter, the home/local language shall continue to be taught as a language wherever possible.From when does the policy become effective? Will its provisions apply in the coming session? Or will you make a timeline to implement various measures? This policy is for the next 20 years. We are in a process of making the implementation plan.During the Covid-19 pandemic, one major issue that came into focus was the digital divide. How do you plan to address the requirements of the underprivileged sections through NEP? NEP 2020 recognises the importance of leveraging the advantages of technology while acknowledging potential risks and dangers. Given the fact that there still persists a substantial section of the population whose digital access is highly limited, mass media — such as television, radio, and community radio — will be extensively used.The policy says children will be given a logical framework for making ethical decisions. How do you plan to teach ethics and morals to students? Instilling knowledge of India and its varied social, cultural, and technological needs; its inimitable artistic, language, and knowledge traditions; and its strong ethics in India’s young people is considered critical for purposes of national pride, self-confidence, self-knowledge, cooperation, and integration as mentioned in NEP. At present, we have just come out with NEP. The formulation of a new and comprehensive National Curricular Framework for School Education, NCFSE 2020-21, will be undertaken by the NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) based on the principles of this National Education Policy 2020, frontline curriculum needs and after discussions with all stakeholders. Based on this, parallel changes will be done in school textbooks.NEP allows foreign varsities to set up campuses in India. How will you ensure that a foreign varsity does not indulge in profit-making from education? India will be promoted as a global study destination providing premium education at affordable costs, thereby helping to restore its role as a Vishwa Guru. A legislative framework facilitating such entry will be put in place, and such universities will be given special dispensation regarding regulatory, governance, and content norms on par with other autonomous institutions of India. Credits acquired in foreign universities will be permitted, where appropriate as per the requirements of each higher education institution (HEI), to be counted for the award of a degree.Multiple mechanisms with checks and balances will combat and stop the commercialization of higher education. All education institutions will be held to similar standards of audit and disclosure as a ‘not for profit’ entity. Surpluses, if any, will be reinvested in the institution. All HEIs — public and private — shall be treated on par within this regulatory regime.There are institutes like IITs and IIMs which stand out in areas like technology and management. How advisable is it to turn them into inter-disciplinary units?The IITs are already leading the path by introducing multi-disciplinary courses. The policy envisages a broad-based multi-disciplinary holistic education at the undergraduate level for integrated, rigorous exposure to science, arts, humanities, mathematics and professional fields.NEP is an ambitious plan. It envisages setting up several new institutions, capacity building, modernizing infrastructure. It also calls for increasing budget spend to 6%. How easy or difficult is it to meet these targets? The Centre and states will work together to increase the public investment in education sector to reach 6% of GDP at the earliest. This is considered extremely critical for achieving the high-quality and equitable public education system.The academic session for 2020-21 has still not taken off. The Kuhad committee has suggested that the dates for commencement of the session be postponed to November-December… The higher education institutes will be opened based on the directions of the ministry of home affairs guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-nep-focus-on-critical-thinking-and-creativity/story-v2gtLoBTcS23QhZVGkeEfJ.html
31-07-2020||India||BJP serves notices to Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah over corruption charges||Bengaluru: The Karnataka unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday issued legal notices to state Congress president DK Shivakumar and leader of opposition in the Karnataka assembly, Siddaramiah, over their “baseless” allegations of corruption in the procurement of Covid-19 equipment. The BJP has demanded that the two Congress leaders withdraw their allegations and apologise. “The allegations made by you without any basis or material have also reflected badly upon all the members of the party who have strived hard in building the party and the government,” the notices, issued on behalf of state BJP general secretary N Ravi Kumar by his lawyers, said. Last week, Shivakumar and Siddaramiah alleged that the costs of Covid-19 medical equipment and supplies purchased were inflated, and over Rs 2000 crore were siphoned off. They demanded a judicial probe into the alleged graft. Reacting to the notice, Shivakumar said that his party was ready to furnish all documents to prove the corruption if the government was ready to order a judicial inquiry by a sitting high court judge. “If the allegations are baseless they can file a case against me and hang me.” Shivakumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-serves-notices-to-shivakumar-and-siddaramaiah-over-corruption-charges/story-kmVzO2BcDYe8KsXJ5VIoaI.html
31-07-2020||India||SC bars registration of BS-IV vehicles sold before March 31||New Delhi The Supreme Court on Friday ordered a freeze on registration of all BS-IV vehicles sold before March 31 after it saw abnormally high sale of vehicles in the days leading up to March 31 when business across the country came to a standstill on account of a national lockdown announced in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Federation of Automobile Dealers (FADA) informed the Court that bulk of purchases was through online sale. Suspecting manipulation of figures, the bench of Justices Arun Mishra, BR Gavai, and Krishna Murari said: “Sales during lockdown is abnormally high. It appears under the guise of our March 27 order (permitting sale of BS-IV vehicles beyond March 31 to compensate for the lockdown) some fraudulent action has been adopted.” The bench ordered FADA to supply full details of vehicles sold online as well as through showrooms. The matter will now be taken up on August 13. An affidavit filed by the Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways (MoRTH) added to the Court’s suspicion. The Court asked the Centre to verify on its E-Vaahan portal, the number of BS-IV vehicles that were sold and registered in the period from March 12-31, 2020. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati informed the Court that as per the figures provided by FADA, a total of 2,25,257 vehicles were sold. On verification it was found, 1,45,152 were granted permanent registration while 29,834 vehicles are still awaiting registration. Following the Court’s order, vehicles falling in this category will have to await registration till the next date of Court hearing. Interestingly, data concerning 50,261 vehicles could not be located on the e-Vaahan portal. The Centre contacted the states which are yet to connect on e-Vaahan. These states/UTs include Andhra Pradesh, and few regional transport offices (RTO) in Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Andaman Nicobar Islands, and Lakshadweep. Out of the missing data of 50,261, the Centre located the data of 10,324 vehicles in these states/UTs, but there is still no clue about 39,937 vehicles which have been shown as sold by FADA. FADA counsel senior advocate KV Vishwanathan said, “We have received the Government affidavit late Thursday evening. We are still in the process of reconciling figures for which we need time. The members and non-members of FADA had complained that they were unable to log in the data on e-Vaahan at the relevant dates.” The Court was surprised to find huge volume of BS-IV vehicles sale and registration as recorded in the Centre’s affidavit. According to MoRTH, between March 12 and March 31, the Vaahan portal recorded sale of 9,56,015 vehicles which included two-wheelers, three-wheelers, commercial and passenger vehicles. The maximum sale occurred on March 29 (78,525), March 30 (94,054) and March 31 (55,334). The bench observed, “We are worried how sales could be so high during lockdown. How could this be….It appears they have manipulated the data. How could showrooms be open during lockdown?” FADA will have to answer these queries posed by the court before August 13. The court has already recalled that part of its March 27 order which allowed sale of BS-IV vehicles beyond March 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-bars-registration-of-bs-iv-vehicles-sold-before-march-31/story-BjKpnkWYIbrImn6yoiIQYI.html
31-07-2020||India||SC backs opening religious places in unlocking phase||Witnessing temple rituals through live streaming cannot be a substitute for physical visit of places of worship, the Supreme Court said on Friday, advocating opening of temples, churches and mosques to the general public during the current unlock phase, on special occasions.A three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra suggested that a limited number of devotes could be permitted in temples during the unlock phase provided adequate safety measures and social distancing guidelines are adhered to.“E-darshan is no darshan. Can’t you permit darshan by adhering to social distancing? During a total lock down things are different. But during unlock period, when other things are functioning, why can’t states manage temples? Temples, churches, mosques should be opened at least on special occasions,” justice Mishra remarked.India was under a total lockdown till May 31. Since then it has been through two phases called Unlock 1.0 and Unlock 2.0 and will, from August 1, enter the third unlock phase. The bench was hearing a plea by Member of Parliament, Nishikant Dubey seeking a direction to the state of Jharkhand and the central government to open Baba Baidhyanath Jyotirlinga Temple at Deoghar and Baba Basukinath Temple at Basukinath to the public and to further allow the ‘Shravani Mela’ devotees to offer prayers during the holy months of Shravan and Bhado (late July to late August and late August to late September respectively).The Jharkhand government opposed the plea citing the threat of the coronavirus disease and the fact that it would be streaming the temple rituals online.The apex court eventually did not pass any direction and instead asked the Jharkhand government to explore the possibility of allowing at least a few devotees to visit the temple every day.“While we are not issuing any direction, we request the state government to find out the possibility and work out a mechanism for allowing darshan (of the temple deity) to the general public. This shall apply to churches and mosques as well. Let efforts be made by the state government in this direction,” the court said.The Baidyanath temple assumes special significance during the festival of Shravani Mela when devotees throng the temple carrying water from the river Ganga to offer it to the deity. Dubey, who represents the Godda constituency of Jharkhand in the Lok Sabha, initially approached the Jharkhand high court seeking permission to open the two temples to the devotees citing similar intervention by the Supreme Court in the Puri Jagannath Ratha Yatra in June.The high court, however, dismissed his plea on July 3 stating that allowing public to congregate for the festival could seriously impact the Covid-19 situation in the state.“No such direction for Shravani Mela will be appropriate to be passed taking into consideration the spread of threat of COVID-19 virus which according to us, if allowed, may cause great danger of wide spread of infection of COVID-19 virus,” the high court said.Dubey then approached the Supreme Court on July 8.During the hearing on Friday, senior counsel Salman Khurshid and additional advocate general Tapesh Kumar Singh, appearing for Jharkhand, told the court that the state has arranged for online darshan of the temple rituals and argued against opening the temple to general public.“The state is going through Covid crisis. Serum testing is happening now and depending on the results, lockdown might be imposed,”, Khurshid said.Tapesh Kumar Singh said that the lanes leading up to the temple are very narrow and it might not be possible to ensure social distancing between people if the temple is thrown open to devotees.The bench, however, said that the state should have made an effort to allow at least a few hundred devotees on a daily basis.“Is it the same for churches, mosques? It is Eid; are mosques open? Why can’t it be permitted adhering to social distancing?” justice Mishra asked Khurshid.“No, it will become difficult with overcrowding”, Khurshid replied.The petitioner’s counsel, Samir Malik pointed out that though the Baidyanath temple is not open to the public around 30,000 priests on pilgrimage are allowed inside the temple.The state government said that only a limited number of such priests (pandas) are allowed inside the sanctum sanctorum of the temple though there is no restriction on them in the temple premises.“We are alarmed by this,” the court noted while ordering the state to make arrangements to avoid entry of large number of pandas so as to avert any spurt in Covid-19 cases in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-backs-opening-religious-places-in-unlocking-phase/story-PItHbNfF058ZlqPMiylNWM.html
31-07-2020||India||Rajasthan Congress goes to SC on disqualification, shifts MLAs||Mahesh Joshi, the chief whip of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) in the Rajasthan assembly, approached the Supreme Court on Friday, challenging the high court’s July 24 order that virtually put a freeze on disqualification proceedings against now-dismissed deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and 18 other rebel Congress legislators backing him.Joshi told the apex court that by ordering “status quo” on disqualification proceedings, the HC has granted full relief, beyond what was sought for by the Pilot camp.The Pilot camp had questioned in the HC a July 14 notice issued by the speaker seeking their response to disqualification pleas sent to them, and claimed that CP Joshi did not grant them sufficient time to respond.“The consequence of the grant of status quo order (by the HC) is that the Respondents have secured relief over and above their original grievance that the Speaker did not give them seven days’ time,” said the special leave petition (SLP) settled by senior advocate Devdatt Kamat.Joshi’s appeal further said the division bench of the HC had no jurisdiction to hear the case as the Pilot camp challenged the validity of para 2(1)(a) of the 10th Schedule, which has been decided upon by a Constitution bench of the apex court in the 1992 Kihoto Hollohan case. Such a matter has to be decided by at least a five-judge bench of the apex court, it added.The move came just two days after assembly Speaker CP Joshi moved a petition in the top court against the July 24 order of the Rajasthan HC.The Pilot camp moved the HC on July 15, challenging the disqualification notices. And on July 22, the speaker filed a special leave petition in the top court, challenging the HC’s July 21 order to defer disqualification proceedings.On July 23, the Supreme Court turned down the speaker’s request for a stay on that order and said it will hear the larger question of whether or not courts can interfere with disqualification proceedings initiated by an assembly speaker against lawmakers even before a decision has been taken.The top court’s refusal to grant stay paved the way for the high court to pronounce its order on July 24. The HC will now examine in detail the legal issues involved and the petition is unlikely to come up for hearing anytime soon.Following this, the speaker on Monday withdrew his plea before the top court that challenged the HC’s July 21 order directing him to defer action on the disqualification notices. Then on Wednesday, he moved the top court again, challenging the July 24 order.The speaker submitted that the HC order is in violation of legal principles laid down by the 1992 Supreme Court judgment in Kihoto Hollohan v. Zachillhu as per which courts cannot interfere with the speaker’s powers to decide a disqualification petition till he gives a final decision on such a disqualification plea.The legal battle began after the Congress chief whip filed a complaint before the speaker on July 14, seeking action against Pilot and the other dissidents under paragraph 2 (1) (a) of the 10th Schedule of the Constitution. The provision disqualifies MLAs if they “voluntarily” give up the membership of the party which they represent in the House.The rebel camp said Pilot never indicated any intention to leave the Congress party. In their petition filed in the HC, Pilot and the other MLAs submitted that were merely exercising their right to criticise party leadership and the functioning of the chief minister.The Pilot camp also challenged the validity of paragraph 2(1) (a) of the 10th Schedule, contending that the provision was very wide since even expression of opinion or views against party leadership are construed as defection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-chief-whip-moves-sc-against-hc-breather-to-pilot/story-JdP0my69p9KDN1chKn5BiO.html
31-07-2020||India||Congress shifts MLAs, takes fresh dig at BJP||Jaipur/ Barmer: The Congress shifted legislators loyal to Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot to a luxury hotel near Jaisalmer on Friday, alleging that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was attempting to poach its MLAs. The legislators had been camping in a hotel on the outskirts of Jaipur since July 13 in the aftermath of a rebellion by now-dismissed deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, who is believed to have the backing of 18 Congress MLAs in the 200-member House. “The government needs to be saved as you can see the way Centre and its departments are after us. The pressure will be less there [Jaisalmer]. I and the most of the ministers will stay here and the rest will keep coming. There will be no compromise on governance,” chief minister Gehlot said before boarding his flight to Jaisalmer. Gehlot said since the governor announced the date for the assembly session beginning August 14, MLAs and their family members have been receiving calls. “Even threatening calls are being made, mentally harassing them. What will happen to the country where horse-trading is being done at such a level?” he questioned. While Gehlot alleges that the Centre’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is trying to dislodge his government, the state’s opposition party denies the charge. Gehlot also says the “horse-trading rate” has increased after the assembly session was announced by the governor on Wednesday night. In the aftermath of the rebellion, the Gehlot camp thinks a trust vote in the upcoming assembly session is its best bet. The Gehlot camp is believed to have the support of 101 MLAs (this does not include speaker CP Joshi, but factors in allies), while the Pilot camp has the backing of three independents who take the tally to 22. The BJP and its ally Rashtriya Loktrantrik Party have 75 MLAs in the House. The chief minister also alleges that the BJP is misusing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the income tax department to “threaten all”. His stand comes at a time when ED has summoned his brother, Agrasain Gehlot, to appear before it in Delhi in connection with its probe into alleged money laundering in the export of fertilizers. On Friday, about 100 MLAs in the Gehlot camp arrived at the Jaipur airport on four buses from the Fairmont Hotel on the Jaipur-Delhi highway. The first batch had 54 MLAs, who left in three chartered planes around 1pm. The second batch of around 35-37 MLAs went around 5pm in another flight. A third flight carrying the CM left around 5pm. After landing at Jaisamler airport, the MLAs were taken to Hotel Suryagarh, about 20 km from the city. Heavy security has been deployed in and around the hotel on the Jaisalmer-Sam highway. BJP state president Satish Poonia wondered if the Congress MLAs will next cross over to Pakistan. “The CM talks of democracy and Constitution, but if there is unity, why are the MLAs shifted? The CM should run the government from secretariat, and not from hotels,” he said. BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said the CM should clarify the horse trading charges. Transport minister Pratap Singh, who is in the Gehlot camp, said in Jaipur the MLAs are being shifted to Jaisalmer so that they can remain united. “The chief minister’s strategy is that not a single MLA can be poached,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-shifts-mlas-takes-fresh-dig-at-bjp/story-PYVVCBZQCrwRvjQ42SfKbN.html
31-07-2020||India||China, Australia envoys spar on Twitter||New Delhi: The Chinese and Australian envoys to India had a terse exchange on Twitter on Friday on China’s actions in the South China Sea and elsewhere, with the latter saying Beijing should refrain from actions that “unilaterally alter the status quo”. Sun Weidong, the Chinese envoy, objected to remarks made by the Australian high commissioner, Barry O’Farrell, regarding the situation in the South China Sea by saying in a tweet that they were made “disregarding facts”. “Noted remarks by Australian HC to India on #SouthChinaSea disregarding facts. #China’s territorial sovereignty & maritime rights & interests are in conformity [with] int’l law incl UNCLOS [United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]. It’s clear who safeguard peace & stability & who destabilize & provoke escalation in the region,” Sun tweeted. A short while later, O’Farrell responded in a tweet: “Thank you @China_Amb_India. I would hope then you follow the 2016 South China Sea Arbitral Award which is final and binding under international law, and also generally refrain from actions that unilaterally alter the status quo.” O’Farrell was referring to the verdict by the arbitral tribunal in the Philippines’ case against China’s activities in the South China Sea. The tribunal ruled overwhelmingly in favour of the Philippines and concluded that China’s territorial claims were unlawful. China didn’t accept the verdict. China’s claims in the South China Sea have been challenged by several countries, including the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan. Sun’s tweet was a response to remarks by O’Farrell in a statement issued by the Australian mission after his meeting with external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Thursday. O’Farrell backed India’s position on the border standoff with China, saying Australia opposed attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) as this could increase the risk of instability. The statement said Australia continues to be concerned by China’s actions in the South China Sea, which are “destabilising and could provoke escalation”. On July 23, Australia had lodged a note with the UN Secretary General refuting China’s “unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea”. While Sun didn’t respond to O’Farrell’s comments on the border standoff, he took exception to the references to the South China Sea. The Chinese envoy also faced criticism from former Indian diplomats and military officials for his comments during a webinar on India-China relations held on Thursday. During the webinar, Sun sought to blame India for both the border standoff and the June 15 clash at Galwan Valley that resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and unspecified Chinese casualties. He also sought to imply that India’s position on interpreting the LAC could lead to new disputes, and that this was one of the reasons why the process for clarifying the disputed had stalled since 2002. Responding to these remarks, former army chief Gen VP Malik tweeted: “By his statement yesterday, #Ambassador Sun Weidong of China has virtually ended any possible progress in LAC talks between military commanders.” Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, described the Chinese envoy’s address at the webinar as a “classic dialogue of the deaf”. Bhatia added: “He talks at, not to, us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-australia-envoys-spar-on-twitter/story-pr859sX2eteeQ6d5K7kFZL.html
31-07-2020||India||Govt restricts import of colour TV sets||New Delhi: The government has restricted the import of colour televisions to check their influx from China and encourage domestic manufacturing, two officials aware of the matter said. The Directorate General of Foreign Trade issued a notification on late Thursday, amending import policy for the televisions from free to restricted category.This is the latest in a series of actions aimed at China that India has taken since 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a clash with Chinese troops along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15. India on Thursday said there has been “some progress” towards disengagement along the LAC, though the process is far from complete and military commanders from the two sides were are set to meet for the fifth time to work out steps to complete the process.India on June 29 banned 59, mostly Chinese, mobile applications like TikTok, calling them “prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, the security of the state and public order”. On July 23, it said bidders from the countries India shares its land borders with would need prior registration and security clearances for government contracts. The move was seen as part of India’s efforts to counter China. India in April issued a similar directive on screening foreign investment from neighbouring countries.“Import of colour TV is now in the restricted category, which would necessitate an importer to seek import license from the government. The main purpose of this move is to check the influx of China TVs,” one of the officials said requesting anonymity. India has a Rs 15,000 crore TV industry and over 36% of TVs are imported primarily from China and South East Asia, he added.A second official said some Chinese TV sets were routed through a third country with which India has a free trade agreement (FTA). “This move will also curb such illegal trade,” he said. Besides China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, and Germany are major exporters of colour TVs. “Many such items enter the Indian market taking advantage of ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations]-India FTA... imports at reduced or zero duty put our domestic industry at a disadvantage. Such imports cannot be controlled through increased duty rates. Hence, the government is taking measures such as non-duty actions like import restrictions,” the first official said.The ASEAN FTA was signed in 2009 with Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos.The second official said India has created necessary infrastructure and made arrangements to produce cost-effective electronic items under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-reliant India Initiative), and will invite global manufacturers to set up units in the country.India’s electronics industry grew from $29 billion in 2014 to $70 billion in 2019, according to the ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY).“Phased Manufacturing Programme for TVs is underway and specified parts like open cells, chips on films, printed circuit boards assembly are exempted from duties. Hence, India is ready for a shift of manufacturing to India with cost-effective imports of essential parts,” the first official said.The officials said the move to restrict the influx of TV sets was taken after consultations with the domestic industry that aims to promote Make in India scheme, create jobs and provide goods at comparable rates.Divakar Vijayasarathy, founder and managing partner at consultancy firm DVS Advisors LLP, said: “As there is no ban and only a restriction [is] being imposed, there is a possibility of such imports, however, with prior approval of the Directorate General of Foreign Trade. The procedural aspects of acquiring this permit [licence], however, would be tedious considering the stakes involved. There shall be transition provisions in place for import orders already being given or goods in transit.”DK Aggarwal, president of PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry appreciated the commerce ministry’s decision. “This move will restrict the irrational dumping of coloured television into the Indian market and cut inbound shipments of non-essential items from China and other Asian countries, which was severely damaging the survival and competency of our domestic manufacturers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-restricts-import-of-colour-tv-sets/story-ZJDtEVjJTqRTGVLyEX7YJM.html

The hill parties want the BJP to keep its electoral promise and come up with a permanent political solution for Darjeeling hills, Siliguri, Terai and the Dooars region before the 2021 assembly elections in Bengal. The Bimal Gurung faction of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) and Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF), the biggest hill parties that have been agitating for statehood for decades now and helped the Bharatiya Janata Party win the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat thrice in a row; have said that they feel disillusioned. The present office bearers of the GTA are appointed by the Mamata Banerjee government. The last review meeting was held in January 2015 when Gurung, who is now in hiding, controlled the GTA. Leaders of the GJM (Gurung faction) and the GNLF met Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya on July 22 and July 29 respectively with the appeal to find a permanent political solution before the assembly polls. The GJM (Gurung faction) said that during the talks Shah decided to start tripartite talks within a fortnight. However, on July 27 the home ministry issued a notice saying that the Union home secretary would review issues related to GTA on August 7 at a meeting with the home secretary, the district magistrate, GTA officials and representatives of the GJM. The hill parties have taken exception to the fact that the letter does not specify which faction of the GJM would be present at the meeting although the Union home ministry has asked the district magistrate to issue a notice to the GJM. In a statement, the Gurung faction has said that it will not attend the meeting. “There is no logic in calling the GTA review meeting after more than five years,” said the statement Roshan Giri issued from his hideout on Friday. Gurung’s followers feel that the BJP-led government at the Centre is sitting on the issue for a long time. In September 2017, then Union home minister Rajnath Singh appealed to the GJM to withdraw its agitation and said the ministry would convene a meeting to discuss the raging issue. The meeting did not take place and politics in Darjeeling underwent a sea change. Gurung, who founded the GJM, went into hiding along with his faction’s general secretary Roshan Giri as they were charged under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act by the state. The Trinamool Congress government put Binoy Tamang, head of the other GJM faction and Gurung’s rival, at the helm of affairs of the GTA. Raju Bista, the BJP Lok Sabha member from Darjeeling, said, “I have informed Shah that GTA has failed to fulfill the aspirations of the people of Darjeeling hills, Terai and Dooars and political talks should be held immediately with GJM, our other allies and rest of the stakeholders.” Benoy Tamang and Anit Thapa, chairman of the GTA board of administrators and general secretary of the GJM’s other faction, said on Friday that they will not attend the meeting. Ajoy Edwards, president of the GNLF Darjeeling branch committee, said, “Those attending this meeting will be betraying the cause of the Gorkhas. We want the BJP to clarify its stand at the earliest.” North Bengal development affairs minister Rabindranath Ghosh said, “I will not say anything on this issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/darjeeling-s-gorkha-outfits-disillusioned-after-centre-calls-gta-review-meet/story-eV8EpHzmYbnxxJ1P8MhZRP.html

Her daughter studies in Class IX while the son studies in Class VII in a government school.She was forced to pawn her gold mangalsutra to raise Rs 20,000 to purchase a TV set so that her children could continue to study by watching education programmes telecast on government-run DD Chandana channel.“They would initially watch the program on a neighbour’s TV set. Unfortunately, sometimes the neighbours would want to watch some other program and they would miss their classes. So, unable to see them struggle and since we want to provide a good education to our children, I decided to pledge my mangalasutra to buy a TV,” Kasturi told local media.She also said that the teachers at her children’s government school had asked students to watch the lessons on the Chandana channel to continue their learning. Schools have been shut due to the Covid-19 pandemic and students are being encouraged to learn online.With the Rs 20,000 she borrowed, Kasturi brought a TV set for Rs 14,000 and rest was used for household expenses.After learning about the incident, district in-charge minister CC Patil said that the government would help Kasturi. However, former chief minister and JDS leader HD Kumaraswamy said that this was an indication of the challenges that poor parents were facing due to the ongoing pandemic. He also demanded that the government come out with a scheme to help such poor parents.Meanwhile, the pawnbroker decided to return the mangalasutra to Kasturi after he came to know about the reason why she borrowed the money.Mahendra, Tahsildar of Nargunda taluk speaking to HT on phone said “Now the entire incident has been resolved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-karnataka-woman-pawns-mangalsutra-to-buy-tv-for-children-s-on-air-classes/story-GvLipzPCZRhXvE3tad3dbL.html

31-07-2020||India||Festive fervour with delectable platter||As we are into a rare extended weekend with different occasions to celebrate, we can fervently try assorted range of recipes and make our festive days all the more special. Starting with Bakrid (Eid-ul-Adha) on Saturday, Friendship Day on Sunday and Raksha Bandhan a day after, every occasion will be special in its own way so the delicacies too have to be different and exciting. “The choice of recipes and dishes for each day is different. People will celebrate these festivals irrespective of their faith. Like on Bakrid it’s a must to prepare a non-vegetarian dish and sewain. Then Raksha Bandhan without its signature dishes and Friendship Day without cakes, pastries will not be as colourful as it should be,” says Mayank Kant, a medical professional. He is getting qimami sewain prepared on Bakrid and kheer for Raksha Bandhan. Best way to say with it love is opting for bakery products that can be easily made at home with quick-fix recipes or pickups with choicest offerings from any bakery, says Vikas Malik of Mr Brown. “Festivities cannot and should not be put on hold in these tough times too as we can celebrate it in our own small way. We won’t hold any social gathering but celebrations have to go on within the family, says chef Mujeebur Rehman. Many home chefs too are providing festive ‘ghar-ka-khana’ from their kitchen giving the festivals and social occasion a homely touch. “Sweets are something which we are procuring for Raksha Bandhan but rest of the delicacies we will be only preparing at home. Safety is the key but the pandemic could not take the fun away,” says Sarita Kanchan, a homemaker.

31-07-2020||India||Food adds positive flavours to tough times: Sanjeev Kapoor||Celebrity chef Sanjeev Kapoor feels that with a series of festivities around we definitely need to utilise the occasion to enjoy as well as make it a healthier, positive celebration. As we are all set to celebrate Bakrid, Friendship Day and Rakshabandhan back-to-back, talking about staying positive and upbeat, he said, “Due to the ongoing pandemic there is a lot of fear and stress everywhere so at this point of time any kind of celebration is most welcome. As all the celebrations in this period is largely with our family and at home, what we have seen of late is that food is adding positivity to these tough times. Home cooking and eating together has become order of the day .” It’s great thing that three occasions are falling together and it’s time to be together in a responsible way, he said. “Festivity plays a big role in bringing positivity in our lives. And three back-to-back occasions are like ‘ek ticket main teen mazey’. In a secular country like India, no matter what religion it belongs to we celebrate it together. Friendship Day has nothing to do with religion but it gives people opportunity to show love and celebrate, which is absolutely a great way. On Eid we crave for biryani-sewain, for gujhiya on Holi, for cake on Christmas and so on…” The masterchef suggests that people can add own touch to the traditional cuisine. “Festival food is symbolic and takes special efforts to be made. I feel this year maybe say it differently with some modern touch. Like dresses have changed over a period of time we need to reinvent same traditional food.” Sanjeev suggests that traditional dishes can be given some interesting twists. “Maybe one can make a healthier biryani with brown rice or add veggies to it to make it better. Many old followings we take as a thumbs rule and don’t try to bring any change. Whereas what I believe is that we must be flexible to make it healthier and relevant as per the day.” He gives an example. “Hundred years back we used to prepare dishes with principles of pickling as then we had no refrigerators so we used more oil and spices. Today, scenario has changed so we make it with less ghee and butter or use lean meat in dishes. Honey can be used in sweets and so on. During celebration we are like ‘tiyohaar roz-roz toh nahi aata hai’ (festivals don’t come every day) and we become carefree and hog on so it’s better to make the same dishes marginally healthier and enjoy eating guilt free,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/food-adds-positive-flavours-to-tough-times-sanjeev-kapoor/story-Wm7VpiIay8HRdyeX1nc6dL.html
31-07-2020||India||Rajasthan police told Sachin Pilot and other MLAs never stayed at Manesar hotels||The administration of hotel ITC Bharat, Best Western Country club, Manesar and Heritage Village, Manesar - where Sachin Pilot and MLAs supporting him were allegedly camping - told Rajasthan’s anti-corruption bureau (ACB) on Friday that the legislators were not their guests and didn’t stay there. The investigators were not allowed to enter Best Western Country club and Heritage Village properties in Manesar. Rajasthan’s special operation group (SOG), which is also probing the horse trading case, had received a similar response by the hotel administrations on Wednesday.On Friday morning around 6am, a five-member team from the ACB headed by deputy superintendent of police (DSP), ACB, Saleh Mohammad had left for Manesar to record statements of two MLAs, Vishvendra Singh and Bhanwarlal Sharma, considered to be in Sachin Pilot’s camp.“The ACB team reached ITC Bharat around 11.30 am, where the team members were allowed entry till reception. The team checked the visitor record of the hotel and an hour later they left for Best Western Country Club, where they were stopped by the hotel administration a few metres ahead of the hotel,” said an ACB official familiar with the developments. Also Read: Man linked to Rajasthan horse-trading tapes refuses to give voice sampleThe official added that when the ACB team enquired about Singh and Sharma, the hotel administration, in a written reply, said the MLAs never stayed there. The team got a similar response from hotel Heritage Village.The anti-corruption bureau (ACB) on Friday served reminder notices to former tourism minister Vishwendra Singh and Sardarshahar MLA Bhanwar Lal Sharma, to get their statements registered within seven-days.“Reminder notices have been sent to Sharma and Singh to come to the ACB headquarters within seven days and get their statements registered. We also want to ask them some questions related to audio tapes,” said an ACB official related to the investigation. Watch: Rajasthan Speaker’s video with CM’s son goes viral, BJP demands his resignationOn July 17, the ACB registered a case against rebel Congress lawmaker Bhanwarlal Sharma, one Gajendra Singh and a power broker named Sanjay Jain under Section 7 (public servant accepts or attempts to take a bribe) and 7A (public servant obtaining undue advantage) of the IPC, on the basis of a complaint filed by chief whip of Rajasthan assembly, Mahesh Joshi. The basis of the complaint was the surfacing of three incriminating audiotapes that quickly went viral on social media. In one of the audiotapes, a rebel Congress lawmaker, who Joshi claims to be Sharma, is purportedly talking to a middleman and a person named Gajendra Singh about toppling the Ashok Gehlot government. In another tape, two persons are heard talking about some MLAs having accepted the first installment and the next course of action.On July 20, notices were sent to the house of Sharma and Singh in which the ACB sought co-operation from the two MLAs in the investigation. On July 24, the duo was served reminder notices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-police-told-sachin-pilot-and-other-mlas-never-stayed-at-manesar-hotels/story-N5ggXyrt5OxRQETpB6ZxJP.html
31-07-2020||India||Supreme Court bats for opening temples, churches, mosques during Unlock phases||Witnessing temple rituals through live streaming cannot be a substitute for a physical visit to places of worship, the Supreme Court said on Friday, advocating opening of temples, churches and mosques for the public during the Unlock period on special occasions.A three-judge bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said that a limited number of devotees can be permitted in temples during the Unlock period provided adequate safety measures and social distancing guidelines are adhered to.“E-darshan is no darshan. Can’t you permit darshan by adhering to social distancing? During a total lockdown things are different. But during Unlock period, when other things are functioning, why can’t states manage temples. Temples, churches, mosques should be opened at least on special occasions,” Justice Mishra remarked.The bench was hearing a plea by Member of Parliament, Nishikant Dubey seeking a direction to the state of Jharkhand and the central government to open Baba Baidhyanath Jyotirlinga Temple at Deoghar and Baba Basukinath Temple at Basukinath to the public and to further allow the ‘Shravani Mela’ devotees to offer prayers during Hindi months of ‘Shravan and Bhado’.The Jharkhand government had opposed the plea citing the Covid-19 threat and the fact that it would be streaming the temple rituals online.The apex court eventually did not pass any direction instead asking the Jharkhand government to explore the possibility of allowing at least a few devotees to visit the temple every day.“While we are not issuing any direction, we request the state government to find out the possibility and work out a mechanism for allowing darshan (of the temple deity) to the public. This shall apply to churches and mosques as well. Let efforts be made by the state government in this direction,” the court said.The Baidyanath temple assumes special significance during the festival of Shravani Mela which falls during July- August when devotees throng the temple carrying water from the river Ganga to offer it to the deity at Baidyanath temple. Dubey, who represents the Godda constituency of Jharkhand in the Lok Sabha, had initially approached the Jharkhand high court seeking permission to open the two temples for devotees citing similar intervention by the Supreme Court in the Puri Jagannath Rath Yatra in June.The high court, however, dismissed his plea on July 3 stating that allowing public to congregate for the festival could seriously impact the Covid-19 situation in the state.“No such direction for Shravani Mela will be appropriate to be passed taking into consideration the spread of threat of Covid-19 virus which according to us, if allowed, may cause great danger of widespread of infection of the virus,” the high court said.Dubey then approached the Supreme Court on July 8.During the hearing on Friday, senior counsel Salman Khurshid and additional advocate general Tapesh Kumar Singh, appearing for Jharkhand, told the court that the state has arranged for online darshan of the temple and argued against opening the temple to for the people.“The state is going through the Covid-19 crisis. Serum testing is happening now and depending on the results, lockdown might be imposed,” Khurshid said.Tapesh Kumar Singh said that the lanes leading up to the temple are very narrow and it might not be possible to ensure social distancing between people if the temple is thrown open to devotees.The bench, however, said that the state should have made an effort to allow at least a few hundred devotees on a daily basis.“Is it the same for churches, mosques. It is Eid, are mosques open? Why can’t it be permitted adhering to social distancing,” Justice Mishra asked Khurshid.“No, it will become difficult with overcrowding,” Khurshid replied.The petitioner’s counsel, Samir Malik pointed out that though the Baidyanath temple is not open to public around 30,000 pandas (pilgrimage priests) are allowed inside the temple.The state government said that only a limited number of pandas are allowed inside the sanctum sanctorum of the temple though there is no restriction on them in the temple premises.“We are alarmed by this,” the court noted while ordering the state to make arrangements to avoid entry of large number of pandas so as to avert a spurt in Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-bats-for-opening-temples-churches-mosques-during-unlock-phases/story-ylTWf89oA9WJbXhCDAGY4I.html

The man expressed happiness at being a “part of an exercise being carried out to help mankind.” “I wanted to be a part of this. I told my family members about my decision. They were worried about the adverse side-effects (if any). I managed to convince them,” he said. “As I walked into the room, I was asked to sit on the bed by the team waiting for me. I was praying that this vaccine works. It (vaccine) is essential to bring people out of despair and defeat this virus,” he added. Dr JS Kushwaha, chairman of the hospital, said the vaccine dose was injected in all the 22 volunteers in one hour. Their condition was constantly monitored for three hours against the specified two hours. “None of them complained of any problem nor did the medical team observe any adverse symptoms of the vaccine. I am extremely hopeful that this vaccine will work,” said Dr Kushwaha. The hospital plans to conduct the trials on 100 healthy volunteers in two phases. The first phase has 36 participants out of which 22 were given the vaccine on Friday. “We have given the volunteers our helpline number; they can speak to our in-house experts and share their experiences or problems if they have any,” he said. A team of eight experts, which a doctor from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) heads, would collect the blood samples of these 22 volunteers on August 13. The samples would be sent to an ICMR-recognised laboratory for anti-bodies’ test and data analysis. Another sample would be taken on August 27 for a similar test. All the healthy volunteers were cleared to undergo the trial after medical screening. Their RT-PCR and anti-bodies’ test reports came on Thursday and the plan to give them the vaccine was set in motion at a notice of 16 hours. The volunteers come from diverse backgrounds and five of them are women — three participated in the Friday trial. Apart from Kanpur and Gorakhpur hospitals, the other institutes selected for the clinical trial of Covaxin are located in Visakhapatnam, Rohtak, New Delhi, Patna, Belgaum, Nagpur, Kattankulathur, Hyderabad, Arya Nagar, and Goa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clinical-trial-of-covid-19-vaccine-covaxin-begins-in-kanpur-hospital-22-volunteers-get-dose/story-mxurdY9yS7VmbVHSqD33zI.html
31-07-2020||India||‘Next up is Pakistan’: BJP as Rajasthan CM Gehlot, MLAs move to Jaisalmer||Taking a swipe at Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot now moving his MLAs to Jaisalmer, the BJP state chief Satish Poonia said at this rate the legislators will soon reach Pakistan. The MLAs, who had been camping in a hotel on the Jaipur-Delhi highway since July 13, arrived at the Jaipur airport amid tight security. Five chartered flights ferried them to Jaisalmer, some 550km from state capital Jaipur. CM Gehlot, facing rebellion from Sachin Pilot and 18 Congress MLAs, alleged poaching attempts by the BJP as reason to move his lawmakers to a new destination.“The government needs to be saved as you can see the way the Centre and its departments (I-T and ED) are after us. The pressure will be less there (Jaisalmer). I and most of the ministers will stay here and the rest will keep coming. There will be no compromise in governance,” CM Gehlot told reporters before boarding the flight to Jaisalmer.The CM said since the governor announced assembly session dates, the MLAs and their family members have been receiving calls. “Even threatening calls are being made. What will happen to a country where horse trading is done at such a level?” asked CM Gehlot.Hitting out at home minister Amit Shah, the CM said, “I take name of (Amit) Shah again and again as he was at the forefront (of toppling the governments) in Goa, Manipur, Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh and Goa. What has happened to Amit Shah? Day or night…awake or sleeping, he only thinks how to topple opposition governments. If the elected government will be toppled in such a manner, then how will democracy be saved?”According to Jaipur airport officials, the planes were hired from India Fly Safe Aviation Pvt Ltd and Himalayaputra Aviation Pvt. Ltd. A total of five charter planes --- three in afternoon and two in evening (carrying the CM) took around 100 MLAs to Jaisalmer. Jaisalmer superintendent of police Ajay Singh escorted the legislators to Hotel Suryagarh, located about 20 km from the city on the Jaisalmer-Sam highway. Heavy security has been deployed in and around the hotel. BJP state chief Satish Poonia questioned where will the CM move them next? “Pakistan is ahead now. The CM talks high of democracy and constitution, but if there is unity and no fear then why do this. The CM should run the government from secretariat and not from Fairmont hotel,” said Poonia. The government, Poonia added, will not be able to face the opposition in the assembly this time. “The situation of Congress in Rajasthan is self destructive. The CM talks of democracy but is acting dictatorial and there is no governance,” he said.Defending the government, transport minister Pratap Singh said the MLAs were moved to Jaisalmer so that they can remain united. “The chief minister’s strategy is that not a single MLA is poached,” he said. The minister said shifting was part of their strategy. “Work of people will not suffer,” he assured. The hotel, built with Jaisalmer’s famous yellow limestone and shaped with high ‘parkota’-style walls, has 70 rooms and all of them are booked for MLAs. Suryagarh has been the venue of shooting of TV serials and films. The hotel has hosted many celebrity weddings, said Manoj Choudhary, a Jaisalmer-based travel agent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/next-up-is-pakistan-bjp-as-rajasthan-cm-gehlot-mlas-move-to-jaisalmer/story-AGuNDQQPqeKRlAzIH5p4TN.html

31-07-2020||India||Construction of Ram temple cultural nationalism: RSS leader||The construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya should not be limited to religious symbolism, but should be seen as a form of cultural renaissance and nationalism, said the joint general secretary of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Dattatreya Hosabale on Friday. The RSS leader added that the Ram temple is necessary for the cultural nationalism of the country, which was engulfed by an “English mindset”. He said it should have been done soon after Independence, just as the reconstruction of the Somnath Temple in Gujarat was undertaken.Ahead of the August 5 groundbreaking ceremony to mark the beginning of the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, which will be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the RSS leader said the construction of a temple in Ayodhya is associated with the rich culture of India and the government also has certain cultural responsibilities.

Being people’s representative, the government also has cultural responsibility of getting the Ram temple constructed as per the Supreme Court’s order.”He said those who oppose its construction often do it under the pretext of secularism, but know nothing about it.

He asked if the same argument be used to justify the British rule over India or apartheid that existed in Europe for centuries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/construction-of-ram-temple-cultural-nationalism-rss-leader/story-DaP2pTbOiSNp11iHuhwN5L.html

A substantial part of the loan money was transferred by AHPL to several companies and individuals on the pretext of payment of running bills and advance for supply of material/work executed,” ED said in a statement on Friday.“The employees of Ambience Group and the associates of Raj Singh Gehlot were made the Directors/Proprietors of these companies and Raj Singh Gehlot was the ‘authorized signatory’ in many of these companies. However, no material was supplied and no work was executed and almost the entire amount was immediately routed back to the entities owned by Raj Singh & Sons HUF and his brother’s son. Money was further siphoned off through multiple layers in a complex web of group entities,” ED added.When contacted, Raj Singh Gehlot’s son Aman Gehlot, who runs AHPL, refused to comment.The Leela Ambience hotel in east Delhi is a 480 room five-star property spread over an area of 20000 sq metres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-raids-owners-of-realty-firm-ambience-group-in-money-laundering-probe/story-exM1lnucHI6CiFU7fnMQgO.html

The LJP has said that the coronavirus pandemic has already acquired dangerous proportions and experts believe that it is likely to be more severe by October-November, as it argued that the priority now should be saving people’s lives and not holding the elections. The LJP’s stand on the elections is opposite to that of the JD(U), which also is a BJP ally, as the Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led party has spoken in favour of holding them on time and has been holding organisational meetings in preparation.  The BJP has maintained that any decision on the poll schedule is the EC’s prerogative, while the main opposition RJD has in past called for postponing the elections, citing the coronavirus threat. The EC has sought views of all parties on the elections. The LJP said endangering lives of a big population would be absolutely “improper” for holding the elections and noted that over 35, 000 people in the country, including 280 in Bihar, have died of Covid-19 so far. “Holding the polls in such circumstances will amount to deliberately pushing people towards death,” it told the EC. A big part of Bihar is also severely affected by floods, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ljp-asks-ec-to-not-hold-bihar-elections-in-oct-nov-says-polls-in-covid-19-pandemic-will-endanger-lives/story-SyyLiZHFFYTCUnrNJX92eJ.html
31-07-2020||India||China-Australia envoys spar on Twitter over Beijing’s action in South China Sea||The Chinese and Australian envoys to India had a terse exchange on Twitter on Friday on China’s actions in the South China Sea and elsewhere, with the latter saying Beijing should refrain from actions that “unilaterally alter the status quo”. Sun Weidong, the Chinese envoy, objected to remarks made by the Australian high commissioner, Barry O’Farrell, regarding the situation in the South China Sea by saying in a tweet that they were made “disregarding facts”. “Noted remarks by Australian HC to India on #SouthChinaSea disregarding facts. #China’s territorial sovereignty & maritime rights & interests are in conformity [with] int’l law incl UNCLOS [United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]. It’s clear who safeguard peace & stability & who destabilize & provoke escalation in the region,” Sun tweeted. A short while later, O’Farrell responded in a tweet: “Thank you @China_Amb_India. I would hope then you follow the 2016 South China Sea Arbitral Award which is final and binding under international law, and also generally refrain from actions that unilaterally alter the status quo.” Also read: US backs ASEAN on South China Sea, challenges China’s predatory world viewO’Farrell was referring to the verdict by the arbitral tribunal in the Philippines’ case against China’s activities in the South China Sea. The tribunal ruled overwhelmingly in favour of the Philippines and concluded that China’s territorial claims were unlawful. China didn’t accept the verdict. China’s claims in the South China Sea have been challenged by several countries, including the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan. Sun’s tweet was a response to remarks by O’Farrell in a statement issued by the Australian mission after his meeting with external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Thursday. O’Farrell backed India’s position on the border standoff with China, saying Australia opposed attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) as this could increase the risk of instability. The statement said Australia continues to be concerned by China’s actions in the South China Sea, which are “destabilising and could provoke escalation”. On July 23, Australia had lodged a note with the UN Secretary General refuting China’s “unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea”. Also read: Amid rising tension with US, China holds live-fire drills near South China SeaWhile Sun didn’t respond to O’Farrell’s comments on the border standoff, he took exception to the references to the South China Sea. The Chinese envoy also faced criticism from former Indian diplomats and military officials for his comments during a webinar on India-China relations held on Thursday. During the webinar, Sun sought to blame India for both the border standoff and the June 15 clash at Galwan Valley that resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and unspecified Chinese casualties. He also sought to imply that India’s position on interpreting the LAC could lead to new disputes, and that this was one of the reasons why the process for clarifying the disputed had stalled since 2002. Responding to these remarks, former army chief Gen VP Malik tweeted: “By his statement yesterday, #Ambassador Sun Weidong of China has virtually ended any possible progress in LAC talks between military commanders.” Former Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, described the Chinese envoy’s address at the webinar as a “classic dialogue of the deaf”. Bhatia added: “He talks at, not to, us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-australia-envoys-spar-on-twitter-over-beijing-s-action-in-south-china-sea/story-EZ7MuR6Kx4QE8IvfF7tN4I.html
31-07-2020||India||Kerala tweaks Covid-19 protocol as cases increase||As coronavirus cases is increasing sharply, Kerala has tweaked its Covid-19 protocol to ease the load in hospitals. The state reported 1,310 cases on Friday, highest single-day number since the outbreak began in January. Now asymptomatic patents can remain in quarantine in their homes and telemedicine facility will be extended to them, said a statement from the health ministry. This will be first experimented in the state capital Thiruvananthapuram which has maximum active cases in the state. Those who are going in home quarantine need to have a separate room with an attached toilet, it said. But in the worst-affected fishing hamlets authorities are finding difficult as most of their dwellings have one or two rooms with a common toilet. Harried officials have sought the help of local parish to tide over the situation. Earlier once a person was tested positive he will be rushed to the hospital. With the latest move, health authorities can lower the case load in hospitals. At least 38 inmates of a care home managed by the Missionaries of Charity were tested positive on Friday. Inmates were tested positive after a nun was infected. Since most of the inmates were elderly the reverse quarantine, a process to isolate elderly and people with co-morbid conditions from others to avoid infection, was in place here but still many got infected worrying health officials. Meanwhile state health director Dr L Saritha’s order asking all hospitals to reserve three rooms for VIPs has kicked off a controversy. There are 29 Covid-19 exclusive hospitals in the state. Health workers unions and others have criticised the move to reserve hospital rooms for VIPs in pandemic times and they asked the Left Front government to shed VIP culture in trying times. With 1,310 Covid-19 cases, total tally went up to 23, 162 in the state, out of this 13,027 have recovered and 10,495 are active cases. The state capital remained worst affected with 320 new cases. What is really worrying is that there is big spurt in locally transmitted cases, out of 1,310 cases, 1,162 are infected locally. With three more casualties, the death toll went up to 75 in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-tweaks-covid-19-protocol-as-cases-increase/story-ENRAn2nsZYpKLhdiTMwHLM.html

Gadkari inaugurated the long-awaited bridge through video conferencing from New Delhi, while chief minister Nitish Kumar, deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi and state road construction department minister Nand Kishore Yadav joined the proceedings from Patna. The opening of one of the two flanks of the bridge, connecting Patna with Hajipur, assumes considerable significance before the impending assembly elections. Roads, power and potable water to every household are the main issues, which the ruling JD(U)-led NDA dispensation is banking on for return to power in the state.Also Read: 1,11,000 laddoos being prepared in Ayodhya for foundation ceremonyGadkari, who also holds the shipping portfolio, said the waterways through Ganga would revolutionise the economy of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. “While the waterway from Varanasi to Haldia through river Ganga is almost complete, a Rs 12,000 crore proposal to develop waterways connecting Delhi to Prayagraraj via Mathura, Agra and Itawa has been submitted to the World Bank,” said the minister, adding that once it is finished, Delhi could be connected through waterways from the rest of the world. The minister said that dredging of Ganga up to Bangladesh has been completed. “Forty river ports, including one at Varanasi, Sahebganj and Patna, are being built along the river. We have carried out dredging in Hooghly at the cost of Rs 250 crore to ensure ships movement to the international port in the Bay of Bengal,” said the minister, adding that litchi and other micro, medium and small enterprises products from Bihar can be transported to other countries through waterways. Also Read: Ram temple to be grander than planned earlier: ArchitectUnderlining the need for holistic development of Bihar, the Union minister urged Bihar CM Nitish Kumar to emphasize on development of industrial clusters along the roads. He said he was working on a plan to increase the turnover of village industries to Rs 5 lakh crore from the current Rs 88,000 crore in the next two years.“Handicrafts and handlooms could be the thrust areas to work on in Bihar. Proposals to develop cottage industries in Bihar are always welcome,” said Gadkari, adding that the fund would not be any issue for development of road and cottage industries in the state. The minister also listed various bridge projects sanctioned in the state and said work on a four-lane bridge parallel to the MG Setu would begin in the next couple of months. CM Nitish Kumar urged Gadkari to build a direct road between Buxar and Varanasi, as people have to make a detour to get to an important religious and trade centre in UP.He also requested the minister to widen some of the busy stretches of National Highways, including from Mokama to Munger, Barauni to Khagaria and NH 77 from Muzaffapur to Nepal border, which is likely to see substantially increased traffic after construction of various bridges on Ganga in the coming years.The CM also urged Gadkari to arrange for additional funds for the MSME sector in Bihar while terming the existing allocation of Rs 25,000 crore as too little, compared to the population density of the state.Officials said that reconstruction of eastern flank of the bridge would start in the next couple of months. The superstructure of the bridge, which was originally built in the eighties on cantilever technology, has been replaced with superstructure made of steel trusses. Inaugurated as the longest bridge on the river in India by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi Setu went into repair mode in 1999 and it remained so till 2016, until the Central government approved its reconstruction plan.About Rs 250 crore is said to have been spent on its repair as against the original estimated construction cost of Rs 87 crore. Union ministers Ram Vilas Paswan, who represents Hajipur constituency in Lok Sabha, and Patna MP Ravi Shankar Prasad, also attended the function through video conferencing. RCD minister Nand Kishore Yadav and additional chief secretary, RCD, Amrit Lal Meena were also present at the programme, besides almost all local MPs and MLAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gadkari-inaugurates-rebuilt-mg-setu-promises-to-catapult-bihar-up-economy-through-waterways/story-dVm8eImzFftzA8BJhFcS2N.html

The notices were issued by on behalf of Karnataka BJP’s general secretary N Ravi Kumar by his lawyers. “The allegations made by you without any basis or material has also reflected badly upon all the members of the party who have strived hard in building the party and the government,” the notice read.This it said amounted to slander and demanded that the allegations be withdrawn and an unconditional apology be tendered in the identical notices to the two Congress leaders alleged. Ravi Kumar alleged that wild allegations are being made without any material proof and attributed these to an internal game of one-upmanship in the Congress party.“Even the numbers they mention vary wildly. First they said Rs 1,000 crore, then Rs 2,220 crore and later Rs 2,000 crore. The allegations are being made to just harass officials so that they are frightened and don’t make any purchases due to fears of wrong allegations. The government is ready to lay all documents on the floor of the house. However, we will not tolerate baseless allegations against our party and leaders,” Ravi Kumar added.The Congress leaders have been alleging that the equipment purchased are sub-standard, that money has been paid to suppliers without the goods being received and that the goods have been purchased at above-market rates.Reacting to the notice in Mangalore, where he is currently travelling and meeting party leaders, KPCC President Shivakumar said that his party was ready to furnish all documents ‘proving’ corruption if the government was ready to order a judicial enquiry into the whole purchases by a sitting judge of the High Court.“If the allegations are baseless they can file a case against me and hang me,” Shivakumar retorted even as he repeated charges of looting in the name of Covid-19 care by the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hang-me-if-covid-19-scam-allegations-are-baseless-dk-shivakumar-on-bjp-s-legal-notice/story-U8Ke20hFraLzERE6foGhqM.html

The train, which reached the station at 2 pm, left for Thiruvananthapuram an hour later, he said. Ernakulam district authorities have identified all his co-passengers in the D-3 coach as his primary contacts.They have been asked to go into home quarantine, officials said. The man, who boarded the train from Kozhikode, came to know that he was a carrier of the virus when he got a call from Kozhikode medical authorities who tested his swabs taken earlier following his primary contact with a Covid-19 patient, officials said.The Kozhikode district medical authorities immediately alerted their counterparts and railway officials when the man informed them that the Thiruvananthapuram-bound Jan Shatabdi Express has already reached Thrissur. But by the time the train had left Thrissur. Health authorities in Ernakulam district and railway officials, who were alerted, made all preparations to handle the situation, they said.

Governor Biswabhushan Harichandan on Friday gave his nod to the two bills – AP Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Bill, 2020 aimed at creating the three capital cities for the state and the AP Capital Region Development Authority (Repeal) Bill, 2020, seeking to abolish the APCRDA formed in December 2014 to develop Amaravati as the state capital. The two bills were passed for a second time by the state legislative assembly on June 16, but were stalled in the state legislative council, which was adjourned sine die without discussing them. Since the council had not taken any decision within one month, the bills were deemed to have been passed and were sent to the Governor for his approval on July 18. Governor Harichandan, who had several rounds of talks with legal experts, finally gave his assent on Friday, paving the way for the formation of the three capitals for Andhra Pradesh. “Once the state government notifies the approved bills in the state gazette, they will become acts and Amaravati will cease to be the capital city of Andhra Pradesh,” an official in the chief minister’s office said. The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) has been arguing that the fresh bills pertaining to the capital are legally invalid, as the two bills introduced by the state government in the state legislative council in January had been referred to the select committee. Former finance minister and senior Telugu Desam Party leader Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said the two fresh bills had no legal sanctity, because the earlier bills had already been pending study by the select committee and the government had given an undertaking to that extent in the high court. “Though the constitution of select committees could not take place due to bureaucratic hurdles, the process is still on. So, the reintroduction of the same bills again in the state legislature in June cannot be legally tenable,” Ramakrishnudu said. The state high court has been hearing a batch of petitions filed by the farmers of Amaravati, opposing the trifurcation of the capital and abolition of APCRDA. The next hearing is scheduled for August 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-to-get-3-new-capital-cities-as-governor-approves-two-controversial-bills/story-yjiWDqyvDMeYVwOiHTs7IK.html
31-07-2020||India||Only 0.28% of India’s Covid-19 cases on ventilator: Harsh Vardhan||India is reporting less severe coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, said Union health minister Harsh Vardhan during the 19th group of ministers’ (GoM) meeting held on Friday, as only 0.28% of patients are being currently on ventilator support across the country. “Out of the total active cases, only 0.28% of patients are on ventilator support, 1.61% patients on intensive care unit (ICU) support, and 2.32% are on oxygen support,” the minister said. India’s case recovery rate is also improving steadily, and with over one million recoveries the current national recovery rate is 64.54%, he cited. Delhi has recorded the highest recovery rate at 89.08%, followed by Haryana (79.82%). Karnataka has the lowest recovery rate at 39.36%. “…this shows that the active cases under medical supervision are 33.27%, or approximately one-third of total Covid-19 positive cases. India’s case fatality rate (CFR) is also progressively reducing and currently stands at 2.18%, one of the lowest globally,” said the health minister. The government aims to reduce the CFR further and bring down the national average to 1% or below. The government is laying emphasis on reducing mortality in high-case load districts/ cities, and cities showing recent upsurge such as Pune, Thane, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad, etc. The GoM also reviewed the distribution of confirmed Covid-19 cases along with locality and active cases in the containment zones across rural and urban India. It has been found that the maximum caseload, which was about 80% of the cases, is restricted to 50 out of about 740 districts in the country. In moderate caseload districts/cities, the efforts are on to focus on preventing spill-over from the high-burden areas; limiting local spread; early identification of cases; strengthening contact tracing with the use of technology; and community involvement. In low-burden districts, the efforts are aimed at preventing infection among the population from other areas; strengthening influenza-like illness (ILI)/severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) surveillance and targeted testing; rigorous contact tracing with targets to be set by the local administration such as 15-20 contacts for every Covid-19 patient and prior identification of the high-risk population. “This three-pronged strategy will help in controlling the disease spread. However, our main concern should be protecting the areas, where no Covid-19 cases are being reported, and also ensuring there is no increase in caseload in low disease-burden areas. The key is to strengthen community engagement, as it will help in sending the message across effectively,” said Jugal Kishore, head, community medicine, Safdarjung Hospital. On the rapidly expanding testing capacity of India, Harsh Vardhan highlighted that to date, through a network of 1,331 laboratories, including 911 and 420 government-run and private ones, respectively, a record 6,42,588 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours. The country has carried out over 10.8 million tests since the viral outbreak was first reported. “The more you test, the better it will in controlling the disease transmission, as you would be picking up cases early who would otherwise be roaming within the community and exposing the vulnerable population to the virus,” says Dr. T Jacob John, former head, virology department, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu. The domestic production capacities of various sectors involved in Covid-19 management such as for manufacturing personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, masks, ventilators, and drugs such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have also been ramped up over the past three months. In terms of healthcare logistics, cumulatively 268.25 lakh N-95 masks, 120.40 lakh PPEs, and 1083.77 lakh HCQ tablets have been distributed to all states and Central institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-0-28-of-india-s-covid-19-cases-on-ventilator-harsh-vardhan/story-2xaFWIx3fhB9tw1pSmAh2J.html

If refused, such instances must be reported. I will look into it,” she said.Sitharaman’s statement follows Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal on Wednesday to bankers to fund bankable projects and MSMEs without fear. He promised that the government will back their decisions.Addressing another major area of concern, the finance minister said that the government is working with the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) for restructuring of loans due to the Covid-19 impact on businesses. This is one of the key demands made by the industry bodies.“The focus is on restructuring. Finance ministry is actively engaged with RBI on this. In principle, the idea that there may be a restructuring required, is well taken,” she said admitting there was a need to consider restructuring in the present circumstances.On a related issue, Sitharaman said that her ministry is working with RBI on the demand of the hospitality sector for extension of moratorium, or restructuring. Hospitality sector is one of the worst hit during the current crisis and the finance minister said she “fully understand the requirements of the hospitality sector on extension of the moratorium, or restructuring”.The important interventions were announced by the finance minister during FICCI’s national executive committee meeting.She also confirmed that work is going on creating a development finance institution to deal with the emerging credit requirements of the industry.“What shape it will take, we will know shortly,” Sitharaman said.On the issue of reduction in GST rates on the healthcare and other products, she said this fell in the domain of the GST council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirmala-sithraman-warns-banks-against-refusing-credit-to-msmes-under-emergency-credit-facility/story-n2Em7SZI6R4YBUTK7Ad5EJ.html
31-07-2020||India||Man linked to Rajasthan horse-trading tapes refuses to give voice sample||Sanjay Jain, whose name had surfaced in an audio recording about horse trading of legislators to topple the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government in Rajasthan, refused to give his voice samples on Friday despite court orders for the same. He alleged that the agency taking samples can’t be trusted. “After an application was filed by the special operations group (SOG) on July 18, the metro magistrate court number 2 had given permission to conduct the voice spectography test of Jain. Today, when the accused was asked to give his sample, his counsel refused after which the court remarked that an inference may be drawn against Jain during trial,” said Liyakat Khan, public prosecutor.Khan added that everybody is bound to obey the orders of the court, adding that in future the accused cannot plead that it’s not his voice.Jain’s counsel, advocate Vivek Bajwa, said his client does not trust the agency which is investigating the case. “We know the fact that as per the Evidence Act not giving the statement will go against us. We don’t trust the agency investigating the case and we also doubt that if my client had given the voice samples then the FSL report could have been tampered on the orders of the government. How can we trust the politicians,” said Bajwa.Jain’s counsel had also filed a bail application which would be heard by the local court on August 4.Legal expert Akhil Choudhary pointed to a 2019 Supreme Court judgment that said the fundamental right to privacy cannot be construed as absolute and must bow down to compelling public interest.“The SC bench held that giving a voice sample to an investigating agency was neither a violation of the fundamental right nor it amounts to furnishing of evidence against oneself. It reasoned that a voice sample was given for the reason of comparison with other voices in order to see if they matched and were of the same person. A voice sample by itself is not incriminating evidence,” added Choudhary.He further said that in the case at hand, the trial court could have directed the investigation team to obtain voice samples of the accused despite the accused not inclined to give his samples. “The trial court has rightly mentioned in its order that not giving a voice sample can go against him during the trial stage,” Choudhary said.Meanwhile, the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) on Friday also filed an application in the local court seeking approval for questioning of Jain.Jain was called for questioning on July 17 after the SOG registered a case on the complaint by chief whip Mahesh Joshi. The Congress filed two cases on the basis of audiotapes. In one, it named Sanjay Jain, Gajendra Singh and Congress MLA Bhanwarlal Sharma as people hatching conspiracy against the government; the second case is against unnamed accused.The SOG arrested Jain on July 17.The SOG is investigating three cases of sedition and conspiracy to pull down the Gehlot government.Also, on the complaint by Congress, a case was also registered at the ACB against Jain, Sharma and Singh under section 7 (public servant accepts or attempts to take bribe) and 7A(public servant obtaining undue advantage) of Prevention of Corruption Act.Jain, who belongs to Loonkaransar town in Rajasthan’s Bikaner district, is a power broker and is perceived to be close to both Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders.A former block president of the Indian Youth Congress, the party has accused Jain of being a BJP leader. The BJP claims Jain is still a Congress member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-linked-to-rajasthan-horse-trading-tapes-refuses-to-give-voice-sample/story-q59rwnPwIyiPRVUy8wF2MJ.html
31-07-2020||India||Normal rain likely in August and September, forecasts IMD||India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast normal rainfall at 104% of the long-period average (LPA) with a model error of +/-8% in the second half of monsoon season in August and September.As on Friday (July 31), the country has received normal rain at 101% of LPA or 1% excess rain with 12% excess over the north-east and east India; 19 deficiency over northwest India; 3% deficiency over central India and 13% excess over the southern peninsula.Rainfall in August is likely to be 97% of LPA with an error margin of +/-9%, which is also in the normal category. The entire monsoon season -- June to September -- rainfall is also likely to be in the normal range (96% -104% of LPA) as was the forecast on June 1, IMD said on Friday.“This is only a general picture. It doesn’t give day-to-day or weekly variations, which can also be significant. We have to remember that this is also not mentioning the distribution of rainfall,” said K Sathi Devi, head, National Weather Forecasting Centre (NWFC).In June, the country received 17.6% excess rains, but in July there was a 9.8% deficiency. Rains in the core monsoon zone are usually dominant in July, but this time around, central and northwest India has recorded a 22% and 26.2% deficiency, respectively.“There were no low-pressure systems this July. In spite of that, we did get rain and in the June-July period, we have recorded normal rains over the country,” said Devi.IMD considers rainfall between 96% and 104% of LPA as normal.IMD’s forecast on June 1 said that monsoon this year is likely to be normal at 102% of the LPA with a model error of 4% (+/-).LPA is the averages of rainfall received over a 50-year period between 1951 and 2001.“At present, the sea surface temperatures (SSTs), as well as the atmospheric conditions over the equatorial Pacific Ocean, indicate” cold El Nino neutral conditions,” according to IMD’s long-range forecasting (LRF) for the second half of the monsoon.The latest forecasts and models indicate that SSTs over the region are likely to cool further.However, ENSO neutral conditions are likely to continue during the remaining part of the monsoon season.In June, IMD had said there is an enhanced probability for the development of weak La Niña conditions after the monsoon season, which begins in June and runs until end-September.La Niña is characterised by unusually cold ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific and is associated with normal or above normal rain over the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/normal-rain-likely-in-august-and-september-forecasts-imd/story-yLQZQFhNarzjTdP7yPq3VJ.html
31-07-2020||India||Long-lasting toxicity for humans, animals and birds at Baghjan oil spill region: Wildlife Institute||The environmental and health impact in the ongoing oil and gas spill due to a blowout in Upper Assam’s Baghjan gasfield will be a long-drawn affair, according to the Wildlife Institute of India’s (WII) 178-page report submitted recently to the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC).WII has said that the highest concentration of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a toxic compound, in fish samples from Maguri Motapung wetland, which is located near the blowout site, was found to be 10-to 100-fold higher than any concentrations reported from India or other parts of the world.“The impact is significant and will have long-term effects, as many of these pollutants will leach into the ground and contaminate groundwater. Long term restorative efforts are needed for cleaning up these pollutants,” the report has said. The burnt-out area is mapped as 65-70 hectares, which include crop fields, grasslands, and swamps.There was a visible oil spill -- oil and sediment -- on June 16 in the downstream of the well, it has said.The Gangetic Dolphin encounters, which were earlier found abundantly in the Brahmaputra tributaries such as Lohit and Dibru and also in Maguri Motapung wetland, have decreased significantly after the blowout.A dolphin was found dead from poisoning from the oil spill.Perhaps, due to the oil spill and intense noise from the blowout, bird species richness has seen an overwhelming decline in grasslands and wetland by 59% and 85%, respectively, the report has said.Fish species have also declined in wetland and river tributaries, where dissolved oxygen level has fallen due to the oil spill.The loud noise due to the explosion can be heard in a radius of 12 kilometres and beyond, making the surroundings extremely unhealthy for humans, animals, and birds.The report has underlined that the wetland and surrounding lowland forests are unique and as a result, extremely vulnerable to more oil spill disasters.The Brahmaputra and the Gangetic floodplain landscape is unique in its morphology and fragility, and is responsible for shaping the unique community of plants and animals … the landscape (in Baghjan) is fragile and is engineered by flooding. The dynamic nature of wetland creates mosaics of habitat which is in perpetual flux.In India as well as the world over, there are only a handful of Protected Areas (PAs), where this unique biodiversity is surviving, and among them, Dibru-Saikhowa National Park (DSNP) and Kaziranga Orang National Park top the list, the report has stated and added that oil wells in and around DSNP would be detrimental to the unique ecosystem.The landscape is also extremely vulnerable to earthquakes and occasionally massive tremors.The expert appraisal committee of the MoEFCC in meetings held between 30 and January 1 had recommended environmental clearance for drilling and testing of hydrocarbons at seven locations inside and under the DSNP.“’The potential of oil blowout and oil spill-like disaster is a reality. Such oil wells in the vicinity of DSNP and important bird area complex (DSNP, Bherjan Wildlife Sanctuary, Padumani Wildlife Sanctuary, and Borajan Wildlife Sanctuary, Important Bird Areas (IBA) Poba Reserve Forest, Kobo chapori, Amarpur chapori and Maguri and Motapung, Dihing-Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary) will be detrimental to the conservation value of this unique ecosystem,” the report has said while suggesting that the cumulative impact of existing gas wells would need to be assessed.The study, led by WII scientist Qamar Qureshi, has also recommended that the government initiates a long term study to monitor the long-term impact on the ecology of Maguri-Motapung wetland and DSNP as well as on the health and socio-economic conditions of local communities around the affected areas. Since the restoration of the area will be a long-term process, an appropriate committee should be formed to monitor and guide the process.“WII has submitted its voluminous report. We are trying to get more details and may go back to WII for it. We are sending all the findings to the Assam government to begin mitigation and restoration work. I understand that the situation is still grim there,” said Soumitra Dasgupta, additional director general (wildlife), MoEFCC.“We will need time to respond to WII’s findings. Since it is a technical report, we will also have to get it reviewed by our independent experts. Our focus is presently on controlling the well and resolving the blowout,” said Tridiv Hazarika, spokesperson, Oil India Limited (OIL).The gas well blowout took place on May 27 and the blaze followed on June 9, but the plugging exercise is yet to be over after two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/long-lasting-toxicity-for-humans-animals-and-birds-at-baghjan-oilspill-region-wildlife-institute/story-sY8pXpMnRz5wMPjPKeUJHJ.html

Modi’s questioning of Mumbai police comes amid growing calls for a CBI probe in the case and follows allegations by the actor’s family that the Mumbai police was more interested in framing big names in Bollywood.“Mumbai police is putting obstruction in the way of a fair investigation by Bihar police in #Sushant death case. BJP feels that CBI should take over this case,” Bihar deputy chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi tweeted on Friday.The differences over the ongoing probe in Sushant’s death is snowballing into a faceoff between the two states as Maharashtra government continues to back investigations by Mumbai police and has again rejected calls for a CBI probe.Also Read: Sushant Singh Rajput death: ED files money laundering case“Mumbai police are investigating the matter. Police will investigate on the basis of evidence, we expect that the probe will be completed as soon as possible and the police will reach a conclusion,” said state water resources minister Jayant Patil on demand of CBI inquiry in the case.The Bihar police team, which has alleged non-cooperation from Mumbai police in their parallel investigation into a case of abetment to suicide filed against actor Rhea Chakraborty, held a high-level meeting at Bihar DGP’s office in Patna on Friday.Rhea was Sushant’s live-in partner and has been accused along with six of her kin of abetment to suicide, withdrawing crores from Sushant’s bank account and harassing him mentally, by Sushant’s family.Sushant’s family had filed an FIR against Chakraborty in a Bihar police station a few days ago and has legally opposed attempts to transfer the case to Mumbai accusing the metropolis police of inaction and waylaying the probe into the 34-year old actor’s death by questioning film personalities and production houses, focusing on alleged nepotism as a possible cause of Sushant ending his own life in frustration. They have also pointed out that the Mumbai police have not registered even an FIR in the matter since June 14, when Sushant was found dead in his Bandra flat in Mumbai.Several Bihar politicians including Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, his son Chirag Paswan, have expressed apprehensions about the probe being conducted by Mumbai police and demanded a CBI probe into Sushant’s death.Also Read: Sushant Singh Rajput’s death must be probed by CBI: Ram Vilas Paswan joins chorusAccording to ANI, a letter petition has been filed in Patna High Court seeking the transfer of investigation into Rajput’s death from Bihar police to CBI.

Therefore a cautious and conservative approach is required,” said a source from the Lt Guv’s office. The person said that while the proposal to allow street hawkers to operate for longer hours from August 1 was approved, the proposal for opening of hotels and hospitality services and opening of weekly bazars were deferred for the time being. He added that it would be reviewed later.On Thursday, the Delhi government decided to allow hotels, hospitality services, street hawkers to operate and do away with the night curfew hours applicable between 10pm and 5am under the Centre’s Unlock 3 plan.The government intended to allow weekly bazars to operate for a week on a trial basis to check if social distancing norms are adhered to. An official order regarding the same was to come by Saturday. “These decisions are in continuation of several important decisions taken by CM Arvind Kejriwal in the past few days to ensure Delhi’s economy, which was impacted severely by the lockdown, gets back on track,” said a statement issued by the office of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday.Regarding hotels, the statement said, “Since hotels of Delhi are no longer linked to hospitals, Delhi government has also decided to allow normal functioning of hotels and hospitality services, as already permitted under Centre’s unlock guidelines.”The Delhi government had on Wednesday de-linked around 40 hotels and 77 banquet halls that were attached to different hospitals to boost the city’s Covid-19 bed capacity.However, even though the Centre has allowed gymnasiums and yoga centres to operate, the government is yet to take a call on it.The Union home ministry issued the plan, Unlock 3, on Wednesday after receiving feedback from states and in consultation with central ministries and departments to open up more activities outside containment zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/l-g-baijal-rejects-delhi-govt-s-move-to-open-hotels-have-weekly-bazars-on-trial-basis-in-unlock-3/story-DI0zWI3XJQjRSh4SOaWUBJ.html

31-07-2020||India||Jodhpur residential areas face landslide threat: Study||Geologists have warned that the residential colonies in and around the seven hills, including the 1.81-kilometre (km) peripheral area, surrounding the Masuria hill in Jodhpur, are under threat of landslides and should be declared landslide-prone zones. Masuria Hill experienced its first-ever landslide on October 4, 2019, which damaged significant geo-resources along with many houses, properties and also injured many people in Jodhpur’s Bank Colony. Landslides at Masuria Hill triggered panic among local residents because of the sudden and rapid fall of massive boulders, which portend for a natural disaster. Researchers at the Department of Geology of Jai Narain Vyas University (JNVU) and Suresh Gyan Vihar University in Jodhpur and Jaipur, respectively, who have tried to ascertain the cause of landslide in Masuria Hill, have found that 1.81-km peripheral area is susceptible to a similar natural disaster in the near future along with six other six hillocks that have identical rock disposition of the Umed Bhawan Formation (UBF). Masuria Hill is a popular attraction for both Jodhpur residents and tourists alike. Several residential colonies, including several of them built illegally, have sprung up in the foothills and are under threat from landslides in the near future, as the last October’s incident had shown. The study has revealed that the soft clay zone, primarily shale horizon, has been identified as failure plane and fall of massive boulders from the rigid sand zone had triggered the landslide. It also found that the two critical zones are spread along with the 1.81-km peripheral area surrounding Masuria Hill, which is located bang in the middle of Jodhpur city, making the adjoining areas prone to any such natural calamity in the near future. “We have identified some factors, which are primarily earthwork and construction of buildings; vibrations from machinery and traffic; blasting for breaking and removing rocks leads to disturbing the natural disposition of rock sequences of Masuria Hill, especially soft clay zone. The first landslide occurred when Jodhpur received 30% more rainfall in September 2019, which might have aggravated the liquefaction and erosion at Masuria Hill,” said Dr. CP Khichi, who is associated with the geology department of JNVU. He pointed out that three persons were killed and many were injured, when the landslide occurred at Jodhpur’s Uday Mandir area These two incidents do not augur well for the future, as Jodhpur braces for natural disasters. The residential areas around the seven hills such as Masuria Hill, Udai Mandir Hill, Kabir Nagar Hill, Pratap Nagar Hill, Mehrangarh Hill, Gol Nadi Hill along fort road, and Ganesh Bhakri Hill are most prone to landslides. Experts said that these areas need to be declared as a landslide-prone zone in a bid to save properties, human lives and significant geological resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jodhpur-residential-areas-face-landslide-threat-study/story-OnVso2FmmW0fiu7wLuDCVM.html

The 50 electronically sealed containers are safer than goods trains; faster and cheaper than transporting goods in trucks. The Sunday train carried fast moving consumer goods such as FMCG products likes soaps and shampoos, and textile fabric.According to diplomats based in Dhaka and New Delhi, container trains will not only help India’s export of essential commodities to Bangladesh, but also facilitate faster movement of Bangladeshi exports at significantly lower freight costs without the delays and overhead costs due to corruption and extortion rackets at the border that have seriously hurt movement of trucks at the Bengal border with Bangladesh.Indian officials said the importance of the breakthrough on Sunday, along with the proof of concept trans-shipment of goods to Tripura through the port of Chittagong in July, is that it underscores that the partnership between India and Bangladesh is at a level above that of any other country in south Asia.Relations between India and Bangladesh have been on an upswing after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina came back to power in 2009 and picked up pace after PM Narendra Modi was voted in 2014. The two leaders made history in 2015 when they signed the land swap pact during PM Modi’s maiden visit to Dhaka, resolving a 41-year-old land boundary dispute that had been a major irritant in bilateral ties.Also Read: India hands over 10 broad gauge locomotives to BangladeshSheikh Hasina also helped PM Modi to hold peace in the northeast by taking strong action against terrorists who would cross the border when Indian forces cracked down on them.During her visit to New Delhi last year, the two leaders spoke of scripting a ‘golden chapter’, or ‘Shonali Adhyaya’, in their partnership.Foreign ministers of the two countries echoed the sentiment at an event on Monday that saw India providing 10 broad gauge railway locomotives to Bangladesh. The gesture was in line with commitments on both sides to improve connectivity and infrastructure initiatives to boost trade and create new supply chains.Also Read: Focus on Bangladesh | HT EditorialOver the decade that Sheikh Hasina has been in power for three consecutive terms, Bangladesh’s GDP has recorded Asia’s highest growth rate of 8.2% in 2018-19, shrinking people living in extreme poverty to less than 9% and turning the country into a manufacturing hub of ready-made goods. Along the way, Sheikh Hasina’s determined push to trade and development helped ensure that its per capita income rose sharply, racing ahead of even Pakistan. Its debt per capita is half that for Pakistan.Sheikh Hasina has demonstrated to the region and the world how a country otherwise short of resources can ensure a better quality of life by just keeping its focus straight, said an Indian official, underlining how a country described as a “bottomless basket’ by Henry Kissinger in 1974 had made great strides.He dismissed reports that the Indian high commissioner couldn’t get an appointment to meet the foregn minister for months - this was interpreted to imply relations between the two countries were headed downhill - and pointed to Bangladesh foreign minister AK Abdul Momen’s “clear statement”.On Thursday, Momen had rubbished such claims, pointing that the high commissioner had sought an “appointment on July 22 and gave us ample time”. She will probably leave in late September or early October and wanted a meeting before that, the minister said.On reports that claimed Dhaka had preferred Chinese firms over Indian companies for the Sylhet Osmani Airport, Abdul Momen said the Chinese company had emerged as the lowest bidder during a tender process. “However, some newspapers say that we have given more benefits to China, which is completely absurd,” he added, according to the Dhaka Tribune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sheikh-hasina-at-helm-india-bangladesh-economic-cooperation-sets-a-new-milestone/story-auufS6006TbOmRepnTmNSI.html
31-07-2020||India||Attempt to plug blow out of Assam gas well fails as wagon falls over||The final attempt to plug the blowout at an Oil India Limited’s (OIL) natural gas well at Baghjan in Upper Assam’s Tinsukia district, which has been on fire since June 9, suffered a setback on Friday, when a wagon used in the process “toppled over”. Foreign experts and their Indian counterparts were attempting to place the blowout preventer (BOP) stack, weighing nearly 3 tonnes, on the wellhead, when the Athey Wagon, a type of hydraulic lift used to fight oil-field fires consisting of a track-mounted boom with a hook in one end, fell down. “BOP stack was hooked up with the Athey Wagon for placing on the wellhead. While the final capping operation was being attempted, the Athey Wagon toppled over at the last moment and the attempt did not succeed,” said a statement issued by OIL. It added that the reasons for the incident are being ascertained in a bid to undertake the next course of action. Installation of the BOP was the penultimate task needed to complete the operation. Once the BOP is installed, the process of ‘killing the well’ was to start immediately. That was to be done by injecting a ‘kill fluid’, a sludge-like specially prepared mud, into the well slowly to push the gas from it back to the reservoir. Earlier this week, OIL authorities had stated that the process would take two-three days and the operation would be over by Thursday (July 30). But Friday’s incident is expected to delay the process further. “Experts are looking at all issues right now. Operations to cap the well will resume on Saturday morning,” said Tridiv Hazarika, spokesperson, OIL. The gas well had witnessed a blowout -- an uncontrolled release of gas or oil -- during a workover operation, or maintenance work, to locate a new reservoir, on May 27. While efforts were underway to plug the blowout, the well caught fire on June 9, killing two firefighters. The fire has been burning ever since. Initially, OIL authorities had said that the blowout would be plugged in a month. Later, the deadline was extended to July 7. But delays due to floods, technical glitches, and burn injury of three foreign experts while attempting to douse the flames have led to several delays. Since the Baghjan well is located close to Dibru Saikhowa National Park (DNSP) and the ecologically-sensitive Maguri Motapung Wetland, there were fears of environmental damage to the area due to the blowout and the blaze. Several studies by different agencies are underway to measure the extent of damage in the ecologically-fragile surroundings. In June, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had ordered the formation of an expert committee to probe the blowout and subsequent fire and assess the damage caused to human life, wildlife, and the environment because of the industrial disaster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/attempt-to-plug-blow-out-of-assam-gas-well-fails-as-wagon-falls-over/story-epobiOvFBTTwgNWMQq8SoL.html

31-07-2020||India||Former J-K CM Mehbooba Mufti’s detention extended by 3 months under PSA||The Jammu and Kashmir administration on Friday extended the detention of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti by another three months under the stringent Public Safety Act.Mufti among others had been taken into preventive custody barely hours before the Centre revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir on August 5 last year. The state was subsequently divided into two union territories— Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.The detention order of the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister was scheduled to lapse on August 5, 2020. Mufti is the only politician currently, who is still detained under the PSA.She will continue to remain under detention for another three months at her official residence, which had earlier been declared a subsidiary jail, the order issued by the Home Department of the government said.A number of other prominent politicians, including two former chief ministers, Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah, have been released from custody. The political leaders were arrested last August, hours after the Centre proposed the revocation of Article 370, which granted special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, and proposed the bifurcation of the state into two union territories. Jammu and Kashmir People’s Conference leaders Sajjad Lone and Imran Ansari were also arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-j-k-cm-mehbooba-mufti-s-detention-extended-by-3-months/story-23POkX1p1dlWRTqZPHXSxK.html
31-07-2020||India||Sushant Singh Rajput death: ED files money laundering case||The Enforcement Directorate has filed a money laundering case in connection with the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.The case was filed on the basis of a First Information Report filed by the Bihar police, say officials. Sushant Singh’s father had alleged that there were unexplained transfers from his son’s bank account involving actor Rhea Chakraborty and others.The late actor’s father has accused Chakraborty, a budding TV and film actress, of having befriended his son in May 2019 with the intention of furthering her own career. The ED will probe allegations of alleged mishandling of Rajput’s money and his bank accounts. The agency will probe if anyone used Rajput’s income for money laundering and creating illegal assets, the officials said.Officials said Rhea Chakraborty and others named in the ED case are likely to be summoned next week. Legal experts said that an ED probe is different from the one conducted by the local police as according to normal criminal law, a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty, but under PMLA (prevention of money laundering act), a person is presumed guilty until he proves his innocence. Dr Sujay Kantawala, senior lawyer who specialises in PMLA cases, said: “When the Bihar police lodged the FIR, the provisions were of Indian Penal Code. Here you are presumed innocent and the burden of proof is on prosecution to prove the charge. However, when the ED comes into the picture, there is a reverse burden of proof. The ED has powers to trace the monies and confiscate properties wherever they want by way of issuing provisional attachment orders.” The statements recorded by witnesses under the PMLA, said Kantawala, are admissible in the court unlike statements recorded by police under section 161 of the CrPC (criminal procedure code). Kantawala further explained that the accused person is entitled to get a copy of the FIR registered by police or CBI, but the ED’s ECIR (equivalent to FIR) is not given to the accused.The 34-year-old actor, who had starred in films such as Chichhore, Kai Po Che and Kedarnath, was found dead at his Mumbai home on June 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-ed-files-money-laundering-case/story-yZzJxx3Ukc1cZlQ1t4po3I.html
31-07-2020||India||After Chinese apps and contractors, India puts restrictions on colour TV imports||India has now restricted imports of Chinese colour televisions to encourage domestic manufacturing after banning mobile applications and excluding firms from China from participating in public procurement tenders, two officials with direct knowledge of the matter said.The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), an arm of the commerce and industry, issued a notification on late Thursday evening amending the import policy of colour television (TV) from free to restricted category.“Import of colour TV is now in the restricted category, which would necessitate an importer to seek import license from the government. The main purpose of this move is to check influx of China TVs,” one of the officials said requesting anonymity. India has a Rs 15,000 crore TV industry and over 36% of that is imported primarily from China and South East Asia, he added.India has taken a series of actions against China after the violent brawl between Chinese and Indian soldiers on June 15 along the Line of Actual Control in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh. Twenty Indian Army personnel were killed that day.On June 29, the Narendra Modi government announced a ban on 59 mostly Chinese mobile applications such as TikTok, UC Browser and WeChat, citing security concerns. On July 23, it restricted public procurements by the bidders from countries that share a land border with it on the ground of national security.A second official said that some Chinese TV sets were routed through a third country with which India has a free trade agreement (FTA). “This move will also curb such illegal trade,” he said.Besides China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and Germany are major exporters of colour TVs.“Many such items enter Indian market taking advantage of ASEAN India FTA imports at reduced or zero duty, putting our domestic industry at a disadvantage. Such imports cannot be controlled through increased duty rates. Hence, the government is taking measures such as non-duty actions like import restrictions,” the first official cited above said. ASEAN FTA was signed during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime in 2009 with Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.India has created necessary infrastructure and made arrangements to produce electronic items in cost-effective manner under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-reliant India Imitative), and invite global manufacturers to set up units in India, the second official said.India’s production of electronics grew from $29 billion in 2014 to $70 billion in 2019.“Phased Manufacturing Programme (PMP) for TVs is underway and specified parts like open-cell, chips on films, Printed Circuit Boards Assembly (PCBA ) are exempted from duty. Hence, India is ready for a shift of manufacturing to India with cost-effective imports of essential parts,” the first official said.The officials said Thursday’s decision to restrict the influx of TV sets was taken after extensive consultations with the domestic industry that aims to promote ‘Make in India’, create jobs and provide goods at a comparable rate to the consumer.“As there is no ‘ban’ and only a ‘restriction’ being imposed, there is a possibility of such imports; however, with prior approval of the Directorate General of Foreign Trade,” Divakar Vijayasarathy, the founder and managing partner at consultancy firm DVS Advisors LLP, said. “The procedural aspects of acquiring this permit [licence]; however, would be tedious considering the stakes involved. There shall be transition provisions in place for import orders already being given or goods in transit,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-chinese-apps-and-contractors-india-puts-restrictions-on-colour-tv-imports/story-I9SrasQWRkF6TKzsSayliO.html
31-07-2020||India||ITBP inks deal with KVIC to procure swadeshi, khadi items for CAPF personnel||The Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) on Friday inked a deal with the KVIC to procure a variety of ‘swadeshi’ and ‘khadi’ goods for around 10 lakh personnel of the Central Armed Police Forces.The force will procure 1,200 quintals of mustard oil from the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) with “a total financial implication of over Rs 1.73 crore”, an ITBP spokesperson said.“A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the two sides on Friday. The aim is to increasingly procure ‘swadeshi’ or indigenously made products,” he said. The MoU was signed by KVIC Chairman Vinai Kumar Saxena and officials of the ITBP procurement wing in Delhi.  The ITBP, a mountain-warfare trained force for guarding the 3,488-km-longs Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China, is the first among the paramilitary or CAPFs to ink such a deal. The other Central Armed Police Forces are the CRPF, CISF, BSF and the SSB.Home Minister Amit Shah had declared few months ago that the CAPF canteens will only sell ‘swadeshi’ or indigenous products from June.Apart from mustard oil, the ITBP is also procuring durries (mats), towels and blankets from the suppliers empanelled with the KVIC.“Approximately 2.5 lakh durries will be procured by ITBP at a cost of Rs 17 crore. The force is the nodal agency for procurement of durries for all CAPFs,” the spokesperson said.The ITBP has also suggested that yoga kits, hospital bed sheets, ‘khadi’ uniform, pickels and some other items can be purchased for the CAPF jawans through KVIC, a senior official said.These items will also be sold to the personnel and their families through the CAPF canteens.These canteens, with a network of 1,700 stores, do an estimated business worth Rs 2,800 crore annually by selling their products to 50 lakh family members of about 10 lakh personnel of these forces tasked with a variety of internal security work apart from border guarding duties.The KVIC, according to its profile statement, is charged with the planning, promotion, organisation and implementation of programmes for the development of khadi and other village industries in the rural areas in coordination with other agencies engaged in rural development wherever necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/itbp-inks-deal-with-kvic-to-procure-swadeshi-khadi-items-for-capf-personnel/story-gz7TputCnd0ukuAZEWF0KP.html
31-07-2020||India||Ram temple to be grander than planned earlier: Architect||The proposed Ram temple in Ayodhya will be almost double the size of what was originally planned as its design was modified following the Supreme Court verdict last year, its architect said on Friday.The temple, to be constructed in Nagara style of architecture, will have five domes instead of two as envisaged earlier to accommodate more number of devotees, the architect said.According to him, the project is likely to be completed in the next three years once the work commences.The ‘bhoomi pujan’ (ground-breaking) ceremony of the temple in Ayodhya is scheduled to be held on August 5, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to attend, as told by the members of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra, a trust formed to oversee its construction.“The design of the temple was modified after the Supreme Court verdict. Now it will be almost double the size of what was originally planned,” architect Chandrakant Sompura, who has designed it, told PTI.“It will now have a shikhara (tower) over the sanctum sanctorum and five domes instead of the earlier plan of two domes. The height of the temple will also be more than what was in the previous plan,” he said.In November last year, the Supreme Court had paved the way for the construction of Ram temple by at the disputed site at Ayodhya, and directed the Centre to allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a “prominent” place in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh. Sompura, 77, who comes from a family of temple architects that have designed over 200 such structures, said that he was asked to prepare a design for the Ram temple by late leader of the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), Ashok Singhal, around 30 years ago.He said designing the Ram temple was an uphill task 30 years back, as he had to prepare drawings using his footsteps as the unit of measurement.“When I first visited the site in Ayodhya in 1990, nothing was allowed to be taken inside the premises due to security concerns, not even a measurement tape and I had to measure with my footsteps,” Sompura said. Based on his design of the temple, the VHP had started preparation for its construction in the 1990s by setting up a unit of carving of stones in Ayodhya, he said.“However, after the Supreme Court verdict in favour of construction at the Ramjamabhoomi site, the temple design was changed,” he said. “Now there will be five domes. It has two reasons- first, there is no dearth of land for the temple now and the second one is that after so much of publicity, we expect that a large number of devotees will visit the temple everyday and the size has been increased to accommodate them,” he said.According to Sompura, his son Ashish had presented this revised plan before the trust in June, which was approved. Ashish Sompura will look after the construction of the temple, although his father will have the final say on it. The septuagenarian architect said that he has designed many temples, but the Ayodhya Ram temple project is special to him just as the Somnath temple was for his grandfather Prabhashankar Sompura, who designed and oversaw its reconstruction.“This project is special as it is being built at the birthplace of Lord Ram. We have to ensure that it should be the best. With five domes, which is rare, it will set an example. It will be developed as the best place of worship in terms of temple architecture,” he said.“The temple is likely to be completed in next three years after its work begins,” he added.Sompura said his family designs temples in Nagara style and the structure in Ayodhya will also be built in that style of North Indian temple architecture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-temple-to-be-grander-than-planned-earlier-architect/story-wz7J7izft23fMcQbX1ubWM.html

After that, they’ll be distributed to all the devotees who will come for the foundation laying ceremony and also sent to all major temples around the country.”He told ANI that a bag is being prepared by the Chhawni which will contain three books on the history of Ayodhya and Ram Temple, a box of laddoos and a shawl, among other things.Another worker at Chhawni said the preparation of the laddoos has been underway for the past 4 days and they’ll be packed and ready before the mega event.PM Modi is scheduled to lay the foundation stone of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya on August 5, according to the president of the Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust. The construction of Ram temple will begin in Ayodhya after the ceremony to lay the foundation stone in which chief ministers of many states, ministers from the union cabinet and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat are also likely to participate.The Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust, set up in accordance with the Supreme Court verdict, held its second meeting earlier this month.In March this year, the Ram Lalla idol was shifted to a temporary structure.The apex court, on November 9 last year, had directed the central government to hand over the site at Ayodhya for the construction of a Ram temple.

31-07-2020||India||Over 1.6 crore sanitary pads sold at subsidised rates under Asmita Yojana: Maharashtra govt to HC||Mumbai. Maharashtra government on Friday informed the Bombay high court (HC) that over 1.6 crore sanitary pads have been sold at highly subsidised rates to adolescent girls studying in Zilla Parishad schools and rural women across the state, ever since the Asmita Yojana was introduced in 2018. In an affidavit filed in HC on Friday, the government said that the Asmita Yojana has been designed and implemented with the objective of ensuring accessibility and availability of affordable sanitary pads across rural Maharashtra and the scheme is being implemented through women self-help groups (SHGs). Under the scheme, a pack of eight sanitary napkins is being sold to adolescent school girls and rural women at a subsidised rate of Rs 5 and Rs 24, respectively. So far, 19,78,140 packets, containing 1.6 crore sanitary pads, have been sold through 29,875 SHGs, the affidavit added. The affidavit was submitted in reply to a public interest litigation (PIL), jointly filed by law graduate Nikita Gore, who is working as a research assistant at Aurangabad bench of the Bombay HC, and law student Vaishnavi Gholave, seeking an order to declare sanitary napkins as an essential commodity and start its distribution through the public distribution system (PDS) along with other essential commodities. In the PIL, filed through advocate Vinod Sangvikar, the petitioners highlighted the need for easy access to sanitary napkins. The PIL stated that hygienic menstrual absorbents help adolescent girls and women to manage menstruation effectively, safely, comfortably, and fearlessly. The freedom from the fear of leakage or unpleasant odour increases their ability to attend schools or at workplaces during menstruation. A woman cannot predict, when menstruation will start and, as a result, there should be easy availability and supply of sanitary pads in schools and at workplaces, it further stated. The petitioners have asserted that sanitary napkins are an essential requirement of every woman. Women have the right to get them at a cheaper rate, as every woman spends about 3,000 days of her life menstruating and lack of cleanliness during this period may lead to infections, the petition pointed out. The petitioners have also sought proper implementation of the national guidelines for menstrual hygiene management issued by the Union Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-1-6-crore-sanitary-pads-sold-at-subsidised-rates-under-asmita-yojana-maharashtra-govt-to-hc/story-uh6sUChZxUHIRtVOMk4piM.html
31-07-2020||India||Jagan Reddy govt reinstates officer it removed from top poll body post||The Andhra Pradesh government late on Thursday issued orders reinstating retired IAS officer Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar as the state election commissioner (SEC), a week after the Supreme Court pulled it up for defying the state high court directions in this regard.A government order reinstating Ramesh Kumar as SEC was issued around midnight by Principal Secretary for Panchayat and Rural Development department Gopala Krishna Dwivedi.A gazette notification was issued subsequently restoring the position of SEC to Ramesh Kumar.The notification, which was signed by Governor Biswabhusan Harichandan, said the reinstatement would be subject to the outcome of the case in the Supreme Court, which is hearing a petition filed by the state government challenging the high court ruling on reinstatement of Ramesh Kumar.On April 10, the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government removed Ramesh Kumar from the post of SEC through an ordinance, which sought to reduce the term of the SEC from five years to three years and appoint a judicial officer of the high court judge rank in the post.Accordingly, orders were issued ending the term of Ramesh Kumar who had just completed four years and retired Madras high court judge V Kanagaraj was appointed in his place.Subsequently, Ramesh Kumar challenged the ordinance in the state high court. After prolonged hearings, the high court bench, comprising chief justice J K Maheshwari and Justice Satyanarayana Murthy, on May 29 struck down the ordinance and ordered that Ramesh Kumar be reinstated as the SEC with immediate effect.On June 1, the Jagan government filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court challenging the high court verdict and seeking a stay on reinstatement of Ramesh Kumar. But the Supreme Court refused to grant any stay on the high court order but continued to take up the hearing in the case.Since there was no stay on the high court order, Ramesh Kumar argued that he be reinstated as the SEC. When the Jagan government refused to yield to his demand, he filed a contempt petition in the high court.Following the high court directions, he approached Governor Biswabhushan Harichandan and the Governor on July 22 wrote to the state government to follow the high court orders.The Jagan government again moved the Supreme Court challenging the contempt case. The top court on July 24 strongly reprimanded the government for not following the high court orders.Having no other option, the Jagan government was forced to restore Ramesh Kumar as SEC on Thursday. He is expected to resume office on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-reddy-govt-reinstates-officer-it-removed-from-top-poll-body-post/story-sqtDSvNYUXqXg2lbUFXVcL.html
31-07-2020||India||‘Better emotional connect if mother tongue is used to teach’: NEP expert||The new education policy (NEP) unveiled this week incorporates many suggestions given by Vasudev Devnani, the former education minister of Rajasthan. In an interview to Rakesh Goswami, he talks about the new policy and other changes in Rajasthan’s schools. Excerpts: Q: As education minister of Rajasthan from 2013-2018, you were part of the core committee on NEP. The policy is out. How many of your suggestions find place in it? A: First of all, I would like to thank Prime Minister Modi and his cabinet, especially (HRD minister) Nishank ji, for incorporating our suggestions in the NEP. They need to be congratulated for building an education policy, which will prove to be a milestone for the country. I have only seen the summary of the policy so far, so I can’t put a number to suggestions that we gave and that the Dr K Kasturirangan Committee incorporated in the Draft National Education Policy but I can see at least three of our suggestions in the new policy. These are taking aganwadi centres to schools for pre-primary education, exams in primary schools for periodic evaluation and vocational training in schools. I was chairman of the sub-committee on no-detention policy and we suggested that students may be detained in primary classes based on their performance in exams. In fact, we started exams in Classes 5 and 8 for promotion. District Institutes of Education and Training (DIET) conducted Class 5 exam and the Class 8 exam was conducted by Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education (RBSE).

A: Like I told you, we brought back exams in primary classes. No-detention policy was affecting the quality of learning and our Board results bore the impact. The aganwadi centres were shifted to schools for pre-primary education. Students came to government schools at age 6 without any education whereas students going to other schools had studied in prep schools. So our students were deprived of education between 3 and 6 years. We moved 11,000 aganwadi centres to schools and principals were made their supervisors. We also started vocational education from Class 9. The NEP proposes to start this from Class 6. Q: How do you see the move to have mother tongue as medium of instruction in primary classes? A: In Rajasthan schools, the medium of instruction is Hindi. But maybe now, the teachers can also teach in local dialects. If someone uses the dialect that students speak at home, there is better emotional attachment with schools. I feel use of local dialects will also enhance the grasping power of students. Also Read: NEP 2020: No language is being imposed in the new National Education Policy: K KasturiranganQ: You had also made suggestions about teachers training. Have those been incorporated? A: It is a common phenomenon for graduates to get into B.Ed. courses because they cannot find a job. We don’t want such people becoming teachers. A person who wants to become a teacher should be passionate about teaching so we suggested a 4-year B.Ed. course right after Class 12. That has been accepted. This will save one year for the candidates – earlier they did graduation for 3 years and B.Ed. for another 2 years. We had also suggested amalgamating ITI, diploma into engineering courses – two years of ITI and diploma each and three years of engineering. I am yet to see if this has been adopted or not. Q: Your suggestions have found place in the policy but back home, the Congress government is reversing your decision to merge schools. How do you see that? A: The decision to reverse school merger is a political decision but the government has not been able to reopen many schools. We closed 21,000 schools due to the merger; the Congress government has reopened only 2,000. Because we did it in a scientific way, they haven’t been to reverse it fully. Also, it was because of the merger that today all gram panchayats in the state have a senior secondary school. When I became the education minister, there were 4,400 senior secondary schools in the state. We took it to 13,000. Because of the merger, we could best utilize the human resource and optimize infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/better-emotional-connect-if-mother-tongue-is-used-to-teach-nep-expert/story-sGNOVcNQuHRzGz470E1kjO.html

The HC also asked the investigating officer to record the doctor’s statement and identify the accused in the next 24 hours. The doctor had gone to the centre to admit some patients, including a mother and her newborn baby.“ ....to record confessional statements of the victim Dr. Sangita Chakraborty and her supporting staff under Section 154(5) of the CrPC within 24 hours, however, at the convenience of the said doctor and her other associates. The investigating officer is further directed to arrange for TI parade, if necessary, to identify the real offenders,” the court said in its order. A complaint was lodged at New Capital Complex (NCC) police station on July 27 by the Tripura health department about the alleged harassment of the doctor by some patients at the Covid-19 care centre. The accused were charged with Section 3 of Tripura Medical Service and Protection of Property Damage Act, Section 353 and 323 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 03 of the Epidemic Diseases Act. Subimal Barman, the officer-in-charge of the NCC police station, said when contacted that four Covid-19 patients suspected to be involved in the incident were shifted to a separate institutional quarantine at Indranagar, few kilometres away from the state capital.“No one has been arrested yet,” he said. A Covid-19 patient, who is an additional government advocate, on Thursday sought anticipatory bail in the high court apprehending arrest in connection with the case.A single bench of justice Arindam Lodh asked the prosecution to submit an updated case diary during the next hearing. “Learned Addl. P.P. is requested to produce the case diary on 05.08.2020 to find out the reasonable apprehension and accusations, if any, against the petitioner,” judge noted in the order. Justice Lodh said in his order that any offence to hurt sentiments, safety and security of doctors would not be tolerated, saying doctors, paramedics, police personnel are the first line of defence in the country’s fight against the coronavirus pandemic.

The demand for a CBI probe has been mounting even as police departments of Maharashtra and Bihar are investigating the case.Anil Deshmukh, Maharashtra home minister and Congress leader, has rejected demands for a CBI probe into the actor’s death more than once, saying Mumbai Police are doing their job.“There’s a confrontation between two states and no FIR has been registered yet in Maharashtra. Chirag had spoken to CM Thackeray that there should be CBI probe,” the Union consumer affairs minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Paswan was referring to the allegations and counter-allegations over the probe being carried out by police teams from Patna and Mumbai. Chirag Paswan is his son and the president of the LJP.“All political leaders are demanding for it. It should be handed over to CBI,” Ram Vilas Paswan said.According to ANI, a letter petition has been filed in Patna High Court seeking the transfer of investigation into Rajput’s death from Bihar police to CBI.The petition came days after a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, dismissed a petition seeking a CBI inquiry into Rajput’s death. The actor’s father, Krishna Kumar Singh, filed a complaint with Bihar police last week accusing his son’s girlfriend and actor Rhea Chakraborty, and six others, for the death. Rajput was found dead in his Bandra flat on June 14.Rajput’s father has levelled several allegations, including abetment to suicide and withdrawing crores of rupees from his son’s bank account and mental harassment, against Rhea Chakraborty and six others, including her family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-s-death-must-be-probed-by-cbi-ram-vilas-paswan-joins-chorus/story-gv9FJoiBxaSGQzufPhSrYN.html
31-07-2020||India||Indian extradited to UK last year, convicted of rapes, murder in 2009||Aman Vyas, who was accused of rape and murder of a woman and rape of three other women in 2009, fled to India and was extradited to the UK in October 2019, has been found guilty and faces a long term in jail when sentenced on August 21.Vyas, 35, who raped and murdered Michelle Samaraweera, was the third Indian citizen extradited from India since the 1992 India-UK extradition treaty. His extradition was the subject of a campaign over the years by Labour MP Stella Creasy.Scotland Yard said on Friday that Vyas was convicted at the high court on Thursday for offences that occurred in Walthamstow in north London between March 24 and May 30 of 2009. He was also found guilty of one count of grievous bodily harm and six counts of rape.After the crimes sparked anger, the police said that it was established that on July 2, 2009, a month after Samaraweera’s murder and just a few days after a television appeal about the case, Vyas purchased a one-way ticket to India, leaving the same day.A manhunt commenced to find Vyas and extradite him back to the UK. In 2011, inquiries revealed at one stage that Vyas was in New Zealand, he then made his way to Singapore and the trail went cold.It was on July 4, 2011 that police were informed by Indian authorities that they had arrested Vyas in New Delhi as he tried to take an outbound flight. Extradition proceedings commenced but it was not until October 4, 2019 that British officers escorted him from New Delhi to London Heathrow that he was arrested.Detective sergeant Shaleena Sheikh said: “Vyas did all he could to avoid responsibility for his crimes. He fled abroad and then added to the distress of those he hurt by making them go through the ordeal of a trial. However, the injuries Vyas inflicted told the true story of this violent criminal and the jury have seen right through his lies”.She added: “Although we had DNA from the scenes of his crimes, Vyas was not on the DNA database and was a complete stranger to his victims; to bring him to justice required an extraordinary investigation. This case lasted more than ten years, needed enquiries in many different countries and finally a lengthy extradition process”.“The sheer scale of the investigation was also remarkable. There were extensive media appeals, and thousands of homes and businesses were contacted, in person or through leaflets. Vyas’s crimes were wicked and relentless and I am thankful that such violent predators are rare”.Previous extraditions from India to the UK are: Maninder Pal Singh Kohli (Indian citizen), on July 29, 2007, for the rape and murder of British teenager Hannah Foster; Somaia Ketan Surendra (Kenyan citizen), on July 8, 2009, in a cheating case; and Kulwinder Singh Uppal (Indian citizen), on November 14, 2013, in kidnapping and false imprisonment case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-extradited-to-uk-last-year-convicted-of-rapes-murder-in-2009/story-yDaoozDHaftRlY0Sk57PPO.html
31-07-2020||India||American people overwhelmingly back India over China: Survey||American people overwhelmingly back India over China and prefer the US government to support New Delhi in possible Indo-China military and economic conflict, according to a survey by Australia-based think tank Lowy Institute.The survey published on The Interpreter by Lowy Institute explores US public views on potential military or economic strife between China to India.The web survey was conducted on a sample of 1,012 American respondents on July 7. The respondents were randomly assigned one of two versions of a prompt ---’If India and China were engaged in military conflict, would you support the US aiding India, China, or neither side?’ or ‘If India and China were engaged in economic conflict, would you support the US aiding India, China, or neither side?’According to results published by the think tank, 63.6 per cent of respondents would have the US support neither India nor China if they were to engage in military conflict with each other, compared to 60.6 per cent regarding economic conflict with each other.For those who did choose to support one of the countries, however, it was overwhelmingly in favour of India.“For a military conflict between India and China, 32.6 per cent preferred that the US support India, as opposed to 3.8 per cent who preferred that the US support China. For an economic conflict, 36.3 per cent of respondents preferred US support for India, while 3.1 per cent preferred the US support for China,” according to survey result.The survey was conducted amid heightened tension between India and China as troops of both countries are engaged in a military standoff since May. While the US has blamed China of taking “incredibly aggressive action” along the Line of Actual Control, saying Beijing had a pattern of instigating territorial disputes.The think tank said China’s broader actions in the region, especially as it thwarts democratic efforts in Hong Kong and pressures Taiwan, could similarly push Americans to have a more favourable view of India in any conflict.“China’s broader actions in the region, especially as it thwarts democratic efforts in Hong Kong and pressures Taiwan, could similarly push Americans to have a more favourable view of India in any conflict,” it said.“The challenge for Indian officials, as well as US officials sympathetic to India, is to find ways to increase American public knowledge of China-India disputes and the importance of India as a strategic partner,” it added.

But this year, they will not meet him due to the cornavirus pandemic. Earlier, Holi celebrations that used to be organised for these widows, was also called off due to Covid-19.Though the widows will miss the opportunity to meet PM Modi this Raksha Bandhan, they have prepared 501 special rakhis with his images and a similar quantity of special Vrindavan-themed face masks which are being sent to him.These rakhis containing colourful photos of PM Modi were prepared by a group of widows living in ‘Maa Sharda’ and ‘Meera Sahabhagini’ ashrams.Social reformer and Sulabh Movement founder Bindeshwar Pathak had started organising all important Hindu rituals for widows living in Vrindavan. Rakhsha Bandhan was among them but no such programme is possible this time due to the Covid-19 crisis.“The ongoing coronavirus crisis disheartened the widows but it didn’t shatter their spirit, so they started preparing rakhis and special Vrindavan themed masks for Mr Modi. Some rakhis contain photos of the prime minister with covered faces,” said Sulabh Hope Foundation vice-president Vinita Verma.Chabi Dasi, who is nearly 75, had personally tied a rakhi to the prime minister. She looked disheartened this year as she has been spending her days inside the ashram for the last five months. But she is happy that her rakhis and masks are being sent to the prime minister.“I have personally designed special masks carrying messages like ‘Stay safe’ and ‘Atamnirbhar’ and rakhis with Modiji with a covered face,” Chabi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vrindavan-widows-to-send-rakhis-face-masks-to-pm-modi-on-rakshan-bandhan/story-v0zbb5MpcnegzMCuTlEvGL.html
31-07-2020||India||Second BJP worker found hanging within a span of 24 hours in West Bengal||Another Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker was found dead in a village in south Bengal on Thursday. Police said they have found a suicide note. This is the second BJP supporter found dead within a span of 24 hours in south Bengal and third in July. All three died in a similar manner, hanging. While in all the three cases the BJP has alleged that the victims were murdered by the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and then their bodies were strung up to pass them off as suicide cases, the latter has refuted the allegations. Bengal is slated to go for polls in May next year, where the BJP, which has emerged as the main opposition in the battleground state following the void created by the dwindling electoral fortunes of the Left Front and the Congress, is vying to unseat the TMC’s uninterrupted rule since 2011. On Thursday, Gautam Patra (52), was found hanging from a tree at Ghoramara in South 24 Parganas districts. “This is propaganda against us. The TMC is not associated with this (Patra’s death) in any way,” said Bankim Hazra, a TMC lawmaker from the area. On Friday, BJP’s state general secretary Sayantan Basu was stopped by the police from proceeding to the East Midnapore district, where local party leader Purnachandra Das was found dead on Wednesday. His body was found hanging from a tree. “Again prevented by the police, I am not being allowed to enter the East Midnapore district. My only fault that I am scheduled to meet with the family members of a murdered BJP booth president,” tweeted Basu. Police officials said that Basu was stopped because they anticipated that there could be a violation of law and order upon his arrival at the dead party worker’s residence. Earlier on July 13, Debendra Nath Roy, a BJP lawmaker, was found hanging from the ceiling of a shop at a marketplace in north Bengal’s Uttar Dinajpur district. While police said he had died by suicide, BJP leaders and family members had alleged that he was murdered by the TMC and had moved the Calcutta high court (HC) demanding a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe. HC turned down the CBI plea. West Bengal Police’s Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is investigating legislator Roy’s death. In early July, BJP leaders had alleged that over 100 party workers have been killed in Bengal over the past three years. In many cases, the workers were found dead and hanging from a tree. Police in most cases found that the victims had died by suicide. A BJP delegation had met President Ram Nath Kovind and Union home minister Amit Shah after Roy’s body was found in Uttar Dinajpur district. Later, Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee sent a letter to President Kovind, alleging that the BJP was distorting facts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-second-bjp-worker-found-hanging-within-a-span-of-24-hours/story-W3VFYF2FA4tQnPh5OXg1gJ.html
31-07-2020||India||At home after years, migrants eagerly waiting for Raksha Bandhan amid Covid-19 gloom||Ajay Pal, a migrant labourer who returned from Mumbai to his village in Pratapgarh due to Covid-19 lockdown in early May, is happy.“This Raksha Bandhan, it will be exactly 12 years since my sister tied rakhi on my wrist. All these years I had been away,” said Pal, who is eagerly waiting for Raksha Bandhan.Pal, who worked as a mechanic in Mumbai, is using this time to meet the members of his extended family and relatives and replenish the old ties which he overlooked while working in Mumbai. “I left home when I was 18. That was the last time I got rakhi tied by my sister. I have got this opportunity again this time,” said Pal. He is third born among four children. Pal is two years younger to Rupa, the only sister among three brothers. Rupa was married two years after Pal left for Mumbai in search of work. He met Rupa on several occasions in the meantime, but never on Raksha Bandhan. “I use to visit my village only during Diwali or Holi. I use to speak to my sister on phone on rakhi but never thought of visiting her on the day. I think I should have come every year just for few days around rakhi, after all she is our only sister,” said Pal.As the day gets closer, Pal has started keeping a close watch on the notices of lockdown issued by the government.“The house of my sister is some 15 kilometres away from here. It will be difficult for me if lockdown is declared due to rising Covid-19 cases. In that case I will have to think of some other way but I have made up my mind to meet my sister on rakhi which is on August 3 this year,” asserted Ajay adding that his younger brother will also accompany him. Another migrant worker, Dinesh Verma, 36, in Prayagraj district is also looking forward to meeting his sisters on Raksha Bandhan.“I will meet my sisters after five years on this Raksha Bandhan day. Though they used to post me rakhi every year, getting it tied by them will be special,” Verma said.Both his sisters, Divya and Madhuri, are married in the same district some 20 kilometres away from his house. Verma has asked his wife to prepare some sweets at home which he would take as a gift to their house on rakhi.“I use to send money for my sisters on rakhi in the past years but don’t have much to give this time. My wife will prepare something that I will take along with me,” said Verma, who worked as a waiter in a restaurant in Nagpur before Covid-19 pandemic hit.He lost his job and returned home on one of the Shramik special trains. He now helps his father on the farms. “Like me there are many migrant workers who will meet their sisters after a long time on this festival, which has come as a brief glimmer in these gloomy times,” said Verma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-home-after-years-migrants-eagerly-waiting-for-raksha-bandhan-amid-covid-19-gloom/story-dtagYBCfpL1bBViajDVDIJ.html

What Mayawati said||Taking note of a Dalit saint’s complaint, BSP chief Mayawati on Friday said it would have been better if the saint from the oppressed community had also been invited along with the 200 priests that will attend the mega Rample temple bhoomi pujan (ground-breaking ceremony) on August 5.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to attend the big event for which Diwali-like preparations are in full swing. Mayawati, in a series of tweets, said the invitation to Swami Kanhaiya Prabhunandan Giri would have made a positive impact and would have been in line with the Constitutional design of creating a casteless society.However, the BSP chief also advised the community to not fall into this trap and work for their upliftment. “Instead of getting into these debates, the Dalit society suffering from casteist neglect, contempt and injustice should focus more on labour/deeds for their salvation. In this case also, they should follow the path of their Messiah Param Pujya Baba Saheb Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar. This is the advice of the BSP,” said Mayawati.Swami Kanhaiya Prabhunandan Giri, lone Dalit Mahamanadaleshwar of Juna Akhada, on Thursday had expressed discontent after the organisers - Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust - did not extend him the invitation for the ground-breaking ceremony of the Ram temple to be constructed at the site of the Babri Masjid, which was demolished by kar sevaks on December 6, 1992. The saints belonging to the upper caste groups have been invited, he said, alleging that he was ignored for being a Dalit. The Dalits are being ignored in the Ram temple construction, he alleged, could be gauged from the fact that no Dalit has been made a member in the Trust constituted to supervise the construction of the Ram temple at Ayodhya. In Ramayana it is clearly mentioned that Rama worked for the uplift and welfare of the downtrodden and oppressed community, the saint underscored. Giri, a native of Azamgarh, was made Mahamanadaleshwar in a programme organised at Prayagraj during the 2019 Kumbh. He is the sole Mahamanadaleshwar from the Dalit community in the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad - the top body that controls the activities of all the akharas in the country. Dismissing Giri’s accusation, the chief of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad, Mahant Narendra Giri, said: “When a person becomes a sadhu he loses the caste identity, all the sadhus are equal in the Akhara Parishad.”HT’s attempts to reach out to the Trust’s local office in Ayodhya elicited no response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-dalit-among-200-priests-invited-for-ram-temple-event-what-mayawati-said/story-U0YxRnfSiI1umMtcJqF8iL.html
31-07-2020||India||Supreme Court orders status quo on ex-Fortis Healthcare promoter Shivinder Mohan Singh’s bail||The Supreme Court on Friday ordered status quo on bail granted by Delhi High Court to Shivinder Mohan Singh, the former promoter of Fortis Healthcare, in the money laundering case related to Religare Finvest Limited. The bench headed by justice Arun Mishra also said that the high court judgment should not be treated as a precedent in other bail matters. “Issue notice. In the meantime, the status quo with respect to bail be maintained. The judgment of Delhi high court not to be treated as a precedent,” the court said. The Delhi high court had, on July 23, granted bail to Singh stating there was no rationale for continuing his custody as an undertrial. The bail was conditional subject to him furnishing a personal bond to the tune of Rs 1 crore and two sureties of Rs 25 lakh.He was also directed not to leave the country without the permission of the trial court hearing the case against him.Though he was granted bail, Shivinder continues to remain in jail since he is in judicial custody in another case filed by Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Delhi Police. Singh was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in December 2019 for offences under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Before that, EOW had arrested him in October 2019 for offences under Indian Penal Code.The trial court had rejected his bail plea in June. The Supreme Court will also consider the important question of whether the twin conditions for granting of bail under section 45 continues to remain valid. Section 45 was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2017. The section was subsequently amended by Parliament. However, Delhi high court had held in a case of Upendra Rai vs ED that the twin conditions for bail under section 45 will not stand revived despite the amendment made to it.This high court order was, subsequently, stayed by the Supreme Court.In Shivinder’s bail plea, Delhi high court observed that although there has been an amendment to section 45, there is no subsequent decision of the Supreme Court holding the said two conditions to be constitutionally valid, even when brought back by way of the amendment. Accordingly, it must treat the said two conditions as invalid and struck-down.This aspect has been challenged by ED before SC. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the bench that the Supreme Court must examine this issue and settle the law conclusively. “We will have to settle the law. The solicitor general has made the correct submission by SG,” justice Mishra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-orders-status-quo-on-ex-fortis-healthcare-promoter-shivinder-mohan-singh-s-bail/story-wr1mSijS3wTeQWd0e3GjRI.html

Joshua had courted controversy after a video of her stand-up act performed last year went viral, where she had purportedly insulted Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, an icon in Maharashtra. Later, she apologised on social media and deleted the video. The arrested persons have been identified as Ashraf Shaikh and Virat Sharma. Both are Virar residents and class X drop-outs, who drive auto-rickshaws to make a living. Also read | Unfunny task of female comedians: Yet to crack upThey are friends of Umesh Dada alias Imtiyaz Shaikh, who was arrested by Mumbai Police from Nalasopara on July 13, for a similar charge. Investigations have revealed that Umesh Dada and the other two arrested accused are influenced by Hindustani Bhau, a popular YouTuber and a former contestant of Big Boss, a reality TV game show. “Influenced by the style of Hindustani Bhau about how he abuses and roasts people in his videos, the three had made similar clips to gain popularity in a short span of time. They had made videos on Joshua for cheap thrills,” said a police official, requesting anonymity.Their videos, too, had gone viral. Umesh Dada is a friend of another YouTuber, Shubham Mishra, who was arrested on July 12 from Vadodara by Gujarat Police on similar charges of threatening and abusing Joshua. Mishra is also a friend of Hindustani Bhau. “The arrested accused had switched off their mobile phones and had gone underground after Umesh Dada was held. They were arrested on Thursday from Virar after a search operation lasted over 15 days,” said Rashmi Karandikar, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) (cyber), Mumbai Police. Mumbai Police on Thursday night shared a video on Twitter in which the two accused could be seen seeking an apology for their actions. The families of the two arrested accused had no knowledge about their crime and only came to know after the Mumbai Police booked them. The two have been arrested under Sections 294 (obscenity), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 354-A (sexual harassment and punishment for sexual harassment), 354-D (stalking), 504 (intentional insult to break public peace), 505 (statements leading to public mischief), 506 (criminal intimidation), 509 (intending to insult the modesty of a woman), 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 67-A (punishment for publishing or transmitting of material containing sexually explicit act) of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000. They will be produced in a Mumbai court on Friday.Initially, a Shiv Sena leader had complained about Joshua’s viral video to Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh. Later, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) activists vandalised Habitat Cafe, a stand-up comedy studio in Khar in suburban Mumbai, where Joshua had performed last year. The video of MNS’s stunt was shared on social media following which social media influencer Shubham Mishra and Umesh Dada also jumped on the bandwagon.

Lone was later shifted to his government accommodation at Church Lane in February last year.“Finally 5 days short of a year I have been officially informed that I am a free man. So much has changed. So have I. Jail was not a new experience. Earlier ones were harsh with usual doses of physical torture. But this was psychologically draining.

The counsel for the other co-accused, Vernon Gonsalves, informed the court that his client had tested Covid-19 negative earlier this week and also spoke to his family members to convey his well-being to them. However, Dr. Teltumbde’s family members are anxious, as his Covid-19 test results are still awaited and he has not spoken to them yet. Public prosecutor Deepak Thakare, who represented the Maharashtra government, informed the court that Dr. Teltumbde’s Covid-19 test result would be made available on Saturday. The court will hear the case next on August 4, when the state government will also submit Dr. Teltumbde’s Covid-19 test report. An HC division bench, comprising Justices RD Dhanuka and VG Bisht, while hearing the plea of Gonsalves and Dr. Teltumbde seeking directions to the jail authorities to test them for SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, was informed by senior advocate Mihir Desai on Friday that Gonsalves had been tested for the viral infection and the results had come negative. Desai further submitted that Gonsalves is back in the normal barracks at Taloja Jail in Navi Mumbai on completion of his mandatory quarantine period. Last week, Gonsalves and Dr. Teltumbde had pleaded with the court to allow them to undergo Covid-19 tests after fellow accused and reputed Telugu poet and social activist P Varavara Rao (81) was found to be infected with the viral infection over two weeks ago. Gonsalves was helping Rao with his day-to-day activities in Taloja Jail because of the latter’s advanced age and Dr. Teltumbde is also lodged in the same prison. Rao is undergoing treatment at Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital after he had tested Covid-19 positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elgar-parishad-case-vernon-back-in-taloja-jail-after-testing-negative-for-covid-dr-teltumbde-s-report-awaited/story-wwPt7Fj4L1lVYuDjFk8PDJ.html

On 1 August 2019, the Modi government enacted a law against triple talaq to get Muslim women free from this practice,” the BJP tweeted.“Today on 31st July 2020 we will celebrate it as #MuslimWomenRightsDay. This day will always be remembered as a golden day in the Indian democracy for giving gender justice, dignity and equality to muslim women by ending the evil practice of #TripleTalaq,” law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad tweeted.“Triple Talaq Bill has been proved to be a historic step of PM Shri @narendramodi Ji’s Govt to ensure socio-economic, fundamental, democratic rights of Muslim women,” Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi tweeted.V Muraleedharan, junior foreign minister, pointed out that there has been an 82% decline in cases of the triple talaq within a year of the implementation of the law. “A sound legal framework put in place by @narendramodi govt ensured safety, security to Muslim women & contributed significantly to their empowerment,” Muraleedharan also posted.“A special thank you to all the brave Muslim women who challenged this inhuman practice in Supreme Court & got it declared unconstitutional & violative of Article 14 of the #Constitution,” Muraleedharan added.Smriti Irani, the women and child development minister, attacked the Congress for not doing enough for Muslim women.“In the 1980s, Congress had time and numbers to do justice to Muslim women. But vote bank was more important for them and not justice to Muslim women. They never aimed to better the lives of Muslim women,” Smriti Irani was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Pralhad Joshi, parliamentary affairs minister, also praised the Prime Minister for doing away with the “regressive practice”.“It took the nation leadership of a visionary Prime Minister, Shri @narendramodi ji to come out of the regressive practice of triple talaq. Today we celebrate 1 year of the historic moment which has been a symbol of women empowerment and liberty,” Joshi tweeted.The Supreme Court had in August 2017 declared the practice of talaq-e-biddat or a form of divorce based on a husband pronouncing divorce thrice in quick succession or as unconstitutional. The practise is banned in most Muslim countries including Pakistan.The verdict came on a petition of five Muslim women, including lead petitioner Shayara Bano, who were abandoned after their husbands pronounced instant divorce.The Centre initially issued an ordinance after the verdict to criminalise the practice of triple talaq for the want of majority in Parliament’s upper house, or Rajya Sabha, before bringing the law.According to the law, the practice of instant triple talaq is a cognizable offence or one in which the police may carry out an arrest without a warrant, and is used for serious crimes such as theft, rape and murder.Section 4 of the act punishes a guilty Muslim man with three years of imprisonment and also make him liable to pay a fine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-marks-anniversary-of-passage-of-triple-talaq-law-as-muslim-women-s-rights-day-union-ministers-hail-pm-modi/story-0ro4MBT23QUiYpkQAla8IK.html

Planes have been hired to take the legislators to the new destination. The MLAs are being moved in batches.CM Gehlot on Thursday indicated that he will seek a confidence vote when the assembly convenes next fortnight and claimed that the money offered to the MLAs to switch sides had increased sharply ahead of the session. He added that rebels who have not accepted money should return to the party fold.“The floor test will happen; we are going to the assembly. The BAC decides this,” he told reporters, referring to the assembly’s business advisory committee.He said the House will also discuss the coronavirus pandemic and the state’s economy after the lockdown.The chief minister claimed that MLAs have been getting calls after Governor Kalraj Mishra agreed Wednesday night to convene a session from August 14.Gehlot said earlier the ‘rate’ was Rs 10 crore as the first instalment and Rs 15 crore as the second.“I am not aware who all have taken the first instalment among those who had left. It is possible that some might not have taken it. I want them to come back,” he said.Gehlot said if the dissident MLAs had any complaints, they should have gone to the AICC office, instead of keeping away.The dissident Congress MLAs, Gehlot said, are at Manesar in Gurugram and the Special Operations Group (SOG) of the Rajasthan police is unable to reach them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashok-gehlot-moves-mlas-to-jaisalmer-alleges-horse-trading-rates-up/story-oO8jrVWzXMDLQ1QRD6X9CN.html

The government said a pilot project of asymptomatic Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment at their homes have started in Raipur and Durg districts and would be expanded across the state. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here “A total of 180 home isolation beds have been installed across the 28 districts in the state. The pilot project has started in Raipur and Durg districts. The initiative will be expanded soon,” state health minister TS Singhdeo told HT. The district collectors have been empowered to take a call on home quarantine facility for asymptomatic Covid-19 patients, he added. “So far, this line of treatment has been tried out in urban areas, where there are basic living facilities for an asymptomatic Covid-19 patient such as a three-bedroom house, etc. The new policy aims to preempt a lack of bed space in case there is an exponential rise in Covid-19 cases and to treat more critical patients. An elaborate guideline will be issued in a day or two. Besides, 80% of Covid-19 patients in Chhattisgarh have been asymptomatic and low-risk,” the minister said. Niharika Barika Singh, health secretary, Chhattisgarh, said the decision to let asymptomatic Covid-19 patients, who can undergo treatment at home, would considerably reduce the load on hospitals in the state. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “There is a demand from various sectors that asymptomatic Covid-19 patients do not require hospitalisation and if they can be isolated at home with all the necessary precautions. It will also reduce the load on hospital authorities in a bid to allow them to concentrate on treating symptomatic patients. It will start as a pilot project in certain districts. The government will evaluate the outcome and decide the next course of action,” Singh said. On Thursday, Chhattisgarh’s Covid-19 count rose to 8,775 after 175 new cases were reported and the death toll climbed to 51. The following is the district-wise break-up of 175 new Covid-19 cases: Raipur (93), Rajnandgaon (21), Durg (13), Kondagaon (9), Bilaspur (8), Janjgir-Champa (4) Balodabazar (4), Kanker (3), Narayanpur (3), Munegli (2), Koriya (2), Surajpur (2), Bastar (2), and Dantewada (2).

The Centre said that this happened despite a direction from the top court.The court then asked the Centre to do the needful to ensure that salaries of these workers are paid on time.“If the states are not complying with the directions and orders of the Central government, you are not helpless. You have to ensure that your order is implemented. You have got the power under the Disaster Management Act. You can take steps also”, the bench of bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.The Supreme Court had issued stringent directions in June to criminalise the non-payment of dues on time to doctors and nurses. The direction had come on a doctor’s petition which alleged that medical professionals were not being paid in several regions and were also not provided with facilities to isolate themselves which was a big risk to their families if they were to get infected.The Centre had then declared the act of withholding salaries of doctors and nurses engaged in the battle against Covid-19 an offence under the Disaster Management Act (DMA). The order was issued by the Union health ministry.The apex court had taken serious note of non-payment of salary and lack of proper accommodation to doctors and said, “In war, you do not make soldiers unhappy.”It had also said that the courts should not be involved in the issue of non-payment of salary to healthcare workers and that the government should settle the issue.In April, the Supreme Court had observed that the doctors and medical staff are the “first line of defence of the country” in the battle against Covid-19 pandemic, and directed the Centre to ensure that appropriate PPEs are made available to them for treating coronavirus patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-states-have-not-made-timely-payment-to-covid-19-healthcare-workers-govt-tells-supreme-court/story-qFHvVP8oPeVANcJFAMcu5O.html

While one person was died late on Wednesday night, two people succumbed at Darsi government hospital on Thursday night and seven others on Friday morning. Three of the deceased are believed to be beggars and the remaining are the local slum dwellers. In all, 20 people believed to have consumed sanitiser in the last two days.

Preliminary inquiries revealed that all of them had consumed pure sanitiser solution. Further details would be known after obtaining the post mortem reports,” the SP said, adding that he had ordered for a thorough investigation by a senior police official. It started with one beggar at a local Goddess Durga temple complaining of severe burning sensation in his stomach. He succumbed while being taken to the hospital on Wednesday night.

Rajput was found dead in his Bandra flat in Mumbai on June 14.“Whenever police from one state go to another state for investigation, then the respective state government and officials cooperate. In this case, it’s unfortunate that they (Mumbai Police) are not cooperating,” Lalit Kishore, Bihar’s principal additional advocate general, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Also Read: SC dismisses plea seeking CBI enquiry into Sushant Singh Rajput’s deathBefore this, Maharashtra’s minister of state for home Shambhuraj Desai alleged that Bihar policemen did not follow protocol.“Whenever a police team from a state visits another state for investigation, there are some protocols which are to be followed. These were not followed,” Desai told a news channel.However, Sanjay Singh, Bihar’s inspector general of police (Central Range), told HTMeanwhile, Rhea Chakraborty has filed an interim prayer that the probe by Bihar’s police be stayed till the Supreme Court decides her plea on the transfer of investigation from the eastern state to Mumbai.Chakraborty moved the top court on Wednesday pleading for the transfer of the investigation from Bihar to Mumbai, as the investigation in Mumbai was still pending.Also Read: Mayawati wades into row over Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. Congress is her targetThe Nitish Kumar government is set to oppose Chakraborty’s plea before the top court and support Sushant’s family in the case.Rajput’s family filed a caveat seeking that her petition not be allowed to be heard “ex-parte” in their counter-petition soon after Chakraborty moved the Supreme Court. A caveat is a type of petition filed to pre-empt any ex-parte order on the plea filed by the opposite side.According to ANI, a letter petition has been filed in Patna High Court seeking the transfer of investigation into Rajput’s death from Bihar police to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).“… it has prima facie raised a number of serious questions on the investigation being conducted by both the State Police and also it has raised a number of unanswered question in the mind of the public at large as it was a suicide or a murder,” Pawan Prakash Pathak and Gauraw Kumar said in their letter petition, ANI said.Also Read: From theft to cheating: Sushant Singh Rajput’s father charges against Rhea ChakrabortyPathak and Kumar said that police from Bihar and Maharashtra—which is investigating the case—are “not collaborating with each other”.“Now there are two states investigating the same sad matter of mysterious death of Late Sushant Singh Rajput, and in the interest of justice there should be single investigation agency which is not possible as the Bihar Police and the Maharashtra Police not collaborating with each other,” they said.“Therefore, in the interest of justice, equity and good conscience, it is humbly prayed that this Letter Petition be treated as a Public Interest Litigation seeking transfer of investigation from State agency to CBI Or SIT Inquiry,” the petition added.Anil Deshmukh, Maharashtra’ home minister, has said Mumbai Police are investigating the case and it will not be transferred to CBI.

31-07-2020||India||Bombay HC grants temporary bail to 65-year-old murder convict, says he is vulnerable||The Bombay high court (HC) last week granted temporary bail to a murder convict until December 31 on the ground that he is a senior citizen (65) and is at high risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices SS Shinde and Surendra Tavade, refused to grant regular bail to the murder convict, Sitaram Kamble, as it was not in a position to scrutinise the complete evidence in his plea for temporary bail. It, however, took note of the fact that Kamble (65) is a senior citizen and, as a result, “very vulnerable if he is infected with SARS-CoV-2”. The bench said: “In such condition, the applicant can be released on temporary bail for a limited period.” Earlier in November 2014, the Ratnagiri sessions court had convicted Kamble for life for the murder of a neighbour on February 1, 2013. The convict had killed his neighbour because of an illicit affair between his son and the murder victim’s wife. He had moved HC seeking regular bail during the pendency of his appeal against the conviction. It was argued on his behalf that the conviction under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was not sustainable in law, as the convict had inflicted a single blow of scythe in a fit of rage, and he did not act in a cruel or unusual manner. His lawyer, advocate Payoshi Roy, pointed out that the act had shown that since the convict had no intention to kill the deceased, at best it could be a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder attracting maximum punishment up to 10 years, and urged the court to release him on bail during the pendency of his appeal, as he had already served seven years in jail. Additional public prosecutor FR Shaikh opposed the plea. He argued that there are three eye-witnesses to the incident and the trial court had convicted him for the murder because the convict had inflicted a fatal blow with the sharp weapon on the chest of the deceased. HC refused to consider the plea for regular bail on the ground that it can be done only after scrutinising the complete evidence on record. The bench, however, granted Kamble temporary bail until December 31 and ordered him to report to the prison on January 1, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-grants-temporary-bail-to-65-yr-old-murder-convict-says-he-is-vulnerable/story-QiuUrl0KVXxtOeQOUhMm5M.html

They are considered to present large angular surfaces that tend to reflect radar signals.“I don’t think J-20 is stealthy enough to be called a fifth generation fighter as the canard increases the radar signature of the fighter and gives away its position to a long-range meteor missile that the Rafale has,” he said.The other question the former IAF chief has for the Chinese is: “Why can’t the J-20 supercruise if it is really a 5th generation fighter as its manufacturer Chengdu Aerospace Corporation calls it.”Supercruise is the ability of a fighter jet to fly at speeds above Mach 1 - the speed of sound - without the use of afterburners, the additional combustion component used on some jet engines to increase thrust.Also Read: Twin naval exercises with US supercarriers signal QUAD has arrived“The Rafale has the supercruiseaility and its radar signature is comparable to the best of the fighters in the world,” Dhanoa told Hindustan Times.Dhanoa has flown top of the line Indian fighter aircraft including Sukhoi 30 MKI. He was the man responsible for targeting the Pakistani intruders on Drass, Kargil, Battalik heights and spearheaded the Balakot air strikes along with National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.The retired top air force officer had earlier this week shredded the Chinese propaganda of superior air capability, wondering that if the Chinese equipment was so good, Pakistan would have used its Chinese JF-17 and not the F-16 aircraft to attack Nangi Tekri brigade in Rajouri sector on 27 February 2019. But Pakistan used the Chinese JF-17 to merely give air defence cover to its Mirage 3/5 bombers. Or why China’s “iron brother” uses Swedish early air warning platforms up north and the keep Chinese AWACS in the south.Incidentally, India is expected to get 12 more Sukhoi 30 MKI and 21 MiG 29s next year from Russia. According to diplomats based in Moscow, the Su-30 MKI will “look better, shoot better, and fight better”. The MiG 29 will be used for setting up a new squadron in Jamnagar in Gujarat and will have the same capability as the MiG 29 that India currently has.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rafale-vs-j-20-ex-iaf-chief-dhanoa-calls-china-s-bluff-with-two-simple-questions/story-Al6kSI8wjj0SvypDHeIrXI.html

He made the demand following the surfacing of a viral video, where Joshi and chief minister Gehlot’s son Vaibhav Gehlot were found to be discussing the ongoing political turmoil in the desert state. Also Read: Constitution supreme for me, there is no pressure: Rajasthan Governor Kalraj MishraHT cannot independently authenticate the veracity of the viral video. In the video, the Speaker is purportedly heard saying that if 30 members of the Rajasthan legislative assembly (MLAs) would have quit, then the crisis would have deepened.He alluded to the situation as tough and hinted at the collapse of the Gehlot government.Poonia alleged that the conversation has sullied the reputation of the office of the Speaker, who appeared more concerned about saving the Congress government at the expense of his constitutional authority. His political inclination towards the Congress was on display and he flouted his constitutional obligation, he further alleged. Poonia said the Speaker has to rise above party politics and play an impartial role in legislative proceedings. He also urged Joshi to come clean on the veracity of the viral video. “It is inappropriate for him to hold on to the post. He needs to maintain the dignity and neutrality of the House and must step down on moral grounds,” the state BJP chief added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-bjp-chief-demands-speaker-joshi-s-resignation-on-moral-grounds/story-Qs5LJHE311FG27G9kxWI5L.html

It is the third worst-hit country in the world after the United States and Brazil.With 779 fatalities between Thursday and Friday morning, the country’s death toll is now 35,747. The toll at the beginning of the month was 17,400.The government has said India has one of the lowest case fatality rate (CFR) at 2.21% as compared to the global average of 4%. It added that 24 states and Union territories have lower CFR than the national average and eight of them have a CFR below 1%.With 37,223 patients discharged in the last 24 hours, the number of recovered people have jumped to 1,057,805. The recovery rate is up from 64.44% on Thursday to 64.54% on Friday.India on Thursday achieved the landmark of more than a million recoveries from Covid-19. There has been a consistent trend of more than 30,000 recoveries daily for the eighth day in a row now. There has been a continued increase in the average daily recoveries from around 15,000 in July’s first week to around 35,000 in the last week. The gap between recovered patients and active Covid-19 cases currently stands at more than 5 lakh now.The government has also said that 16 states and Union territories are recording higher recovery rate than the national average. It has also said that 16 states and Union territories are recording higher recovery rate than the national average. A senior official of the health ministry said on Thursday that the herd immunity level is “far away” for the Indian population and it can only be achieved through immunisation by vaccines.“For a large country like India, herd immunity cannot be a strategic choice or a strategic option... It will come at too high a cost and can be done only through immunisations via vaccination,” Rajesh Bhushan, the officer on special duty, said during a briefing.The march of an infectious disease such as Covid-19 can be halted only when there is a large enough proportion of the population that is immune to it – a threshold known as herd immunity. Besides a vaccine, which is yet to be approved, the only way people become immune is if they have had the disease and recovered.The official also hinted that India is looking at a multilateral, World Health Organization (WHO)-led mechanism to secure Covid-19 vaccines and the country is yet to begin direct discussions with any of the developers that are leading the development race.Bhushan also said the question on who would get the vaccine first was still under deliberation at the health ministry.There are at least 25 vaccines in human trial phases, including two from India, across the world. Three vaccine candidates—one each from the US, UK and China—are largely regarded as the frontrunners since they are now at advanced stages of experiments among people.In India, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Zydus Cadila’s ZyCov-D are both in Phase I/II human trials for determining its safety and dosage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-more-than-50-000-covid-19-cases-for-second-straight-day-tally-over-1-63-million/story-cd3UGvkEfnxyLsU2Lw2B2O.html

31-07-2020||India||‘Violence, corruption part of governance in Bengal’: Governor Dhankhar in first YouTube address||After criticising the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government almost incessantly on social media and in public statements since last year, West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar took to YouTube on Thursday night.To mark the completion of his first year in office, the governor uploaded his first YouTube video. It is an address featuring photos of his meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, central ministers, the Lok Sabha speaker, Indian and foreign dignitaries and his visits to different places. All these have been compiled with background scores and Dhankhar’s voice-over. It is the script of the address, however, that is not likely to go down well with chief minister Mamata Banerjee, although she too features in several photos with the governor and his wife. Taking the acrimony between Raj Bhawan and the TMC government to a new crest, Dhankhar has compared the state’s governance to the dictatorship depicted by Satyajit Ray in his landmark 1980 movie Hirak Rajar Deshe (Land of the Diamond King). He drew the reference earlier in a tweet but this time the script gets longer. Ray portrayed a king who was obsessed with his diamond mines and subjected farmers, labourers and students to slavery and clinical brainwashing before being ousted by mass revolution. After praising the history, heritage and people of West Bengal and Kolkata, Dhankhar says, “Some facets of governance are cause of concern. Violence, corruption, hegemony and goondaism (ruffian activity) under police protection have become part of governance. I am sure Satyajit Day would have never liked the day he depicted in his movie to happen someday in the state of West Bengal.” “It is very serious dilution of democratic values... women’s right have been compromised... Fear of operation by police is all pervasive... All this has led to steep decline in growth of trade and industry, education and service sector. Flight of our youth and workforce is alarming and needs to be contained. Ground level governance is sought to be superimposed by cosmetic projections in media that is controlled. I am tirelessly working to secure authentic, democratic governance,” says the governor. Dhankhar also says that free and fair elections are necessary to normalise democracy but it is not possible if there is “institutionalised rigging of polls”. The film was uploaded three days after Banerjee complained about Dhankhar, without taking any names, at a virtual meeting with the Prime Minister. Quoting Tagore’s famous lines, “where the mind is without fear and the head is held high,” Dhankhar says, “Sadly, in this state we are far distanced from the thoughts of Tagore.” The film ends with the national anthem and some video clippings of Dhankhar taking to the media. No senior TMC leader was available for comment on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/violence-corruption-part-of-governance-in-bengal-governor-dhankhar-in-first-youtube-address/story-i74LGnMuQm7E82fBQfPmnK.html

31-07-2020||India||NEP 2020: Vice President Naidu hails new policy, teachers differ on language||The National Education Policy (NEP), unveiled by the government on Wednesday, is generating a lot of buzz. While many in the government and otherwise are welcoming the change in the education sector, others, including teachers, have varied views.Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday expressed happiness over NEP 2020 and called it a major step forward to enhance access to quality education for children and youth.“Diversity and respect for the local context as well as a recognition of the importance of India’s classical languages will undoubtedly give learners a holistic world view. The focus of NEP 2020 on ethics and human and Constitutional values would go a long way in the creation of enlightened citizenship essential for deepening our democratic roots,” Naidu said.Calling the NEP-2020’s vision as “truly global and essentially Indian”, Naidu said that it exemplifies India’s timeless quest for welcoming noble thoughts from all over the world.Also Read: Youngsters elated, but worry about BoardsThe man who headed the panel which drafted the NEP 2020, said no language is being imposed on anyone. Former Isro chief K Kasturirangan said that a flexible approach has been proposed with a three-langauge formula.“Adopting local languages as the medium of instruction till Class 5 is important in the early phase of education because the child’s strengths in understanding the principles and in displaying creativity manifests better in the mother tongue as well in the local language,” said Kasturirangan.The policy was approved by the Union Cabinet on Wednesday.“Children have a great ability to pick up multiple languages in early age. The policy talks about a flexible approach in three-language formula. How it will be implemented in states its their decision. No language is being imposed in the policy,” said Kasturirangan.However, some school principals believe students who will be taught in the mother tongue or regional language up to class 5 may face difficulties in coping with the syllabus in upper classes where medium of instruction is English.“We first have to distinguish between language and literacy. Language is speaking and is natural for our brains. Literacy is reading and writing which is to be learnt by our brains,” said Vishnu Karthik, Director, Heritage Schools.He said that children’s brains are designed to learn multiple languages and the more they are exposed to many languages, the more they can absorb them at an early age. “Thus, teaching in only one language is not the best use of the critical learning windows nature has given for learning languages. Teaching only in English or only in the mother tongue is not a good practice. Rather a healthy mix of 2-3 languages is good for children in primary school,” he said.Alka Kapur, Principal of Modern School in New Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh, said that English is a universal language and in the guidelines it is written that it can be used wherever possible. “It is not clearly stated if ‘wherever possible’ means subject or place. English should be one common language as everyone wants their child to know the language and I think if it is taught at the foundation state it would be very nice,” she said.“Regional language along with English language would be a good idea as the English language is a window to the world and every child from the foundation should be focused to learn English,” she added.Replacing the 10+2 structure of school curricula with a 5+3+3+4 curricular structure corresponding to age groups 3-8, 8-11, 11-14 and 14-18 years respectively, scrapping MPhil programmes and implementing common norms for private and public higher education institutions are among other salient features of the new policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nep-2020-vice-president-naidu-hails-new-policy-teachers-differ-on-language/story-gSu6PzmiPbwZc3QdKtq4TJ.html

On Tuesday, the Delhi Cabinet, in its meeting chaired by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, had rejected the panel of lawyers proposed by the Delhi Police, saying it would not help a “free and fair” trial of the cases related to the riots in north-east Delhi. Following this, Kejriwal on Wednesday evening went to meet the L-G to discuss the issue.“The L-G invoked special powers granted to him under the Constitution. The home department of the Delhi government has been ordered to approve the panel chosen by the Delhi Police. The Delhi government will now have to implement the order at any cost as it is mandated by the Constitution,” the government statement read.The L-G’s office refused to comment on the matter. On July 10, the Delhi police had proposed the names of six special public prosecutors to argue 85 cases related to riots and the anti-CAA protests. But, the Delhi government had rejected the panel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-riots-l-g-refers-lawyers-issue-to-president-kovind/story-ZXgWL1dMX46F2DFfau3TZP.html

Twenty Indian Army personnel were killed in the violent clashes in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15. “The US-India relationship is broad, deep, and growing – and we discussed how vital the cooperation between our nations is to countering common challenges and aggression in the region and upholding a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific,” said Senator Cory Gardner after his call with India’s ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu.The Republican Senator from Colorado is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy. His office said he had a productive phone conversation with Sandhu regarding the importance of US-India relations. “Today I began my call with Ambassador Sandhu by expressing my sincere condolences on the loss of Indian lives at the Line of Actual Control between India and China,” he said. “I look forward to continuing to work with Ambassador Sandhu to grow the bond between the United States and India, which will be supported by my Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, signed into law in 2018,” Gardner said. The Senator authored the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act (ARIA) of 2018, which was signed into law on December 31, 2018. The ARIA represents a generational policy framework to enhance US leadership in the Indo-Pacific region and to demonstrate a commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The Indo-Pacific is a key priority area for the US armed forces falling under the authority of the United States Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM), unified combatant command responsible for enhancing stability in the Asia-Pacific region. China has been fast expanding military and economic influence in the Indo-Pacific region, triggering concern in various countries of the region and beyond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-us-relationship-broad-deep-and-growing-says-key-senator/story-R7SHMBL4HBVGk56lBiQjZJ.html

The police action came after a video of the incident went viral on Wednesday, in which the woman is seen carrying her husband on her shoulders as a punishment while villagers, carrying sticks, can be seen heckling her. According to police, the couple returned to their village under Kotwali police station in the district from Gujarat during the Covid-19 lockdown. In the five-minute-long video, the woman can be seen struggling to walk, and even forcing her husband to get off her shoulders. But the villagers again force her to carry her husband. “There was a dispute between the husband and wife. The husband questioned her fidelity. When we got the information we talked to the woman and lodged the FIR,” Surendra Singh, Jhabua Kotwali police inspector, said. Along with the husband, several others, including their relatives, have been booked under sections 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 355 (Assault or criminal force with intent to dishonour person, otherwise than on grave provocation), 147 (rioting), 149 (Every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 294 (Obscene acts and songs) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code (IPC). Earlier in June, a similar incident took place in Jhabua when a woman was forced to carry her husband on her shoulders, for over an hour. The man suspected infidelity on the part of his wife, according to police. The man and three others were arrested in the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-held-after-wife-forced-to-carry-him-on-shoulders-over-infidelity/story-Ff3vUVDZkfXK5x6kpVxY1J.html

Out of these, just over one in five had a medically certified cause of death, numbers released by the Union home ministry showed on Thursday. India has been making progress on registering deaths but this has not been accompanied by an increase in deaths where the cause has been medically certified. Among medically certified deaths, diseases of the circulatory system (the heart and blood vessels) were the leading cause of death. Even these numbers need to be read with caution, as reporting is not uniform across states. Bihar reported this data from just five more hospitals than Andaman & Nicobar Islands. The registration rate of deaths increased for the eighth consecutive year in 2018, to reach 86%. Medical certification of deaths has hovered around the 20% mark since 2010.Share of registered deaths and medically certified deaths has been depicted in the chart.Even this data needs to be read with caution. Just about half of medical institutions having in-patient facilities report this data. This number varies drastically at the state level. Andaman and Nicobar Islands has 37 inpatient institutions, all of which reported MCCD data. Bihar on the other hand had just five more institutions covered under MCCD out of its 683 inpatient institutions, which itself is likely to be an underestimate. Telangana, which has 7,144 of 7,827 inpatient institutions covered under MCCD, reported the data from only 284 institutions.Even states that had all inpatient institutions registered under MCCD, such as Assam and Maharashtra, do not appear to be reporting this data regularly. In both these states, the share of medically certified deaths came down between 2017 and 2018. In Assam, it dropped from 31.2% to 12%, while in Maharashtra it went down by around four percentage points from the 2017 value of 38.9%. Diseases of the circulatory system or cardiovascular diseases were the leading causes of death among the deaths that were certified, accounting for nearly a third (32.9%) of all such fatalities, followed by diseases of the respiratory system (9.4%), and infectious and parasitic diseases (9.4%). Infectious and parasitic diseases were the leading cause of deaths among children aged 1-4 years (21% of such deaths) and 5-14 years (22.3%) and among those of age 15-24 years (17.5%). Cardiovascular diseases were the leading cause of death among all older age groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/of-8mn-deaths-in-india-about-6-9mn-were-registered-in-2018-report/story-FvXNtjge7MV7rOyZCU1x1L.html

We have had good data so far. We need to show the efficacy in the clinical programme, but so far, so good,” chief executive Pascal Soriot said on a media call.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAstraZeneca has already reached deals with countries to make more than 2 billion doses of its Covid-19 vaccine, developed in partnership with the University of Oxford, and says it could be approved by the end of this year.The company has had a busy few months — it took on development of the Covid-19 shot, received billions in government funding, signed several supply deals, and was even the subject of a mega-merger speculation, all the while marching on with its core business.There are no approved vaccines for the illness caused by the new virus, but AstraZeneca’s shot is widely considered the leading candidate after results from early-stage human trials showed it was safe and produced an immune response.The drugmaker, Britain’s most valuable listed company, also announced second quarter results that beat its sales and profit estimates, thanks to strong sales from a diverse product line-up.Among drugs with better-than-expected revenues, sales of respiratory drug Symbicort rose 12% to $653 million, about $90 million above consensus, while revenue from cancer drug Lynparza jumped 62% to $554 million. Newer drugs for diabetes, heart conditions and cancer, including its top-selling lung cancer drug Tagrisso, performed well in the quarter and AstraZeneca remains on track for a third consecutive year of growth.It stuck by its 2020 outlook on Thursday, and its shares were up about 3% at 88.6 pounds after product sales of $6.05 billion in the three months to June surpassed consensus of $6.01 billion. The figure excludes payments from tie-ups.Core earnings of 96 cents per share beat analysts’ expectation of 93 cents.

The ministry has clarified that the order will not affect any ongoing vital infrastructure projects of the railways. “Ministry of Railways has to abide by the instructions of the ministry of finance. However, sufficient resources exist and have been provisioned for to ensure that wheels of progress and modernization continue to move at rapid speed. The order is not going to impact any of vital infrastructure projects of Railways. It is not going to impact our mission of 100% electrification of routes, doubling tracks, any of railway high speed corridors or DFCCIL, vital signalling projects, projects to launch new modern trains/locomotives, passenger amenities or any project to enhance safety,” the ministry told HT.“It may be noted that there is no reduction in capital expenditure for infra works. The full capex would be utilised. Ministry of finance order will not to impact railways’ massive infrastructure development program,” the ministry added. The order issued by the railway board refers to a directive issued by the finance ministry in June on government spending in the year.In a communication sent to all zones and public sector undertakings (PSU) on Tuesday, the railway board said projects that were previously approved but have made insignificant progress “shall be kept frozen till further orders except those which are essentially required for safe running of trains”.The board has instructed zonal railways to review all projects already approved by them.“Exemption for sanction of works which are considered essential and inescapable will be obtained from the ministry of finance,” the order added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vital-railway-infrastructure-projects-to-continue-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-v6i5fRuLuCNevPBJaBlC4H.html
31-07-2020||India||Concretisation, digging killing Lutyens’ heritage trees: Experts||On May 6, a towering Neem tree on central Delhi’s Kasturba Gandhi Marg fell dead. This piece of Delhi’s history, which was planted during the British rule, was estimated to be nearly 90 years old and had a girth of 1.8 metres. In the municipal survey report, the cause of the death was simply identified as “hollowness”. According to New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) data accessed by HT, 1,475 trees have fallen, or dried up and died, or been cut down for construction activities between 2015 and July 3 this year. Apart from ageing, experts blame concretisation and digging of trenches to lay underground cables for the tree deaths, which they say is causing tremendous ecological damage. Environmental activists and experts say that despite a 2013 National Green Tribunal (NGT) order placing a ban on construction anywhere within a one-metre radius of a tree trunk, such activities continue. Frequent soil digging to lay underground cables — which causes severe damage to roots of trees — and the lowering of the water table , which dries out the tap-root , are also reasons behind tree deaths, according to the experts. In Lutyens’ Delhi, the avenue trees that have fallen in about five-and-a-half years include pilkhan trees on Dr Zakir Hussain Marg; neem trees on Abdul Kalam Road and Prithviraj Road; and imli (tamarind) trees on Tilak Marg and Akbar Road. Nearly 30% of these trees were “heritage trees” that were over 100 years old. The others were planted between 1920 and 1935 during the construction of Lutyens’ Delhi. Beginning 1912, British planners and arboriculturists planted a specific variety of tree on each avenue. For example, neem trees were planted on Shahjahan Road and Abdul Kalam Road, among others, and jamun on Ashoka Road and Rajpath. Author and environmentalist Pradip Krishen said trees in the Lutyens’ zone not only have ecological value but are also historically important. “Even though NDMC is now planting the second line of trees in these avenues, it is no excuse to not take care of the older trees. It will take these new trees years to attain enough height and girth to provide the benefits that the older ones are providing,” Krishen said. He added: “The loss of any tree is bad news for us, but these trees carry a lot of history with them. Each variety of trees was selected for each avenue keeping the aesthetics and its surroundings in mind. These are a part of the Capital’s history, and horticulture departments must have the good sense to preserve it.” Data shows that this year alone, 41 trees died in the NDMC area due to various reasons such as damage to roots, hollowness, and storms. In 2019, a total of 229 trees died. Out of them, 50 were uprooted and 172 dried up. Two were cut for construction work and five were cut because they were categorised as “dangerous”. This year, NDMC has set a target of planting 5,116 trees. In 2019, the agency planted nearly 10,000 trees. However, the survival rate of saplings in this area is 50-60%. During an inspection conducted in 1999 to ascertain the reason behind the high mortality of Imli trees on Tilak Marg and Akbar Road, a multi-disciplinary team comprising members from the Dehradun-based Forest Research Institute found that these old trees were mainly falling because of “developmental activities” such as laying of underground electrical wires, telephone cables and water pipelines, according to the findings. NDMC’S horticulture department is in charge of the maintenance of the trees. S Chellaiah, director (horticulture), NDMC, said the trees are primarily uprooted because of concretisation, laying of underground utilities and soil compaction. He stressed that the civic agency is concerned that the falling of these full-grown trees will not only be an environmental loss but also a loss of heritage. “Considering that most of the wiring [for electricity cables, CCTV cameras, street lights etc.] is laid underground, you will find a web of cables around tree roots. Even if roots are cut or damaged during the digging of trenches, they slowly start decaying and eventually die. Other reasons for trees getting uprooted are concrete-centric development and ageing. Even older trees could have lived for 10-20 years longer if it weren’t for constant digging and concretisation,” Chellaiah said. The civic agency says it has been proactive in checking trenching work and concretisation to prevent more trees from falling. Early July, NDMC issued a show-cause notice to Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL) after reports of damage to trees on Sardar Patel Marg in Chanakyapuri during work to lay underground cables for installing CCTV cameras along the route. CR Babu, professor emeritus at the Centre for Environment Management of Degraded Ecosystems at Delhi University, said concretisation is a major reason behind trees choking to death across the Capital, but the loss increases when the victims are old, avenue trees. “Concrete and overhead and underground wiring choke roots and damage canopies. Even though the government has maintained the avenue trees well, by paying a little more attention, we can protect the city’s heritage for some more years. The trees in other parts of the city are in worse conditions. Even if they aren’t chopped off, they die a slow death,” Babu said. The area under NDMC (43.7 sq km) accounts for just about 3% of the entire city (1484 sq km). Nearly 50% of the NDMC area is under green cover. Explaining the ecological benefits of the trees, Babu said: “If you assess based on numbers, why does Lutyens’ Delhi always have lower pollution levels compared to the rest of the city? It is because of this canopy of trees that are planted along both sides of the roads there. Trees are efficient scavengers of dust; the amount of dust trapped by these trees is very high. Also, you cannot depend on new plantation because the survival rate of saplings is very low across municipalities, and it takes years for the few survivors to become fully-grown trees.” Officials in the three other municipalities in Delhi (north, south and east Delhi municipal corporations), who did not want to be named, said they do not have a proper log of the number of trees in their area and the reasons behind tree deaths. Officials said even if there are trees in their areas that are older than 100 years, they are neither categorised in terms of plantation dates nor are they treated with any additional care.“We are yet to have a proper tree census to ascertain the number of trees in our area and the reasons behind the death of each tree. We don’t have the means or the finances to undertake such a detailed analysis,” said a senior horticulture department official of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/concretisation-digging-killing-lutyens-heritage-trees-experts/story-TyBADzE3eBR6VlPAeqcIvK.html
31-07-2020||India||How will Covid-19 interact with India’s infection season?||Infections are the single biggest ailment reported by Indians and they peak during the monsoon, the July-September quarter. Infections are the lowest during peak summer; the April-June quarter. Nine out of ten people who get infections also report a fever. These statistics are based on an HT analysis of unit level data from a 2017-18 National Statistical Office (NSO) survey on consumption of health services in India. When read with the ongoing pandemic, these statistics should ring alarm bells. August and September are still to come. India’s daily confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease and positivity rate – confirmed cases as a proportion of tests – are still rising. A spike in infection-driven fevers means that more symptomatic suspected Covid-19 patients are likely to land at hospitals/testing centres even if they don’t have that illness.The pros and cons of different kinds of tests could also create a policy dilemma. The RT-PCR tests are the gold-standard when it comes to detecting Covid-19, but they take more time to give results. Antigen tests produce quick results, but they are more susceptible to generating false negatives (which means they may show people to be uninfected when they are actually infected). At a time when symptomatic suspected cases are expected to rise, should India prioritise RT-PCRs over antigen tests? Not necessarily, suggests experience from many countries in the southern hemisphere. According to the NSO report, the share of infections in reported ailments increases by 1.5 times between the June and September quarters. The share of persons reporting infections more than doubles between June and September , from 1.6% to 3.6%. The nearly 2 percentage point difference here means a difference of about 25 million people in a country of roughly 1.3 billion people. The share of persons reporting an infection was the second-highest in the post-monsoon season, from October to December. The share of persons reporting ailments other than an infection was roughly the same across the year. This pattern is seen in both rural and urban areas of India. See Chart 1: Share of Indians reporting infections and other ailments  In normal circumstances ( the survey was conducted at such a time), 61% of those who reported infections sought treatment at a private clinic, a private hospital or with an informal healthcare provider. Nearly 24% sought treatment at a government hospital. Because most infection patients are likely to show Covid-19 symptoms such as fever, this means an increase in suspected cases at hospitals and clinics. Fifteen percent of infected patients did not seek any treatment. Of those who did not seek treatment, an overwhelming 79% did not consider the ailment serious enough. As is to be expected, the headline numbers hide significant state-wise divergence: 43% people suffering from infections did not seek any treatment in Bihar. This number was only 3.2% in Tamil Nadu. Similarly, 31% of the patients in Bihar did not consider the ailment serious enough, against only 3% in Tamil Nadu. See Chart 2: Share of infection patients who did not consider the ailment serious enough to seek treatment  To be sure, it is entirely possible that the pandemic has changed this behaviour among people, and they are pro-actively seeking tests and treatments. Another possibility is that the lockdown and continuing mobility restrictions might have significantly enhanced precautionary measures and therefore reduced infections this monsoon. For example, community mobility data from Google until 21 July shows that people were spending significantly less time outside than the baseline scenario, which is based on median value during the five week period from 3 January to 6 February, 2020. That could mean less chance of an infection.  See Chart 3: Decline in outdoor mobilityInternational evidence also points towards such a possibility. Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that countries across the Southern Hemisphere are reporting significantly lower cases of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and other seasonal respiratory viral infections this year. It attributed this to measures as mask use and restrictions on air travel amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Maybe India could catch a similar lucky breakProfessor Indranil Mukhopadhyay, who teaches public health at Jindal School of Government and Public Policy, said decreased mobility and supposedly increased level of precautions that people take may not decrease the prevalence of other infectious diseases in India. “Had that been the case the Covid would have come down,” he said, adding that while it is possible that a higher number of people will seek treatment at a hospital if they show Covid-19 like symptoms, it is also likely that people won’t visit hospitals out of fear of catching the coronavirus there.Mukhopadhyay said monsoon leads to a surge in waterborne diseases, many of which cause Covid-19 like symptoms. “Rapid tests need to be done, otherwise reach would be less,” he said.Dr Sanghita Bhattacharyya, public health specialist at the Public Health Foundation of India, said that even as people are now likely to be more panicked with onset of symptoms such as fever, fear of catching the virus at hospitals can prevent some of them from seeking treatment. “It’s also due to the burden on the health system that people are not getting treatment for other non-covid infections,” she said while advocating for increased use of RT-PCR testing for foolproof diagnosis of symptomatic patients in case there is a surge in symptomatic patients who are actually suffering from other infectious diseases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/number-theory-how-will-covid-19-interact-with-india-s-infection-season/story-1rdls3erG5HKTQWtvHat1K.html
31-07-2020||India||What can explain the mystery of China’s Covid-19 numbers?||No large country in the world has been able to contain the disease to one restricted geography the way China has.According to worldometers.info, it has seen 84,165 cases of the coronavirus disease thus far with only 4,634 deaths. It has only 574 active cases of the disease (all data is till late evening of July 29). Merely by looking at the numbers it is difficult to imagine that the disease which has infected more than 17 million people worldwide, killing close to 670,000 (including over 4.4 million cases and 150,000 deaths in the US, and close to 1.6 million cases and almost 35,000 deaths in India) actually originated in Wuhan, China, from where it travelled, through people, all over the world. Sure there has been a minor flurry of cases in Beijing, but the numbers are far too small to suggest any sort of outbreak.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageOne theory is that the Chinese have completely buried all inconvenient information related to the disease and its fallout within the country. This is true at least in part; Beijing has steadfastly sidestepped calls for a scientific investigation into the origin of the virus. But there is nothing to suggest that it has engaged in a massive cover-up to hide outbreaks in other parts of the country.Which is why its Covid-19 numbers are a mystery. This column has pointed out that the pandemic has followed roughly the same trajectory in most countries. It has also pointed out that its trajectory has been similar in large countries such as the US, Brazil, and India, with concentrated outbreaks in a few areas that gradually spread to other areas, which then started seeing similar outbreaks. China is the world’s most populous country and the third largest country by geographical area. The US is the fourth largest, Brazil the fifth, and India the seventh (India is the second most populous country in the world, the US the third, and Brazil the sixth).A recent paper in Science may have the answer. According to the paper, by Benjamin Cowling and other researchers, mostly at the University of Hong Kong, China’s ability to stop Covid-19 in its tracks may have to do with its ability to manage the serial interval. In epidemiology, the serial interval is the gap between the onset of symptoms in Person A, and Person B, who is infected by Person A. The researchers’ main finding is the title of the paper: “Serial interval of SARS-CoV-2 was shortened over time by nonpharmaceutical interventions”.The researchers found that the serial interval in Wuhan came down from 7.8 days to 2.6 days between early January and early February. They hypothesise that this was made possible by China’s aggressive contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation protocols, which meant that all infections arising from one infected individual happened in a short period of time (in this case, 2.6 days), thereby ensuring that infected people, because they were isolated, could not infect any more people later in the infection cycle. The result, according to the researchers, was fewer cases. The sooner an infected person was isolated, the researchers found, the shorter was the serial interval. Their paper also explains that the serial interval is related to other epidemiological parameters, such as the attack rate of a virus (the proportion of people exposed to the virus over a period of time) and the reproduction rate or R naught, the number of people who will be infected by one infected person.At this point, what Cowling and Co have proposed is a theory (backed by data and research), albeit a very plausible one.It is also one that emphasizes the only way to deal with the coronavirus disease in the absence of a vaccine or a cure – test, trace, and isolate. And it is proof that better tracing and prompt (and stringent) isolation can lead to flatter infection curves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-can-explain-the-mystery-of-china-s-covid-19-numbers/story-HuG99971H6xng1O4LCNrGP.html
31-07-2020||India||Herd immunity far away, Covid-19 vaccine only option: Health ministry||The herd immunity level is “far away” for the Indian population and it can only be achieved through immunisation by vaccines, a top health ministry official said on Thursday and added that reaching this threshold – believed to be crucial for the Covid-19 outbreak to end – in any other manner will exact too high a cost. The official also hinted that India is looking at a multilateral, WHO-led mechanism to secure Covid vaccines and the country is yet to begin direct discussions with any of the developers that are leading the development race.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“For a large country like India, herd immunity cannot be a strategic choice or a strategic option... It will come at too high a cost and can be done only through immunisations via vaccination,” said Rajesh Bhushan, the officer on special duty, health ministry, during a briefing on Thursday. The march of an infectious disease such as Covid-19 can be halted only when there is a large enough proportion of the population that is immune to it – a threshold known as herd immunity. Besides a vaccine, which is yet to be approved, the only way people become immune is if they have had the disease and recovered.“Government has not signed an agreement with any vaccine manufacturing company. There are multiple stakeholders within and outside government and ministry of health has started actively engaging with such stakeholders. It’s too premature to comment on supply and distribution of vaccine at this stage but whenever it comes it has to be deployed on a much larger scale than the existing vaccines,” said Bhushan. Bhushan also said the question on who would get the vaccine first was still under deliberation at the health ministry. World over, there are roughly 25 vaccines in human trial phases – including two from India. Three vaccine candidates – one each from US, UK and China – are largely regarded as the frontrunners since they are now at advanced stages of experiments among people. Several countries have entered into commercial deals with the UK candidate’s developer AstraZeneca and the US candidate’s Moderna. “India is in touch with global multilateral organisations such as GAVI, CEPI, WHO etc. to see how it can be made accessible for people in India,” said Bhushan. GAVI (Gavi-The Vaccine Alliance) and CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations) have partnered with WHO and several of the vaccine developers to help pool resources for the production, acquisition of distribution of any potential Covid-19 vaccine, with fair access being one of the factors that they will keep in mind. The two Indian vaccine candidates are Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Zydus Cadila’s ZyCov-D, both in phase I/II human trials for determining its safety and dosage. About 141 vaccine candidates globally are in the pre-clinical stage, which means these are into research stages or in pre-clinical trials where animal experiments are taking place to generate toxicity data.The virus strain isolated for Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin was isolated at the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV) in Pune, and transferred to the company. It received central drugs controller’s approval for early human trials on June 29. Zydus Cadila’s vaccine candidate is called ZyCov-D, a DNA plasmid vaccine that received drug controller’s approval for early human trials on July 2. The candidate was developed indigenously at the company’s Vaccine Technology Centre in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, and uses DNA to train the body to recognise parts of Sars-Cov-2 and build an immune response. Experts said vaccine is the most cost-effective way to achieve immunity against an infectious disease. “The vaccine will be ultimate to check the disease spread but we don’t know when an effective vaccine will be available for use even though all our efforts are being directed towards making it happen as soon as possible. A good vaccine is the most cost-effective way of preventing a disease,” said Dr Amita Jain, head, microbiology department, KGMU, Lucknow. Till the time a vaccine comes, Covid-19 appropriate behaviour such as wearing a mask, maintaining physical distancing, and maintaining hand hygiene, etc, will work the best, Bhushan said at the briefing. As the Covid-19 outbreak turned into a pandemic, epidemiologists around the world said countries would need to use a combination of suppression (not letting the virus spread) and mitigation (focussing on helping infected people and letting the virus spread in a limited manner to allow immunity to build up) strategies till a vaccine is developed. For India, the second part has been deemed as not feasible since the country has fewer hospitals per person than developed countries – which raises the possibility of health services being overwhelmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/herd-immunity-far-away-vaccine-only-option-govt/story-Ov9cp9oWXWCSSYX4QLrrAI.html

Modi didn’t refer to other countries involved in development cooperation in the neighbourhood, though he appeared to be making a distinction between Indian aid and Chinese-backed projects, including the Belt and Road Initiative that have led to several countries in the region falling into a “debt trap”. “For India, the most fundamental principle in development cooperation is respecting our partners. This sharing of development lessons is our only motivation,” Modi said. “That is why our development cooperation does not come with any conditions. It is not influenced by political or commercial considerations,” he said. In the Indian Ocean region, Sri Lanka leased the strategic Hambantota port to a Chinese firm for 99 years in 2017 after the country was unable to repay Chinese loans for developing the facility. The current government of the Maldives has sought India’s help to cope with massive loans taken from China by the previous regime. India’s development and security cooperation with smaller Indian Ocean states has been a key part of its “neighbourhood first” policy, with work continuing on projects in areas ranging from health care to defence amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Modi highlighted his government’s vision of “Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR)” for the Indian Ocean region and said: “Our development partnerships reflect the development priorities of our partner nations.” Modi outlined the projects taken up and completed in diverse fields through India’s development partnerships, including the Parliament building in Afghanistan, the Mahatma Gandhi Convention Centre in Niger, an emergency and trauma hospital in Nepal, and emergency ambulance services in all nine provinces of Sri Lanka. An oil pipeline project being implemented with Nepal will ensure the availability of petroleum products in the Himalayan nation, while another scheme will provide drinking water and sanitation in 34 islands of the Maldives. “We have tried to make cricket popular in countries as diverse as Afghanistan and Guyana by helping build stadiums and other facilities,” he said. The Supreme Court building in Port Louis, built with grant assistance of $28.12 million, is part of a special economic package of $353 million provided by India. Other infrastructure schemes taken up under this package are the Metro Express project worth $275 million, the first phase of which has been completed, a $14-million ENT Hospital, which too has been completed, and a social housing project with nearly 1,000 units. India is the largest development partner for Mauritius, to which it has provided lines of credit worth $600 million on concessional terms. India is assisting in the building of health care facilities such as a renal unit, four medical clinics and two health centres in the country. Modi said India is also focusing on sustainable development through institutions such as the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. “Both initiatives are of special relevance to island countries,” he added. In his speech, Jugnauth thanked the government and people for their solidarity in trying times amid the pandemic. He said Mauritius had benefited from medicines and equipment supplied by India and the three-week-long deployment of a medical team on board the Indian warship INS Kesari. He described the new Supreme Court building as a milestone in the modernisation of the infrastructure of Mauritius that will enable the judiciary to use new technologies to make justice more accessible to all. Judges often had to wait to use the limited number of courtrooms at the old building to hear cases, he added. Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said India’s development projects in South Asia and Africa highlighted how the approach of Indian policy-makers was different from that of the Chinese. “India’s projects are part of a partnership of equals, not in terms of resources but in terms of mutual respect. China says the same thing but the facts show otherwise. If the same was true in the case of China, something like Hambantota port wouldn’t have happened,” he said. “India opts for elaborate and lengthy consultations on these projects, which are based on the needs of other countries – we don’t fly down to a country and say this is what you’re going to get.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-we-help-partners-without-preconditions/story-sEGhwGkuK8w8BPsGLAaxVO.html
31-07-2020||India||House panel meeting called on draft EIA||Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar and his predecessor Jairam Ramesh’s tussle over the Centre’s draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) 2020 is set to enter the next phase, with Ramesh deciding to discuss the draft policy in the environment panel of the Parliament.Ramesh’s decision to call a House panel meeting on the subject was prompted by Javadekar’s letter to him that mentioned “government decisions are always open for scrutiny by Parliament and standing committees.”Even as recommendations of House panels are not binding upon the government, any critical report of the EIA 2020 can be construed as institutional disapproval and remain as a reference for the future debate or policymaking. A panel can also seek action-taken reports from the ministry on its recommendations.Ramesh, the chairman of the standing committee on environment, science and technology, has invited ministry officials on August 7. A notice for the meeting has been circulated and it mentions that soft copies of relevant documents would be distributed and no physical copies would be provided due to Covid restrictions.The former union minister recently wrote to Javadekar to record his “strongest objections” to the draft on grounds that “it allows for post-facto approvals which go against the very principle of assessment; it reduces public participation in all steps of environment clearance process; it does away with environment impact assessment altogether in many cases of expansion; increases validity of environmental clearances allowing projects to secure land for longer durations and it gives union government full powers to appoint state environment impact assessment authorities.”Javadekar replied that the Congress leader’s concerns were “unfounded” and based on “misrepresentation”.The minister also wrote to Ramesh on July 26, saying, “I will reply you in detail. Government will finalise after considering various suggestions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-panel-meeting-called-on-draft-eia/story-4FgK2dCs3vOWDoklsDwqNP.html
31-07-2020||India||ED seeks copy of FIR against Rhea Chakraborty||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has asked for a copy of the FIR registered by Bihar Police against Rhea Chakraborty and others in connection with the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, officials said on Thursday. The agency will study the police FIR to assess if it merits a probe under the prevention of money laundering act (PMLA). Sushant Singh Rajput’s father, Krishna Kumar Singh, has alleged in his complaint to the Bihar Police that there was a transaction of Rs 15 crore from one of the accounts of his son. He has also alleged that Chakraborty had kept Rajput away from his family and completely in her possession, and that she was also handling his bank account. If the case merits an investigation, the ED will probe if anyone used the actor’s income for money laundering and creating illegal assets. On Tuesday, the actor’s father had lodged an FIR against Chakraborty, her family members and six others on charges of alleged abetment to suicide. The Bihar Police lodged a case under various IPC sections, including 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrongful confinement), 380 (theft in dwelling house), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating) and 306 (abetment of suicide). The Supreme Court, earlier on Thursday, dismissed a PIL seeking transfer of the probe into Sushant Singh Rajput’s death from Mumbai Police to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). A bench, comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said that the Mumbai Police should be allowed to complete the investigation and if there is a, then a plea should be filed before the Bombay High Court. The actress had moved the Supreme Court on Wednesday seeking a stay on the investigation by the Bihar Police on the FIR filed against her by Sushant Singh Rajput’s father for allegedly abetting the suicide of his son. The Mumbai Police is already investigating the actor’s death. Meanwhile, a Bihar police team has also reached Mumbai to investigate the allegations against Rhea Chakraborty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-seeks-copy-of-fir-against-rhea-chakraborty/story-cddpfv6Q0AY6Q6TaWbX56N.html
31-07-2020||India||SC turns down demand for CBI probe in Sushant Singh Rajput case||The Supreme Court on Thursday turned down the demand for a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput even as his family and the Bihar government filed separate caveats to deny actor Rhea Chakraborty, who is accused of abetting the suicide, any immediate relief in the case.The top court’s order came on a public interest litigation that asked for a court-monitored probe and said Rajput was a generous person who supported charities. But the bench, comprising Chief Justice of India SA Bobde and justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, wasn’t convinced. “This matter has nothing to do with the fact whether the person was good or bad. The case is being investigated by the Mumbai Police. We are dismissing this petition,” the bench held. The 34-year-old actor was found dead in his Bandra flat in Mumbai on June 14. Since then, Mumbai Police have questioned 45 people, including top directors and producers but family of the actor – who hailed from Bihar – has remained unconvinced with the probe. Last week, Rajput’s father KK Singh filed a police complaint in Patna that alleged Chakraborty and her family members of abetting the suicide, prompting Bihar Police to send a team of officers to Mumbai for the probe. Chakraborty and Rajput were in a live-in relationship.On Wednesday, Chakraborty filed a petition in the apex court asking the FIR to be transferred to Mumbai from Bihar. She alleged that Rajput’s father had used his influence to rope her into the case. Chakraborty had also been questioned by Mumbai Police earlier. But on Thursday, Rajput’s family filed a caveat seeking her petition not be heard without a notice or a hearing to the family. Later in the day, the Bihar government also filed a caveat and announced it hired senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi to appear on behalf of state government to oppose Chakraborty’s plea.Advocate Keshav Mohan appearing for Bihar, confirmed the development and said, “The Bihar government is a necessary party in this case as the petition by Rhea Chakraborty has challenged the jurisdiction of Bihar government to pursue the FIR lodged by KK Singh.” A caveat is a pre-emptive legal measure taken to ensure that a party does not get any favourable order without a notice or a hearing accorded to the opponent.A senior Bihar government official said the administration might recommend CBI probe in the case, agreeing to the demand by Rajput’s family. The official said that Bihar government had the right to recommend a CBI probe because an FIR was lodged in its jurisdiction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-turns-down-demand-for-cbi-probe-in-sushant-singh-rajput-case/story-WCJh1VmQ917Vva2oFABbpJ.html
31-07-2020||India||Pakistan court forms special bench to hear Kulbhushan Jadhav case||A special bench of a Pakistani court is set to take up the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the former Indian Navy officer sentenced to death for alleged involvement in spying, even as New Delhi said on Thursday that Islamabad haS blocked all its efforts to seek remedies in the case.A special bench of the Islamabad High Court headed by chief justice Athar Minallah will hear Jadhav’s case from August 3, Pakistan’s Geo News channel reported. A lawyer will also be appointed to represent Jadhav on Monday, it added.The Pakistani government this week tabled the International Court of Justice (Review and Reconsideration) Ordinance, 2020, in Parliament for approval. The ordinance was promulgated to allow Jadhav, 50, to appeal the death sentence given to him by a military court in 2017.In New Delhi, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a virtual weekly news briefing that Pakistan has systematically blocked all of India’s attempts to seek remedies for Jadhav.He accused Pakistan of violating the 2019 judgement of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which called for an effective review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentencing of Jadhav, and its own ordinance.Pakistan, Srivastava said, has not provided unhindered, unimpeded and unconditional access to Jadhav or the official documents requested by India. “Their actions expose the farcical nature of their approach to this issue,” he said.“We reserve our position in this matter, which includes the right to avail further remedies. I’ll also reiterate that we stand committed to protect the life of our national Kulbhushan Jadhav,” Srivastava said.The Pakistani government petitioned the Islamabad high court on July 22 to appoint a lawyer to represent Jadhav for filing a review petition against his sentence. The defence secretary and the judge advocate general branch of the military were made parties to the petition filed by the law ministry.The petition contended Jadhav had refused to file a review petition against his sentence and that India was reluctant to avail of the remedies under the ordinance.India has dismissed these contentions and said that a Pakistani lawyer appointed by it was unable to file a review petition on July 18 as he was not provided necessary documents by Pakistani authorities. Indian officials walked out of a meeting with Jadhav on July 16 after Pakistan breached assurances of providing unimpeded consular access.Jadhav was arrested by Pakistani security agencies in Balochistan in March 2016 and charged with involvement in spying. India rejected the allegations and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business. The ICJ ruled that Pakistan violated Jadhav’s rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and stayed his execution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spl-bench-in-pak-to-hear-jadhav-case/story-YO2OpO1r9LJAEqeXu49W3N.html
31-07-2020||India||Smuggled to UK, rare Shiva statue on way home||London: An exquisite 9th-century Natesh Shiva statue, which was smuggled to the UK after being stolen from the Ghateshwar temple in Rajasthan’s Chittorgarh district in February 1998, will be returned the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) on Thursday, according to the Indian high commission.Indian officials said British authorities were alerted in 2003 when it emerged the statue had been smuggled to the UK. They contacted a private collector, who was in the statue’s possession and had him voluntarily return it to the Indian high commission in 2005. The statue has been displayed prominently at London’s India House.  “For the past few years, the Government of India has been giving renewed impetus to protect India’s cultural heritage and showcasing it to the world. The ministry of external affairs along with India’s law enforcement agencies has been very active in pursuing the investigations and restitution of our stolen and smuggled antiquities”, said an Indian high commission spokesperson. “Accordingly, antiquities and idols have been returned back to India from various countries including the USA, Australia, France and Germany”, he added.In August 2017, an ASI team examined the idol and confirmed it to be the one stolen from the Ghateshwar temple in Chittorgarh’s Baroli village.Several such priceless items have been recovered in the UK and handed over to the Indian mission. The mission has been working with British law enforcement authorities to trace, seize, and retrieve stolen artifacts.Recent items recovered and returned to India include a 17th-century bronze idol of Navanitha Krishna and a 2nd-century limestone carved pillar motif by the US embassy on August 15, 2019. A 12th-century bronze statue of Buddha was handed over by Scotland Yard on August 15, 2018. A Bramha-Brahmani sculpture, which was stolen from the world heritage site Rani Ki Vav in Gujarat, was returned to ASI in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/smuggled-to-uk-rare-shiva-statue-on-way-home/story-s8mRVxCOzacMAcLIFXDMeK.html
31-07-2020||India||Space dept lists responsibilities and roles of IN-SPACE||A month after announcing the formation of a nodal agency Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) for commercialisation of space activities in the country, the department of space has detailed its structure, roles and responsibilities. The single-window agency will permit and oversee activities by private sector right from building launch vehicles and satellites to launching it. The agency will also monitor the usage of the data generated by the private spacecrafts and rolling out of any space-based services, according to the document. So far, the industry participation in space activities was limited mainly to building parts for the ISRO missions. However, these included 500 medium and small-scale enterprises, public sector undertaking and private industries. According to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), this has created jobs for around 45,000 people in the country and has matured the Indian industry in manufacturing motor cases, engines, satellite production and rocket motor building to the level of exporting indigenous technologies. “IN-SPACe will be another vertical under the department that will enable private players to carry out space activities. To do so, definitely some systems, like appropriate policies, are required. The Space Activities Bill should comprise this. We are already working on it — we are trying to modify some existing policies to suit the entry of private players. Some of the activities can be started without the Bill. By then, the Bill will also come in and the picture will come together. But for space launched by the private sector, yes, the Bill would be required,” ISRO chairman and secretary of department of space Dr K Sivan had said during the announcement last month. Other sectors such as defence production, telecom, materials, chemicals, and precision engineering have also benefitted from these collaborations. For a complete end-to-end mission – developing the spacecraft, launch vehicle and launching a mission – is infrastructure needed to carry out extensive research and development, integration and testing, and launch port (India has only one space-port in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh). These facilities are capital intensive and take time to establish. IN-SPACe will create a mechanism for sharing the already existing infrastructure in ISRO with the private players. It will also enable the private sector to create temporary infrastructure within Department of Space establishments. The technology, expertise and facilities will be offered to private players either free or at reasonable cost, according to the document. IN-SPACe will also be the nodal agency for approval of any other space-related infrastructure to be built. The newly created agency will have a chairman, technical experts for space activities, safety considerations, legal and strategic experts, and member of the industry and academia. The body will also have members from the prime minister’s officer and from the ministry of external affairs. The decision of IN-SPACe shall be final and binding on all stakeholders, including ISRO. The body will also have a monitoring directorate that will have oversight over space activities till the completion of the missions as per IN-SPACe decisions. It shall report back to the agency for corrective actions needed. Any disputes will be resolved by IN-SPACe and department of space. As per the document released by the department of space, the unresolved disputes will be resolved by an appellate body. “As an interim measure, utilization of TDSAT (Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal) is suggested.” The private sector participation will not be limited to established technologies and ISRO will open up new technology challenges to the industry. The shortlisted proposals will be promoted for part funding by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/space-dept-lists-responsibilities-and-roles-of-in-space/story-WBizPaq4r5I69pDBfanc9M.html

The department of estate confirmed the development to HT. The ministry of housing and urban affairs did not comment on the matter. “Smt. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has also passed on to the CPWD and the Directorate of Estates, a full inventory of privately installed fittings, fixtures etc. She has paid all electricity, water and previous dues and is awaiting the final assessment for the licenCe fee of the month of July from the Directorate of Estates due to her on the 31st July to close all accounts with reference to the allotment and subsequent cancellation of the lease of the government bungalow,” Congress said.She was allotted the Lodhi Estate bungalow on February 21, 1997, as an SPG protectee.Priyanka Gandhi on July 14 dismissed claims that she requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi for an extension of the tenure beyond August 1.“This is FAKE NEWS. I have not made any such request to the government. As per the eviction letter handed to me on July 1, I will be vacating the government accommodation at 35 Lodhi Estate by August 1,” she had tweeted.Urban affairs minister Hardeep Puri countered lleged that a “powerful Congress leader” had requested him to let her stay on at 35 Lodhi Estate on July 4, three days after the eviction notice was served on her.“Facts speak for themselves!

Let’s not sensationalise everything please,” Puri tweeted.The July 1 order issued by the department of estate stated that any stay longer than August 1, would attract “damage charges and penal rent” as per rules.Hours after the notice was served to her on July 1, Priyanka Gandhi paid all her pending dues, amounting to 3,46,677, until June 30, the ministry had said.The allotment of central government bungalows is done through the General Pool Residential Accommodation (GPRA) Rules, 2017, of the directorate of estates.The ministry has already allotted the bungalow to Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Rajya Sabha member and party spokesperson, Anil Baluni. “Talked to Mr Anil Baluni and his wife today.

31-07-2020||India||Delhi HC stays Jaya Jaitly’s 4-year jail term in graft case||The Delhi High Court on Thursday stayed an order passed earlier in the day by the trial court sentencing former Samta Party leader Jaya Jaitly to four years imprisonment in connection with a corruption case dating back to 2001. A trial court on Thursday sentenced three people -- Jaitly, her erstwhile party colleague Gopal Pacherwal and retired Major General (retd) SP Murgai -- tor four-year rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on each of them while convicting them for criminal conspiracy and corruption. The court also directed them to surrender by 5 pm the same day. Even as Pacherwal’s counsel sought time for his client to surrender, Jaitly got relief from the HC. Later in the evening, the trial court also granted time to Murgai time till August 3 to surrender. Justice Suresh Kait suspended the sentence after Jaitly, through her counsel Aditya Vijay Kumar, moved the Delhi HC appealing the conviction and sentence. The case in qustion was registered on the basis of a sting, Operation West End, conducted by news portal tehelka.com in 2000, purportedly exposing alleged corruption in defence deals. The Central Bureau of Investigation submitted a charge sheet against Jaitly and others in 2006. According to the prosecution, Jaitly entered a criminal conspiracy with Murgai, Pacherwal and Surendra Kumar Surekha in 2001. She obtained Rs 2 lakh as illegal gratification from one Mathews Samuel ( a representative of a fictitious firm MS International Westland, London), the agency said. In truth, Samuel was a journalist. On Thursday, while passing the order on sentence, the court said that in “total disregard to the positions they were holding and their social status, they conspired with each other to assist Samuel in pushing its product Hand Held Thermal Imagers (HHTI) into the Indian Army by exercising personal influence upon the concerned officers in the Ministry of Defense, particularly the then Union Defense Minister” George Fernandes. “By their act, they compromised the entire defence system of the country. It is a crime with very wide and huge repercussion for the entire nation and thus cannot be dealt with leniently. For their petty gains, the convicts sought to assist the induction of a product of an unknown fictitious company into the Indian Army, which if done, would have made the Army immensely vulnerable and handicapped in the wake of an enemy attack. The very existence of our country would have come under threat. It was no less than an attack on the independence of our country,” the court said.It added: “In the opinion of this Court, there should be zero tolerance towards corruption in defence procurement deals as these have a direct bearing upon independence and sovereignty of our country. Hence, the crime which these convicts have committed is of highest degree. They certainly do not deserve any mercy. They deserve the harshest sentence. Showing any kind of mercy towards the convicts would be a mockery of justice and sure to excite the fury of the society at large,” the judge said in its order. It said that the “virus of corruption has engulfed the entire fabric of our society, is becoming a major obstacle in the growth and development of our nation”. Reacting to the HC order, Jaitly’s counsel Aditya Vijay Kumar said that it came as a relief that court stayed the sentence after it found merit in their position. Advocate Vikram Panwar, representing Murgai, said that he too would move to the Delhi High Court against the judgment and sentence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-stays-jaya-jaitly-s-4-year-jail-term-in-graft-case/story-y7YdGVLWvH1090KvpZVnQO.html

Vocational courses will also be made available online.Bagless days will be encouraged throughout the year for various types of enrichment activities involving arts, quizzes, sports, and vocational crafts, the policy suggests.The policy also lays special emphasis on developing innate talents in every student. These talents might express themselves in the form of varying interests, dispositions, and capacities. Those students that show particularly strong interests and capacities in a given realm must be encouraged to pursue that realm beyond the general school curriculum.Teacher education will include methods for the recognition and fostering of such student talents and interests. The NCERT and National Council for Teacher Education will develop guidelines for the education of gifted children.Olympiads and competitions in various subjects will be conducted across thecountry, with clear coordination and progression from school to local to state to national levels, to ensure that all students can participate at all levels for which they qualify. Efforts will be made to make these available in rural areas and in regional languages to ensure widespread participation. Public and private universities, including premier institutions like the IITs and NITs, would be encouraged to use merit-based results from National, and International Olympiads, and results from other relevant national programmes, as part of the criteria for admissions into their undergraduate programmes, according to a person in know of the developments.

The court on Wednesday closed a habeas corpus petition filed by Soz’s wife after the administration assured it he was not under detention.“I am [under] house arrest since August 5, 2019, and today [Thursday] press people came and they saw police not allowing me to go out...they [administration] shamelessly told the SC [Supreme Court] that I was a free man. It is so tragic. The SC must feel the necessity of asking the central government why it was told lies...My lawyer will approach a court here about how a lie was told in the Supreme Court,” Soz told HT over phone.Soz, who is a five-time member of Parliament and a former Union minister, said this after a video went viral on social media showing security personnel pulling him away from the boundary wall of his Srinagar house when he was speaking to journalists. Soon after, Soz, who can’t be seen any longer, is heard telling the person who pulled him away not to touch him. Soz added he has over the last year left his house to visit his ailing sister and to travel to Delhi in September and December for treatment. “Whenever I went out of my premises since August 5, 2019, I had to obtain permission from the government,” he said. He added additional security personnel had been deployed at his house. “I asked one of them ‘how can he touch me. This is my house and you go out’. Look at the high-handedness of that policeman; he was in civvies and I did not know him. But what can the Kashmir police do, they are also under pressure.”Also read | Time to heal Kashmir’s wound, look to future within India: Supreme CourtHundreds of people, including three former chief ministers, were detained in August last year as part of measures to prevent protests against the nullification of the Constitution’s Article 370 that ended Jammu & Kashmir’s special status. A communications blackout and a lockdown were imposed but most of the restrictions have since been eased even as the mobile internet remains restricted. Two former chief ministers Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah were released in March while Mehbooba Mufti remains under detention.Jammu & Kashmir lieutenant governor GC Murmu did not respond to questions about Soz’s detention.The Jammu and Kashmir administration’s spokesperson and principal secretary, Rohit Kansal, reiterated the government’s stand that Soz was never under detention or arrest. “...He has been to Delhi twice- in October and December.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted Soz’s video and hit out at the government over the former Union minister’s illegal detention. “The illegal detention of political leaders with absolutely no basis damages the fabric of our nation. Mr Soz must be released at once.”Congress lawmaker Shashi Tharoor, too, shared the video and termed Soz’s treatment a “national disgrace”.Omar Abdullah said 15 leaders of his National Conference were also illegally detained like Soz. “Soz Sahib’s plight is not unique. @JKNC_has gone to court because more than 15 of our colleagues are similarly illegally detained & I have no doubt the administration will claim they aren’t detained...”Mufti’s daughter, Iltija Mufti, said Soz was manhandled for speaking to media. “I faced the same situation in January when I tried to address media at my house in Srinagar.”Bharatiya Janata Party spokesman Anil Gupta questioned the video’s authenticity and added if the administration has said Soz is not under detention, then he is free. “Soz is playing the victim card to gain sympathy.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/under-house-arrest-from-aug-5-sc-must-question-centre-soz/story-WlamfkFZZqfO1ZfASv33GO.html
31-07-2020||India||29 tigers present in Dibang block: Report||An estimated 29 tigers were present in Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang-Kamlang-Namdapha Block, according to the Status of Tigers, Co-predators, and Prey in India report (2018) released on Tuesday. The confirmation of the big cat presence based on scat samples and camera trap images comes amid concerns about the proposed diversion of large forest areas around Dibang Valley Wildlife Sanctuary for a power project and a dam. Experts say the projects will impact both the tigers and their prey.The 3,097 MW Etalin Hydropower Project will impact 1150.08 hectares and the Dibang Multipurpose Dam 4,577.84 hectares in the unclassified state forests and other community lands. Both are under different stages of the Union environment ministry’s consideration.Two adult individual tigers were photographed in the sanctuary in 2018 during the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA)’s tiger estimation, according to the report. Dibang Valley holds unique importance for in-situ conservation of this “unique and genetically diverse lineage of tigers” as the local aboriginal community of Idu Mishmis considers tigers as their elder brothers, it added.One adult tiger was photographed in Dibang Valley during the estimation process in 2014. Molecular signs were also noted. “Tiger presence is repeatedly being seen during camera trap exercises. The Valley is definitely a very good habitat for tigers,” said NTCA member secretary SP Yadav. The 2018 estimation has recommended discussions with Idu Mishmis before proceeding with any notification of the sanctuary as a tiger reserve.Arunachal Pradesh Wildlife Advisory Board member Anoko Mega said the projects will impact both the tiger and tiger prey. “Some of the prey cross the Talon river or are found in abundance along the river like the Mishmi Takin. If the environment ministry really considers the tiger to be an important species, it will not consider projects which will be disastrous for the tiger habitat here. The community had always known there were tigers here,” said Mega. “If at all a tiger reserve is declared here, the boundary should be demarcated after consulting local people so that there is no impact on human habitation.”Wildlife Institute of India (WII) researchers identified 11 individual tigers, including two cubs, during a three-year camera trap-based study in the sanctuary and the Mishmi hills. They published their findings in the Journal of Threatened Taxa in 2018. But WII, in a report titled Wildlife Conservation Plan for the Impact Zone of Etalin HEP, said there was no tiger presence in the project area.Environment ministry’s Forest Advisory Committee in its factsheet had said Etalin Hydropower project is located in sub-tropical evergreen and rain forests and in a vital tiger area. The Idu Mishmi Cultural & Literary Society (IMCLS) wrote to NTCA and the Union environment, forests & climate change ministry in 2018, saying the community should be consulted before proceeding with notifying the sanctuary as a tiger reserve. “Based on years of empirical research on ecological and social aspects of tigers in Dibang Valley, we strongly believe that the right strategy for Dibang tigers would be to develop a new kind of tiger reserve that is built not with fences and armed patrol guards, but around a cultural model, a culture which has so far proven to be effective in saving the tiger,” wrote IMCLS.The 2018 NTCA report said Arunachal Pradesh has large contiguous forests over 136,000 km, which include Pakke Tiger Reserves, Tale Valley Wildlife Sanctuary, Mouling National Park, D’Ering Wildlife Sanctuary, Mehao Wildlife Sanctuary, Dibang Wildlife Sanctuary, and Kamlamg and Namdapha Tiger Reserve. “Compared to earlier surveys, this landscape unit shows a persisting low-density tiger population…the largest tiger population of Arunachal Pradesh is within pockets of this landscape,” it said. The report added the 1,811 km Trans Arunachal Highway will become a barrier for the movement of the wildlife species in several of these corridors.One in every three tigers in India lives outside reserves, according to the report, highlighting the challenge of protecting India’s national animal and reducing instances of man-animal conflict. The proportion has increased from around one in every four tigers living outside reserves, according to a 2014 study.India recorded a 33% increase in tiger numbers from 2014 to 2018, according to the summary of the report, All India Tiger Estimation Results, released last year. There were 2,967 tigers in 2018, compared to 2,226 in 2014.No tigers were recorded in Mizoram’s Dampa and West Bengal’s Buxa tiger reserves while they face the severe threat of local extinction in Jharkhand’s Palamau reserve, according to the report. Corbett Tiger Reserve, which is among reserves at or nearing capacity, had the largest population of tigers—about 231—in 2018, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/29-tigers-present-in-dibang-block-report/story-I8XhzzZnEhz2f15UxydlwI.html
31-07-2020||India||Australia opposes Chinese attempts to alter status quo along LAC||Australia on Thursday backed India’s position on the border standoff with China, saying it opposes attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) as that could increase the risk of instability.Australian high commissioner Barry O’Farrell conveyed his country’s position to external affairs minister S Jaishankar during a meeting where the two sides discussed developments across the Indo-Pacific region amid the Covid-19 pandemic.The Australian side urges restraint along the LAC and supports continued moves towards de-escalation, said a statement from the Australian high commission.“As I told the external affairs minister of India today, Australia opposes any attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo, which only serves to increase tension and the risk of instability,” O’Farrell was quoted as saying in the statement.“It is important that the bilaterally-agreed principles and norms that have helped prevent escalation or miscalculation in the border areas over many decades continue to be observed.”India has repeatedly said in recent weeks that it is opposed to any unilateral efforts to change the status quo along the LAC, along which tens of thousands of Indian and Chinese troops continue to be deployed.There has been growing convergence between India and Australia on security issues and the role of China in the Indo-Pacific in recent months. The two sides elevated their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership and signed an agreement for reciprocal access to military logistics during a virtual summit last month.Australia, which is set to be invited to join the Malabar naval exercise conducted by India, Japan and the US, has also backed India’s calls for reform of international bodies such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and sought a probe into the origins of the pandemic.During a meeting of the US and Australian defence and foreign ministers in Washington on Tuesday, the two countries envisaged a key role for India in defence cooperation and post-Covid-19 recovery efforts in the Indo-Pacific.The Australian mission’s statement further said that “Australia remains vigilant about strategic trends inimical to our vision of the region” even as it focuses on the health and economic impacts of the Covid-19 crisis.Australia envisages an Indo-Pacific that is an open, free, rules-based region that is “resilient to coercion” and supported by inclusive institutions, the statement said. “Territorial disputes and competing claims should be resolved peacefully by the claimant countries, and in ways consistent with international law,” it added.Australia also continues to be deeply concerned by China’s actions in the South China Sea that are “destabilising and could provoke escalation”, the statement said. On July 23, Australia lodged a note with the UN Secretary General refuting China’s “unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea”.It added: “It rejects China’s claim to historic rights and internal waters, its assertion of certain maritime zones, and its contention there is wide international recognition of its South China Sea sovereignty claims.”Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at the Australian National University, recently said the Indo-Pacific “serves as a canvas for framing policy responses to Chinese power”, including a web of security cooperation based on the US alliance system, and “emerging middle power coalitions, involving Japan, India, Australia and occasionally others such as Southeast Asian or even European states”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/australia-opposes-chinese-attempts-to-alter-status-quo/story-AKEFYdf5X1tSwEH0bYI1nM.html
31-07-2020||India||Ahead of Ram temple ceremony, junior priest, 4 others test Covid +ve||A junior priest at the Ram Janmabhoomi site in Ayodhya, three members of the UP Fire Services and one personnel of the local intelligence unit deployed there tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Thursday, days ahead of the ground breaking ceremony for the new Ram temple, but the person overseeing the project said there is no cause for concern. On August 5, 11 priests from Varanasi and Ayodhya will perform the rituals during the bhumi pujan for the Ram temple , but the junior priest was not part of this group. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to participate in the ceremony. The construction of the temple was made possible by a Supreme Court ruling in November that ended a decades-old dispute and ordered that a Ram temple be built on the disputed Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site. The priest in question is one of the five who perform daily rituals at the current makeshift temple at Ram Janmabhoomi. “There is nothing to worry. One of the priests who performs daily rituals at Ram Janmabhoomi has tested positive. The entire campus will be sanitised on a routine basis,” said Mahant Kamal Nayan Das, successor designate to Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, chairman of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust which is responsible for the temple project. A member of the trust who asked not to be named said the 11 priests would be tested for Covid-19 on August 3, when rituals begin for the three-day ceremony that culminates in the bhumi pujan. Only a few people are being invited for the ceremony on August 5 in light of the social distancing norms necessitated by the pandemic. The number of Covid-19 cases in Uttar Pradesh is on the increase and stood at 81,039 as of Thursday night. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath visited the Ram Janmabhoomi complex on July 25 to review preparations for the event. He requested local saints to attend the ceremony only if they get invites from the trust. Those that do, shouldn’t take along anyone with them, he added. The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust last week issued an appeal to all saints across the country to perform puja in their respective temples and Maths from 11.30 am to 12.30 pm on August 5. Champat Rai, general secretary of the trust, requested people to watch the live telecast of the bhumi pujan on television and light earthen lamps at home in the evening.On Saturday Adityanath said people have waited 500 years for this day and that it would be celebrated on the lines of Deepawali, which, in some parts of the country, is celebrated to mark Lord Ram’s return home to Ayodhya after a 14-year exile.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-ram-temple-ceremony-junior-priest-4-others-test-covid-ve/story-owbUMF99wbIosFosgLSTuJ.html
31-07-2020||India||Sonia Gandhi meets party RS MPs, old vs new debate rages on||An intense old vs new, senior vs new, debate consumed a large part of Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s meeting with the party’s Rajya Sabha MPs on Thursday, with Gandhi even mentioning the need a for a mechanism to improve communication between the two sides. The meeting witnessed an overwhelming demand by party seniors to bring back Rahul Gandhi as Congress president. The MPs also decided to intensify the fight against the Narendra Modi government over the mismanagement of Covid-19 and the economy, and the handling of the India-China border clash at Galwan. Some leaders suggested honest introspection of the party’s performance in elections and pointed at lack of ideological clarity in many leaders. But the first interaction between Gandhi and the Rajya Sabha MPs saw some senior leaders including Ripun Bora and Akhilesh Prasad Singh criticizing the promotion of “neta putras” or dynasts of leaders in the party. Some leaders alleged that while these sons of leaders were given more than they deserved , they often betrayed the party. While Gandhi did not deliver a speech according to people familiar with what happened at the meeting, she said: “Media keeps mentioning that seniors don’t listen to juniors. They should be taken along.’’ She also announced that she was forming a committee that would sort out such communication issues. In the past six months, the Congress has lost Jyotiraditya Scindia to the BJP and now faces a rebellion by Sachin Pilot. Both Scindia and Pilot have been ministers and have for long been spoke off as the party’s next-gen leaders, but they found themselves marginalized by party old-timers. While some of the MPs at the meeting questioned the ability of young leaders to win elections -- both Scindia and Pilot were responsible for revival of the party in respective assembly elections -- others struck a more balanced note, the people cited above added.  Abhishek Manu Singhvi, they said, suggested a more democratic process to use young talents in the party. ro-BJP media. Rajya Sabha leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad and leaders such as Digvijay Singh, Shaktisinh Gohil, Rajeev Satav and Neeraj Dangi led the demand for Rahul Gandhi’s return as Congress President. According to one of the people cited above, almost every MP who spoke wanted Rahul Gandhi back as the party chief.Senior leader Digvijaya Singh said he would not discuss what happened “among Rajya Sabha MPs” but both he and Akhilesh Prasad Singh maintained that the party wants Rahul Gandhi back as president. Sonia Gandhi was critical about the role of governor s and said the BJP wants to finish off Indian democracy, a e reference to Rajasthan governor Kalraj Mishra, and mentioned how the country’s land laws and environment laws are being ignored and misused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-meets-party-rs-mps-old-vs-new-debate-rages-on/story-gIvv8HLNx6hwv9NDHLV8NM.html
31-07-2020||India||Tiger presence in Dibang Valley could pave way for people-led conservation plan||Two adult tigers were photographed in Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang Valley Wildlife Sanctuary in 2018 during the tiger estimation survey by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), according to the 656-page “Status of Tigers, Co-predators and Prey in India” report that was released on Tuesday.The Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has brought out the 2018 report.Dibang Valley holds unique importance for in-situ conservation of this “unique and genetically diverse lineage of tigers” as the local aboriginal community, Idu Mishmis, a sub-tribe of Mishmi and of Mongoloid origin, who speaks the Tibeto-Burman language, considers tiger as the ethnic group’s elder brother, the NTCA has said in its report.In the Dibang-Kamlang-Namdapha block, the report has estimated the presence of 29 tigers based on scat samples and camera-trap images.The confirmation of the presence of tigers in Dibang Valley holds immense importance to the Idu Mishmis because large forest areas around the Dibang Valley Wildlife Sanctuary are being considered for diversion.The proposed 3,097 mega-watt Etalin Hydropower Project is likely to impact 1150.08 hectares (ha) of forestland and the Dibang Multipurpose Dam will impact 4,577.84 ha of un-classified state forest and other community lands.Both the projects are under different stages of consideration by the MoEFCC.In 2014, an adult tiger was photographed in the Dibang Valley during the estimation process. Molecular signs were also noted.“Tiger presence is repeatedly being seen during camera-trap exercises. The Dibang Valley is an ideal natural habitat for tigers,” said SP Yadav, member-secretary, NTCA.The 2018 estimation has recommended that discussions be conducted with the Idu Mishmis before proceeding with any legal notification of the sanctuary to be a tiger reserve.During a three-year-long camera trap-based study in the Dibang Valley Sanctuary and the adjoining Mishmi hills, 11 tigers, including two cubs, were identified by a team of researchers from the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), who had published their results in the Journal of Threatened Taxa in 2018.But, WII in a report titled, “Wildlife Conservation Plan for the Impact Zone of Etalin HEP”, said there was no tiger presence in the project area. “These projects will impact both the tiger and its prey. Some of the prey cross the Talon river or they are found in abundance along the river like the Mishmi Takin. If the MoEFCC authorities consider the tiger to be an important species, then they will not consider projects that will be disastrous for the animal’s habitat. The community had always known about tigers’ presence in their homeland,” said Anoko Mega, member, State Wildlife Advisory Board, Arunachal Pradesh.“If at all a tiger reserve is declared in the area, the boundary should be demarcated after consulting the local indigenous population in a bid to ensure that there is no impact on human habitation,” he added.The Idu Mishmi community members consider tigers as their kin with whom they have been co-existing through the generations.The Idu Mishmi Cultural & Literary Society (IMCLS), an apex community body, had written to NTCA and MoEFCC authorities in 2018, stating that the community would like to be consulted before proceeding with notifying the Dibang Valley Sanctuary to be a tiger reserve.“Based on years of empirical research on ecological and social aspects of tigers in Dibang Valley, we strongly believe that the right strategy to develop a new kind of tiger reserve that is built not with fences and armed patrol guards, but around a cultural model.
