22-07-2020||News||How PM Modi scores on political communication||Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi has reached a new social media milestone, with 60 million followers on Twitter. While this number reflects his popularity, it doesn’t tell the whole story.That story is about how PM Modi has used social media to communicate with people, establishing a new paradigm in political leadership. This is particularly relevant because political communication has become more challenging where multiple, often conflicting, constituencies and issues have to be addressed simultaneously. A leader has to be in constant communication with citizens, allay their anxieties, give them hope, keep them informed, provide guidance and boost morale, and communicate with the international community.PM Modi’s early embrace of technology is well-recognised. In his seminal book, The World Is Flat, Thomas L Friedman wrote that while there was no email in 1992, just over the next 10 years, the world changed so drastically that it became difficult to fathom a world without emails. That is how quickly technology became a part of our lives. Modi was quick to understand the importance of technology in strengthening a participatory democracy, where the state is both accountable and responsive.He has used technology for a democratic purpose and to ensure accountability. The issues of the modern world go beyond gender binaries of providing food, water and shelter. There are subgroups within groups, and all groups have to be spoken to and be heard. There are issues concerning children, transgender communities, working professionals, homemakers, even those who do not want to be classified under any tag. The democratisation of communication, which has been fuelled by the advent of social media, has helped trigger debates on all sorts of issues. This has also put the onus on governments to respond to concerns and injustices. PM Modi has taken the challenge with amazing ease on the domestic front. Both in terms of messaging, and language — he has used different languages to communicate with citizens in his tweets — he has reached out. He has used technology to ensure crucial nation-building tasks and fulfil governance responsibilities. Take the global context — the coronavirus pandemic, the climate crisis debate and the scourge of terrorism have led the world to adopt a multidimensional approach to communication. The need for government heads to talk directly to people has never been greater. In India, the PM has made use of his social media reach to do the needful on this front. For instance, at a time when Indians stared at despair with the sudden lockdown forcing them to stay inside their houses, Modi gave the country a sense of “we are in this together” by asking people to light diyas on their balconies and terraces. By that one act alone, he brought 1.3 billion people of the country together.He has also used technology to enhance citizen awareness. We often don’t see tall leaders talk about everyday issues. But Modi is an exception. He spoke about people throwing garbage on roads and spitting in the open on August 15, 2014. His appeal to people to take to yoga to make health a priority now has made the world follow suit with June 21 being celebrated as World Yoga Day. His accounts have also showcased examples of courage and exemplary citizenship. He has recognised unsung talent, and amplified stories of grit and innovation that had so far remained untold. Finally, he has used technology to ensure peace and harmony. The sheer size of the country and the magnitude of its population opens the room for many fissures and conflicts. But when a leader keeps the channel of communication with his people open, resolutions can be found quickly.It is not just Twitter. To achieve these objectives, there is hardly any social media platform which hasn’t been put to use by the PM. To take his voice deeper into the hinterland of India, Modi took to the radio. With 66 episodes till June 28, Mann Ki Baat is a programme people look forward to every last Sunday of the month. From the economy to Swachh Bharat, from health and spirituality to beating the fear of exams, Modi has spoken his heart out to people and invited citizen participation.With the responsibility to govern a country that prides itself as the world’s largest democracy, the fact that the PM is committed to communicating with citizens shows his democratic commitment and skills. The Twitter milestone is thus just a glimpse of what Modi’s leadership has meant in the past six years.

22-07-2020||News||Overcome the malaise of defection | Opinion||This is not about Rajasthan (full disclosure; I am arguing for the speaker in the high court) nor Madhya Pradesh or Karnataka, though paradigms can be extrapolated from these. This is state- neutral, party-neutral, and politics-neutral. It is about an institutional malaise called defection and party-hopping. It is about every major stakeholder — governor, speaker, defecting Members of Parliament (MPs)/Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs), ruling party defenders and Opposition opportunists — having mud on their face. It is about the need to root out this “constitutional sin” by root surgery.The body politic needs to decide whether acting like Brutus or changing parties midstream for the loaves and fishes of office is sinful. Innumerable Supreme Court (SC) judgments say it is, as do the elaborate parliamentary debates preceding the anti-defection law enacted in 1985. But the “true” Indian politician has circumvented the best-drafted laws through inimitable and unsurpassable jugaad. Here is how.First, if the ruling party wants to prolong itself in office with support from other parties’ legislators acting against their own parties, individual pliant speakers are available to never decide disqualification petitions against them for years. The SC’s lament in the Manipur case (2020) is an example. Worse was Tamil Nadu, which footballed the issue between the high court and a non-deciding speaker for years, while a minority government continued. The SC decided the issue by not deciding in time.The second jugaad is the engineered resignations of legislators in a ruling dispensation by a desperate Opposition promising them lucrative ministerships if they ensure that the Opposition comes to power. It helps that these ”toppling” agents are entitled to at least six months of ministerial portfolios in the new government, even if they fail to get re-elected.Third, there is always the office of governor readily available for misuse. The governor seems to be at his master’s bidding, wrongly ready to interfere by giving unsustainable directions to Speakers to have floor tests within 48/72 hours, only to assist the defectors to topple the government and preclude the speaker from discharging his 10th Schedule duties.Fourth, clear defectors, even after being subjected to ongoing disqualification hearings before the speaker, are advised by lawyers to file no-confidence motions against the speaker under a misconception of law that the SC, in the Nabam Rebia case, rendered a speaker lame-duck and paralysed him the moment a no-confidence was filed against him. Rebia only cautioned against speakers already facing prior and serious pending no-confidence motions from deciding disqualification issues against their accusers. Otherwise, every pending and prior disqualification proceeding could be rendered infructuous by the simple expedient of defectors filing subsequent no-confidence motions against the speaker, rendering the 10th Schedule a dead letter.While individual speakers can certainly be aberrant, generalisations are dangerous. It is forgotten that the speaker is the sole persona designata who can decide disqualification petitions under the 10th Schedule. His job is non-transferable and non-delegable.What is the solution? The common citizen may be forgiven in saying “Plague upon all your houses” to all stakeholders in such a pessimistic scenario. Idealistic lectures and sermons, by commissions/ committees or even the SC, is not going to change the nature of the beast, which is actuated by personal, pecuniary and partisan considerations. But there is a comprehensive solution.One, we should abolish all artificial distinctions which, under the 10th Schedule, earlier had endless wrangles between defection and split, and the later amendment, which now legitimises defections if you are able to induce two-thirds to join you. The 10th Schedule should be replaced with a simple provision itemising all activities, culled from established SC cases, both inside the House and outside it, which will automatically disqualify you and force you to be re-elected in case of anti-party activities.Two, no one who resigns or is disqualified under this new listing, should be allowed to be a minister or corporation post holder, for six months or a year even after re-election. It is instructive to go back to a parliamentary standing committee, which had observed: “..there is possibility for defection ..as the defectors can be accommodated in the Council of Ministers through the other route i.e., by offering a seat in Rajya Sabha/Upper House in the States. Stringent law, which debars defectors who later become Members of the Rajya Sabha to get the post of Ministership, is required.”Three, we should start electing speakers, as in the old British tradition, by all or majority of parties unanimously selecting an appropriate person before each general election as presiding officer and not putting up a candidate against such a pre-selected speaker. The moral and political authority of such a person will be humongous.Four, the governor should be constitutionally and explicitly barred from anything but a ceremonial role in the legislature to prevent meddling in the running of the House and the government.British administrator John Owen once said, “Be killing sin or it will be killing you.” The time has come to kill this constitutional sin. The Indian experience of the dynamics of defection and anti-party activities validates William Shakespeare’s negative recognition of pessimistic reality: “Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall.” India’s constitutional democracy must put right this upside-down balance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/overcome-the-malaise-of-defection/story-u67uwPex371hKPGqlfWd4L.html
22-07-2020||News||China’s belligerence: We are all Hong Kong now | Opinion||In recent decades, the combination of a slow-but-certain incrementalism — couched in parables attributed to Confucius and other Chinese notables — had made Beijing’s diplomatic behaviour inscrutable, and yet, viewed as benign. It gave the country an advantage in being able to change facts on the ground, and attract zero retaliation and minimal critique. It was the perfect excuse for western and Indian companies and governments to look the other way, and continue with the high profits that this authoritarian regime brought.This has now dramatically changed. The rest of the world has a red hot smoking gun of Beijing’s new diplomacy. As two astute American analysts, Kurt Campbell and Mira Rapp-Hooper put it, “Beijing appears less image-conscious now than in the past.” And they argue, “Xi (Jinping) has endured the reputational damage of his government’s ‘Wolf Warrior’ diplomacy (named after a series of nationalistic action films), likely calculating that China ‘will gain more by flexing its military and economic muscles even if it loses some of its soft power along the way’.”Recall, China’s big advantage for the last decades has been its incrementalism. Especially in its foreign policy, its method was to move little-by-little, step-by-step, under-the-radar. This was a strategy of managing to stay just below the level of a full-blown provocation, such that any concrete retaliation by injured parties would look like a hysterical overreaction.In fact, one can apply this insight to other aspects of China’s behaviour too. The World Trade Organization (WTO) is a case in point. China has slowly, deliberately, and quietly chipped away at the rules that underpin the multilateral trading system, but attracted scarce attention. In contrast, President Donald Trump’s diatribes against the WTO, and in-your-face decision to paralyse the Appellate Body of the Dispute Settlement Mechanism, has led even allies to view the United States (US) with disappointment and anger. There is considerable irony in the fact that a sulky US — the guarantor of trade multilateralism for decades — has chosen not to join the parallel interim dispute settlement mechanism (created by the European Union (EU), Norway, Canada and others), but China has. Similarly, deeply frustrated with the World Health Organization (WHO)’s apparent complicity with China, the US announced on May 29 that it would withdraw from the organisation. In doing so, the US has attracted the ire of the great and the good of the world. China, in contrast, for all its mishandling of the pandemic, and in spite of the threats that it issued to countries that demanded an enquiry (such as Australia), still manages to present itself as being on the side of the angels by reiterating its commitment to WHO.The international community cannot dismiss Hong Kong as it has done Chinese excesses in Xinjiang. The issue goes to the heart of international jurisprudence and China’s new aggressive interpretation of its sovereignty. Hong Kong is not “just” another unit in China’s domestic jurisdiction; underpinning the handover of Hong Kong to China was the guarantee of “one country, two systems”. Hong Kong is not “just” another artificial island, being quietly militarised, somewhere in a faraway sea that the West does not need to bother about — in many ways, it is a cornerstone of a liberal, English-speaking, democratic West. Hong Kong is not even “just” another fatal border conflict with India, which the West can dismiss as a product of misperceptions over unclear boundaries drawn by careless colonial masters.What has happened in Hong Kong should matter to all of us because of the deeply worrying repercussions it carries for its citizens. But as foreign policy is too seldom about values, here’s a straightforward reason why all realists should also be concerned about Hong Kong. China’s actions in Hong Kong are a clear signal of the heavy costs that its government is willing to bear to openly assert, consolidate, and further expand its power.The costs for China are huge, both reputational and financial. Hong Kong — along with Taiwan — was a symbol of reassurance that China, despite its different model of governance and development, could co-exist peacefully with other models based on freedom, democracy, and free markets. Besides, the financial attractiveness of Hong Kong stemmed from the fact that there was rule of law, transparency, independent judiciary, checks and balances. Companies knew that they would be given a fair deal, if they entered into conflict with a state-owned enterprise. With these advantages gone, financial costs will be inevitable — and China has shown that it is ready to incur them. This does not augur well for Taiwan, for the region at large, or for global order.And this is why banal statements from all defenders of the liberal multilateral order need to stop. German chancellor Angela Merkel, for instance, still talks remarkably of the need to “seek dialogue” with the Chinese government on the basis of a “relationship of trust”. EU high representative, Josep Borrell, also stated “It is clear that China has a global ambition. But, at the same time, I do not think that China is playing a role that can threaten world peace”. No, Mr Borrell, think what you may, there’s no way you can really know that. None of us can. Because ultimately, we can never know the intentions behind the actions of states. But when states take actions entailing high costs — especially to themselves — these are signals that must not be ignored.We could all be Hong Kong tomorrow. And this is why — and not only for altruism — we should all be acting with one voice, with the people of Hong Kong now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/china-s-belligerence-we-are-all-hong-kong-now/story-8Py6Y4yG36KpwD5csP1YjN.html

Interested parties can set up units in the park to develop all sorts of toys, and the ₹1,000 crore park has the potential to end the current monopoly of China in the toys market, Yeida officials said.Yeida, which is also developing Noida international greenfield airport in Jewar, will open the scheme on Thursday (July 23) inviting applications from interested parties. “We are launching the open-ended Toy Park project on July 23 onwards. The scheme will remain open for 15 days and interested parties can apply to get the land to set up units to manufacture toys. This project has the potential to end our country’s dependency on Chinese products as the manufacturing units in the park will be able to deliver the market requirements,” Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer, Yeida, said .The interested parties can apply for plots under this new scheme on the portal -- https://niveshmitra.up.nic.in/.In 2013, the authority had carved out sectors 32 and 33 from agricultural land near Muradgarhi, Bhaipura and Birampur villages. The same year, Yeida started developing these sectors as an industrial hub and allotting the land to industries. The Yeida, in 2010, decided to develop a Toy Park in this area along the expressway but the project was never shelved. The authority has now revived the project as at least 70 toy manufactures have shown interest in setting up units, officials said.“We have got an expression of interest from 70 applicants who are seeking different plot sizes ranging from 1,000 square metres to 10,000 square metres. We have finalised the park layout in Sector 33 and got approval from our chairman to float the scheme 100 acres. All allotment will be done immediately,” Singh said. The rates for plots will range from ₹4,000-6,700 per square metre, depending upon the size of plots, with bigger plots costing less. “The Union government has increased import duty on toys and also put in Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) provisions for importing toys, thus creating a level playing field for domestic manufacturers,” Singh said.The Toy Association of India said this project will make India self-reliant in the segment.“Toy products business has an annual revenue of ₹12,000 crore in our country and a majority of the supply comes from China, owing to their cheaper rates. But Toy Park products can change the market. This project will help the consumer get the best quality products at reasonable rates,” NK Gupta, convener of Toy Association of India, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/yamuna-authority-s-1-000cr-toy-park-scheme-on-100-acres-opens-july-23/story-GiqipuPXo2UhmTOkGWYMfL.html

The allegations have been denied by revenue officials saying that if structures were built on the urban area land notified under Section 7-A, the TCPD does not issue NoCs and they have no option but to execute the sale deeds.How long is the ban on registration of properties?The revenue department has put an embargo on the registration of properties in rural areas till July 29. For land parcels situated in municipal areas and urban areas declared under Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act and controlled area declared under Punjab Scheduled Roads and Controlled Areas Restriction of Unregulated Development Act, the registration has been stopped till August 5.For land in urban areas and notified under section 7-A of Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act and villages where jamabandis are offline, the embargo will remain till August 15.“ We are planning to introduce three kinds of safety features – an application programming interface (API) of Town and Country Planning department to grant no objection certificate (NoC) for urban area land notified under Section 7-A of Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act, a feature entailing generation of a one-time password (OTP) which will act like a key to confirm that the registration documents has been delivered to the owner of the property and making it mandatory for revenue officials to upload the sale deed copy of each transaction on HALRIS within 24 hours,” an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-stops-property-registration-till-security-features-are-not-installed/story-gJwrtsaStmBVvvelZSJ8aN.html

In Mathematics, 80.18% Class-12 students cracked the exam while 71.52% Class-10 students cleared the exam.

I am sure that the Class 10 results will be better in the coming years. The board is an autonomous that evaluates the performance of students and by restarting Class-8 board exams, weak students will be filtered. Many students did not take studies seriously till Class 8 as they knew they will be passed,” he added.Government Senior Secondary School mathematics lecturer Naveen Soni of Bhiwani’s Gurera also blamed the non–detention policy for students’ dismal performance. .“Government policies need to be revised as we can’t strike out the name of a student who has not come to school for 21 days and he can repeat the same pattern after attending classes for a day. Many students take advantage of such rules. The Class-12 students are more focused towards their target as compared to Class-10 students,” he said.Soni further said that teachers need to access the most scoring portions of syllabus instead of blindly teaching everything.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-board-results-class-12-students-fared-better-than-class-10-students-in-english-hindi-maths/story-6ABR9MeeCG0jXE4JKUWn8M.html

22-07-2020||Chandigarh||2 UT traffic policemen dismissed for accepting ₹500 bribe||A head constable and constable have been dismissed from service for accepting a Rs 500 bribe from a Jammu resident, which was termed “extortion in uniform” by Shashank Anand, deputy inspector general of police (DIG), security and traffic, Chandigarh.Head constable Daljeet Singh and constable Vikas, posted with the traffic wing of Chandigarh police were dismissed with instructions that their suspension from August 20, 2019, to July 21, 2020, not be considered as spent on duty.“This act of commission and omission on part of Daljeet and Vikas, amply manifests their moral turpitude, ignoble intention and proclivity towards corruption and extortion in uniform,” Anand said.He added, “Their continuance in police force even for a single moment more would not only cause irreparable loss to the functioning and credibility of Chandigarh police. Their wilful misconduct of highest order makes them unfit for retention in the police force any longer.”They deserved deterrent punishment without any sympathy so that the rank and file of police force thought twice before committing such acts in future, he added.Jammu resident Rakesh Gupta had alleged through a series of tweets in August 2019, that Daljeet Singh and Vikas had forced him to pay Rs 500 as bribe. In a complaint on the Twitter account of the Chandigarh traffic police, Gupta had said that on August 9, 2019, while driving in his car with a Jammu and Kashmir registration number, he was stopped at the second light point after Sector 43 while going towards Ropar for jumping traffic lights. The two policemen had let him go after taking the money, he alleged.Gupta gave his testimony to the police through video conferencing.Anand also referred to the “well-known practice that police officials target outside vehicles in order to extort money by giving the threat of challan, suspension of driving license and seizure of vehicle.” To check this practice, instructions were repeatedly issued that no vehicle would be stopped by any traffic police official for jumping traffic lights without a special naka being set up and senior officers and traffic marshal present at the spot. Enquiry officer not spared DIG Anand had pulled up the enquiry officer Uday Pal Singh for his failure to fix responsibility on Daljeet Singh and constable Vikas. Talking about the willingness of the enquiry officer to expose malpractices of subordinates, Anand, said, “enquiry officer while holding the delinquent guilty of charge against them has dithered in fixing the responsibility of Daljeet and Vikas, this speaks of lack of moral courage of enquiry officer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2-ut-traffic-policemen-dismissed-for-accepting-500-bribe/story-YTAzZekEk4E5KgepJk6euI.html

22-07-2020||City||Proceedings on Punjab DGP selection can’t be made public: UPSC to HC||Chandigarh Invoking privilege in sharing information, the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has told the Punjab and Haryana high court that the assessment sheet of various police officers considered by the Commission for the appointment of Punjab Director General of Police (DGP) in 2019, can only be shared with the court, not with others.The UPSC response came to a July 2 order of the high court in which the court had posed a number of questions with regard to procedure for appointment of DGPs in the country and also asked the commission to prepare an assessment sheet of all those considered by the UPSC for this post. The court had passed the order in petitions filed by Punjab government and DGP Dinkar Gupta challenging the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) order quashing the appointment of Gupta as the Punjab police chief.In January, the high court had stayed the CAT order. Two IPS officers, Mohammad Mustafa and Siddharth Chattopadhyaya have challenged the appointment. A 1987-batch IPS officer, Gupta had superseded five senior officers on February 7, 2019.“UPSC does not accord permission to anyone under Section 123 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, to produce the assessment sheet of empanelment committee and as such as per established convention of the UPSC, the Commission claims privilege under the Act,” the court has been told in a written statement. It adds the UPSC has no objection, whatsoever, in sharing the sheet with the court, for its legal scrutiny and satisfaction.The commission says it got involved in the selection of DGP’s appointment in 2006, after a Supreme Court order for which guidelines have been framed in 2009. Detailing about the same, it says the officers from the cadre concerned from not below the rank of ADGP rank are to be considered and those who have at least 30 years of service on the date of occurrence of vacancy are included in the zone of consideration. However, the zone of consideration may vary from the state to state depending upon the availability of ADGPs and above level officers with residual service of six months.It has clarified that state governments are mandatorily asked by UPSC to forward the list of all eligible officers and their relevant documents. “State governments have no say in restricting the zone of consideration. It is mandatory for the state governments to send names of all officers, who fulfil requirement of eligibility,” it says.To the contention raised by these two officers that Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) guidelines were flouted, the Commission says, DoPT guidelines are not applicable in these appointments as the UPSC has its own mechanism.It says that the UPSC takes into account the range of experience, very good service record, and length of service into account, while making recommendations as per inter se seniority of the officers. In March 2019, the Supreme Court has said that appointment should be based only on the basis of merit, it has informed court. The hearing in the matter will resume on August 13. The bench presided over by justice RK Jain took on record only response of the UPSC, and ordered that it be listed for hearing before the bench, which is already seized of the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/proceedings-on-punjab-dgp-selection-can-t-be-made-public-upsc-to-hc/story-YH7IMf2EsN8qnLymyT5vBJ.html
22-07-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab cabinet gives nod to new land pooling policy for industrial sector||Mohali : The Punjab cabinet led by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday gave its nod to the new land pooling policy (LPP) for the industrial sector under the ambit of the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) to promote industry in the city. The cabinet also allowed increased compensation for land owners opting for its land pooling scheme for residential projects.The move comes as GMADA gears up to acquire 1,680 acres of land in the first phase of development of Aerotropolis Estate, an extension of Aerocity. The policy change will also facilitate development of an industrial estate in Sectors 101 and 103 in Mohali by easing the process of land acquisition for timely execution of development projects.Under GMADA’s amended LPP, 1,000 square yards of developed residential plots and 200 sq yards of commercial plots, excluding parking, will be given in lieu of cash compensation for every 1 acre of land to be acquired from landowners for the upcoming Aerotropolis Residential Estate. Earlier, 121 sq yards was offered instead of 200 square yards.According to the LPP introduced for the industrial sector development for the first time, for every one acre of land, land owners will get 1,100 Sq yard of industrial plots and 200 sq yards of developed commercial plot, excluding parking, in lieu of cash compensation.Validity of the sahuliyat certificate given to land owners opting for LPP and providing certain benefits to them for purchase of equivalent value of land, would be counted from the date of allotment of plot. The earlier validity was two years from the date of announcement of award. With the certificate land owners can get exemption from stamp duty, besides certain other benefits/privileges when they purchase agricultural land with the sale proceeds from the developed plots they get under LPP. The move is in response to the demand of land owners that the validity be applied from the date they are offered physical possession of the plots on the ground that only when basic infrastructure has been laid does a plot fetch its potential value.GMADA has acquired 4,484 acres of land from 2001 to 2017. Of this, 2,145 acres has been acquired till date, through LPP introduced in the state in 2008 and amended from time to time. The rationale behind introducing the LPP was to ensure prompt land acquisition and reduce financial burden on GMADA, as the acquisition of land through cash compensation mode is fraught with the risk of enhancement of compensation by the courts apart from it being a cumbersome and time consuming process. GMADA is already facing the risk of paying enhanced compensation of nearly Rs 9700 crore as per the decisions of the first reference appeal in the courts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-cabinet-gives-nod-to-new-land-pooling-policy-for-industrial-sector/story-shogg5Xng0J6Is5s3vpFBN.html

So far 1,003 patients have been discharged from the facility.The trauma centre has been one of the busiest hospitals, also treating Covid-19 patients with other conditions like heart disease, stroke, brain and other tumours, and caesarean section deliveries in Covid patients. Thirty-five surgeries have been performed on Covid patients at the hospital, and there have been 14 deliveries though caesarean section, two pacemakers inserted for heart block, and 210 dialysis procedures done since April. Sixty-five positive children below the age of 12 years have been treated at the hospital. The hospital has also been treating sexual assault victims Covid-19 as well as accused persons.“Once it was decided to make it a dedicated Covid facility, it took us barely two weeks to make the appropriate changes to house virus patients. Our critical trauma patients were moved to the main AIIMS section along with the entire emergency department in early April,” said Dr Rajesh Malhotra, head, AIIMS Trauma Centre. “We have taken care of newborns from caesarean sections and several children, and in many cases their parents were negative,” he added.The hospital has 265 beds, of which 237 can provide oxygen support. There are 50 dedicated intensive care unit (ICU) beds and six high-dependency unit beds. Close to 700 health care workers are on duty over three shifts.Preparations to convert the trauma centre into a dedicated Covid-19 facility started on March 20, with the focus first on shifting trauma patients undergoing treatment at the hospital to the main hospital campus. The structural changes include putting up barriers to divide Covid and non-Covid areas to ease the movement of patients within hospital as well as for the safety of staff not involved in Covid care. Wards, especially private wards, that were without oxygen supply were equipped oxygen support beds and additional equipment needed for Covid-19 management.The staff was provided training in infection prevention practices, keeping in view the updated international guidelines on Covid-19 care.Separate personal protection gear donning and doffing areas were created at the academic areas in the basement of hospital with change rooms, wash rooms and lockers.“All services had to be arranged independent of the main hospital; and all the challenges were met within about 2 weeks and we admitted first patient on April 3, 2020. By this time we had converted the new emergency area on ground floor into 18 bedded ICU. Moreover, the wards on first, fifth, sixth and seventh floor in old wing were prepared for instant conversion to ICU in case of need. We designated an operation theatre on the first floor for emergency surgeries,” said Dr Malhotra.“We have all arrangements under one roof, including MRI, CT scan and X rays that makes our hospital suitable to treat even non-Covid conditions in Covid-19 positives, which won’t happen in many places,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aiims-trauma-centre-discharges-its-1-000th-covid-patient/story-WMrQidh8SNa5faXa61JDtL.html
22-07-2020||City||Delhi High Court asks UGC to clarify mode of final-year exams||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked the University Grants Commission (UGC) to clarify the mode of final year examinations to be conducted by various universities — multiple choice questions (MCQ), open choices, assignments or presentations. Educational institutions were shut across the country in the last week of March to curb the coronavirus spread in the country. Various examinations conducted by universities and higher education institutions have been suspended since then. Early this month, the UGC had announced that end-of-term semester exams will be held in September. Several students have challenged the Delhi University’s decision to conduct online open-book exams and the UGC’s decision asking varsities to conduct exams for final-year students throughout the country. Justice Prathiba M Singh, while hearing a bunch of pleas by students, also asked the UGC to clarify on the differences about the mode of examination since the April guidelines by the higher education body mentioned other forms of assessment. However, the fresh guidelines issued by the UGC on July 6 mentioned only online, offline and blend of both. During the hearing, the judge sought to know from DU as to whether a window of 24-48 hours could be granted to the students to submit their answer scripts. Citing examples of the foreign universities, Justice Singh said in most of the foreign universities, the students have been given at least 24-48 hours to submit their transcripts. DU’s counsel, senior advocate Sachin Datta, told the court that it cannot be allowed to prevent cheating. To this, the judge said, “Why are the exams timed? Why can’t the answer scripts be taken after a day or two? Yesterday, when it rained in the city, we did not have electricity for three hours and this is in the heart of the city. How do you expect to students to have the connectivity to upload the answer scripts in a time-bound manner. The court also asked the UGC as to why it is insisting on conducting the exams as the children are suffering and all they want is to give the exams and finish this up. The counsel for DU said that they were conducting the exams strictly in accordance with the instructions given by the UGC. Appearing for the UGC, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said there was no divergence internally between the Union HRD ministry and UGC. The UGC submitted that the guidelines do not permit internal assessment for evaluating final year students as it puts credibility of the system at stake. When the UGC counsel said DU can undertake a mixed form of examination, the judge said, “Look at the condition. ICMR says that Covid-19 is going to be at its peak in November. How do you expect them to conduct the offline exam by September?” One of the counsel for the petitioner pointed out that many universities have opted for a creative mode of examination, including MCQs and assignment-based exams and the long-form mode is time consuming and the open-book method is “prima facie troublesome”. He submitted that the marksheet of even last semester of Physics department has not been released by the DU yet and it will take a long time to complete the final year exams. The court said it has failed to understand why UGC was insisting on conducting the final exams and said, “Imagine the number of writ petitions that are going to come here due to the number of reasons after open-book exams in August. DU will be struggling with it for years. I think the administration has collapsed and students are suffering. OBE is not going to work.” When the court asked why did the HRD ministry directed DU to postpone the exams, advocate Sunita Ojha replied that there was a meeting and only an advisory was given to postpone if they were not ready and DU has to examine its own preparedness. The Delhi University is scheduled to hold final year undergraduate online open-book exams from August 10-31 after the high court had compressed the schedule of the examination suggested by the university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-high-court-asks-ugc-to-clarify-mode-of-final-year-exams/story-y0uNdUo3BeHgK636mTPYTK.html

Addressing the students, Kejriwal said, “Each one of you have faced a difficult situation, be it health complications of a family member or financial shortcomings at home, but you did not give up. By sheer determination, you achieved such a good result. The results are proof of your undeterred efforts and dedication towards studies. You have to move forward and keep dreaming big, and if you keep working day and night, you will always be successful.”Kejriwal said there is a perception that families with low-income do not want their children to study. “But the reality is that failure on the part of government in not ensuring quality education to kids made low-income families think that sending kids to school would be a waste of time. Now that the condition of government schools has improved in Delhi, the poor man wants his/her child to study for a bright future,” he said.Among those who met Kejriwal and Sisodia on Wednesday was Raghav Kumar, a student of the government boys senior secondary school in Mundka. He scored 93.4% marks in class 12. Kumar, who worked in nearby factories in his spare time and taught students in his neighbourhood, said, “My parents live in Bihar and I was staying here at my uncle’s place. I left my uncle’s home in class 11 and started living independently. My teachers helped me a lot financially and in my studies as well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-meets-govt-school-top-scorers-in-cbse-class-12-exams/story-MjCfb0Xuktf9ho0P36webJ.html

22-07-2020||City||Delhi: Three former bouncers ram vehicles in bid to escape after robbing car||New Delhi: Three former bouncers of Lady Hardinge Medical College, who allegedly took to crime after losing their jobs a few months ago, went on to ram multiple vehicles on a 15-kilometer stretch of road while being chased by the police after having robbed a sports utility vehicle (SUV) in north Delhi’s Burari on Monday afternoon, the police said. Their run came to an end near Kashmere Gate when they found themselves stuck in a traffic jam near Kashmere Gate, thanks to the police’s plan to also set up pickets along the route of the hot chase.By the end of the chase, the fleeing suspects had allegedly rammed at least 10 vehicles along the route, even as none of the occupants of those vehicles were hurt.Monika Bhardwaj, deputy commissioner of police (north district), identified the arrested men as Deepak Dalal, Brij Bihari and Nirala Kumar Singh -- all aged 24 years. She said Deepak is from Jhajjar in Haryana while the other two are from Delhi’s Kirari.“Until four months ago, they worked as bouncers at the Lady Hardinge Medical College. When their contract expired, they were left unemployed. They planned to start robbing cars to make quick money during their unemployment,” the DCP said. On Monday, they allegedly borrowed a friend’s Hyundai i10 car and set out to scout for targets. “Around 1pm, they intercepted a Mahindra XUV300 car outside a banquet hall in Burari and told it’s driver, Naresh Kumar, that he had rammed their car and that he needed to pay for repairs,” said the DCP.The SUV driver worked for a west Delhi businessman and was alone in the vehicle at the time.“Suddenly, one of the bouncers entered the driver’s side of the car and pushed Kumar to the adjacent seat. The others also got in and drove away,” said the DCP. When they neared a gate of the Nirankari Mandal near Burari, they allegedly slowed the car down, pushed Kumar out and sped away in the SUV.Police said Kumar hurriedly dialled the local police who quickly launched a pursuit. “The robbed car was first chased towards Mukundpur from where the suspects turned back towards Kashmere Gate,” the DCP said. Until this point, the suspects had allegedly rammed seven vehicles. “Even as the chase continued, the police flashed the robbed vehicle’s number so that pickets could hurriedly be set up along the possible routes of escape,” said the officer. Meanwhile, the car rammed three more vehicles before it reached Kashmere Gate.“By the time the SUV reached Kashmere Gate, the police team chasing it had lost its trail. But the car ended up getting stuck in a little traffic jam which was actually created by the policemen at the picket to prevent any escape,” said the DCP. The suspects were confronted and caught before they could escape. The damaged SUV was recovered from them. An FIR with IPC sections for robbery has been registered against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-three-former-bouncers-ram-vehicles-in-bid-to-escape-after-robbing-car/story-shdtRaQTt6mFZZPO3qyI8L.html

Acting jathedar of the Akal Takht, the highest temporal seat of the Sikhs, Giani Harpreet Singh had announced on Friday that Navita Singh, a retired judge of the Punjab and Haryana high court, and Ishar Singh, a lawyer at the Telangana high court, will probe the case. On Wednesday, advocate Ishar, along with Akal Takht jathedar’s personal assistant Jaspal Singh, Akal Takht’s head granthi (priest) Malkiat Singh and a representative of justice Navita Singh visited the publishing house and seized its record. The record was then shifted to the Akal Takht secretariat. The jathedar said, “The probe will be completed in one month.” Fourteen saroops of Guru Granth Sahib were damaged in a fire at the SGPC publishing house at Gurdwara Ramsar Sahib in May 2016, according to the SGPC, but the Punjab Human Rights Organisation (PHRO) claimed, after five years, that the damage was far more extensive. The PHRO also claimed that this fact was hidden to save the then SAD-BJP government from public wrath as the Bargari sacrilege incident was already a burning issue and the then assembly elections were approaching.On the basis of the statement of a retired employee of the SGPC, the PHRO said that 267 saroops went missing after the fire and a probe must be conducted to ascertain their whereabouts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/267-missing-saroops-probe-team-shifts-record-to-akal-takht-secretariat/story-0tF36srn9FNCsKTybQpHGI.html

On the other hand, public prosecutor for the CBI, KP Singh, submitted that five months and 10 days had already elapsed for considering the grant of sanction from the date of order – February 13, 2020. However, CBI had no objection to grant more time to submit the final report in the matter, he said.The matter was adjourned for July 29.In October 2017, sub-inspector (SI) Mohan Singh was arrested for accepting Rs 2 lakh in bribe, allegedly on the directions of the then Sector 31 SHO, Jaswinder Kaur.Prem Singh Bisht, the complainant, had alleged that the SI, who was the investigating officer in an attempt to murder case, demanded Rs 9 lakh to drop the names of three of his employees from the FIR.Bisht had alleged that the SI had told him that the Rs 8 lakh were for SHO Jaswinder Kaur and Rs 1 lakh for him. The CBI had arrested the SI while accepting Rs 2 lakh bribe, but the case was closed against Kaur as the agency could not find any evidence to implicate her.However, in the CBI court, the complainant had said that he was taken to SHO Kaur by the SI at Old Car Bazaar in Hallomajra, where a meeting had taken place and SHO had demanded money.In 2019, Bisht had moved an application to declare Kaur an accused in the case, followed by another application in February 2020, where he stated he was being pressured by the SHO.Taking cognizance of the applications, the court had directed CBI to place before the sanctioning authority (SSP, Chandigarh) all evidence, so that the authority could apply its own mind whether to give sanction for prosecution or not.On July 17, the UT DIG had told the court that Kaur’s prosecution was under consideration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cbi-court-allows-ut-dig-more-time-for-prosecution-sanction-against-suspended-sho/story-CgXFGy5vJaIRO1y6kbtrTJ.html

No field inspection is done before preparing the work estimates. Even the Finance and Contracts Committee (F&CC) does not get the site checked before approving a project,” the official revealed.When asked, area councillor Poonam Malhotra said, “The interlocking tiles which are being replaced were in bad shape and I had received complaints regarding this from residents. It is only after this that I got the project approved from the MC and the work was started.”MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “I have not received any official complaint in this regard so far. I will look into the matter and seek report from the officials concerned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mc-wasting-public-money-by-replacing-good-condition-tiles-say-ludhiana-residents/story-UdLGanuP7CduAd6BQfHbaI.html

Frivolous charges are being slapped on them and they were being dubbed as anti-nationals.”Majithia said that in a recent case at his constituency, a 16-year-old boy, Jaspreet Singh, was arrested and kept in Patiala jail for 14 days on charges of being linked with subversive activities.“Sikh youth, who are not even old enough to drive a car, are being booked for terrorist acts. Such barbaric behaviour by the State will scar the psyche of impressionable minds and is dangerous for maintenance of peace and communal harmony in Punjab,” he added.He said that the Congress government should be circumvent before taking action against youth and “should not charge youth with having committed subversive activities for simple misdemeanours.”The SAD leader said, “The real problem is the mindset of people at the top, particularly state police chief Dinkar Gupta who had been handpicked by the CM. Gupta had revealed his mindset when he had given a statement while referring to the abode of the first Guru at Kartarpur Sahib by saying ‘Kartarpur offers a potential that you send somebody in the morning as an ordinary chap and by evening he comes back as trained terrorist’.”He said it was due to this mindset that Sikh youth are being targeted in the garb of Referendum 2020. Majithia said Punjabis are a patriotic community and there is no support whatsoever for the Referendum 2020. He said that Punjabis had rejected the divisive agenda earlier as well.He added that the party will fight all cases in which Sikh youth are framed in subversive activities on merit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sad-condemns-cm-dgp-for-booking-sikh-youth-on-frivolous-charges/story-4bx2AsaUeFrtqcYnIn1fIK.html

They have not been paid their pay, which is Rs 1,700 per month and are unsure about July’s money coming through. Schools again being closed only add to their woes. They also claim that the government has failed to honour a promise made to them to hike their salary at Rs 3,000 a month. Kamaljit Kaur, a MDM cook from Hoshiarpur district, said, “My husband is a labourer, who has been bed-ridden. My salary is my only sustenance.” Bimla Rani, president, Mid-Day Meal Workers Union Punjab, said, “The government gave priority to widows for the job of cooks, but we do face problems. It is injustice that the government pays us for 10 months. Indeed, the Congress government is not paying heed towards our financial problems.” “State education minister Vijay Inder Singla had assured us on December 14, 2019, that we will get Rs 3,000 salary per month. Nothing, however, happened,” said Harjinder Kaur, state president, Democratic Mid-day Meal Cook Front.State School education minister Vijay Inder Singla said, “The Centre contributes 60% share of the salary of these workers.

Out of these, 53 are situated in zone A, 21 in zone B, 18 in zone C and 10 in zone D.A civic official requesting anonymity said many cases of unsafe buildings are sub-judice as owners and the tenants are at loggerheads over vacating the same. Due to this, the MC has not been able to demolish such structures. Despite repeated notices served by the MC, no tenant or owner has vacated the buildings, the official said. A 70-year-old man, Gurcharan Singh, had died in 2015 after a part of an unsafe building collapsed in Thapran Mohalla.Tribhuvan Thapar, a resident of Naughara Mohalla, said, “Rather than waiting for the owner to bring down the building, the MC should take matters in its own hands and raze such structures. Fatal accidents can happen at any time, especially in monsoon, as most of these buildings are on the verge of collapsing.”The MC chief said, “Notices have been issued to the owners under Section 273 of Punjab Municipal Corporation Act, 1976, asking them to vacate or demolish the buildings. Owners would be held responsible if any tragedy or fatality is reported at such sites.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/vacate-unsafe-buildings-or-be-liable-for-mishaps-ludhiana-mc-chief-orders-dwellers/story-i81Bor7hZubBOsm0zGLwjO.html

As per budgetary proposals for this fiscal, the varsity expects an income of ₹380 crore, with expenditure at ₹676 crore, leaving a massive ₹296-crore deficit. The university also has an overdraft of ₹140 crore, which is expected to touch ₹150 crore by the end of the year.Finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal chaired the meeting of senior functionaries of finance and higher education departments and varsity vice-chancellor Prof BS Ghuman at Chandigarh to discussed the finances of the varsity. Prof Ghuman apprised the minister about the financial crisis at the varsity and demanded an immediate financial relief package to pay monthly salaries and pensions to its employees.“Considering the varsity demand, the finance minister has decided to provide an immediate special grant of Rs 20 crore to the university. The finance department, however, has also directed the varsity to control its expenditure and adopt immediate austerity measures,” said Rahul Bhandari, secretary higher education.Manpreet also directed the university to take assistance of former IAS officer Manjit Singh Narang, who has been appointed as honourary advisor to vice-chancellor, to improve its financial condition. Another meeting will be held in the first week of August in which the vice-chancellor has been instructed to come up with a self-explanatory roadmap to increase income of the university from its own resources rather than banking upon state government funds to meet its committed expenditure.The varsity has also been asked to submit a report on glaring financial irregularities as mentioned by the Punjab accountant general in its report to the higher education department on June 30.“The vice-chancellor has been asked to hold a syndicate meeting at the earliest to take decisions on pending administrative matters, including rationalisation of teaching and non-teaching employees and other academic issues,” the secretary said.In 2019, in an attempt to bail the varsity out from the financial crunch, the state government had increased the annual grant of the university from Rs 88 crore to Rs 93.4 crore. Even in this year’s annual budget, the state finance minister had announced a 6% increase in the annual grant for the varsity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjabi-university-gets-special-state-govt-grant-of-rs-20-crore/story-IrHPoeWrj64ONxhVUJpH2O.html

We are yet to gather details as he is unconscious,” said Sandip Patil, superintendent, Pune rural police.The incident happened at 9:30am on Wednesday as Manerikar was travelling in a black Mahindra XUV with his partner, according to police.“We do have footage from CCCTV nearby, but due to the speed, it is difficult to identify the assailants as only an outline is visible. One person was on the bike while the pillion shot the man. There is an eye-witness too. We are exploring the financial angle, but it is too soon to draw any conclusions,” said Navneet Kanwat, sub-divisional police officer of Lonavla division.The partner who was travelling with him in the car was identified as Chetan Vijay Nimkar (51) a resident of Bhangarwadi, Lonavala. The two were heading towards their polyhouse in Vahangaon, Vadgaon Maval, Pune. The injured man underwent surgery at Pawana Hospital in Somatane phata where he was rushed to after the incident. Police are on a lookout for the two accused.A case under Sections 307 (attempted murder), 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) along with section 3(25) of Arms Act has been registered at the Vadgaon Maval police station of Pune rural police.

The police are scanning his computer and mobile phones to trace other members of the nexus.The fraud came to light on Tuesday when labourer Pramod Yadav of Harkrishan Vihar Colony, along with his family, reached the Ludhiana railway station to board Shaheed Express train for Khalilabad in Uttar Pradesh. He had booked an e-ticket through the accused.Before boarding, when Pramod showed the text message of his confirmed tickets for four seats in the train, the ticket checking staff found that there was no such booking as per the seat chart.On verifying the PNR of Pramod’s train, it was found to be of Sachkhand Express and six people had already travelled on the said tickets on July 17. Following this, the railway staff did not allow the labourer to travel on the fake e-ticket. They summoned the ticket agent at the railway station and handed him over to the police.The railway staff said they only scan tickets of passengers at the station during their entry at the platform as there are gag orders to not check tickets in running trains, owing to the pandemic.Sub-inspector Kuldeep Singh, who is investigating the case, said the accused not only issued a fake e-ticket to the labourer but also overcharged him. He had charged ₹3,200 for four confirmed tickets, while the fare from Ludhiana to Khalilabad for four persons is ₹1,080.A case under sections 420, 465, 467, 471, and 474 of IPC has been registered against the accused. The police are trying to trace other suspects involved in the crime, the SI added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fake-e-ticket-nexus-busted-by-railway-staff-in-ludhiana/story-aE3nO4XN0x7i8UpYUZwTjI.html

After hearing the complaint, the NGT had directed the HSPCB to take appropriate action and furnish a factual and action taken report in this regard.As per the report submitted to the NGT, the HSPCB teams have recommended action against seven industrial units for drawing water without any permission and also imposed an interim environmental compensation of ₹4 lakh to ₹15 lakh.The teams have also found several other violations as there was no provision of reverse pumping in many industries. The HSPCB has made it clear that the prosecution action will be initiated against non-complying units. The pollution control board has also written to the Central Ground Water Authority for environmental compensation for withdrawal of ground water without any permission.Three industrial units were found shut and they have been told to cooperate for the inspection later. “We conduct regular inspections as per the guidelines and action is also being taken against the erring unit,” said S Narayanan, member secretary, HSPCB.On asked why the action was taken only after the NGT’s intervention , Narayanan said, “The HSPCB teams conduct the inspections in routine and action is taken against them as per the law. In this case, we have submitted the factual report to the NGT. We will also take action against these units.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/withdrawal-of-groundwater-haryana-pollution-control-board-recommends-action-against-7-industrial-units/story-q0v3YeGrBx8Y7opPIAlShJ.html

Rathore said the CM’s statement is a lie and if he was concerned about the people he would not have taken any such decision which will have a negative impact on the lives of people. “Truth is that the state government has not provided any financial relief to the people during the pandemic. The government and its leaders are misleading people with their statements,” he said.Rathore said the state government has increased financial burden of the people by hiking the bus fare and electricity charges. “They are using government treasury for their own pleasure and comfort,” he added.He said the state government has completely failed in preventing the spread of Covid-19.Accusing the BJP of being busy in political gains, he said the Congress has provided every possible help to people during the pandemic and will continue to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/constitutional-right-to-raise-voice-against-govt-s-anti-people-decisions-cong-to-hp-govt/story-UDOeHiN2S0AB3CpDSVmYII.html

However, there is a shortage of requisite staff for supervising them. The paucity is being felt more acutely since the Nabha jailbreak of November 27, 2016, and needs to be beefed up to check recurrence of such incidents.The high-powered committee constituted to probe the Nabha jailbreak had also identified shortage of staff in the jails as a major cause of the incident.Meanwhile, the cabinet, chaired by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, also approved the annual administrative report of the home affairs and justice department for 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/305-warders-to-be-recruited-directly-for-jails-through-punjab-police-recruitment-board/story-EpO2FbmqXwtQui9dvZycNN.html
22-07-2020||Chandigarh||Himachal Pradesh Police proposes creating office of DIG, intelligence, in Dharamshala||Shimla: The Himachal Pradesh Police have proposed the creation of the office of deputy inspector general of police (DIG), intelligence, in the northern police range of Dharamshala in view of the growing sensitivity of the situation in Una, Kangra and Chamba districts bordering Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir.“The matter is before the home department. There is huge merit in posting a DIG, intelligence and security, to cover the districts of Una, Kangra, Chamba, Hamirpur and Bilaspur. Besides intelligence, the DIG will oversee ways to control social crimes, cyber crime, economic offences, organised crimes such as liquor and narcotics smuggling and human trafficking, and VIP security, including that of Tibetan Buddhist leader the Dalai Lama,” state director general of police Sanjay Kundu said on Wednesday.These districts are densely populated and susceptible to crime, while the police headquarters is based in the state capital of Shimla, which has three posts of inspector general of police.“The police are heavily based in Shimla while vast areas of the state are uncovered,” says the police proposal.Chamba, Una and Kangra are most affected due to inter-state smuggling of narcotics, illegal mining besides border terrorism. Chamba shares a porous border with Doda, Kathua and Kishtwar districts of the Jammu region.Besides security and intelligence inputs are provided by the state crime investigation department (CID) to the international cricket stadium in Dharamshala.“Effective and regular supervision of the security set-up of the Dalai Lama is vital and can be ensured with the posting of one regular senior officer,” the proposal said.Dharamshala, which is the second capital of the state, is not only politically sensitive with 15 assembly segments, it has also emerged as an important tourist centre.Last year, the government organised a three-day international investors’ meet in Dharamshala that was presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-pradesh-police-proposes-creating-office-of-dig-intelligence-in-dharamshala/story-QBpT338YvDeVKAutiqqtkK.html

22-07-2020||Noida||Journalist Vikram Joshi’s family will get Rs10 lakh ex gratia: Yogi Adityanath||The family of journalist Vikram Joshi, who died on Wednesday after being shot at near his house in Uttar Pradesh’s Ghaziabad, will be given an ex gratia of Rs 10 lakh and a job, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has announced.The 35-year-old journalist was attacked in Vijay Nagar area of the city in front of his two minor daughters by a group of men late on Monday night at Vijay Nagar of the city. Vikram Joshi had sustained a gunshot injury in the head. “The chief minister has announced an ex gratia of Rs 10 lakh for the family of the deceased and a job for his wife,” Ajay Shankar Pandey, Ghaziabad’s district magistrate, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Joshi, who worked at a local Hindi newspaper, was riding his motorcycle with his two daughters, aged six and 10 years, when the group attacked after cornering him in Mata Colony area around 10.30pm on Monday. The shooting was also captured on a nearby CCTV camera, in which one of his daughters was seen shouting for help as the attackers fled the spot soon after.Hours after Joshi’s death, Uttar Pradesh Police said they have arrested three more accused in the case along with six others, while one is absconding.Ravi Kumar, Akash Nath and Chotu were arrested, they said. Others who have been arrested in connection with the case are Mohammad Shakir, Mohit Kumar, Dalvir Singh, Abhishek Saroj, Abhishek Janwal (Balmiki), and Jogendra. Babu is still on the run, the police said.Earlier in the day, Joshi’s family said that they want justice and the main accused should be arrested else they would not accept his body.The incident occurred on Monday, days after Vikram Joshi had filed a complaint with Vijay Nagar Police Station stating that some men were harassing his niece. According to the police, the group, led by Ravi, fought with Joshi on July 16, as a result of which Ravi’s eye was injured and his jaw broken.“He was hospitalised and discharged on Monday. While in the hospital, he roped in his accomplices to ‘teach Joshi a lesson’. The group cornered Joshi on Monday night and started beating him up in the presence of his daughters. One of the suspects, Chotu, opened fire from close range—Joshi was shot in the head,” said Rakesh Mishra, circle officer (city 1).Police sources had said that after the fight on July 16, the two parties lodged their complaints at the local police post.The station in-charge has been suspended and departmental inquiry initiated after the family of the journalist alleged inaction by the police, officials said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/journalist-vikram-joshi-s-family-will-get-rs10-lakh-ex-gratia-yogi-adityanath/story-Q3RMMu1oi09LQU1ch3jOUO.html

Uttar Pradesh tests more than 43,000 samples every day. On Tuesday, West Bengal tested 13,064 samples in 54 laboratories. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“At present, we are testing around 13,000 samples per day. By August 15 we would try to conduct around 25,000 tests per day,” Banerjee said while addressing a virtual rally.Till July 21, West Bengal has conducted around 7.2 lakh tests. The daily testing rate is 144 per million, which is above the threshold of 140 per million, set by the World Health Organization.“We are going to increase the testing rate further over the next few days as a result of which the number of Covid-19 cases will also rise. There is no need to panic,” said Banerjee.The state had received flak from medical experts, opposition parties and the inter-ministerial central team for its low testing capacity in the initial days of the pandemic. In the first week of April, less than 200 tests were done per day.The state had cited faulty kits and fewer laboratories as one of the reasons. On Tuesday, the state reported 2,261 new Covid-19 cases taking the total number of positive patients to 47,030 till date. The positivity rate is 6.45%.Four states in eastern India, including West Bengal, have shown high case positivity rates despite low levels of testing.In the last 24 hours, 35 Covid-19 patients died in the state taking the toll to 1,182 till date.“At present, the death rate in West Bengal is 2.5%.

22-07-2020||Patna||Death toll in Assam deluge climbs to 87; flood hits north Bihar||The death toll in the Assam deluge rose to 87, while heavy rainfall in the catchment areas of the Gandak river in Nepal led to flooding in parts of north Bihar on Tuesday.The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has positioned 122 teams in 20 states to tackle the flood and heavy rain situation during the ongoing monsoon season. A maximum of 19 teams have been deployed in Bihar, followed by 12 in Assam, a spokesperson of the force said.The death toll in the Assam floods rose to 87 as the situation due to the calamity remained unchanged with 24.19 lakh people affected in 24 districts, a government report said.According to the daily flood report of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), one person died at Raha in Nagaon district and another at Morigaon town. Twenty-six others have died due to landslides triggered by the rains and floods, it said.The affected districts are Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Biswanath, Darrang, Baksa, Nalbari, Barpeta, Chirang, Bongaigaon, Kokrajhar, Dhubri, South Salmara, Goalpara, Kamrup, Kamrup Metropolitan, Morigaon, Nagaon, Golaghat, Jorhat, Majuli, Sivasagar, Dibrugarh, Tinsukia and Cachar.Four children and a woman died in floods in Meghalaya’s West Garo Hills district and 1.52 lakh people have been affected, Chief Minister Conrad K Sangma said and announced Rs 4 lakh ex-gratia to the next of kin of the deceased.Heavy rainfall in the catchment areas of the Gandak river in Nepal has led to the discharge of excess water from the Valmikinagar barrage in West Champaran district, flooding parts of north Bihar.Several rivers except the Ganges continued to flow above the danger mark and the flood waters have hit nearly four lakh people in eight districts, a disaster management department bulletin said.Meanwhile, at least 10 people died due to lightning strikes in four districts of the state, an official said.Two persons were killed in lightning strikes in Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch district, officials said.A fresh spell of heavy rains lashed the national capital, inundating the low-lying areas and affecting traffic movement in parts of the city.Residents shared pictures and videos of rainwater gushing into their houses and vehicles navigating waterlogged roads on social media platforms.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the major weather stations in Delhi, including Safdarjung and Lodhi Road, recorded around 20 mm rainfall.The convergence of moist easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal and southwesterly winds from the Arabian Sea is likely to continue over northwest India for another two-three days, weather experts said.The monsoon trough is also running through the region and these two factors led to moderate to heavy rains in Delhi-NCR, they said.On Sunday, at least four people died as heavy rains lashed the city.Widespread rains lashed Haryana and many parts of neighbouring Punjab, causing the maximum temperatures to drop sharply, the IMD said.It said more rain or thundershowers are likely at a few places in the two states over the next two days.Light to moderate rain accompanied with thunder occurred at most places in Uttar Pradesh with Maharajganj recording a maximum of 12 cm rainfall, the meteorological office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/death-toll-in-assam-deluge-climbs-to-87-flood-hits-north-bihar/story-2q1kjEfS94tFjVhJLcYfTO.html

22-07-2020||Mumbai||Serum Institute to begin trials of Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate by Aug-end||Serum Institute of India on Tuesday said it will be starting trials of the Covid-19 vaccine candidate developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca by the end of August on up to 5,000 Indian volunteers after getting the necessary nods, and launch the vaccine by June next year if all goes well.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage The Pune-based company’s chief executive Adar Poonawalla said the company, which is the largest vaccine maker in the world, is putting USD 200 million at risk by manufacturing nearly 300 million doses before the final nod to launch the vaccine in market, which is expected at best by the end of the year. Oxford University on Monday announced satisfactory progress with the vaccine, making it one of the leading ones among the dozens of vaccine candidates being developed around the world. The varsity has tied up with Serum Institute of India (SII) to manufacture and supply the vaccine to India and over 60 other countries having a combined population of 3 billion, Poonawalla said. “We are making this application within the next 48 hours to the Drug Controller General of India’s office. They will probably take about 1-2 weeks on what kind of study and trial we will have to do,” Poonawalla said, speaking to CNBC-TV-18 news channel. It will take another three weeks to inject patients in hospitals, he said, adding, “We are talking about a month or month and half maximum from today...may be even sooner.” The vaccine under development will be injected into 4-5,000 volunteers in Pune and Mumbai -- which have high rates of coronavirus infections -- as part of the crucial phase three of the trial which will determine if the antidote can be introduced in the market or not. Poonawalla said there is no dearth of volunteers and added that unlike the exclusion of older people in the initial phase of trials at Oxford, the Indian trials will include elderly people and health workers as well because the initial phase has conclusively proven the safety of the vaccine. Parallel to the process of applying for trials and having actual trials on humans in India, the company will be applying for a special permission to start manufacturing the vaccine in the country, which exposes it to a commercial risk if the vaccine fails at the last stage, he said. As part of the special permission, the company will manufacture up to 70 million doses of the vaccine per month up to October, and plans to take it up to 100 million per month by December, so that it is ready to hit the market once the final approvals are in place. If this goes to plan, the phase three trials will take two months after the patients get injected and the vaccine gets a final nod by November, he said, adding that in such a scenario, it can get introduced either in “quarter one or two” of next year. The company has already manufactured around 2-3 million doses of the vaccine for getting the process correct and also stabilising its machinery, Ponnawalla said, clarifying that these will never be used on humans. “If you look at the process right now, the risk of the opex (operating expenditure) which we are putting in is more than USD 200 million. If this vaccine fails, we will be down (by) USD 200 million,” he said, adding the expenses exclude the opportunity cost of using the same facility for some other purpose. Poonawalla also said SII is looking at external investors for the vaccine-related endeavour and added that it has tie-ups with five other vaccine candidates which will be housed into a separate step-down subsidiary, where the family will dilute its stake by 15-20 per cent. Apart from the five tie-ups already forged, SII is in talks with two other candidates, he said, adding that a manufacturing plant with capacity to produce 1 billion units of the vaccine per year will also get housed in the subsidiary. He further said it is extremely likely that the Covid-19 vaccine would require two or more doses, like in the case of antidotes for measles and other diseases. “We have got a lot on the line and bet big on this (Oxford-AstraZeneca) candidate. And we really hope it works,” he added. Meanwhile, Poonawalla Group Chairman Cyrus Poonawalla said SII is committed to producing 1 billion doses of the Covid-19 vaccine after it gets the necessary approvals. He was speaking at an online discussion organised by FICCI Ladies Organisation (FLO), Pune Chapter. The company wants to make the vaccine available at the lowest price possible so that even the poor can afford it, a statement quoted Cyrus Poonawalla as saying. Asked if there could be any setback in terms of productivity and output of the vaccine, he said chances of failure look remote. If the approvals are in place and trials are completed successfully, then lot of companies will manufacture the vaccine and India will be the largest producer of the Covid-19 vaccine in the world, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/serum-institute-to-begin-trials-of-oxford-s-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-by-aug-end/story-wHRkmtNxV1uNuOUgnkfp5I.html

As citizens don’t understand medical terms, there needs to be better transparency in the reports. Now I don’t know which report should I believe in,” the man said.Officials and experts claimed that the error may have occurred owing to the viral mutations in an individual’s body.Dr Pratibha Panpatil, health officer, Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC), said, “The results can vary depending on the viral load in the body, especially if the testing is done on different days.”The man was asymptomatic and asked to be quarantined at home after his first result came positive.Prashant Patil, secretary, Indian Medical Association’s (IMA)) Kalyan chapter, said that the viral load of a person with good immunity can come down within 24 to 48 hours. “This must have happened with the Kalyan resident oo. If his antigen test has come positive, the virus exists in the patient and he should follow strict isolation norms. There are various factors such as clinical acumen, CT scan of lungs and RT-PCR ‘reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction’ tests that together help in diagnosing if a patient is positive.”The Kalyan resident said he developed weakness and so approached the antigen testing centre at Kalyan’s Rukminibai Hospital for a test.“A day after I went into isolation, I felt that I need to cross-check the test report and so I visited a private laboratory in the vicinity to get myself tested. The next day, my report came negative, leaving me baffled,” he added.Meanwhile, KDMC recorded 268 Covid-19 positive cases and nine deaths on Tuesday, taking the total number of cases to 16,602 and deaths to 264. The twin city recorded the lowest number of positive cases on Tuesday since July 12, when it had the highest day spike of 661 cases.KDMC commissioner has issued directives to set-up fever clinics in every Covid-19 hospital, where citizens who develop symptoms can get antigen tests done.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kalyan-man-tests-negative-for-covid-19-a-day-after-he-was-tested-positive/story-GQnhNLoaT59j9S5TRxW6aP.html
22-07-2020||City||Bombay HC questions state’s stand on not allowing actors, crew above 65 years for film, TV show shooting||Questioning the state’s stand to not permit any cast or crew above 65 years of age to be present for the shooting of films and television serials, the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday asked the government how are physically fit senior citizens expected to live a dignified life if they are not allowed to go out and earn their livelihood.The bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Riyaz Chagla has also sought an explanation from the government as to whether any data or statistics was taken into consideration before restraining the cast or crew members from attending film studios or shooting sites. The bench has also sought to know if similar restrictions are imposed on senior citizens traveling on public transport facilities, attending workplaces and if they are allowed to attend funerals.The order was issued on a petition filed by Pramod Pandey, who has been earning his livelihood by performing small roles in films and television shows for the past 40 years. In his petition, Pandey challenged a clause of the guidelines issued by the government on May 30 regarding the shooting of film and television serials.His counsel, advocate Ashok Saraogi, submitted that though Pandey is above 65 years old, he is physically fit, despite which he is deprived of the only source of livelihood, as a clause in the guidelines prohibited the entry of cast and crew members above 65 years of age from attending any film studio or a shooting site.Saraogi further submitted that if data is perused, it will become clear that majority of the persons affected by Covid-19 are below the age of 65 years. He added that the state’s decision has grave hardships and prejudice will be caused to the small-time actor, if he is prevented from participating in the shootings, as he will not be able to survive with dignity and self-respect.A government lawyer responded to the petition, suggesting that as provided in the guidelines, whenever possible, castings should be done remotely using apps.The response, however, irked the judges. “The learned advocate for the state had to be reminded that the actors performing small roles are required to go to the studios and request for work to enable them to have their two meals, and no producer or director is going to shoot their role via Facetime, Zoom, Skype etc,” said the bench commenting on the suggestion. HC has posted the petition for further hearing on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bombay-hc-questions-state-s-stand-on-not-allowing-actors-crew-above-65-years-for-film-tv-show-shooting/story-IbuOL1Ea4gO0g30yiauIfL.html
22-07-2020||Mumbai||Opened from July 8, hotels in state see only 10% occupancy||Hotels which were allowed to open two weeks ago after a long spell of lockdown seem to be tottering, as they are recording only 10% of daily occupancy. According to experts, a hotel needs to have at least 50% occupancy to sustain itself in the race.The Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), an apex body of hoteliers, said that hotels are running into huge losses owing to the situation.“While flights are restricted, the other modes of transport such as trains and private buses are closed for operations. Even corporates are running with limited staff. All of these factors are playing havoc and we are not getting any guests,” said Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, president, HRAWI.Though the state allowed hotels to open from July 8, it asked owners to keep amenities such as swimming pools, gyms, playing areas and gaming arcades closed to all the guests. The government also prohibited gatherings of more than 15 people at hotels.While majority of them chose to remain closed, many owners decided to resume as they have to provide employment to their staff. “We are shelling out money from our own pockets but we need to keep our workers employed and also earn some revenue. So we can’t close operations,” said Kamlesh Barot, who manages Empresa Hotel at Andheri, where of the 33 rooms, only three are booked everyday. The situation is similar at Andheri’s Radisson Mumbai, which has 111 rooms. “We have a daily occupancy of just 5 to 10 % since we opened. All our corporate clients have stopped coming to the hotel. We are running into losses, but even then need to keep the hotels running,” said Mehttab Siddiqui, chief operating officer of GHV Group, which operates Raddison Mumbai. Hospitality sector experts said the situation is likely to remain grim for the two-three months.“Business travellers who form the bulk of patrons will avoid travelling to Mumbai until it is absolutely essential for them and this will significantly impact the hotel sector. The occupancy of hotels will remain subdued for the next two to three months,” said Jaideep Dang, managing director, hotels and hospitality group, JLL (India).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/opened-from-july-8-hotels-in-state-see-only-10-occupancy/story-eSmvPjlZNw2oAalE5G9dWL.html
22-07-2020||Mumbai||IndiGo’s decision to lay off 10% staff start of a painful process for Indian aviation: CAPA||A day after IndiGo announced that it would lay off 10% of its employees owing to the financial crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Centre of Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA India) – a global aviation consultancy – on Tuesday predicted that the shutting down of one or two Indian airlines would be unavoidable in the near future.“Industry conditions are such that one or more airline failures appear inevitable. Airlines have limited options to turn to for funding except their promoters, given that 3rd party investors will be reluctant to provide capital right now, and the government is unwilling to do so,” read a tweet from CAPA.CAPA India stated that the decision is the “beginning of a painful process for Indian aviation”. “The decision by IndiGo to lay off 10% of its staff is the beginning of a painful process for Indian aviation as things start to unravel from the impact of Covid-19 in India. It will be impossible to survive this crisis without a strong balance sheet,” read CAPA’s another tweet.Airlines are struggling since March, after the Covid-19 lockdown was announced. Even after domestic operations partially resumed from May 25, most aircraft are on the ground, as airlines are operating with only 60% of their capacity, owing to the poor load factor.“Even as the state allowed 50 take-offs and 50 arrivals from Mumbai, not all airlines are operating their planned flights, as demand is low,” said a senior official of an airline, who did not wish to be named.The six major airlines operating in the country currently are AirAsia India, IndiGo, Air India, SpiceJet, GoAir and Vistara. Additionally, India also sees operations of smaller airlines such as TruJet, Air Deccan, Zoom Air and Star Air. A bulk of air traffic is carried out by large private airlines.Though CAPA-India did not elaborate if the financial brunt will be borne by large or smaller airlines, its chief executive officer Kapil Kaul said, “With Indigo deciding to further boost liquidity and strengthen its finances by raising funds, and at a later stage also monetising aircraft and engine assets, it is preparing to deal with this crisis. The government may further restructure loans, but it is unlikely that it will provide financial assistance directly or indirectly. So industry consolidation is inevitable and the emergence of Covid-19 has expedited the process.”According to Jitender Bhargava, former executive director of Air India, airlines that fail to take drastic measures now to cut costs will fail to survive in the long run. “When there are very few people flying, airlines have to consider cost cutting measures such as downsizing their aircraft, giving pay cuts and laying off staff, as there is no other way for them to sustain. IndiGo’s decision to lay off 10% of its employees could be the beginning of a larger issue.” Former instructor pilot and aviation expert Mohan Ranganathan said that the pandemic is likely to destroy the domestic air travel industry. “There won’t be any business or family travel and people won’t go on tourism either. Without international connectivity, Indian aviation will never take off. And at the rate in which airlines are suffering losses, CAPA’s prediction about airlines closure is right. According to me, three airlines will fold up shortly,” he said.Foreign airlines have also borne the brunt of the pandemic. Chile’s Latam airline, Air Mauritius, Virgin Australia and South African airways are among the few foreign airlines that have shut operations owing to the ongoing crisis.“The situation is intense worldwide and has adversely affected many airlines. In India, it is difficult to see an increase in load factor as passengers are scared to travel by air. The situation will largely continue till the year-end, with the international sector remaining closed and this which will further lead to job losses in the industry. As a result, airlines will find it extremely difficult to sail through the pandemic phase,” said a former Directorate General of Civil Aviation official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/indigo-s-decision-to-lay-off-10-staff-start-of-a-painful-process-for-indian-aviation-capa/story-WmcywEta6G95NIHxz8nSdP.html

The first batch of researchers are likely to be called in by the first week August.The institute launched a ‘slow reboot plan’ to restart research work in laboratories in a phased manner. As a first step, it has asked around 128 PhD scholars and part-time researchers based in Mumbai if they are willing to resume their research or project work inside the campus.“Nearly 40% to 50% students are in research programmes, and they ought to have access to the laboratory. Teaching is just one part of IIT system,” said Subhasis Chaudhuri, director of the institute.The institute sent consent and declaration forms to a select few students, asking if they are willing to return to the campus and if their health permits them to do so.“In the first phase, we asked Mumbai-based fourth and fifth-year PhD and Masters students, as well as those pursuing dual degrees based in Mumbai to express their interest in coming to campus to resume their project work,” said Prita Pant, head of the reboot committee and professor in the department of metallurgical engineering and materials science.Chaudhuri said the committee was put in place to plan for the slow rebooting of research work, and to determine which students should be called in first and how. Apart from Pant, the committee comprises student representatives and a doctor from the institute’s hospital.The institute closed completely on March 28, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, followed by an early summer vacation announced on April 1. However, on June 25, the institute declared that the entire autumn semester will be conducted online in the interest of students’ safety. While undergraduate students, incoming masters and PhD students can complete their semester from their respective locations, research scholars and senior masters students ought to mandatorily complete their research projects in order to complete their course work.“First the students have to evaluate their own situations. Only if they are willing to come to campus, will we take it to the next step,” said Pant.A list of such consenting students will be shared with lab operators and heads of departments, who will then analyse if the labs are equipped to handle students.“A checklist is shared with lab and department heads. The heads and the guides will take a final call on whether it is essential for the student to come to campus,” Pant added.Meanwhile, the institute has put in place a standard operating procedure for labs and hostels to ensure they are not crowded. It will also install foot-operated door openers and hand sanitising stations on campus. The in-house hospital is equipped with isolation centres and is approved by the civic body to treat mild and moderate Covid-19 patients.Researchers, however, are on the fence over the matter.“By asking us to sign a consent and declaration form, the institute seems to be shifting the responsibility of safety on to students. Moreover, there is no clarity on the health insurance of students on campus. The institute should give us clear guidelines on what it is doing to ensure our safety,” said a PhD scholar on the condition of anonymity.All the students of IIT-B are covered for medical insurance. However, the committee is mulling increasing the benefits for students, who may require hospitalisation outside campus, in case they get infected with Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iit-bombay-plans-slow-reboot-to-resume-research-in-labs/story-IRnVDFpKyR0eVEyLxcjArJ.html
22-07-2020||Chandigarh||Schools willing to reopen for Classes 10, 12 between August 15-31: UT education department||In reply to the Union ministry of human resource development (MHRD’s) communication over reopening of schools, the UT education department on Tuesday stated that schools are willing to reopen between August 15 to August 31 in order to conduct classes only for Classes 10 and 12. In the letter to education secretaries of all states and Union territories, the MHRD had sought parents’ feedback on when to reopen schools this year. The decision was taken after considering their feedback.The ministry asked the states/UTs to file their responses by July 20 regarding “what is the likely period when they will be comfortable with reopening of schools — August/September/October and what are the parents’ expectations from schools as and when they reopen”.The education department in its reply said that the parents want schools to reopen between August 15 to August 31. Giving more details, director school education, Rubinderjit Singh Brar said, “This is only tentative. There wasn’t enough time to collect feedback from parents so we spoke to the principals of the schools and used Google forms to get the responses from the parents. Before schools are allowed to reopen we will wait until the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and senior officers of the UT administration give permission. We will also ask health experts for their inputs regarding this.”Brar added that schools are willing to reopen only to conduct classes for 10 and 12. He added that the whole class won’t be called at once and the students will be called in small groups. While parents of students studying in lower classes are wary of sending their children to schools as of now.Even though it still hasn’t been finalised, schools including private schools think that they will be able to pull it off. President of Independent School Association HS Mamik said, “After months of the lockdown, the school administrations have started gaining experience. We will wait for whatever decision the MHA takes and whatever guidelines are floated for schools to reopen however, it is time for schools to reopen soon.”However, president of the Chandigarh Parents Association, Nitin Goyal said, “The MHRD had asked for parents’ feedback, however, no parent in my knowledge were asked for any feedback.” DSE Brar said that the department will ask parents for their feedback before any concrete decision is taken.The first order to close schools was issued on March 13 owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, after which schools have remained closed in the city. Some board exams for CBSE and ICSE which were scheduled during this period could not be conducted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/schools-willing-to-reopen-for-classes-10-12-between-august-15-31-ut-education-department/story-s9YLt5lE0Jxaeb8ZsXb7aK.html
22-07-2020||City||Maharashtra must follow in Delhi’s footsteps and conduct more testing for Covid-19: Devendra Fadnavis||Leader of Opposition in Assembly Devendra Fadnavis said that the consistent low testing figures led to high case positivity as well as fatality rates in the state as well as in Mumbai. Pointing to the Delhi model, the former chief minister, also said that after Union home minister Amit Shah intervened in the Covid-19 situation, increased testing in the national capital brought down the case positivity rate from as high as 30-35% to 6%.“Time and again, I have been continuously requesting to increase Covid-19 testing in Mumbai. There is no alternate way to tackle Covid-19 by reducing tests. We need to test and trace more to prevent the spread of the virus,” said Fadnavis.“What have we lost and what have we gained due to very low Covid-19 testing? The infection rate in Maharashtra was around 6-7% in the beginning, then at 17-18% on June 8, and now stands at 23-24%. Mumbai’s infection rate stands between 21% and 27%, and we are testing very less tests in Mumbai,” he said, adding that the average daily tests in Mumbai from July 1 to 19 stood around 5,500.After civic commissioner Iqbal Chahal liberalised the testing protocol, any citizen can undergo a Covid-19 test even without a prescription. However, the average number of testing in Mumbai has not increased significantly despite this step. The maximum per day tests from June 15 to July 15 were conducted on July 15 (7,070 tests).As far as the state is concerned, the testing has been ramped up from this month, with an average of 31,442 tests conducted from July 1 to 19. The maximum tests (41,565) in the state were conducted on July 19.BMC officials, however, refuted this claim by Fadnavis without contradicting the figures.A senior civic official pointed out that a majority of Delhi’s test numbers come from antigen testing, even as the national capital conducted fewer reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. RT-PCR is seen as the gold standard for Covid-19 testing, unlike antigen tests, which can be conducted easily, but result in more false negatives.“Mumbai continues to be the city that is conducting the most number of RT-PCR tests. Our average has increased but to increase RT-PCR testing by more than double, for instance, would require serious ramping up of testing infrastructure. We will need 50 labs to test instead of just 27 and this will cost more funds and time, at least three more months,” said the civic official.He also pointed out that the city was now getting more than 80-85% asymptomatic Covid-19 patients and hence, increasing testing would not really have any impact on tackling the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-must-follow-in-delhi-s-footsteps-and-conduct-more-testing-for-covid-19-devendra-fadnavis/story-gTuTRI8KNZYeN2q5mqsm3J.html

The ward, 70% of which is occupied by slums, has recorded 6,715 Covid-19 cases so far. It has a fatality rate of 6.7%, while the city’s case fatality rate is 5.5%. Ward officials attributed the deaths to delay in reporting of cases and its proximity to SevenHills Hospital and Trauma Care Centre, where patients from across the city are treated.Parag Masurkar, deputy municipal commissioner of K-East ward, said, “We have two major Covid centres in our ward wherein patients from across the city are admitted. If those Covid patients die and are cremated in K-East ward, irrespective of their residence, the death is counted in the ward. Also, the rise in positive cases is due to the ward’s proximity to the airport and several foreign passengers traveling and turning positive while in quarantine period.”Civic officials also indicated there are several cases of delayed reporting. A senior civic official said, “People should report their symptoms within 24-48 hours. Early detection and early treatment are key to beating the virus in a majority of cases.” The other wards with a high number of deaths are G-North ward (Dadar-Dharavi), which has recorded 417 deaths, followed by L ward (Kurla) which has seen 389 deaths.On Tuesday, Mumbai reported 992 Covid-19 cases, taking the total to 103,368.

Now, operations including single and multiple cardiac valve replacement, coronary artery bypass surgery and basic congenital heart surgeries including surgery in children born with a hole in the heart can be performed at the hospital.A team of trained surgeons, anaesthetists, nursing staff, technicians, and a fully functional cardiology department will provide optimum operative and post-operative care, officials said. “The machine is important because it performs the heart’s and lungs’ functions by maintaining blood flow and respiration while the patient’s heart is made to stop working while performing surgery,” said Dr Sidharath Garg, a faculty member of the department.An MoU has also been signed between GMCH and PGIMER by UT home secretary and PGIMER director to provide mentoring and support for the newly-opened services, as and when required at GMCH. The pact was initially signed for a year and it will be extended for another year.At present, only PGIMER, Chandigarh, PGIMS, Rohtak, and IGMC, Shimla, are providing these services among government hospitals of neighboring states of Punjab, HP and Haryana.Director-principal of GMCH in a press release stated that the full-fledged CTVS department at GMCH will be of huge benefit to patients of tricity and neighboring states who have been waiting to be operated but still have to suffer because of long waiting lists.

22-07-2020||Chandigarh||Southern sectors of Chandigarh complain of wild grass growing on pavements||Every monsoon season, the growth of wild grass goes unchecked in the city and residents of southern sectors complain they are the worst hit.The pavements and berms on the roads of many southern sectors are overgrown with wild grass making them unusable, putting pedestrians at risk.As per traffic police data, in 2019 the number of accidents involving pedestrians went up to 36, the highest since 2016. Many of these accidents could have been averted if the victims were on the footpath and not on the main road.Highlighting the issue, general secretary of the Sector 40C resident welfare association (RWA) SK Khosla said, “We seniors feel scared having to walk on the main road as the footpaths are covered with grass. Every year, we have the same complaint.” Khosla said that after lodging numerous complaints for around two weeks, the grass of the footpath near his house was cut, but the rest of the sector still remained overgrown.BREEDING PLACE FOR MOSQUITOES, REPTILESSector 48 paints a similar picture. President of the RWA here JJ Singh said, “The wild grass is so thick on some roads that snakes can hide in them. Lots of mosquitoes and other insects also breed here. During monsoon, trimming the grass once a month is not enough; it should be done twice or thrice for each sector.”Chairman of the Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED), Hitesh Puri, said that the problem was limited to the southern sectors. “In the northern sectors, the grasses are trimmed regularly. Why should southern sectors with higher population density suffer just because the officers live in the northern sectors,” he asked.In Sector 44 as well, residents complained of wild grass growing near the market here. A member of the Sector 44C RWA, Sudershan Joshi, said that the residents felt unsafe walking to the market, especially during the night with the large patches of grass growing on the footpaths.BRUSH CUTTERS INVALID IN MONSOONPruning of wild grass is carried out by Lions Services, a private firm. General manager Pradyuman Bakshi said, “During the monsoon, brush cutters can’t be used for trimming grass. Any moisture damages the blades which is why sometimes the work gets held up. Many times people don’t move their vehicles that are parked on the berms while the machines are being used. As a result, small stones are flung at great speeds at the cars sometimes causing damage. Many people have even filed claims for damaged windows and windshields. Now, we don’t cut the grass till the time vehicles are not moved.”As per contract, they are supposed to cut grass in a sector only once a month, but some councillors ask for favours, Bakshi said, adding that complaints when received had to be dealt with, due to which they were unable to streamline operations, he added. Lions Services owns 30 brush cutters for catering to 30 sectors of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/southern-sectors-of-chandigarh-complain-of-wild-grass-growing-on-pavements/story-KewPxLD1eI9C7x7TPTWS4K.html

Generally, the practice of handcuffing is denounced with respect to human dignity.”Dismissing the application, the court stated that the application was not maintainable.The court order read, “The application is not maintainable as per law as the applicant does not have locus standi to file his application. However, if the police or prosecution finds reasonable grounds for the likelihood of the accused escaping from custody on being produced, an application may be filed by the police.”However, the order further mentioned that due to the Covid-19 pandemic, accused are being produced only by video conferencing until further orders from the high court. “As such, physical production of the accused during this period is not necessary,” the order further read.Currently lodged in a jail in Bharatpur, Rajasthan, the 35-year-old gangster has a number of FIRs lodged against him in Chandigarh, Punjab and Rajasthan.Bishnoi had mentioned in the application that according to news reports, his name had cropped up in two recent cases—firing incidents at Singlas’ house in Sector 33 and at a liquor shop in Sector 9.His counsel Terminder Singh said that Bishnoi had been lodged in Rajasthan for two years and had no communication or connection with any of the accused arrested in the above mentioned cases.As he was anticipating arrest, Bishnoi had pleaded before the court to direct the investigating officer to “handcuff” him and “guard with special security” so that he was not killed while in police custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-court-dismisses-gangster-bishnoi-s-plea-to-be-handcuffed/story-OguUWU9lfvs8OS6Y3zHapJ.html

Last year, the figure was around 100kg for the same period.Punjab Police officials opine that the coronavirus-induced nationwide lockdown and restrictions imposed on the unnecessary movement of people have cut the supply chain of heroin, increasing the drug’s demand and prompting the Pakistani smugglers to push in more consignments into the Indian territory through various means.In the last four months of lockdown (March 23 to July 19), the BSF has seized 229kg heroin on the state border, which is 9kg more than the total seizures in the last year. In 2019, the BSF had seized total 227kg heroin. On March 23 this year, the Centre had enforced the nationwide lockdown.This year’s seizures include a 64-kg heroin haul from the Ravi river that flows along the India-Pakistan border in Gurdaspur district. The contraband was found in 60 packets concealed in long fabric cloth tubes and tied to a bunch of water hyacinth floating in the river on Sunday.A senior BSF official in Amritsar said, “We have noticed the increased activities of anti-national elements across the border this year. But our force is capable of thwarting their all attempts. Our personnel are keeping 24x7 vigil along the border.”A senior special task force (STF) official said, “The supply chain of heroin has been disrupted by the strict lockdown in Punjab and due to this out-patient opioid assisted treatment (OOAT) centres across Punjab have also witnessed a drastic increase in the admission of drug dependents for treatment.”The BSF’s recovery is apart from the drug haul by Punjab Police along the international border. On May 28 this year, the Tarn Taran police had seized around 8.50kg of heroin from across the barbed fence at Rattoke village on the India-Pakistan border.Tarn Taran senior superintendent of police Dhruv Dahiya had said the heroin was buried in an agriculture field across the barbed fence. After the recovery, the police had also arrested one Gurlal Singh of Rattoke village. Police had said Gurlal had been in contact with Pakistani smugglers for the supply of heroin.Similarly, on May 2, STF had recovered 9kg heroin with the arrest of three persons in two separate operations carried out near the India-Pakistan border. The STF had said the heroin, which was smuggled from across the border, was being cleared by the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/heroin-seizures-along-punjab-border-see-three-fold-rise-this-year/story-gXzVvQ1lHpO26sUGkJa9fI.html

22-07-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand to give land ownership rights to women working in their husband’s fields||The Uttarakhand government is planning to give land ownership rights to women who work in their husband’s fields by amending the Uttarakhand Zameendari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said on Tuesday.Rawat said the move was aimed to facilitate the women who are working in fields owned by their husbands especially in the hilly areas of the state.So far in Uttarakhand, land ownership rights are transferred to men in the family which are then passed on to their sons. The government has been planning to introduce it for the daughters and now it is also mulling the same for wives.“Traditionally in the hilly areas, men and their wives are involved in the farming on their land. However, men are largely involved in just heavy labour intensive work like ploughing of field and remaining about 90% farming related works are done by their wives only. Despite that they don’t have any ownership of that piece of land but their husbands,” said Rawat.“Due to this, if any woman wants to take some loan for any farming related work on the field, they are denied because they don’t have the ownership of the land. Once this amendment is introduced in the aforementioned Act, they will also have the ownership rights of the land along with their husbands and take loan,” he said.The chief minister said: “Till now it is somewhat unfair, that despite doing the maximum work in fields, they don’t have any ownership of the land. Once they are also given the ownership, it will also make them more self-dependent and help in women empowerment in the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-to-give-land-ownership-rights-to-women-working-in-their-husband-s-fields/story-sN52woyhzzYYnKL4Z2wKYJ.html
22-07-2020||Chandigarh||Delhi border districts behind virus spread in Haryana||Haryana’s tally of cumulative coronavirus positive cases is set to cross 35,000 by July end, as per the state health department’s projections. But at the same time, the number of recoveries is also expected to be around 27,000, leaving just around 7400 active infections by July 30, as per the forecast.The bulk of positive cases, about 71%, have come from five national capital region (NCR) districts of Faridabad, Gurugram, Sonepat, Rohtak and Rewari. However, with the state government allowing free movement of people, after easing lockdown restrictions, there are other nooks and corners like Ambala, Hisar, Panipat, Mahendragrah and Panchkula which are showing early signs of a wider spread.The state has seen a massive jump in the number of infections in the last eight weeks, registering 24,980 cumulative positive cases in 56 days between May 25 and July 19, mainly on account of relaxations given in lockdown measures after May 18. In comparison, there were only 1,184 cumulative positive cases in the initial 10 weeks (70 days) between March 16 and May 25.“Once the lockdown measures were relaxed, the infections started increasing due to back and forth movement of men and material from the national capital,” top officials said.‘Increased testing brings higher positivity rate’Health officials attribute the detection of more infections to increased sampling. Additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora said that they were conducting about 10,000 RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests every day. “We were testing about 5,000 persons per day in June. So we have doubled our testing. In fact, we have done more than 70,000 antigen tests in the state,” said Arora. More sample collection centres are being opened in every district, including about 45 recently in Faridabad.‘ACTIVE CASES MATTER THE MOST’The ACS said their recovery rate is pretty good at over 75 % which means there are fewer active cases. “The active cases determine how much pressure there is on the resources. Statistics show that about 45% to 50 % of the active infections are put in home isolation. So most of our isolation facilities, hospital beds, including the ventilator beds, are not burdened,” Arora said.STRATEGY TO TACKLE THE VIRUSHealth officials say they took the lead in going for home isolation of patients having mild symptoms. This proved to be a big success. Over 54 % of the 6,022 infected patients were in home isolation as of July 19.“House-to-house surveillance, mobile clinics, testing international and domestic travelers, isolating the infected and tracing their contacts have been the thrust areas of our strategy. Picking up emerging hotspots early by using technology and data and aggressive containment in containment zones has ensured that we are in control of the situation. There is no need to panic but also no room for complacency,” the ACS, health said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-border-districts-behind-virus-spread-in-haryana/story-ecdemjwrJcuw4Yo5YN8FUM.html
22-07-2020||Chandigarh||Multani disappearance case: CBI court dismisses Punjab Police plea seeking prelim probe papers||The special CBI court, Chandigarh, dismissed an application of the Punjab Police seeking documents of the preliminary probe into the case involving alleged abduction of Balwant Singh Multani in 1991 in which former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini is an accused. The detailed order is awaited in the case. Multani, who worked as a junior engineer with the c (CITCO), was picked up by police after a terrorist attack on Saini, the then Chandigarh senior superintendent of police (SSP). Later, the police claimed that Multani, son of a former IAS officer, had escaped from their custody and was never traced.On May 6 this year, a case was registered against Saini and seven others in Mohali on a complaint by Multani’s brother Palwinder Singh.A month later, the police moved an application in the CBI court, Chandigarh, seeking documents of the preliminary probe as the case was initially investigated by the central agency in 2007. In its reply, the CBI had said it keeps records only for five years.On June 8, the police filed another application seeking the status report that the high court had returned to the investigating agency in 2016 which also had the documents with it.Again, the CBI had refused to share the status report, which was returned by the Punjab and Haryana High Court to the agency in 2016, saying it was an “internal communication” between it and the court. It was also mentioned that the CBI was not able to trace the document.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/multani-disappearance-case-cbi-court-dismisses-punjab-police-plea-seeking-prelim-probe-papers/story-GwoCAdvpIYRJHkmlt1EZxI.html
22-07-2020||City||Testing, contact tracing remain key focus of Punjab||Chandigarh Punjab has focused on testing and contact tracing in the past two months to contain the spread of Covid-19 pandemic even as the mortality rate continues to be an area of concern for the Amarinder Singh-led government.For about a week, 300-400 cases are getting added daily to the state’s patient tally, but in comparison to many other states, Punjab’s caseload has not increased that much.On May 21, Punjab was among the top 10 states with a caseload of 2,028 and by July 20, the state was at 18th position.On May 21, Punjab was conducting only 1,865 tests per million of population, which now has gone up to 14,204 tests per million, claims the health department. Currently, the state is conducting 10,000 tests per day, five times the number on May 20. The state is planning to increase the daily testing to 20,000 by September 10, it is learnt.“Punjab had a different set of challenges because of the arrival of NRIs and labourers for farm and industrial sectors. Restrictions in movement also helped us in curbing the spread of virus as compared to other states,” said Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar.STATE FOCUSES ON CONTACT TRACINGNearly 70% of Punjab’s total cases are the contacts of those having tested positive. As a preventive measure, the state has tested 10 people against each infected patient to break the infection chain. The health authorities claim that they have traced 99% of the contacts of every patient.“In cases, where patients don’t share their contacts, we take help of police and procure CDR reports of mobile phone of positive cases and trace their locations and contacts. Help of IIT Chennai is also being taken to get details of GPS locations of the positives,” an official said. Besides, the government has made it mandatory for every person visiting Punjab to get registered on the COVA app. Also, it is compulsory for every person coming from outside the state for more than 72 hours to quarantine themselves in their homes for 14 days.Since July 17 when curfew relaxation were announced, of the 2.34 lakh people who arrived in Punjab from different states and abroad, 75,148 (32%) were tested for Covid-19. Of these, 1, 353 were found infected with a positivity rate of 1.8%.HIGH CASE FATALITYAt 2.5%, the state high case fatality rate (CFR) continues to be a matter of concern as it is as high as the national average.From total 265 deaths the states has witnessed due to COVID, maximum were above sixty years of age. “This can be attributed to the high rate of co-morbidities among those infected in Punjab. Our analysis of Covid-19 deaths in the state has found that nearly 30% of fatalities were actually due to other serious illnesses the patients were suffering from. Covid was not the primary cause of their death,” Dr Bhaskar claimed.GEARING UP FOR THE WORSEWith the state’s daily case count touching 400, the government has now roped in private hospitals for treating Covid-19 patients after capping treatment rates at these facilities.“We don’t know when the state will hit the pandemic peak. But we don’t want to take any chances. We are all prepared if the daily case count reaches 1,500,” said the nodal officer.The government has set-up a plasma bank at Rajindra Medical College Patiala for the treatment of Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/testing-contact-tracing-remain-key-focus-of-punjab/story-UbzK5G4QmAvSACsg7uKBLJ.html

22-07-2020||City||Rioters conspired to kill on phone groups: Court||New Delhi: The murder of a Muslim man during the riots that took place in north-east Delhi in February was part of a “well-planned” conspiracy plotted on a WhatsApp group by accused who were overcome by “bottomless stupidity of propaganda”, a Delhi court judge said on Tuesday while taking cognisance of the charge sheet against the 11 men who are accused in the case. The court also pulled up the Delhi Police for not invoking relevant sections despite the victims being targeted on the basis of religious identity. The police filed a charge sheet on June 4 in connection with the murder of Aamir Khan, whose body was found from a drain in Gokulpuri, naming 11 people and charging them with offences under sections 302 (murder), 144 (unlawful assembly), 147 and 148 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 201 (disappearance of evidence), 395 (dacoity), 396 (dacoity with murder), 427, 432 and 435 (mischief), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. The offences entail a maximum punishment of death penalty. Taking cognisance of the charge sheet on Monday, chief metropolitan magistrate Purushottam Pathak said, “…it is prima facie revealed that there was a well-hatched conspiracy among the accused persons. Same is evident from the fact that in order to take revenge on Muslims, some youths of that area who failed to perceive the bottomless stupidity of the propaganda, they as saviours of their community created a WhatsApp group.”The court will next hear arguments on the framing of charges against the accused.The accused are Lokesh Kumar Solanki, Pankaj Sharma, Sumit Chaudhary, Ankit Chaudhary, Prince, Rishabh Chaudhary, Jatin Sharma, Vivek Panchal, Himanshu Thakur, Pawan Kumar and Lalit Kumar.According to the charge sheet, a caller informed the police control room on February 26 that he had gone to Bhagirathi Vihar to search for his missing bike.He saw a mob at the spot, armed with stones, sticks, swords and iron rods, and they were allegedly shouting religious slogans.The police said in the charge sheet, quoting the PCR caller, that the mob allegedly stopped two persons on a bike and killed them after establishing that they were Muslims. The mob threw their bodies in the drain, the police said. During investigation, the police said, the officers noted that three people were following the inspecting team around the crime scene. The investigators interrogated them and checked their mobile phones. It was found they were members of a WhatsApp group named ‘’Kattar Hindu Ekta’’. According to the charge sheet, when the members of the group were rounded up, the PCR caller, who is also the witness in the case, identified the 11 accused — all members of the group — as being part of the mob that killed Aamir. “It has been found that the common object of the unlawful assembly was not only to kill but also to destroy all evidence of that crime... There cannot be any doubt that the accused who killed Aamir Khan were certainly up to their neck in the conspiracy and were thus very active members of the unlawful assembly,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rioters-conspired-to-kill-on-phone-groups-court/story-meBtnnluWyLPbUSextWi0I.html

22-07-2020||Mumbai||State govt to hold hearing on Metro Bhavan online||Owing to the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak, the state is looking to conduct an online public hearing on the proposed 27-storey Metro Bhavan in Aarey colony.The state invited suggestions and objections, on the change in land-use for 2.03 hectare (ha) of land in the contested Aarey area from green zone to ‘Metro Bhavan and Metro rail allied users’ last year in August .In February, HT reported that despite 2,563 objections filed by citizens, the state is yet to conduct a hearing on the issue.“We are looking to conduct the hearing next week, after which we will submit a report to the state government,” said AB Patil, deputy director of town planning.The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), which is executing the Metro lines , planned a central operation and control centre on the 2-ha plot at Aarey. The basement-plus-27-floor building will be constructed at ₹1,033 crore.The decision to construct Metro Bhavan in Aarey also stands on a sticky ground for the current regime. After assuming office in November 2019, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray stalled the Metro-3 car-shed construction at Aarey, stating that no more trees will be cut in the green lung for the project. However, the state did not made its stance clear on the Metro Bhavan plan. Environmentalist Zoru Bhathena, in his objection to the proposed building said no land-use change can be proposed in a green zone without the Centre’s prior permission. “MMRDA has hectares and hectares of its own vacant land across Mumbai, which can be used to build the Bhavan. There is no need to destroy a natural area for the purpose,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/year-after-inviting-suggestions-maharashtra-government-to-hold-hearing-for-metro-bhavan-online/story-Qh7a2FUwgb9keBgooZhnYO.html
22-07-2020||Noida||Engineer held in connection with theft of mobile parts from phone manufacturer||An engineer with a multi-national mobile phone manufacturer was arrested by the Noida police on Tuesday for alleged involvement in stealing mobile parts worth at least ₹80 lakh from the company.The police identified the suspect as Vikas Kumar Garg (35), an engineer with the original equipment manufacturing department of the mobile manufacturer. According to the police, the suspect would facilitate the stealing of the mobile parts when they would be transported to the company’s warehouse.The incident had first come to fore on July 18 when a company official had filed a complaint with the Phase 2 police alleging that for the past four months, mobile parts were going missing from the company’s warehouse. A case was registered against unidentified persons based on the complaint.On July 19, a resident of Delhi, Gaurav Sikka, was arrested by Noida police from his shop in Ghaffar market in Delhi while stolen parts like displays, chargers, back covers, were recovered from him, the police said. He would purchase parts from the suspect and his accomplices at reduced prices, said the police.Three other people, including a driver, were also arrested from Eldeco crossing on July 19 and 18 boxes of mobile display unit were recovered from them along with a car and ₹20.5 lakh cash which they had accumulated after selling stolen goods, the police said. One of them worked with a private firm providing electrical parts to the phone manufacturer.“During questioning and further investigation, Garg’s involvement in the entire operation came to light,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 2, Harish Chander.Police officers said that vehicles transporting merchandise from the company’s plant to the warehouses are sealed, and Garg was responsible for overseeing the process. He had allegedly stolen a few of these seals and kept them at his house.“While the vehicles would leave for the warehouses, the suspects would add a few extra boxes inside the consignment. Garg would send the stolen seal to the driver, Ashok, who would then break the original seal, remove the extra boxes and then put s stolen seal on the vehicle,” said the DCP.On directions from Garg, such vehicle seals were recovered from his house in Alpha 2 in Greater Noida.The suspect was booked under sections 406, 411 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code.“We are questioning him to find out how long the operation had been going on for and how much money they have accumulated” said Chander.Though police officers were not sure how long Garg had been employed with the company, they said that he was an old employee.When contacted, officials from the company did not comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/engineer-held-in-connection-with-theft-of-mobile-parts-from-phone-manufacturer/story-66iJO5hO4MBNRYEALlatcI.html
22-07-2020||Mumbai||Delay in competitive exams may increase demand for BA, BCom, BSc||With uncertainty regarding the scheduling of entrance exams for professional courses due to the Covid-19 outbreak, several aspirants for these courses are now likely to seek admissions to vanilla courses like Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Commerce ( BCom) and Bachelor of Science (BSc), say experts.Entrance exams like the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) and the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) have been pushed to September due to the pandemic. Traditionally, students who appear for these exams get their scores around the same time as the Class 12 results.“Since colleges are starting their admissions process this week, many students will want to secure a seat for BSc as a back-up,” said Subhash Joshi, trustee, Science Parivar, a chain of coaching institutes in the city. Joshi said that this might also increase the overall cut-offs for these courses, as many top scorers who wish to take up professional courses will first apply to city colleges.Kiran Mangaonkar, principal, GN Khalsa College, Matunga, said that the number of students opting for the BSc course has been on the rise for the past three-four years. “Many students are seeing better job opportunities after BSc compared to engineering, and have therefore been opting for vanilla courses over professional ones. In the current situation, more students, including engineering and medical aspirants, might end up securing a seat in BSc or BSc-IT courses in university-affiliated colleges until they bag a seat in the professional course and institute of their choice. “There is also a chance that these students may cancel their admissions once they are allotted a seat in the professional courses,” Mangaonkar added.Sanjana Ramnath, an 18-year-old student, cleared her HSC exams in the Arts stream from Jai Hind College with 94.3% and was among the top three scorers in the stream this year. While her original plan was to appear for the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) and secure a seat in one of the top law colleges, she now plans to postpone this dream by a year. “The current situation seems very uncertain, and the constant delays in conducting entrance exams and eventual admissions will affect academics as well. I want to avoid that,” said Ramnath, who now plans to apply for a seat in the Bachelor of Arts (BA) course at a good college, and apply for CLAT in 2021 instead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/delay-in-competitive-exams-may-increase-demand-for-ba-bcom-bsc/story-yU7Y1iLBVnELo5rvcnjTbP.html
22-07-2020||Mumbai||Yes Bank fraud: PMLA court rejects Rana Kapoor’s bail plea||A special Prevention of Money Laundering (PMLA) court on Tuesday rejected the bail plea filed by Rana Kapoor, Yes bank founder, former chairman and managing director, who has been booked for alleged money laundering by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).ED arrested Kapoor on March 8 and produced him before the special PMLA court. He was remanded in ED custody till March 11 and later sent to judicial custody.Kapoor’s advocates had pleaded that investigation in the case has been completed as a charge sheet was filed against him. They further pleaded that the case was based on documentary evidence which has already been collected by the agency, and hence there was no harm in granting him bail.ED, however, argued that the probe had not concluded and that Kapoor could tamper with the evidence and influence witnesses. The special court, after hearing both the sides, rejected the bail plea.ED had initiated a probe into allegations of money laundering after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered two cases of corruption against Kapoor in March. In one first information report (FIR), the bureau alleged that Yes Bank had invested ₹3,700 crore in short-term debentures of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) between April and June 2018. In return, Kapoor was allegedly paid ‘kickbacks’ amounting to ₹600 crore by DHFL promoter Kapil Wadhawan. DHFL sanctioned a loan to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RAB Enterprises in which Kapoor’s wife Bindu is a director and 100% shareholder, alleged CBI. Kapoor’s daughters, Rakhee Kapoor Tandon, Roshni Kapoor, and Radha Kapoor, are also 100% shareholders in DoIT Urban Ventures. Based on the case registered by CBI, ED began its probe into allegations of money laundering by Kapoor.In the second case, CBI alleged that Kapoor and his wife bought a bungalow from Avantha Group promoter Gautam Thapar at a much lower price than its valuation. In the past, Thapar had mortgaged the bungalow for a corporate loan of ₹600 crore, but he sold it for ₹380 crore to Bliss Abode Pvt Ltd in which Kapoor’s wife was a director at the time.After the probe, ED filed a charge sheet against Kapoor, his wife, and their three daughters for money laundering. After the charge sheet was filed, Kapoor’s lawyers moved a bail plea on the merits of the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yes-bank-fraud-pmla-court-rejects-rana-kapoor-s-bail-plea/story-20e06i6m64V1R2bLSmmkMP.html
22-07-2020||Mumbai||Infra to hit 1.2K trees: ‘How can we send objections during lockdown?’||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) last month proposed to cut and transplant approximately 1,282 trees in Mumbai for various infrastructure projects, including the Metro, road works and the construction of Goregaon-Mulund Link Road (GMLR). Activists have complained that citizens were not able to submit their responses and objections to these proposals due to the lockdown.Since June 6, BMC has been issuing public notices for cutting trees in the city. Prior to this, the last public notice for cutting trees was issued on March 18. In a public noticed issued on June 9, BMC sought suggestions and objections from citizens over cutting and transplanting 1,282 trees. The last day for submissions and suggestions was June 19.According to the notice, around 320 trees are affected by the various Metro projects in the city; 326 trees are affected by road works; 146 trees are affected by the Railways’ stabling yard; and 382 trees are affected by GMLR. Among the major projects, tree cutting has been proposed for Metro line 6, Metro line 2-B and GMLR. Thirty-five trees will be cut and 169 transplanted for Metro line 6. Sixty-five trees will be cut and 51 transplanted for Metro Line 2-B. For GMLR, 103 trees will be cut and 279 will be transplanted.However, citizens and environmental activists have said that since BMC issued its tree-cutting notice during the lockdown, few were aware of it. Activist Zoru Bhathena said, “Notices are being issued during the lockdown and citizens are not able to get the information. Also, if citizens come to know about the same, one cannot go and visit the site to give suggestions or objections. On one hand, BMC is saying ‘do not go out for non-essential work’, and on other hand, they are bringing these notices. This does not fall under the essential category unless there is an urgency to cut or transplant a few trees.” Bhathena has said that he will be submitting suggestions and objections, and if these are not considered, he may explore legal options. Earlier, in the first week of July, another city -based environmental activist Kunal Birwadkar had written to BMC, urging the civic body to stop cutting trees during lockdown as citizens cannot lodge their objections due to travel advisories.An official from BMC’s garden department, requesting anonymity, said, “We are doing the exercise in a very transparent manner by uploading the public notices on the website.”Jitendra Pardeshi, chief of BMC’s garden department, was not available for comment despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/infra-to-hit-1-2k-trees-how-can-we-send-objections-during-lockdown/story-w1AwSdSikjHLwdcIEYVBfM.html
22-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt orders legal proceedings against DU over governing bodies in funded colleges||Education minister Manish Sisodia on Monday ordered the directorate of higher education to initiate legal proceedings against Delhi University for not responding to correspondence over the formation of governing bodies (GBs) in colleges partially or fully-funded by the Delhi government . This is the first time the Delhi government is initiating legal proceedings against the central varsity.The role of governing bodies includes taking all decisions for the smooth functioning of a college, such as the appointment of teaching and non-teaching staff. The 10-member governing bodies in these colleges have people nominated by both the university and the Delhi government. For over a year now, the Delhi government and the university have been engaged in a tussle over the formation of GBs in 28 colleges.In the order issued on Monday, Sisodia said the university had not sent a complete panel of names to the colleges concerned despite reminders to forward the names of six Delhi government nominees.On March 13 this year, DU’s executive council recommended sending these names back to the state government for reconsideration. A week later, the government said these six names were to be continued. On May 13, the university forwarded a list of nominees to colleges, except the six names in contention.“..Despite repeated reminders directing the University of Delhi to send the six names of nominees of Delhi government to the concerned colleges, namely Lakshmibai College, Kalindi College, Keshav Mahavidyalaya, Aditi College, Maharishi Valmiki College of Education, and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College, the university has not sent a complete panel of names to the concerned colleges,” Sisodia wrote in Monday’s order.“Not just this, a few of these colleges have initiated the process of the election of the chairperson even in the absence of a complete panel. This seems to indicate a conspiracy to cover up corruption in these colleges. Since DU has not responded to the repeated correspondence of the Delhi government, the Directorate of Higher Education should move legal proceedings against the University of Delhi,” deputy CM ordered.The tenure of the GBs in 28 Delhi government colleges ended last year and these have not been reconstituted since. “Colleges are functioning with truncated governing bodies since March 2019,” the order read. Two months ago, on May 26, Sisodia had written to vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi, alleging that the university was deliberately delaying the formation of GBs in 28 Delhi government-funded colleges to shield corrupt officials.The vice-chancellor could not be contacted despite attempts.DU Dean of Colleges Balaram Pani said, “Out of 140 names, the university cleared 134. Only six names are facing certain objections from some quarters. When these were forwarded to the government for reconsideration, the government sent back the names and then the Covid-19 crisis struck. No EC meeting could be held thereafter. If the names have to be passed, it will be through the EC, which has the power to take a call on the names.” Pratyush Vatsala, principal of Lakshmibai College, said, “The university had already forwarded us the names of the panel except for one name that was dropped. The Delhi government nominee had approached court, asking for a stay on the elections and the court directed that we could conduct the GB elections to ensure day-to-day functioning is not affected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-orders-legal-proceedings-against-du-over-gbs-in-funded-colleges/story-wZEBpq7zMzair2QfHSL2mN.html
22-07-2020||Mumbai||University of Mumbai releases admission schedule for UG degree courses||The University of Mumbai (MU) on Tuesday released the admission schedule for undergraduate degree courses, less than a week after the last of the Class 12 results were announced.Keeping in mind the current situation, the university has asked students to submit a declaration form along with their pre-admission registration form to the allotted college in order to confirm their admissions. The colleges, in turn, have been asked to give provisional admission to students and confirm the same after the applicant submits a hard copy of the mark-sheet and all other necessary documents later.“All colleges shall provide an online system in order to avoid the physical presence of students. Colleges in Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Palghar, where an online system is difficult to implement, can ask students to visit the college campus, provided they ensure social distancing norms are adhered to,” said a statement released by the university on Tuesday.While the pre-admission registration process is already underway, applicants have till August 4 to complete this process, following which the first merit list will be announced at 7pm.While the university is positive that admissions will be conducted smoothly, colleges are worried about the chaos that will ensue once students start submitting hard copies of original documents for admission confirmation. “Every year, several students don’t get admission in quotas because they don’t have appropriate documents to support themselves. This year, if we give provisional admission without checking documents, many students might end up losing the seat when they finally have to submit documents. The university needs to address this problem,” said the principal of a suburban college.University officials, however, said that such problems can be avoided if colleges take extra care while proofing documents submitted online. “Students, for the time being, can complete the entire admissions process online, which includes submission of a scanned copy of all necessary documents. Colleges need to be extra careful about screening documents and accepting fees online before giving provisional admission to the student. The submission of hard copies later will be a simple procedure,” said an official from MU.BOX*Sale of admission forms (colleges to make it available online): July 24 to August 4*Pre-admission online forms: July 22 to August 4 (up to 1pm)*Submission of admission forms along with a copy of pre-admission form (in-house and minority quota admissions to be completed in this period): July 27 to August 4*First merit list: August 4 (7pm)*Verification of documents and payment of fees: August 5 to August 10 (up to 3pm)*Second merit list: August 10 (7pm)*Verification of documents and payment of fees: August 11 to August 17 (up to 3pm)*Third merit list: August 17 (7pm)*Verification of documents and payment of fees: August 18 to August 21(up to 3pm)Link for online pre-admission registration is available on mum.digitaluniversity.ac||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/university-of-mumbai-releases-admission-schedule-for-ug-degree-courses/story-yY1iqN1vF0xYLrCcg92rPJ.html
22-07-2020||Patna||With 11 more deaths, Bihar’s Covid-19 toll rises to 198; cases breach 28k-mark||The Bihar government decided to test all the people in high-risk containment zones as the number of Covid-19 cases rose to 28,564 after 1,109 new infections were reported on Tuesday , with 11 more deaths taking the state toll to 198.Three deaths were reported from Patna, two each from Lakhisarai and Bhojpur and one each from Bhagalpur, Muzaffarpur, Nalanda and Saran.Five deaths were also reported from Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) and four from the AIIMS-Patna.Of the five deaths at NMCH, two were from Patna and one each from Motihari, Rohtas and Saran, said Dr Mukul Kumar Singh, nodal officer for Covid-19 at the NMCH. All the deceased had co-morbid conditions.Three of the four deaths at AIIMS were from Patna and one from Bhojpur, said Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at the institution.Meanwhile, information and public relations department secretary Anupam Kumar said during the media briefing that the state has sufficient number of beds. “We have sufficient number of hospital beds and most of the infected patients are recovering, so there’s nothing to panic. If need be, we will increase the number of beds as we have sufficient capacity,” he said.The government had decided to attach the Guru Gobind Singh hospital with the NMCH and the ESIC hospital in Bihta with the AIIMS in its endeavour to increase hospital beds for Covid-19 patients.He said chief secretary Deepak Kumar, presiding over the core group meeting on Tuesday, had asked the health department to increase the number of hospital beds, with proper facility like oxygen supply and ventilator support.He said health workers were monitoring the condition of asymptomatic Covid-19 positive patients who were in home isolation.Kumar said the government had also decided to test all high risk group people, including senior citizens, those having co-morbidity and pregnant women, in containment zones.Rapid Antigen testing launched in 38 districtsIn an effort to ramp up testing, Bihar would move from target-based to demand-based testing. It initiated rapid antigen point of care (POC) test across all 38 districts on Tuesday, while committing itself to extend the facility to primary health centres by the end of this week.“After having initiated testing at 25 facilities in Patna, besides using five mobile vans also, we will now begin testing in our five sub-divisional hospitals shortly,” said Patna district magistrate Kumar Ravi.Asymptomatic Covid-19 patients, having facility to isolate themselves from other members of the family, are only being allowed home isolation, said Bihar’s health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh during the joint media briefing. He said health workers are regularly monitoring their condition and shifting patients to Covid care centres if their condition deteriorates.In addition to the three dedicated Covid-19 hospitals in the state — one each at Patna, Gaya and Bhagalpur— the government had also decided to allocate 100 beds in separate block at each of its other six hospitals in the state.He said the government had laid down a referral protocol from district Covid care centres, where medium cases would be admitted to those in medical colleges. He also said health workers in district hospitals would be trained in management of Covid-19 cases by giving them oxygen.Singh said 1,206 patients had recovered in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of recoveries to 18,741, with a recovery rate of 65.61%.Meanwhile, the central team, which visited Bihar on Sunday, was critical of the unfettered movement in Rajeev Nagar locality, which was a buffer zone after the entire stretch between road numbers 1 and 22 had been marked as containment zone. The team, which found lack of police personnel and unhindered movement of public besides vegetable and fruit vendors in the area, called for better access control in containment zones.Of the 2,584 containment zones in the state, Patna had 83. While 1,931 containment zones were in rural area, 653 were in urban areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/with-11-more-deaths-bihar-s-covid-19-toll-rises-to-198-cases-breach-28k-mark/story-EH9ap0uT8E4i5Kpr3TnbGL.html

22-07-2020||City||DDA gets 12,000 applications for ownership rights under PM-UDAY||New Delhi: The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has received nearly 12,000 applications under PM-UDAY for ownership rights from residents of 1,731 unauthorised colonies in the Capital since March 22, when the lockdown was imposed due to the coronavirus pandemic. This is more than double the number of applications the land-owning agency had received in the first three months after the scheme was launched in December 2019.The Pradhan Mantri Unauthorised Colonies in Delhi Awas Adhikar Yojana (PM-UDAY) – one of the main poll planks of the Bharatiya Janata Party in the Delhi assembly elections — is aimed at benefiting four million people living in 1,731 unauthorised colonies in the Capital.DDA vice-chairman Anurag Jain said, “We are working on streamlining the system so that more applications can be processed at the earliest. For this, we are planning to rope in more field surveyors. We are also roping in an agency to provide an alternate way to register under the scheme. Currently, people can either fill the application online on their own or through our five processing centres. This will be an alternate way. We are also sending messages to RWAs in unauthorised colonies telling them about the process.”According to DDA officials, the land-owning agency has received 11,922 applications from property owners between March 21 and July 17, 2020. Just 4,573 people had submitted their applications between December 16, 2019 (when the scheme was launched) and March 20, 2020. “Due to Covid-19, the field survey process was put on hold while we were accepting applications online. We have further simplified the online process due to which there was a huge jump in the number of applications,” said a senior DDA official.But the process to clear the applications has been rather slow. DDA officials say that while they are receiving the applications online, they couldn’t process it due to the lockdown. “The process to clear application involves a physical survey of the property, which was stopped during the Covid-19 lockdown. We resumed the field survey in June. More than 600 properties have been surveyed. We are trying to expedite the process,” said a DDA official.In the last eight months, 938 property owners have been given either conveyance deeds or authorisation slips of which 251 were cleared after June 1. A DDA official said, “Even now, we have instructed the field teams to follow all norms and guidelines issued by the Centre and the Delhi government regarding Covid-19 while doing the measurement of the property. We are not processing the applications which are in containment zones right now.”As part of the process to get ownership rights, property owners from the 1,731 unauthorised colonies have to first register on the website for PM-UDAY, which is managed by the DDA, and then submit an application along with his/her property documents. While the number of applications received by the DDA has increased during the lockdown period, the registration has dropped significantly. After document verification, a team is sent to the spot to carry out measurement and assessment of the property. A conveyance deed or authorisation slip is issued to the owner based on the field report and after payment made by the owner. Based on the conveyance deed or authorisation slip, a property owner can get the property registered with the Delhi government’s revenue department.The scheme is aimed at benefitting roughly one million households, but so far just 2.77 lakh property owners have registered on the portal. Between March 21 and July 17, as many as 23, 374 people had registered on the portal as against 2.5 lakh people before the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dda-gets-12-000-applications-for-ownership-rights-under-pm-uday/story-cZxV5YG5YWs5CQNdkTWSeI.html
22-07-2020||Mumbai||Only 28% stock in seven lakes supplying water to Mumbai||Despite heavy rain over the past month, the water stock in the seven lakes supplying water to Mumbai was just 28% on July 21, which could last 109 days. The stock was 52.88% of its full capacity on July 21, 2019, and in 2018, it was even better, with 78% stock recorded on the same day. Though there has been good rainfall in the city, the catchment areas of the lakes and dams have not received much rainfall, said civic officials. Mumbai gets its water from the lakes and dams located in the city as well as the neighbouring Thane and Palghar districts. According to the estimates, the city has water supply for around 109 days, with about two months of monsoon remaining. According to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials, they are closely monitoring the situation, and no decision on water cuts has been taken for Mumbai considering the ongoing crisis due to Covid-19. According to data shared by BMC, the seven lakes have 4.08 lakh million litres of water or 28.55% as recorded on Tuesday, against the full capacity, which is around 14.47 lakh million litres. The Bhatsa dam, which caters to 55% of the city’s total water requirement, stood at 32.17% of the total capacity compared to 48.60% at this time in 2019.The lakes and dam reservoirs that supply drinking water to Mumbai are Tulsi, Tansa, Vihar, Bhatsa, Modak Sagar, Upper Vaitarna, and Middle Vaitarna. The seven lakes are bifurcated into two systems – the Vaitarna system which supplies water to the western suburbs and the island city, and the Bhatsa system which supplies water to the eastern suburbs. Ajay Rathod, chief engineer of BMC’s hydraulics department, said that the civic body is hopeful that rains will help inprove the water levels, “There is no plan to impose water cuts for now. We have time till August. The level in the lakes supplying water to Mumbai is less because not much rainfall has been recorded in these catchment areas, though there was good rainfall in the city.”Whenever there is shortage of water, BMC issues water cuts starting from 10%. According to BMC officials, despite there being a lockdown imposed, and a large number of commercial establishments, schools, colleges, and offices were shut, the city’s water demand did not go down significantly. “We have noticed that the consumption of water in the residential category has increased this year owing to people being home during the lockdown. So, in a way it has covered up to meet annual consumption every year by the city,” said a BMC official.Of the total required rainfall for the year, 15% is expected in June, 35% in July and August, followed by 15% in September. The civic body manages to supply 3,750 million litres of water daily against the city’s demand for 4,200 million litres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/only-28-stock-in-seven-lakes-supplying-water-to-mumbai/story-Uhvf3uQqa7HAnNiXgGn5wN.html
22-07-2020||Delhi||Kejriwal announces scheme to deliver ration at doorstep of card holders in 6-7 months||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday announced the Mukhyamantri Ghar-Ghar Ration Yojana, a scheme in which the Aam AadmI Party (AAP) government aims to provide ration at the doorstep of 1.85 million households by next six-seven months. “The Delhi cabinet today (Tuesday) cleared the scheme on doorstep delivery of ration. It will be named Mukhyamantri Ghar-Ghar Ration Yojana. Under the scheme, ration will be processed, packed and delivered at doorstep of beneficiaries. The scheme will be fully implemented in 6-7 months. This is the amount of time that is needed for floating tenders and engaging agencies which would help in implementation,” said Kejriwal in a video press briefing.With the doorstep delivery scheme, the Delhi government will also implement the central government’s ‘one nation, one ration card policy’, which makes the whole ration system more portable, the Delhi CM said. The ‘one nation, one ration card’ policy would benefit beneficiaries who are registered in Delhi to avail ration in other states and vice-versa. The Delhi government already delivers nearly 70 services at the doorstep of citizens under the doorstep delivery schemes. People could just call on the centralised number -- 1076-- and place a service request. The services include the issuance of certificates (caste, income, domicile, delayed birth order; duplicate registration certificate of the vehicle, transfer of vehicle ownership), and new water and sewer connections, among others.The chief minister said that ration beneficiaries will have to choose between doorstep delivery and the traditional way of collecting ration from the designated fair price shops. “Those who opt for the doorstep scheme will get processed flour instead of wheat,” said Kejriwal, calling the scheme a “revolutionary step” in governance.As per government records, Delhi currently has around 7.5 million ration beneficiaries and 2,028 designated fair price shops. The Delhi government on Monday directed all fair price shops in the city to update their contact and Aadhaar details for the doorstep ration delivery scheme. The order, which HT has seen, further said the government also plans to re-introduce the electronic point of sales (e-PoS) system for ration distribution.As per the plan, e-PoS(electronic point of sale) devices will be given to all the 2,028 fair price shops in Delhi and also to agents who would deliver the monthly ration at the doorstep of card holders. The process includes entering the ration card number into the device, followed by the biometrics (fingerprint scanning) of the beneficiary or entering the Aadhaar card details. Once the details are matched with the database, the ration will be disbursed to the beneficiary.The Delhi government had stopped using e-PoS since April 2018, in the wake of a large number of complaints concerning inconvenience in availing ration owing to technical glitches that also entailed a tussle between the elected government and top bureaucrats in the food department. “By now, we have got all e-PoS machines checked and the technical glitches have been resolved. Delhi has 100% Aadhaar seeding of its ration card holder. We can start using e-PoS again,” said a senior government official who did not wish to be identified.The Delhi government was supposed to launch the doorstep ration delivery scheme in March 2018 but could not do so because of some administrative issues. “Later, in 2019, the government initiated a pilot project off doorstep delivery in around five (out of 272) municipal wards in the city and some glitches were identified. All issues have been resolved now and we are in a position to launch the scheme at the earliest,” said a senior official in the food and civil supplies department who did not wish to be identified.HT had reported in May about Kejriwal directing the food and civil supplies department to restart the Delhi government’s flagship project of doorstep delivery of ration using electronic point of sale (e-PoS) devices. The direction came after Union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan wrote to Kejriwal, urging Delhi to implement the Centre’s ‘one nation, one ration’ card policy.Paswan’s letter came at a time when the Capital witnessed large-scale reverse migration of the labour force in the light of the lockdown that was imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19.“A scheme on doorstep delivery of ration can help the government tackle mismanagement and irregularities in the public distribution system, which ultimately lead to people being deprived of their basic rights -- subsidised food items in this case. The scheme, if implemented effectively, can also put checks on potential hoarding. From the point of view of the beneficiaries, it provides a convenient option for availing ration, especially if the card holders are elderly people, pregnant women, persons with disability, etc. However, the government should consider involving civil rights groups in the process, which will help in making it more inclusive and efficient,” said Sunil Kumar Aledia, executive director at the Centre for Holistic Development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-announces-scheme-to-deliver-ration-at-doorstep-of-card-holders-in-6-7-months/story-ecmZO8HAF7qX325PP1kFHM.html
22-07-2020||Delhi||Traffic jams add to misery of daily commuters in Delhi||Heavy downpour Monday night and during the day on Tuesday led to massive waterlogging yet again in many parts of the city, triggering traffic jams. A portion of road caved in on Bhairon Marg and near ITO bus stand, adding to traffic snarls on arterial roads such as Mathura Road, Ring Road, Vikas Marg, Sarai Kale Khan and parts of central and New Delhi. Massive waterlogging was reported from Ring Road near Indraprastha Metro station, Bhairon Marg rail underbridge, Sarai Kale Khan main road, ITO, Laxmi Nagar, Lado Sarai, Gautam Nagar, near Dhaula Kuan underpass on Ring Road, Bihari Colony, Wazirabad Road, near Rajdhani College, Najafgarh main road, Sector-4 and 23 in Rohini, Shastri Nagar, Shalimar Bagh, Patel Nagar, Paschim Vihar and Mangolpuri rail underbridge.Moderate to heavy rain on Sunday and Monday also caused waterlogging, which has become a regular problem during monsoon. On Sunday, a tempo driver had drowned in the flooded Minto Bridge underpass.  Public Works Department (PWD) and municipal officials said temporary pumps were immediately put in place to clear the roads. However, the authorities had to toil hard to clear stagnant water from the stretch between Indraprastha Metro station and Vikas Minar on Ring Road.“Due to damage to the Anna Nagar slum drain, we have been facing problems in pumping out water from the area as it backflows on the Ring Road service road near WHO building, Azad Bhawan and even spills on the ITO road. The SDMC is repairing the drain and waterlogging cannot completely be fixed until the drain is fully repaired. Stormwater from around the ITO area is discharged in this drain only,” a senior PWD official said.The Delhi traffic police, in a statement, said that because of heavy waterlogging on Ring Road near the WHO building, severe traffic snarls were witnessed on the Bhairon Marg leading to Mathura Road. Apart from the ongoing construction work on the stretch, a road cave-in ensured it remained out of bounds for traffic. “Because of the cave-in and the heavy traffic volume on the stretch, we had to divert vehicles coming from Akshardham towards Sarai Kale Khan to further go through Barapullah and those coming from the Ashram side towards Akshardham to take the Geeta Colony flyover via Pushta Road,” joint commissioner of police (traffic) Narendra Singh Bundela said on Tuesday.The department also issued an advisory for drivers coming from the Ashram side to take the DND flyway, Mayur Vihar, Noida Link Road, Akshardham and Pushta Road. No vehicle will be allowed towards ITO from Nizamuddin (TILL WHEN?).Sumitra Atreya, a resident of Noida, said since the traffic was diverted onto the DND and Noida link road, commuters faced a harrowing time on Tuesday evening. “Traffic on that stretch is already diverted because of the ongoing construction at the Ashram intersection. Traffic didn’t move at all for 20 minutes and there was no policeman to direct the traffic,” she said.Traffic holdups were also reported from Moti Bagh, Munirka, Rajouri Garden, Sarojini Nagar (on the Ring Road), Mathura Road (near Apollo), Sagarpur, and Ring Road near Delhi Cantt Metro station. The heavy rain also led to collapse of portions of six buildings and at least 16 trees being uprooted. PWD minister Satyendar Jain said 1,500 pumps – including mobile pumps – have been deployed across the city to prevent waterlogging. Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev held an emergency meeting on Monday on the city’s monsoon preparedness plan. The chief secretary said that the head of the departments (HoDs) of the agencies responsible for tackling monsoon related problems will be held responsible for any lapsesExperts have said the multiplicity of authority in managing drainage and roads is the primary reason behind the annual monsoon misery. At least 11 agencies — PWD, the three civic bodies, Delhi Development Authority, irrigation and flood control, New Delhi Municipal Council and Delhi Cantonment Board — are responsible for de-silting of drains alongside roads under their jurisdiction. Govt announces compensation The Delhi government will be providing financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh to the family of a 56-year-old man who drowned while trying to manoeuvre his mini-truck through a waterlogged underpass following heavy rains in the city, the Aam Aadmi Party said on Monday.Kundan Singh, survived by his wife and two daughters, was driving a Tata Ace from the New Delhi Railway Station to Connaught Place when he got stuck under the waterlogged Minto Bridge in central Delhi on Sunday.“The Delhi government is providing financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh to the family of deceased Kundan Singh, who lost his life in the unfortunate incident near Minto Bridge,” the official account of the Aam Aadmi Party tweeted in Hindi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-traffic-jams-add-to-misery-of-daily-commuters/story-05V0quFeju1etgyVANXhcN.html
22-07-2020||Gurugram||Nearly 26% Covid-19 deaths in Gurugram reported in people above 61||Patients over the age of 61 years account for 26% of Gurugram’s Covid-related deaths, according to the data compiled by the district health department. Officials said that they have been able to manage the fatality rate by focusing on treating patients with mild or moderate symptoms and preventing them from turning into critical patients requiring ICU care and ventilation support.Till Tuesday, the Covid-19 toll in Gurugram stood at 116, out of which 92 are men and 24 women. Data shows that the maximum Covid-19 toll is reported in the 61-70 age group, with 30 people succumbing to the illness. At least 22 deaths were reported in the age group of 71-80 years. Eighteen people were in the age group of 51-60 years and at least 16 each were in the age groups of 31-40 and 41-50. One death each has been reported in the age groups of 21-30 years and 91-100.As reported by HT earlier, of the total number of Covid-19 related deaths, 45% had co-morbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). However, the health department is yet to figure out how many victims belonging to the age group of 61-70 had co-morbidities and how far their pre-existing health conditions had contributed to the fatality.According to the USA-based Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, older people are at a higher risk of developing complications due to Covid-19 infection. As such, they need to take extra precautions.Earlier this week, Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer(CMO), in a press meet, had said that most of these deaths in the city are due to co-morbidities, especially hypertension. “The health department is taking a slew of measures to keep the fatality rate down. Pulse-oximeter, an equipment to calculate the oxygen level in the body, is being provided to the Rapid Response Teams (RRTs), which would help them to confirm the oxygen saturation level in apparently mild cases of Covid-19 and take steps accordingly. The oximeter helps in tracing the early complications in the disease. Immediate hospitalisation is necessary if the oxygen saturation level dips below 90%. The normal saturation level in an adult is between 94-100%,” said Yadav, adding that the health department has given 500 pulse oximeters for distribution among RRTs.He also said that hydroxychloroquine is being given to patients who are being home isolated. “Even if the patients are opting for home isolation after having been confirmed for Covid-19, they are being provided hydroxychloroquine by our RRTs. There are apprehensions about the medicine being cardio-toxic. However, it is helpful in patients who are in the early stages of the disease with mild symptoms. We are also asking some patients to get X-Ray and CT-scan of the chest done to avoid developing any health complications,” said Yadav.He added that in case of hospitalisation and subsequent complications, the line of treatment approved by the ICMR, includes antiviral drugs, such as favipiravir, tocilizumab and remdesivir.Gurugram’s mortality rate has dropped to around 1.45% this week from 1.5% last week. Currently, Haryana’s fatality rate is 1.33%, with cumulative toll of 349.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/nearly-26-covid-19-deaths-in-gurugram-reported-in-people-above-61/story-aoBXnCxg1PACkijEcesAIP.html

22-07-2020||Gurugram||83.26% of Ggm students pass Haryana class 12 board exams||The overall pass percentage for students in the district stood at 83.26% in the Board of School Education Haryana (BSEH) examination for class 12, the results of which were declared on Tuesday. The district improved its performance from last year when the pass percentage was 70.01%.Of the 8,493 students who appeared in the examinations from Gurugram, 7,071 students passed while 1,094 got a compartment. The number of students who did not qualify stood at 328. The overall state’s pass percentage stood at 80.34% with girls outperforming boys. The pass percentage of girls stood at 86.3% while for boys the same was 75.06%.At 83.26%, Gurugram scored the eighth highest pass percentage among all 22 districts of Haryana. However, no student from the district could make it to the top ten scorers in the state. Around 78.72% of students cleared the examination in Mewat (Nuh) district and 90.01% students cleared the examination in Panchkula, the highest in the state. Sonepat stood as the worst-performing district with only 71.83% of students clearing the exam. The Haryana board had called off examinations in some subjects after a lockdown was imposed across the state to curb the spread of Covid-19. The board took into account the average marks of already appeared exams for marking the remaining papers of students.Gurugram district education officer Indu Boken said that the district had improved its performance from last year when the district stood at the 19th position in the state. “We have improved our performance significantly this year. Last year, we stood in the 19th position, whereas this time we are ranked 8th among all districts. We have jumped up by 11 positions. Moreover, there is a marginal percentage difference between us and other districts,” said Boken.She said that the department had completed the entire syllabus by November-end in most schools and focused on revision and assessment. “We conducted extra classes and completed the syllabus by November. On a daily basis, we took tests focusing on writing abilities since students often know the answer but struggle to articulate it on paper. Each and every student was made to go through the past five years papers and we conducted mock pre-boards at the school level. Tuesday’s results reflect the efforts that students and teachers had put in,” said Boken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/83-26-of-ggm-students-pass-haryana-class-12-board-exams/story-Yr3NsXWlmrHe1cb1KmxEcM.html
22-07-2020||Gurugram||Haryana: 4.6% found positive for rapid antigen test across 16 districts||More than 62,000 people across 16 districts of Haryana have been covered under rapid antigen test for detection of coronavirus till July 19. Of this nearly 4.6% people tested positive for Covid, as per the health department data. Officials said antigen tests have been helpful in detecting people who are asymptomatic, making Covid-19 testing accessible for everyone.Experts, however, also believe that too many negatives in the antigen tests can lead to false sense of security.Across the state, antigen detection kits have been used to test a total of 62,141 people, out of which 2,871 were found positive, while the remaining tested negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Data till July 19 shows that Gurugram’s share in overall tests is almost 40.6%. Its share in the total positives detected is 29.3%.The antigen diagnostic test detects proteins attached to Covid or within it by testing the sample collected from the nasal cavity using swabs. It delivers result within 30 minutes.Until July 19, Gurugram has conducted the maximum number of antigen tests by covering 25,249 people. Out of these, 840 were confirmed Covid-19 positive. The district’s antigen test positivity rate is 3.3%. Compared to the antigen tests, RT-PCR positivity rate is as high as 8.1%. From June 24 till July 19, 27959 RT- PCR tests were conducted in the city, out of which 2263 were detected positive for coronavirus. Notably, antigen testing started from June 24. Compared to Gurugram, Faridabad has done the second highest number of tests at 13,042 out of which 1,161 had tested positive, taking the district’s antigen positivity rate to 8.9%. Sonepat, on the other hand, had conducted just 7,473 antigen tests, of which 334 were detected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. Rewari which did 1,244 tests had a positivity rate of 9.5%, with 118 positives. Rohtak has the lowest positivity rate of 1.2%, even after conducting 2,758 tests (higher than Rohtak) with only 32 positives.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer of the district, said, “We are using antigen detection kits for mass testing. It covers people who are asymptomatic as well as symptomatic. Those who are symptomatic but test negative in antigen testing, their samples are being sent for Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test.” The health department, however, did not share the total positivity rate of RT-PCR tests.Experts, however, warned that negatives or extremely low test positivity rates do not confirm to the fact that the situation was under control. Professor Rajib Dasgupta, centre of social medicine and community health, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) said, “The huge number of negatives mean nothing. On the contrary, if these are not followed up, it will lead to a false sense of security and muddy the true epidemiological picture. The negatives have to be categorised into symptomatic and asymptomatic; and the symptomatics further tested by more confirmatory tests (RT-PCR/CB-NAAT-True-NAAT). That completes the full protocol.”Dheeraj Kumar, data scientist, who has been monitoring Gurugram’s data agreed with Dasgupta. “Antigen test results should not be relied upon on ‘as-is’ basis to compute positivity rates that informs public health policy and response strategy as it can create a false impression by giving lower values of positivity rates due to its inherently lower sensitivity,” he said.Dasgupta pointed out that authorities need to clarify that the antigen tests are limited to be conducted only on categories of people defined by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) . “ The rapid antigen test is to be deployed in very specific settings and these include Influenza Like Illnesses (ILI) in containment zones and fever clinics, healthcare workers, suspected COVID-19 deaths, asymptomatic patients undergoing chemotherapy, and, immunosuppressed patients (HIV positive, transplant recipients, etc). It is pertinent that the authorities clarify that the antigen tests are indeed limited to these categories,” said Dasgupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-4-6-found-positive-for-rapid-antigen-test-across-16-districts/story-oPDmXUXdGowq1iEr8e6oZL.html
22-07-2020||Gurugram||Woman falls to death: Partner arrested for abetment to suicide||A day after a 25-year-old woman, who formerly worked as a cabin crew member with an international airline, allegedly fell to her death from the fifth floor of a condominium in Sector 67, the police on Monday arrested a man, who was allegedly in a relationship with her, on charges of abetment to suicide. The police said he had told them that the woman had jumped from the balcony of the flat after they had an argument.The police said the 26-year-old suspect was arrested on Monday night and produced in a district court on Tuesday and sent to judicial custody. Dinkar, station house officer (SHO), Sector 65 police station, said, “The suspect, who is a pilot with a private airline, was arrested on Monday night. During the questioning, he said that he and his partner had gone for a get-together to a friend’s house in Sector 67 on Sunday, and at the house, they had an argument following which she jumped from the fifth-floor balcony.”The victim’s sister, in her complaint to the police, had alleged ‘foul play’ and said that she had a “strong suspicion that her sister was murdered”. An autopsy conducted on Tuesday afternoon found that the woman had suffered more than 30 external injuries. Deepak Mathur, the forensic expert who conducted the autopsy, said, “The body had more than 30 external injuries including pelvic fractures. There was some internal bleeding as well. Prima facie, the cause of death is a head injury.”On Monday afternoon, the police had registered an FIR under section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code against the suspect, based on the complaint filed by the woman’s sister.According to the police, the woman and her partner had gone to the get-together at 4pm on Sunday.In the police complaint, the victim’s sister said at 10.25pm on Sunday, she received a call from her sister’s partner asking her to come to a hospital as she had “fallen down from the building”. “At 11.30 pm, when I reached the hospital, I noticed that my sister’s partner had scratch marks on his neck. My sister had bruises over her lower body, the left side of her forehead, and a cut on her lips. It did not look like she had fallen from a building,” she said.The victim’s sister had also said that the woman had been in a relationship with the 26-year-old man for three years, but for the past four weeks, he had not been talking to her. She said it was suspicious that he had not bothered to contact her for so many days and that the incident took place on the day he had asked to meet her. “My sister had tried all means to get in touch with him over the last month but he had blocked her on all social networking sites and she had to resort to emails to reach out to him. She sent him long emails but he ignored them and instead sent abusive replies. He also called her names for playing mobile video games with his friends. On Saturday, after weeks, surprisingly he sent an email to my sister inviting her for a get-together at his friend’s place,” said the woman’s sister in the FIR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/woman-falls-to-death-partner-booked-for-abetment-to-suicide/story-oZWNFxsxsvuWBegAvXMoOL.html
22-07-2020||Gurugram||Afternoon showers lead to waterlogging on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway||Several areas in the city were waterlogged after heavy overnight rain on Monday and another spell on Tuesday afternoon. One of the worst-affected areas in the city was a three-kilometre stretch between Narsinghpur and Kherki Daula on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway.Gurugram received two spells of rain on Tuesday. The first spell was between 12 noon and 3.30am and the other was between 1.30pm to 3.30pm. As per the website of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the city received 16.3mm of rainfall and is likely to get spells of rain every day till at least July 27. On Tuesday, the service lane heading towards Kherki Daula was completely inundated with water and cut off for motor vehicles for several hours. The accumulated rainwater also spilled onto the main carriageway of the expressway, leaving commuters with only a single lane to pass through.Such waterlogging, however, is not uncommon for the stretch, which sees flooding every monsoon season. The stretch is located in a low-lying area along a slope. During heavy rains, the backflow of sewer and rainwater from the nearby Badshahpur drain floods the area.To ensure that the impact of this overflow is minimal during this monsoon season, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) had installed six motor pumps last month along this stretch. However, only three of these pumps started working properly after 2.30pm on Tuesday.“There was an issue with the power connection at the stretch. Without electricity, we weren’t able to switch on the motor pumps to drain out rainwater in the morning. Around 12pm, a 65 kVA diesel generator was arranged and the motor pumps only started working at full capacity around 2.30pm. Following the afternoon rains, it took us another three hours to pump out the rainwater significantly,” said an NHAI official privy to the matter.Meanwhile, commuters travelling through the stretch said that although the volume of the vehicles was low, the limited space available in the carriageway meant they had to pass through the stretch at a very low speed. This added to their travel time. “In the morning, there was only one lane of space available at most points of the stretch as the remaining lanes of the carriageway and the service lanes were completely inundated. Although the volume of vehicles was very low, we had to cross the stretch in a single file. Therefore, it took me longer to cross the area and I got delayed by ten minutes,” said Ishwar Chand, a resident of Sector 82.Other parts of the cityApart from the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, the Gurugram Interstate Bus Terminal (ISBT) in Sector 12 was also inundated for the second day in a row. The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) officials, however, said it was a localised drainage issue, which was fixed around 4pm on Tuesday after which the rainwater receded. “There was a localised drainage issue at the ISBT that was rectified by the late afternoon, following which it was cleared of rainwater. Overall, we used 22 motor pumps across the city to drain out rainwater on Tuesday. With the help of pumps, we were able to drain out rainwater from most waterlogged stretches within two hours after it stopped raining. By evening, most roads had little to no waterlogging,” said Raman Sharma, chief engineer, MCG.The Gurugram traffic police issued warnings on various social media platforms and cautioned commuters regarding heavy waterlogging in areas such as Sector 50, IMT Manesar, Dundahera, Sohna Chowk, Basai Road, and Iffco Chowk. Waterlogging was also reported at various arterial roads in sectors 47, 49, 30, 31, 10, 10A, 27, and 28.Earlier on Monday, two patches of roads — one under the Iffco Chowk flyover and the other at another portion of the road near the Bakhtawar Chowk — caved in after 12mm of rain on Sunday night. At least eight trees also fell due to the strong winds and heavy rains on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/afternoon-showers-lead-to-waterlogging-on-delhi-gurgaon-expressway/story-GybVroD52Dv0LwIZUIfMON.html
22-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi receives moderate rain but monsoon deficit yet to reduce||The national capital received some “moderate” spells of rain for an hour on Tuesday afternoon, leading to waterlogging and traffic disruption in several areas.Safdarjung, Lodhi Road and Palam received 24.2mm, 27.8mm and 23mm of rain on Tuesday respectively, according to the Regional Meteorological Centre. These stations received 1-2 cm rain in the short span of 45 minutes according to RMC, Delhi.“We received moderate rain within a short period of half an hour to 45 minutes. There may be more rain later tonight (Tuesday night) or on Wednesday early morning. This rain is a combination of factors. The monsoon trough (a line of low pressure) is passing through Ganganagar in Rajasthan, Delhi, Hardoi in UP, Gorakhpur and the northeastern states. There is also a trough in the westerlies bringing rain here. The monsoon trough will shift slightly northwards but light rain is likely to continue over Delhi,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of the regional weather forecasting centre.Delhi’s rainfall deficiency (since June 1) was 43% on Tuesday morning but is likely to have reduced by Tuesday evening after the spell of rain. Early Tuesday morning, moderate rain was recorded at Ayanagar, which received about 34mm rain, and heavy rain was recorded at Faridabad, which received about 80 mm rain around the same time. Rainfall between 64.5mm and 124.4mm in a day is considered ‘heavy” rain by IMD.IMD, in its Tuesday bulletin, said the western part of the monsoon trough is near its normal position and the eastern part is along the foothills of the Himalayas. Besides, the convergence of moist southerly-southwesterly winds from the Bay of Bengal over the north-east and east of India and from the Arabian Sea over the north-west of India at lower tropospheric levels is likely to continue for the next two days.Under the influence of these meteorological conditions, widespread and heavy rain is likely over Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh till Wednesday.Widespread and very heavy rain is also likely over Bihar, Jharkhand, Sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura in the next three or four days and the intensity of rainfall is very likely to decrease thereafter.FLOODS IN ASSAM, MEGHALAYAAs on Monday, 30 stations (15 in Bihar, 10 in Assam, 3 in Uttar Pradesh, 1 in Arunachal Pradesh and 1 in West Bengal) were categorised as ‘severe flood situation’, according to the Central Water Commission.Siang river at Pasighat in East Siang district continues to flow in ‘severe flood situation’ with heavy rainfall in its catchment. Due to forecasted rainfall in the next three days, there is a likelihood of a rapid rise in water levels in rivers Siang, Lohit, Dibang, Subansiri, Kameng and Noa-Dehing, CWC has warned. The Brahmaputra continues to be in ‘severe flood situation’ all along its course from Dibrugarh to Dhubri. Due to forecasted rainfall, there is a likelihood of ‘severe to extreme flood situation’ in the main Brahmaputra from Dibrugarh to Dhubri districts. Some rivers in Sub-Himalayan West Bengal, including rivers flowing from Bhutan—Teesta, Jaldhaka, Torsa and Raidak—are expected to rise rapidly in the next two or three days. A ‘severe flood situation’ is declared when the water level touches or exceeds the danger level but is below the ‘highest flood level’ (HFL). Floods in Assam have already killed at least 80 people and affected over 70 lakh, according to the state government. In the north, there could be a sudden rise in the Sutlej, Yamuna, Alaknanda, Bhagirathi, Ramganga, Ghaghra, Sharda and Rapti rivers, CWC has warned.“Uttarakhand’s Ramnagar has received 29cm rain on Monday which is in the ‘extremely heavy rain’ category. Many parts of Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh have been receiving ‘extremely heavy rain’ for three days now ranging up to 39cm a day, which is why there is flooding,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.‘Moderate to severe’ thunderstorm and lightning is likely over Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, north-west Uttar Pradesh, east Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, east Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Meghalaya and north Odisha on Wednesday.Monsoon rain over the country is over 7% with an excess of 15% over the east and north-east of India, with a -17% deficiency over north-west India, an excess of 6% over central India and an excess of 19% over the southern peninsula.“Rain in the foothills is likely to reduce gradually in the next two days and the rain belt over central India will increase gradually,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/rain-leads-to-traffic-waterlogging-in-delhi-more-likely-on-wednesday/story-KYnkG91FMKBtInu1GOLFiO.html
22-07-2020||Gurugram||Education department seeks response from parents, teachers on school reopening||The state department of school education is seeking feedback from parents, teachers, students, authorities of both private and government schools, and other stakeholders on when they would like schools to reopen and what are their expectations for the resumption of physical classes, which are currently on hold due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The department has been circulating an online questionnaire since last week among various stakeholders via WhatsApp groups, seeking their feedback before it holds consultations to decide the time frame for the reopening of schools. Respondents have been asked to share if they would like schools to be opened in the current scenario, the month of opening for different grades starting from pre-nursery till Class 12, and their expectations regarding the resumption of physical classes. Earlier in June, the district education department had conducted a consultation regarding the opening of schools with parents and school authorities, in which most of the stakeholders had opted in favour of continuing distance learning through online classes in the view of the rising Covid-19 cases in the city.District education officer Indu Boken said that the department has sought feedback from various stakeholders, seeking information. The questionnaire has been shared with the students and parents via school administrators. “We have circulated an online form through which students, parents, and teachers can share their feedback about the reopening of schools. Although there is no deadline for the submission of the responses, the feedback that we receive will be taken into account before the state decides on a timeline for the reopening of schools. While discussions have been taking place, so far, no particular month has been zeroed in for the reopening of schools,” said Boken.Most parents said that there was no immediate need for reopening schools and online classes could continue until the situation improved. “I don’t think I would be sending my son to school until the situation improves. Children are not mature enough to follow all precautions and teachers can’t take responsibility for all students. I would prefer to teach my son at home rather than sending him to school,” said Sonal Kaushik, whose son studies in Class 9.Sonu Singh, mother of a nursery student, said that she would not be sending her son to school at least till the end of the year or till the time a vaccine is ready. “I am hoping that there will be a vaccine ready by the end of the year. Unless that happens, I don’t see myself sending my son to school. It’s not worth taking the risk. Online classes are taking place anyway,” said Singh.Government school administrators also said that schools could stay closed for some more time since the implementation of physical distancing rules in schools seems challenging. Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, Urban Estate, said that maintaining physical distancing in government schools would be difficult, given the available infrastructure and facilities.Aparna Erry, principal of the DAV Public School in Sector 14, said the school had received the form last week and circulated it among parents for feedback. “We have asked students, parents, and teachers to share their feedback about the opening of schools by filling up the form,” said Erry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/education-department-seeks-response-from-parents-teachers-on-school-reopening/story-eQsPqQeNn8cQcA7DcDhvLI.html

The furniture on the ground floor of the branch was completely gutted. In their statement to the police, the bank authorities reported a loss of nearly ₹35 lakh to the property. According to the officials, a short circuit is suspected to be the cause of fire.The incident was reported to the fire control room at 6.07am, following which three fire tenders — two from Sector 37 fire station and one from Pataudi — were pressed into service.Sunil Adlakha, fire safety officer, Bhim Nagar fire station, said, that the fire tenders reached the spot within half an hour and the fire was brought under control in over two hours. A cooling process was initiated around 8.30am. A fire department official, who was at the spot, requesting anonymity, said, “The fire was controlled before it could spread to the upper floors of the building. On the ground floor, all the furniture, cash counters, computers, electrical wiring and files were completely charred. However, the strong room did not sustain any damage. A short circuit is suspected to be the cause of the fire.”Subhash Chand, the manager of the Farrukhnagar SBI branch, said that two security guards, who were deputed outside the bank’s ATM noticed smoke billowing out of the premises and called him at around 6am. “I rushed to the bank and opened the shutters and the windows to let the smoke out. It took half an hour for the fire tenders to reach the spot and, by that time, the fire had totally engulfed the ground floor. The strong room of the bank, where the lockers, cash cabin and loan documents are kept, did not sustain any damage and we have communicated the same to our account holders. Property worth nearly ₹35 lakh has been damaged,” said Chand.A team of police personnel from Farrukhnagar police station had also reached the spot. Satyawan, assistant sub- inspector (ASI), who is the investigating official, Farrukhnagar police station, said, “We received information of the incident from the police control room and immediately alerted the fire department. No persons have been injured. The branch manager has stated in a written statement that a short circuit probably led to the fire. There is no complaint against any party.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/fire-at-farrukhnagar-branch-of-bank-property-worth-35-lakh-damaged/story-8n684X646h7KtD3JLc80II.html

The teachers were from high enrolment schools in nine Delhi districts that secured a 100% pass percentage in board exams. The meeting was held to understand their approach and strategies and emulate the same in other schools, government officials said.“We will record the experience of our high-performing teachers in short videos and share them widely so that other teachers and students can also benefit,” Sisodia said.Various factors, including increased concentration levels due to entrepreneurship classes and a stronger teacher-student connection, were stated as the reasons behind the improved performance of students. This year, Delhi government schools recorded a pass percentage of 97.8%—a jump of three percentage points from last year.“English is a foreign language for students; earlier they lacked interest in the subject and were stressed about it. Mindfulness [practiced during entrepreneurship classes] has helped a lot in easing stress and helping them concentrate better,” said Poonam Arora, who teaches English at Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya in Timarpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sisodia-interacts-with-govt-school-teachers-from-high-performing-schools/story-qCwiS7DuutHSbQwtZ577hL.html
22-07-2020||Delhi||CATS staffers attacked by mob in outer Delhi for foiling theft bid, 8 ambulances vandalised||Eight paramedics and drivers of the Centralised Accident and Trauma Services (CATS) ambulance fleet were injured -- two of them critically -- and as many as eight ambulances vandalised by a mob of 25-30 who attacked the emergency workers with knives, blades and sticks in outer Delhi’s Mangolpuri on Monday night over the attempted theft of a tablet. The violence, which lasted for nearly 20 minutes, took place at Mangolpuri’s L-block community centre that has been turned into a temporary base station for CATS ambulances and staffers hired from Uttar Pradesh by the Delhi government. The injured persons alleged that the attack happened after a few CATS employees caught a local resident and his two associates trying to steal a tablet, provided to each CATS ambulance for attending emergency calls, from a driver. The driver and the ambulance had returned to its temporary base station after shifting a positive Covid-19 patient to Sanjay Gandhi Hospital when the attempted snatching took place.Shahzad Rajput, the driver whose tablet they tried to snatch, said, “Around 8pm, I was attending a call when three-four men arrived and tried to snatch the tablet and my cellphone. I resisted and caught one of them with the help of my co-workers. Soon, a group of 25-30 people arrived and tried to free the man from us. They pelted stones and bricks at us and attacked us with sticks and weapons. I suffered cuts on my back and forearm.” Apart from Rajput, seven other CATS staffers were injured. They were identified as Javed, Arun Mishra, Anil Babu, Dinesh Kumar, Ambrish, Akhilesh Dubey, and Mahender Dubey. Akhilesh, Arun and Dinesh are paramedics, while the others are drivers. Mahender and Ambrish, who were seriously injured, are still undergoing treatment.The damaged ambulances were on Covid-19 duty and the injured staffers are all front-line workers in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. The windscreens and glasses of all the eight CATS ambulances were smashed in the stone pelting. The ambulances will be taken off emergency services until they are repaired and that may take at least a week, said the injured CATS employees. The injured men claimed that they made two calls to the police but they reached the spot 30 minutes after the incident. “One of the policemen tried to frighten us; he said the attackers were all local criminals and since we were outsiders, we should not be getting into a confrontation with them. Almost 17 hours have passed since the attack on us, but not a single culprit has been arrested,” alleged Javed, an injured driver.The police said the locals turned violent after they learnt that the CATS staffers had allegedly tied up the suspected snatcher and assaulted him.“We have registered a case and are looking for the persons who damaged the ambulances and freed their associate who had tried to snatch a phone from an ambulance driver,” said deputy commissioner of police (outer) A Koan.There are two more base stations at the community centres of R and N blocks in Mangolpuri. Nearly 20 newly hired CATS ambulances are stationed at the three base stations and their drivers as well as paramedic staff have been given accommodations there itself, said Jitender Kaushik, president, CATS ambulance staff union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cats-staffers-attacked-by-mob-in-outer-delhi-for-foiling-theft-bid-8-ambulances-vandalised/story-uEUwQj9Kb85ys5tQ7gOmaM.html

Acting on a plea that said animals were starving due to the bankruptcy of circuses amid Covid-19, a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rajnish Bhatnagar asked the board to file a status report with regard to the survey. The court directed AWB to specifically ask circus officials if they were in a condition to maintain the animals or if they needed to be surrendered for rehabilitation in the nearest zoos.The bench issued notices to the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Ministry of Environment and Forests, the Central Zoo Authority and the Animal Welfare Board of India, while directing them to reply on the plea within two weeks.The court was hearing a plea by the Federation of Indian Animals Protection (FIAPO), a collection of organisation working for the protection of animal rights, which also challenges the constitutional validity of certain sections of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act as they permit exhibition and training of animals in circus acts.Senior advocate Dayan Krishnan, appearing for FIAPO, sought direction to the authorities to formulate an appropriate scheme for the rescue, rehabilitation and relocation of all animals rescued from circuses. He said there is an urgent need to ban animals from circuses and initiate their rehabilitation.The plea said circuses with animals performing tricks often use wild animals, including elephants, hippos, and exotic birds. It said these animals are very often used without requisite paperwork, certifying their fitness.It contended that the animals are chained and tied up for several hours each day, made to perform several shows without proper rest, trained using negative reinforcement with instruments such as metal rods, wooden sticks, whips and outdated and barbaric tools like hooks and spiked belts, the plea said.The plea said on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, there have been numerous reports of animals being stranded as part of these circuses all over the country and being abandoned by their owners.“This will lead to numerous animals perishing on account of starvation and unsanitary conditions. The intervention of this court is prayed to ensure that this entirely avoidable loss of life is averted. The urgency of this petition cannot be understated,” the petition said.The court, however, declined to grant interim relief and a direction to the authorities to take custody of all animals from all circuses operating in India and make appropriate arrangements for their transfer and well-being.It said it cannot pass any order like that without hearing all the parties and posted the matter for August 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/see-if-animals-stuck-in-circuses-need-rehab-court-tells-authorities/story-OaJtkQ6CR64FxY05vHuB3O.html
22-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi high court has some tough questions for NBCC over East Kidwai Nagar project||The Delhi high court on Tuesday -- while hearing a plea that alleged the East Kidwai Nagar redevelopment project was executed without considering environmental implications, road space, or rights of residents -- said it knows the condition of traffic in the city and NBCC India will have to give answers to the court .“Being a resident of Delhi, I know the traffic conditions in the city. You will need to give answers,”Justice Navin Chawla said after the petitioner concluded her arguments in person. The court will hear NBCC’s arguments on Wednesday. The court was hearing a petition filed by senior advocate Aman Lekhi and advocate Manali Singhal in 2014, who alleged the East Kidwai Nagar redevelopment project plan, meant to provide accommodation to government officials, was conceived without considering the environmental implications, road space or rights of residents.NBCC India is in charge of the project.During a hearing on Tuesday, advocate Singhal told the court that the project had been executed in complete violation of the Master Plan of Delhi-2021. She said 10% commercial use of the property had been allowed on wrong premises and explained that there was no parking for visitors, which was highlighted in a report submitted by IIT professor Geetam Tiwari to the high court in 2019.“There is no visitor’s parking. Cars would have to be parked on the service lane, which will lead to congestion,” she said, adding permission for the project had been given “without application of mind” and in an “arbitrary manner”.She said even the IIT report had said the project was “unrealistic” and incorrect. The Union government is developing a massive residential area around Ring Road in south Delhi. According to the plan, eight areas — East Kidwai Nagar, Sarojini Nagar, Netaji Nagar, Nauroji Nagar, Kasturba Nagar, Thyagaraja Nagar, Srinivaspuri and Mohammadpur — are being developed as group housing societies for government employees and for commercial use.The Centre is proposing to build over 25,000 flats for government employees in these neighbourhoods in addition to the 4,700 flats already built in East Kidwai Nagar adjoining South Extension-1.IIT professor Geetam Tiwari, who had come to assist the court, had pointed out loopholes in the project in her report. She had stated that the project should have been constructed according to Transit Oriented Development norms as the idea was to increase the use of public transport, but was not, resulting in congestion in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehi-high-court-has-some-tough-questions-for-nbcc-over-east-kidwai-nagar-project/story-KmEN1FlEGlkTvasfnHXAXN.html

The court was hearing a plea it had initiated itself with regard to the disbursement of unpaid salaries of teachers employed in schools run by the north corporation.During the hearing, the counsel for north Delhi municipal corporation told the court that the remaining amount payable to the teachers (for the month of April) is generated internally but due to the orders passed by the Supreme Court, it is required to release the salaries of sanitation workers, health workers and doctors who are on duties to contain the spread of coronavirus disease, on top priority.“It is stated that the Delhi government has not released its share of the salaries payable to the sanitation workers, health worker and doctors.Only in the first week of July, the Delhi government has released its share of salaries payable to the doctors for the months of April, May and June, but it is yet to release its share of the salaries payable to the sanitation workers,” the counsel for North DMC said.Avnish Ahlawat, standing counsel (Services), Delhi government, in a status report, informed the court that the dues to the tune of Rs 147 crore for the North DMC to pay salaries to its teachers has already been released in three monthly tranches for April, May and June. As per the government status report, the funds for the second quarter (July to September 2020) will be released by the end of each month.

South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) officials said they will utilise Gambusia fish for checking the spread of vector-borne diseases this year. Gambusia is a large genus of viviparous fish in the family Poeciliidae. They are also known as mosquitofish and can be introduced into ponds to eat mosquito larvae.According to SDMC officials, there are around 48 ponds under the south civic body’s jurisdiction where Gambusia fish farming is done.Anamika Mithilesh, mayor SDMC, said that killing mosquito larvae through Gambusia is an eco-friendly way of dealing with mosquito breeding. “Now that monsoon is at its peak, the threat of mosquito breeding has also increased. There are many open places such as Chhath Ghats, Raj Ghat and parks where water gets accumulated, which in turn lead to mosquito breeding and vector-borne diseases. Other than our routine exercises to kill the larva, this year we will also release Gambusia fishes at these water accumulation points to combat mosquito breeding. We have nurtured Gambusia fish at 48 ponds,” she said.She added that besides this, routine initiatives of the corporation that are taken every year will continue. She said that the season of vector-borne diseases — such as dengue, chikungunya and malaria — kicks off as soon as monsoon sets in. So, the corporation has started making efforts to tackle the issue before it spirals out of control.“In a meeting last week, instructions were issued to all officials of anti-malaria department, including the domestic breeding checkers (DBC), to intensify checking at domestic households and public places. They have also been instructed to spray anti-larval chemical solutions to prevent mosquito breeding,” the mayor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gambusia-fish-to-help-south-civic-body-combat-mosquitoes-this-year/story-cNZwJDaSZ1jGsorhyDbl4N.html

The affidavit was in response to a petition by Rahul Roy, seeking urgent orders for safe passage of ambulances for the injured and rehabilitation of the violence-affected people during the northeast Delhi riots. During the same hearing, after receiving the Delhi government’s reply, the Delhi High Court on Tuesday also adjourned the matters related to the registration of FIRs against various political leaders for making inflammatory speeches to August 4, after some of the counsels for the petitioners said that they had not received the response filed by the Delhi police.The court gave a last opportunity for filing the replies and said that no further adjournment would be given on the next date of hearing. It also posted a bunch of pleas seeking various reliefs in the Jamia violence for July 27 for the same reason.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rs18-67-crore-disbursed-to-northeast-riot-victims-delhi-govt-tells-hc/story-sRvAbbWoeZg6XNlocWotVK.html
22-07-2020||Delhi||Fruit vendor stabbed to death by four friends||A 27-year-old fruit vendor was stabbed to death, allegedly by his four friends, at Jheel Khureji near Krishna Nagar in east Delhi on Sunday night. The four men, who were arrested on Monday, said the vendor taunted them for depending on him for their drinking sessions after losing their livelihood amid the Covid-19 pandemic, police said.The crime was captured on a CCTV camera near the crime spot. The video footage shows two men riding a scooter stopping near the roadside. They are having a discussion when three men with their faces covered arrive on a bike and attack the fruit vendor, Jitender Gupta, riding pillion on the scooter, police said. The footage shows the fruit vendor trying to run but is overpowered. They pin him down and stab him while the man riding the scooter keeps on looking. Gupta again tries to flee but is caught and stabbed, killing him on the spot, senior police officers said.The police said Gupta’s wife rushed him to a hospital. He told her the names of the two attackers before he died, they said.Deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) Amit Sharma said the police received a call on Sunday night regarding a quarrel in Jheel Khureji. A police team reached the spot to learn that a man who was stabbed by some men had been taken to a nearby hospital, where he was declared brought dead. A case was registered, DCP Sharma said.“The deceased was killed by his friends. The suspects identified Sandip, Hemant Nitin Kapoor and Gaurav were caught,” said Sharma.During interrogation, the DCP said, one of the arrested men said Gupta used to bully them and often passed taunting remarks after they lost their livelihood.On Saturday night, an investigator said all five friends were drinking when Gupta passed similar remarks in a drunken stupor. One of the four men put his earphone to avoid Gupta’s remarks. This irked Gupta more and he allegedly threatened to kill him, the officer said.“The next morning, Gupta again taunted and threatened them, after which they hatched his murder plan,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fruit-vendor-stabbed-to-death-by-four-friends/story-WmFzlCwKrPlkbXEYIHlMiO.html
22-07-2020||Delhi||DU admission: Students can submit disability quota certificates from private institutes to register||Delhi University has allowed candidates seeking admission under the disability quota to provide relevant certificates from private medical institutes for the registration process in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, varsity officials said.Applicants were earlier required to submit certificates from notified government hospitals.According to the officials, the decision was taken after candidates said procuring certificates from government hospitals, which are treating Covid-19 patients, was difficult during the pandemic.Admission, however, will still be granted on the basis of certificates issued by government hospitals and students will get time to get those.Dean (admissions) Shobha Bagai said since admissions are likely to happen around September, students will get time to arrange for these certificates from government hospitals and submit it during admission time.“For the registration process, we have allowed students to upload anything they have and at the time of admission, they have to submit documents mentioned in the bulletin of information as per guidelines. In order to ensure a student-friendly process, we also allowed applicants to replace or update the supporting documents within the stipulated time period and without any charge,” she said.Last year, 27 government hospitals across 11 districts in Delhi were designated to issue disability certificates under the new central Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, for 21 conditions.Bipin Kumar Tiwari, an officer on special duty at the varsity’s Equal Opportunity Cell, said the decision was taken as a one-time measure during the pandemic. “Preferably, if applicants have any valid government certificate, they should upload that. However, if they don’t have it, they can upload one from a private institute for the time being to facilitate registration at least. During the time of admission, students will have to submit certificates from a government hospital,” he said.Reacting to the development, disability rights activist Dr Satendra Singh said, “This is the bare minimum that authorities can do for students during such troubled times. Applicants should not be expected to get certificates right now from here and there and the screening of certificates can happen later when they come to colleges. However, caution must be taken to ensure no unfair means is used for fake certificates.”The university’s admission committee has also allowed all applicants to download and use their class 12 marksheets from the government’s digital document wallet application DigiLocker. “The mark sheets that are downloaded directly from DigiLocker will be held valid for the purpose of admission,” Bagai said, adding the decision was taken after students had approached the administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/du-admission-students-can-submit-disability-quota-certificates-from-private-institutes-to-register/story-iMzy3JJIsSdDEMQWojiHDM.html

22-07-2020||Delhi||35-year-old man shot in front of minor daughters in Ghaziabad||A 35-year-old man was shot and critically injured in front of his two minor daughters by a group of men late Monday night at Vijay Nagar in Ghaziabad. The man sustained a gunshot injury in the head. The police arrested nine suspects in connection with the incident on Tuesday.The police identified the victim as Vikram Joshi, a journalist who works at a local Hindi newspaper. Joshi was riding his motorcycle with his two daughters, aged six and 10 years, when the group attacked after cornering him in Mata Colony area around 10.30pm on Monday. The shooting was also captured on a nearby CCTV camera, in which one of the two girls was seen shouting for help as the assailants fled the spot soon after.“Joshi’s brother informed us that he was returning from his sister’s house when the group attacked and critically injured him. We roped in six teams and arrested nine persons in connection with the incident,” said Kalanidhi Naithani, the senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Ghaziabad.The police identified the nine suspects as Ravi Kumar, Chotu (who goes by a single name), Mohit Kumar, Dalvir Singh, Akash Nath, Yogendra Singh, Abhishek Kant, Abhishek Mota and Mohammad Shakir, adding that they were working to nab another suspect Akash Bihari, who is on the run.All the suspects are residents of Vijay Nagar.“The family also alleged laxity on part of the local police, saying that they did not act on their previous complaint. I have suspended the local police post-in-charge and assigned the inquiry to the circle officer (city 1),” the SSP said.According to the police, the group, led by Ravi, fought with Joshi on July 16, as a result of which Ravi’s eye was injured and his jaw broken.“He was hospitalised and discharged on Monday. While in the hospital, he roped in his accomplices to ‘teach Joshi a lesson’. The group cornered Joshi on Monday night and started beating him up in the presence of his daughters. One of the suspects, Chotu, opened fire from close range—Joshi was shot in the head,” said Rakesh Mishra, circle officer (city 1).According to police sources, after the fight on July 16, the two parties lodged their complaints at the local police post. Joshi had alleged that the men had harassed his niece.“After the fight, we had complained that the men were harassing a girl from our family, but the local police took no action. The police just called the men to the post, asked them not to do so again and let them off. On Monday around 10.30pm when my uncle was riding his motorcycle with his daughters, the group cornered him and started beating him. One of them fired a gun at his head. He is in a very critical state,” said Vimal Joshi, the victim’s nephew.Dr Sangeeta Garg, the chief medical superintendent of Yashoda Hospital, Nehru Nagar, said, “The man has sustained a bullet injury to the head and his condition is very critical. He is admitted to the ICU and is on ventilator support.”The police, late Tuesday evening, released a statement in which they said that the suspects would often hang about in Mata Colony area to gamble, to which Joshi and his family objected. This led to the fight on July 16, the police said.Meanwhile, the incident drew criticism from Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the general secretary of the Congress, who slammed the law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh and tweeted, “A journalist was shot because he had given police complaint against harassment of his niece.”Akhilesh Yadav, Samajwadi Party chief and former chief minister of UP, accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Twitter and questioned how assailants could gather the courage to perpetrate such incidents.UP’s BJP spokesperson Chandra Mohan denied the allegations of deterioration in law and order and said that the politicians were tweeting about the incident because they had no other work.“Their work nowadays is only to tweet and levy accusations. The police acted swiftly and arrested nine persons. The reasons behind the incident are also being investigated. The politicians should have raised questions if the police had not acted,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-35-year-old-man-shot-in-front-of-minor-daughters/story-wlk0XMq6zDU6nKw7bDbk4N.html

A presentation of the design was made to Badnore on Tuesday.CHB under the scheme will build nearly 784 apartments of different categories, including those for economically weaker sections (EWS) and units with two and three bedrooms in seven storey buildings.“The board has to get a green signal from the approval committee of the estate office. Also, environment clearances are required for the project. But we expect all the requisite approvals to be in place in less than six months, and by the end of the year the scheme will be launched,” said a senior CHB official requesting anonymity.The board has 123 acres of land in its possession at IT Park where 20 sites are to be developed after another CHB residential project, Prideasia, failed to take off.“CHB will develop the scheme on two plots, measuring 10.51 acres and 6.43 acres at IT Park. Prices will be fixed after the drawings are approved by the architecture department,” the official said.The board will build 784 flats on two sites, while the remaining 18 sites will be given to private builders for development. For this, the board has hired a private consultant for improved designs.High-end officers’ flats for government officials of the UT administration, Haryana and Punjab are also planned in the area.CHB has decided to launch the scheme after it failed to sell 18 residential and commercial sites at an e-auction two years back. Due to the high reserve prices, not many developers showed interest in the auction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/it-park-chb-group-housing-scheme-set-for-rollout/story-UrKKex5RiihiP3pYWDfW6N.html
22-07-2020||Chandigarh||Weekend curfew may not break virus chain, but will send a message||Punjab and Haryana have turned down the UT administration’s proposal to impose a weekend curfew in the tricity from Friday 7pm to Monday 6 am, scuttling its plans to put stricter measures in place to control the spread of Covid-19.UT Adviser Manoj Parida talks to Hindustan Times regarding the rationale behind the proposal and strategies going forwardWhat made the UT propose a drastic step like a weekend curfew?For four months we have been successful in containing the spread of the disease in the city. But with borders opening and inter-state travel now allowed, there was sudden spike in cases. A majority of new cases are coming from people with travel history and their contacts. This has been indicated by contact and source tracing. We have stopped bus operations but other modes of transport are open.While you are attributing the recent spike to open borders, a weekend curfew will only put restrictions on locals. What can be achieved by imposing it?A weekend curfew cannot break the chain. It will convey a message of awareness to people. With lockdown restrictions eased, people somehow think that they can go back to normal, celebrate, and they can gather in large numbers. It (weekend curfew) is just to remind them that the battle is not over. On weekends we can effectively implement (rules) as government offices and markets are closed.Does it mean that the administration has failed to strictly enforce social distancing norms and that there has been poor monitoring of those coming from other places?The administration has not failed. We cannot post a policeman outside every house to enforce social distancing and wear masks. We are making surprise inspections, challaning people and running awareness campaigns. But, it is the failure of the people, families and social leaders like resident welfare associations. In an educated city, a sense of responsibility is expected from residents.With Punjab and Haryana saying no to a weekend curfew, what’s the administration’s strategy now?The administration will take the advice of medical experts and decide on Chandigarh going it alone in imposing the curfew. A final decision will be taken at Wednesday’s war room meeting.Why don’t you go in for a Sunday curfew like Punjab?Chandigarh will take its own decision, and a decision has to be a two-day curfew. There is no question of diluting it to one day. We will not take a token step.Is there any plan to restrict public dealing also in offices such as registering and licence authorities?We have introduced online system for appointments, and for grievance redressal. People have to register their vehicles and their properties. We cannot stop that. These were stalled for several months, we need to bring some normalcy in these affairs.The administration has come under criticism for the level of testing being undertaken in the city. Why is it shying away from vigorous testing?Chandigarh’s testing rate per day is more than double that of stipulated by the World Health Organisation. For instance, yesterday, there were 600 odd tests. We are screening the entire city for the second time now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/weekend-curfew-may-not-break-virus-chain-but-will-send-a-message/story-4NYps1LzzOM22hwYjqB3wK.html
22-07-2020||Pune||Pune’s sudden spike in cases: why, how and... is community transmission now a reality?||Even as the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) claims that it has the highest number of tests per million compared to any Indian city, the number of positives being detected is steadily increasing – 1,500+ cases per day for the last seven days. While the city’s positivity rate, the number of samples that test positive for every 100 samples tested for Covid-19 was 10 per cent in the month of April. As of Monday, July 20, this rate stands at 18%. While the district administration claims that this is because of increased testing thanks to the rapid antigen detection kits, health experts believe it is because the PMC has not been able to break the chain by improper contact tracing and, it needs to ramp up testing even more. Dr Abhijit More, member of the Jan Aarogya Manch, said, “If the number of positives are increasing drastically along with the number of tests, then it does reflect that there is community transmission. The ICMR may not declare it due to political or administrative reasons, but many ground workers have admitted that there is community transmission. The positivity rate needs to be below 5 per cent consistently for at least two weeks and only then, the curve will flatten. Tests per million may be high for Pune, but it does not necessarily prove enough tests are being conducted. The spread of the infection is also more widespread now. If the PMC doubles or even triples its testing capacity, the positivity rate will go down.”However, Dr Bharat Purandare, infectious disease specialist associated with Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, believes that instead of testing asymptomatic contacts, the PMC must test only symptomatic contacts and use the limited testing kits in the right way. He said, “The spread of the virus is in a geometric fashion and it is more intense. It spreads along the community. The ICMR may not say, it but there are clear indications that there are cases where the source is not known. Also these ratios are just a manipulation of figures which change dynamically. Every city is following this curve and we are just behind Mumbai, while Bengaluru is right behind us now. We must also be prepared that no matter what, anyone is likely to be infected now; and that is how the herd immunity develops. As citizens we must cover our mouth and nose and stop the spread of aerosol, but there is still a mild chance that the virus may enter the body. Quarantining the asymptomatic contacts of a positive person instead of testing them is the way out. Wasting kits on asymptomatic contacts is causing an overall delay as there is a waiting period of almost three days at some labs just to collect the sample, and thereafter, two days just to get the report if it is RT-PCR. This will delay the treatment process.” As of Monday, 2.09 lakh tests have been conducted by PMC of which 39,203 samples tested positive which bring the city’s positivity rate to 18.73%. While with the city’s case fatality rate stands at 2.56% with 1005 deaths reported as of Monday.Of the 14,757 active cases in the city, 591 are critical patients. The recovery rate of the city is 59.79% as 23,441 people have been discharged as of Monday. After a thorough house-to-house survey which the PMC claims to have done repeatedly in which 1.68 crore people were covered by 530 teams spread across the city. With respect to the containment zones and the sealed areas, till date, 5,027 patients were found to have flu-like symptoms and 21,694 were quarantined. Pune district collector, Naval Kishore Ram said, “The positivity rate is high because the spread of the infection is now more as compared to what it was in the beginning. We are testing specifically as per the ICMR guidelines, but we are working on ramping up our testing which includes those with comorbidities or the high-risk contacts. We are paying more attention to the treatment process and lowering the mortality rate. We will also increase the use of rapid antigen testing kits.”Dr Subhash Salunkhe, heading the state’s communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee, said, “There are three basic reasons for why the positivity rate is going up. One, the number of tests along with rapid antigen testing is going up. Two, the intensity of contact tracing aggressive and high risk contacts being tested is also going up; and third, the total number of tests is increasing and the denominator is also increasing, which is why the positivity rate is also increasing. It was anticipated that this would happen. At this stage it is critical to maintain strict implementation of home quarantine, and keep a watch on recovery rate and mortality rate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-s-sudden-spike-in-cases-why-how-and-is-community-transmission-now-a-reality/story-KmniqMwkKMgpHcHG1jLHkK.html

However, he did not have a fixed address. The two are natives of Baramati taluka.On July 17 around 9am, Pandule’s sheep were grazing the field, when one of the sheep strayed on the road in Somatane village in Maval taluka, according to the complaint.“His son told us that on of their sheep strayed and got stuck to a metal fence near a roadside field. The deceased man tried to save the sheep and got stuck to the fence himself. The son realised what had happened and called for help,” said police sub-inspector Dattatray Nagargoje of Shirgaon police outpost in jurisdiction of Talegaon Dabhade police station.Pandule died along with sheep on the spot, according to the police.The body was taken to a local government hospital for post-mortem. The doctors informed the police that the man died due to shock caused by electrocution, according to the police.“We had registered an accidental death case when it first happened. We called for an expert from Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) to the spot for an opinion. The expert submitted a report which revealed that the fence was running a charge due to contact with an illegal line that the farmer had drawn for irrigation pump on his field,” said PSI Nagargoje.The farm belongs to Vasant Dattatray Murhe who was booked in the case. He had used a metal hook to connect the pump on his field with the main electricity line.A case under Sections 304(a) (causing death due to negligence), 429 (mischief by killing or maiming cattle, of any value or any animal of the value of fifty rupees) of the Indian Penal Code along with Section 135 of the Indian Electricity Act, 2003, has been registered at Talegaon Dabhade police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/shepherd-electrocuted-to-death-by-illegal-live-wire-drawn-to-power-pumps-farmer-booked/story-0xKCyxNh3hxZMXql5g4X3K.html
22-07-2020||Pune||Home quarantine for asymptomatic positives in Pune: Tales from behind the locked doors||The Pune district administration has all but issued an order that asymptomatic Covid -19 positive cases are not to be admitted to hospitals, and are to be confined to home quarantines instead.“Sixty per cent of the positive cases are asymptomatic and that number is on the rise,” said Dr Ravindra Chhajed, consulting physician and intensivist at Harsh Hospital, Bibwewadi, and consultant at Ruby Hall Clinic, and Inamdar hospital in the city. At present he knows of 15 Covid patients in home isolation. He follows up on his patients daily through a video consultancy, along with the patients updating him via WhatsApp on the daily report of their health. “I have prescribed medicines depending on their mild symptoms. I have also asked them to buy the kits from hospitals to check their oxygen levels and temperatures while at home,” said Dr Chhajed.A teacher in Bibwewadi, tested positive, but had no symptoms. She now lives alone in her apartment but has her son-in-law, who is a doctor, taking care of her. “I live alone and initially was wondering how I got it. I was also surprised to see many patients waiting to be tested at the centre, but the doctors ease the fears. My society members were also informed as well the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) medical officer, who calls to check twice a week. My daughter lives in the next building and she is taking care of my diet and all the other necessary things that I might need. We talk via video calling and that uplifts my mood,” she said.In Balewadi, a 30-year-old man came in contact with the virus through an office colleague in a manufacturing unit. “I live with my wife in a two--bedroom house, so I have self-isolated in one of the bedrooms. My wife prepares food and leaves it near the door. She is also being helped with essentials by the society members who were informed of my condition. Even doctors at the Sahyadri Hospital as well as PMC medical officers have been very kind and helpful. I was provided a kit which includes an oxymeter, thermometer, sanitiser and mask by the hospital. Once a day, a nursing care manager who has been allotted my case calls to monitor my daily records. I usually end up reading books or watching TV series, and sleep as much as I can,” said the patient.It is not just common citizens, but doctors also who are testing positive. This doctor believes he got it from an OPD patient. “For him it began with severe lassitude and fatigue. There was no fever or cough the first 10 days, but he suspected Covid and isolated himself in one room in the house from day one. He was in constant touch with the hospital Covid team, who told him to treat this as Covid and self-isolate,” said his wife, who also tested positive. The couple live above a nursing home which the husband runs.“We are now quite fine except for mild weakness. I still have a poor appetite and anosmia, but that will reduce with time. We have been extremely careful with disinfection protocols. My staff has to wear N95 masks and gloves if they come upstairs to the door (no one is allowed in yet). We communicate via the intercom or cell phones,” says the wife, adding, “The most difficult thing was staying cheerful and upbeat on calls with family members. We literally had an army of friends and family members for ancillary support, yet the entire experience was intensely lonely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/home-quarantine-for-asymptomatic-positives-tales-from-behind-the-locked-doors/story-QLQQ5F6ULiStUVHtEIWTIK.html
22-07-2020||Pune||Naidu, one of state’s first dedicated Covid hospitals in Pune, yet to get ICU facility||Pune: Naidu Infectious Diseases Hospital, the only infection control hospital run by Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the first two hospitals in the state to be declared as dedicated for Covid-19 treatment, is yet to be equipped with an ICU facility.According to a hospital staffer, before the coronavirus pandemic broke in the city, the hospital did not have an ICU or a ventilator bed, necessary for the treatment of patients affected by the Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes coronavirus. The hospital upgraded itself with non-invasive ventilators, and critical care beds that are overflowing.Out of the 41 deaths reported in the city on Sunday [July 19], highest reported so far within 24 hours, Naidu hospital’s count alone was 14. Some of the deaths were registered as outdated as July 14. Of the 976 deaths reported in PMC jurisdiction as of Sunday, 49 are reported from Naidu hospital.The casualty figure raises questions on the hospital administration’s effectiveness to handle critical patients.Dr Sudhir Patsute, superintendent, Naidu hospital said, “We have seven non-invasive ventilators and 50 oxygen beds. Seventy hypoxic patients are presently admitted and all our critical care facilities are overburdened.” Hypoxia is a condition in which the body or a part of the body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply at the tissue level.Saurabh Rao, IAS officer on special duty for the administration’s response in fighting Covid-19 said, “We have upgraded PMC’s Dalvi hospital with over 10 invasive ventilators. I need to find out if Naidu requires any invasive ventilators that are needed when non-invasive ventilators do not help critical patients. Out of the 21 ventilators received through PM cares funds, we sent 15 to Sassoon General Hospital and remaining to Dalvi hospital.” Dr Abhijit More, health activist and member of Jan Arogya Manch, said, “PMC has always ignored to better the civic health infrastructure, be it the swine flu situation in the past or coronavirus outbreak, while private hospitals flourished. While authorities claim to have ramped up medical facilities on war footing to handle the pandemic, civic hospitals lacking crucial equipment to treat critical patients is no less than criminal negligence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/naidu-one-of-the-state-s-first-dedicated-covid-hospitals-yet-to-get-icu-facility/story-QxstOQpTAUyWy8uQpvyG8H.html

But it remains to be seen whether the shopkeepers will sell these over the Chinese ones. If we are able to provide a good product at cheap rates, the market will not look towards Chinese made rakhis,” Ghosh said.Artists who are preparing rakhi at the Kalamandir said that they had started using the traditional patterns and materials on masks, etc during the COVID-19 induced lockdown.“We are trying to use as less plastic as we can and especially during this lockdown phase we are using the local patterns to add a traditional twist to the rakhis. We are promoting this on social media platforms, and the response so far has been great. Till now, we have made over 11,000 rakhis,” an artist at the centre said.Meanwhile, in positive news for the artisans in the country shopkeepers in Ahmedabad, Gujarat have claimed that demand for Chinese made rakhis has fallen this Rakshabandhan festival.“All of us are hurt by China’s actions. Customers who come here are willing to pay a little bit more for Indian products instead of Chinese,” a shopkeeper told ANI here.Customers at the shop said that they would rather opt for the indigenous rakhis rather than those imported from China as they are better in quality and are traditional.

22-07-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab pushes for testing, patient contact tracing||Punjab has focused on testing and contact tracing in the past two months to contain the spread of Covid-19 even as the mortality rate continues to be an area of concern for the Amarinder Singh-led government.For about a week, 300-400 cases are getting added daily to the state’s patient tally, but in comparison to many other states, Punjab’s caseload has not increased that much.On May 21, Punjab was among the top 10 states with a caseload of 2,028 and by July 20, the state was at 18th position.On May 21, Punjab was conducting only 1,865 tests per million of population, which now has gone up to 14,204 tests per million, claims the health department. Currently, the state is conducting 10,000 tests per day, five times the number on May 20. The state is planning to increase the daily testing to 20,000 by September 10, it is learnt.“Punjab had a different set of challenges because of the arrival of NRIs and labourers for farm and industrial sectors. Restrictions in movement also helped us in curbing the spread of virus as compared to other states,” said Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar.70% of cases contacts of those tested +veNearly 70% of Punjab’s total cases are the contacts of those having tested positive. As a preventive measure, the state has tested 10 people against each infected patient to break the infection chain. The health authorities claim that they have traced 99% of the contacts of every patient.“In cases where patients don’t share their contacts, we take help of police and procure CDR reports of mobile phone and trace their locations and contacts. Help of IIT Chennai is also being taken to get details of GPS locations of the positives,” an official said.Besides, the government has made it mandatory for every person visiting Punjab to get registered on the COVA app. Also, it is compulsory for every person coming from outside the state for more than 72 hours to quarantine themselves in their homes for 14 days. Since July 17 when curfew relaxation were announced, of the 2.34 lakh people who arrived in Punjab from different states and abroad, 75,148 (32%) were tested for Covid-19. Of these, 1, 353 were found infected with a positivity rate of 1.8%.State’s CRF as high as national averageAt 2.5%, the state high case fatality rate (CFR) continues to be a matter of concern as it is as high as the national average.From total 265 deaths the states has witnessed due to the coronavirus, maximum were above sixty years of age.“This can be attributed to the high rate of co-morbidities among those infected in Punjab. Our analysis reveals that nearly 30% of fatalities were actually due to other illnesses the patients were suffering from. Covid was not the primary cause of their death,” Dr Bhaskar claimed.With the state’s daily case count touching 400, the government has roped in private hospitals for treating Covid-19 patients after capping treatment rates at these facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/trailing-till-may-punjab-on-a-better-footing-than-haryana-in-covid-fight/story-cpfINS0KsChsQnhTJZvWhN.html

Vaccines for this pandemic are not for the wealthy, they are not for the poor, they are for everybody,” he said.The US government will pay $1.95 billion to buy 100 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine being developed by Pfizer Inc and German biotech BioNTech if it proves safe and effective, the companies said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Ryan also cautioned schools to be careful about re-opening until community transmission of Covid-19 is under control. Debate in the United States over restarting education has intensified, even as the pandemic flares up in dozens of states.“We have to do everything possible to bring our children back to school, and the most effective thing we can do is to stop the disease in our community,” he said. “Because if you control the disease in the community, you can open the schools.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-expect-first-covid-19-vaccine-until-early-2020-says-who-expert/story-kTgt1fXtVogWluhyd7vCJI.html
22-07-2020||World||Ukraine president defends movie post to end hostage crisis||Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday defended his decision to agree to a hostage-taker’s bizarre demand that he post a movie recommendation to end a 12-hour stand-off.Zelensky described how he negotiated personally on Tuesday evening with a gunman who was holding 13 hostages on a bus in Lutsk, around 400 kilometres (250 miles) west of capital Kiev. The tense stand-off ended after the president agreed to post a video of himself recommending a 2005 US documentary narrated by actor Joaquin Phoenix called “Earthlings”, which condemns humans’ mistreatment of animals. “We have a result -- everyone is alive. We are not fighting for (approval) ratings -- we are fighting for life,” Zelensky said in a statement, after some criticised him for giving in to the gunman’s demands.The SBU security service said all the bus passengers were released unharmed. The hostage-taker had earlier fired shots and thrown an explosive package.Zelensky said he agreed in a phone-call with the man, identified as 44-year-old Maksym Kryvosh, that “he would release three people, and after that I would record a video.”- ‘Unstable’ -The armed man complied and freed three hostages: a man, a pregnant woman and a child.In response, the president posted a video message on Facebook urging people to watch the documentary.Kryvosh agreed to release all his captives half an hour later, Zelensky said.Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said Kryvosh, who was armed with a pistol, a rifle and a hand grenade, came out of the bus following the negotiations.Footage published by Ukrainian officials showed police escorting hostages away while armed special forces detained Kryvosh, lying face-down on the pavement.The SBU security service classed the incident as an “act of terror” and “hostage-taking” and Kryvosh faces up to 15 years in prison.After the crisis ended, Zelensky deleted the short video he had posted.“Today loved ones can hug everybody who languished all day on the bus with a gun pointed at them,” he wrote on Facebook.“We did not lose a single person,” added the president, who was a television comedian before his 2019 election win.The hostage-taker is currently in a temporary detention centre, police reported.Kryvosh had previously spent around 10 years in prison on charges including fraud and illegal handling of weapons. Interior minister Avakov described him as “unstable.”Posts in a Twitter account in Kryvosh’s name, later suspended, claimed he had bombs and asked top Ukrainian celebrities to post anti-establishment messages on social media.The security service said on Wednesday that it had detained several suspected accomplices.The head of the Lutsk branch of the SBU, Pavlo Danyukov, said at a briefing that the hostages were in satisfactory condition and had not suffered any physical violence during the stand-off.- ‘This is a mistake’ -The US Embassy in Ukraine tweeted a message of praise, saying: “We join the people of Ukraine in celebrating the safe release of the hostages... and commend Ukrainian authorities’ success in securing their release.”Some Ukrainians criticised Zelensky for his concession to the hostage-taker, however.Many likened the incident to an episode of the popular British television series “Black Mirror” where the prime minister fulfils the grotesque demands of a kidnapper holding a member of the royal family.Natalia Delgyado, a Kiev-based Facebook user, wondered “whether Zelensky would have fulfilled the terrorist’s demands if he had demanded public sex with a pig like in the plot of the Black Mirror episode”. “This is a mistake. We should not negotiate with terrorists,” Kiev-based lawyer Igor Pashnev wrote on Facebook.But another Facebook user, Eduard Runin, from Kharkiv, praised Zelensky for choosing the option of “fulfilling the demands of a terrorist and keeping people alive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraine-president-defends-movie-post-to-end-hostage-crisis/story-e0xUxckRPj7hoe033JjozN.html

This dramatic development is sure to further sour the rapidly deteriorating bilateral ties with the two countries already at loggerheads over South China Sea disputes, the Hong Kong security bill, US arms sales to Taiwan, the condition of minorities in Xinjiang, and the origin of the coronavirus besides an ongoing trade war.Earlier on Wednesday, Hu Xijin, the editor of the Communist Party’s Global Times newspaper said Washington had given 72 hours to Beijing – that is by July 24 – to close down the Houston consulate.Also read: Relationship with India important, monitoring LAC very closely - US defense secretaryHu’s tweet came hours after Houston police and firefighters descended on the consulate following witness reports that papers were being burned outside in open containers, the Houston Chronicle and two local TV stations reported, citing local police.In Beijing, the Chinese foreign ministry lashed out at the Donald Trump administration for passing the order.ALSO WATCH | ‘US leading the world in Covid-19 testing, India second’: Donald Trump “It is a political provocation unilaterally launched by the US side, which seriously violates international law, basic norms governing international relations and the bilateral consular agreement between China and the US.”Speaking at the regular ministry briefing, Wang said, “China strongly condemns such an outrageous and unjustified move which will sabotage China-US relations. We urge the US to immediately withdraw its erroneous decision, otherwise, China will make legitimate and necessary reactions”.“The unilateral closure of China’s consulate general in Houston within a short period of time is an unprecedented escalation of its recent actions against China,” Wang said and listed allegations of Washington harassing its diplomats and students in the US.“For some time, the US government has been shifting the blame to China with stigmatisation and unwarranted attacks against China’s social system, harassing Chinese diplomatic and consular staff in the US, intimidating and interrogating Chinese students and confiscating their personal electrical devices, even detaining them without cause,” Wang said.The spokesperson said China had shown goodwill to US diplomats in China and had promoted Sino-US ties through its envoys in the US.“On the contrary, the US put restrictions on Chinese diplomats in June and last October respectively with no valid reason. [The US] has seized and opened mail and official supplies,” Wang said.Due to the deliberate smearing and hatred-inciting moves from the US, Chinese delegations in the US have recently received bomb threats and death threats. Responding to a separate question at the press conference, spokesperson Wang asked the US to immediately stop making accusations against it about cybercrimes, in response to Washington’s indictment of two Chinese nationals for hacking Covid-19 vaccine-related data and defence secrets.Wang said “…the consulate was operating normally” but sidestepped questions about US media reports in Houston on Tuesday night that documents were being burned in a courtyard at the consulate.Earlier on Wednesday, US media reported that Houston police and fire officials responded to reports that documents were being burned in the courtyard of the Consulate General of China in Houston on Tuesday night, citing the Houston Police Department (PD).Houston PD said they began receiving reports just after 8 pm that documents were being burned at 3417 Montrose Boulevard where the consulate is located, click2houston.com reported.The Chinese Consulate in Houston was opened in 1979 - the first in the year the US and China established diplomatic relations.The consulate website says the office covers eight southern US states - including Texas and Florida - and has nearly one million people in the area registered at the consulate.There are five Chinese consulates in the US while the embassy is in Washington.The US has its embassy in Beijing and consulates in Chengdu, Shanghai, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/livid-china-ready-to-retaliate-after-us-says-shut-houston-consulate-in-72-hours/story-ALtRuNXsA0sWI0zLrtdD4M.html

It has 24 questions based on British traditions, history and customs that migrants need to know well enough to pass it.To prepare for the test, the applicants are prescribed an official handbook called ‘Life in the United Kingdom: A Guide for New Residents’. Over 1.25 lakh migrants applied for naturalisation in 2019, a process that includes the test.The historians, mainly specialising in the area of British empire, wrote an open letter in protest against what they call “misrepresentation of slavery” and empire in the test and the handbook, which includes references to colonial India.The letter says: “The official handbook published by the Home Office is fundamentally misleading and in places demonstrably false…It also states that ‘by the second part of the 20th century, there was, for the most part, an orderly transition from Empire to Commonwealth, with countries being granted their independence’.”“In fact, decolonisation was not an ‘orderly’ but an often violent process, not only in India but also in the many so-called ‘emergencies’ such as the Mau-Mau Uprising in Kenya (1952-1960). We call for an immediate official review of the history chapter”.Signatories include David Washbrook (Cambridge), Yasmin Khan (Oxford), Joya Chatterjee (Cambridge), William Dalrymple, Tirthankar Roy (LSE), Anindita Ghosh (Manchester), Sujit Sivasundaram (Cambridge) and David Olusoga (Manchester).The letter says: “Applicants are expected to learn about more than two hundred individuals. The only individual of colonial origin named in the book is Sake Dean Mohamet who co-founded England’s first curry house in 1810. The pages on the British Empire end with a celebration of Rudyard Kipling”.“The aim of the official handbook is to promote tolerance and fairness and facilitate integration. In its current version, the historical pages do the opposite…Until the history chapter has been corrected and rewritten, it should be formally withdrawn from the test”.The Home Office, headed by secretary Priti Patel, said: “Given the breadth of British history, the Life in the UK handbook provides a starting point to explore our past and help those seeking to live permanently in the UK gain a basic understanding of our society, culture and historical references which occur in everyday conversations”.“We have published several editions of the handbook since it was launched and will continue to keep its contents under review and consider any feedback we receive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/revise-official-history-on-india-british-empire-urgently-historians-tell-uk/story-YHke8kJgcS9D7yOpeutumM.html

But, the Reuters tally shows the disease is accelerating the fastest in the Americas, which account for more than half the world’s infections and half its deaths.Globally, the rate of new infections shows no sign of slowing, according to the Reuters tally, based on official reports.After the first Covid-19 case was reported in Wuhan, China, in early January, it took about 15 weeks to reach 2 million cases. By contrast, it took just eight days to climb above 15 million from the 13 million reached on July 13.Health experts stress that official data almost certainly underreports both infections and deaths, particularly in countries with limited testing capacity.The official number of coronavirus cases at 15,009,213 is at least triple the number of severe influenza illnesses recorded annually, according to World Health Organization data, while the death toll of more than 616,000 in seven months is close to the upper range of yearly influenza deaths.Relax or tightenWith the first wave of the virus still to peak in several countries and a resurgence of case numbers in others, some countries are reintroducing strict social distancing measures while others relax restrictions.Stung by low approval ratings for his handling of the epidemic and downplaying the risks during the early stages, Trump made a significant shift in rhetoric on Tuesday, encouraging Americans to wear a face mask.While the epidemic worsened in the United States, Trump’s focus ahead of a presidential election in November has been on reopening the economy, and governors in the hard-hit states of Texas, Florida and Georgia continue to push back hard against calls for stricter restrictions.In Brazil, more than 2.15 million people have tested positive including President Jair Bolsonaro, and more than 81,000 people have died. While Bolsonaro has played down the outbreak, its scale has made Brazil a prime testing ground for potential vaccines.India, the only other country with more than 1 million cases, reported almost 40,000 new cases on Wednesday. Having been keen to reopen its economy, India is now facing the twin challenge of combating the pandemic and massive flooding in the country’s northeast.Two ministers in South Africa’s cabinet were admitted to hospital with Covid-19, as Africa’s most-industrialised country counted a total 372,628 confirmed cases and 5,173 deaths.Other countries are reintroducing restrictions in response to fresh outbreaks.In Spain, the number of people allowed on Barcelona’s beaches was limited after crowds flocked to the seaside over the weekend despite advice to stay home.In Australia, residents of Melbourne, the country’s second biggest city, were ordered to wear masks in public from Wednesday after the country reported a record 501 new cases.Officials in Canada were closely watching a spike in cases as the economy reopens, attributing the rise in part to large numbers of young people gathering in bars.China, meanwhile, announced that passengers on inbound flights must provide negative Covid-19 test results before boarding, as authorities seek to reduce the risk of imported cases amid increased international travel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-covid-19-cases-exceed-15-million/story-ANaxmb4BPoyXznHm3RyaMN.html
22-07-2020||World||Five common cancers could get detected up to 4 years before conventional diagnosis: Study||A non-invasive blood test could prove key in detecting five common cancers up to four years before conventional diagnosis, a new international clinical study conducted in China says.The long-term study, the findings of which were published in Nature Communications on June 21, a leading science journal, was carried out on 123,115 individuals in Taizhou city in eastern China’s Jiangsu province.As part of the Taizhou Longitudinal Study (TZL), the individuals, aged between 25 and 90, provided blood samples for long-term storage between 2007 and 2014. The samples were collected by the Shanghai-based Fudan University.“These individuals were then indefinitely monitored for cancer occurrence through linkages with local cancer registries and health insurance databases. By the end of 2017, a total of 575 initially healthy subjects (who presented as asymptomatic) were diagnosed with one of five common cancer types (stomach, esophagus, colorectum, lung or liver) within 4 years of initial blood draw,” the study said.Also read: Breast Cancer Awareness - All you need to know about the disease, its symptoms and moreThe five cancer types studied in the research account for 261,530 annual cancer deaths in the US and 2.1 million cancer deaths every year in China, the study said, adding that early detection could greatly reduce deaths from these diseases.“Recent studies have also identified that early detection of cancer could reduce cancer treatment costs by $26 billion annually (and also reduce the loss of productivity caused by cancer),” it said.“The ultimate goal would be performing blood tests like this routinely during annual health checkups,” said Zhang Kun, one of the paper’s corresponding authors and professor and chair of the Department of Bioengineering at the University of California, San Diego.“But the immediate focus is to test people at higher risk based on family history, age or other known risk factors,” Zhang was quoted by the University of California which was involved in the study.The researchers said early diagnosis of cancer was the aim of the study as late-stage cancers often lack an effective treatment option.“Survival rates increase significantly when cancer is identified at early stages as the tumour can be surgically removed or treated with milder drug regimens; average 5-year survival at early stage is 91%, while average 5-year survival at late stage is 26%,” the study said.The detection of tumours at the earliest possible stage is therefore of paramount importance for cancer treatment. The test, which has been named the PanSeer assay, however, is unlikely to predict which patients will later go on to develop cancer.Instead, it is most likely identifying patients who already have cancerous growths but remain asymptomatic for current detection methods, the study said.In conclusion, the research team said that more large-scale longitudinal studies were needed to confirm the potential of the test for the early detection of cancer in pre-diagnosis individuals.“We also demonstrate that PanSeer detects cancer in 95%... of asymptomatic individuals who were later diagnosed, though future longitudinal studies are required to confirm this result. These results demonstrate that cancer can be non-invasively detected up to four years before the current standard of care,” it said.The team, according to the University of California, comprised researchers from “…Fudan University and at Singlera Genomics, a San Diego and Shanghai-based startup that is working to commercialise the tests based on the advances originally made in Zhang’s bioengineering lab at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-common-cancers-could-get-detected-up-to-4-years-before-conventional-diagnosis-study/story-qQfO23z9CPToBFTbTVMVoO.html
22-07-2020||World||US asked China to close Houston consulate: Report||The US government abruptly ordered China to close its consulate in Houston in an “unprecedented escalation,” the Foreign Ministry said, in the latest sign of deteriorating ties between the world’s biggest economies.China said the move was unilaterally initiated by the U.S. and Beijing would “react with firm countermeasures” if the Trump administration doesn’t “revoke this erroneous decision.” It accused the U.S. of harassing diplomatic staff and intimidating Chinese students, confiscating personal electrical devices and detaining them without cause. Chinese diplomatic missions and personnel also recently received bomb and death threats, it added.“China strongly condemns such an outrageous and unjustified move which will sabotage China-U.S. relations,” the Foreign Ministry said. “We urge the U.S. to immediately withdraw its erroneous decision. Otherwise China will make legitimate and necessary reactions.”It wasn’t immediately clear what spurred the move by the U.S., which has clashed with China over everything from trade and 5G networks to territorial disputes and responsibility for the pandemic. The Justice Department on Tuesday accused two Chinese hackers of working for Beijing to steal or try to steal terabytes of data, including coronavirus research, from Western companies in 11 nations.A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.In the statement, China said “infliltration and interference is never in the genes and tradition of China’s foreign policy,” without referring to anything specific.On Tuesday night in Houston, police and firefighters descended on the consulate following witness reports that papers were being burned outside in open containers, the Houston Chronicle and two local TV stations reported, citing local police.In videos posted online by local media outlets in Houston, fires could be seen in multiple containers, with smoke rising into the sky. TV stations KPRC and KHOU said firefighters were not allowed inside the complex, and KHOU said the fires were later extinguished. The Chronicle said no injuries were reported.The Chronicle and both stations separately reported the consulate would be evicted on Friday at 4 p.m. local time, each citing unnamed sources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-close-consulate-in-houston-says-news-agency-reuters-quoting-sources/story-Yz9Gly1isk9clBdRIiMtsM.html
22-07-2020||World||After Dahal stand down in round 1, fight with Oli is now for cabinet berths in Nepal reshuffle ahead||After a dramatic stand down by Nepalese Communist Party co-chairman P K Dahal during a political duel with Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli last week, the stage is now set for a possible cabinet reshuffle in the Himalayan Republic after the party standing committee meets on July 28. It is the allotment of cabinet berths to various factions of NCP which will define the politics ahead. While it is known that the morning meeting between co-chair Oli, Dahal and Madhav Nepal on July 15 was acrimonious to say the least, it is still not clear who ensured the stand down from Dahal after a lunch with Nepalese PM the same day and at what cost. It is only after this crucial lunch meeting with two associates of the two leaders negotiating on the sidelines that Oli refused to step down either from PM post or the party post and Dahal caved in by saying that he was opposed to the division of the party. Oli got a walkover in the duel last week and Dahal is now looking towards more Cabinet berths to maintain his political clout. The Chinese Ambassador to Nepal, Hou Yonqi, on her part is preparing for another political battle ahead in an uncertain Nepal. “We do not know whether it was lure of incentives or threat of vulnerabilities that settled the round last week. But what is definitely know is that the Chinese had a major role to play in avoiding the bust-up,” said a western diplomat based in Kathmandu.Ambassador Hou, the master handler of KathmanduAlthough the politics in Nepal continues to be fluid and uncertain, Hindustan Times explored the background of Ambassador Hou, who is at the centrestage of the political games in the Republic.Born in Shanxi province in March, 1970, Hou is a master of arts and holds a major in Urdu language from Peking University, and is fluent in Hindustani language. While many assume that she has an PLA Intelligence background as she was Director, Department of External Security Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2012-2013, Hou for the record is a career diplomat with a firm belief that diplomacy is war by other means.For the past 24 years since 1996, Ambassador Hou has been attached to department of Asian Affairs and rose up to one of the four Deputy Director Generals in that department from 2015-2018 before becoming a master handler of Nepal. Barring a stint as Attache in Pakistan in 1996-2001 and 2007-2009 tenure as Consul at the Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles, Hou has served only in Asian Affairs department to date.While Ambassador Hou has been successful in keeping the NCP flock together and orchestrated Oli’s needling of India through cartographic expansion, Beijing has not been so-successful in reading the Nepalese society. Even though China has now offered to revive one of the two hydropower projects in Nepal for free, the hill people of Nepal are still to be enamoured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-dahal-stand-down-in-round-1-fight-with-oli-is-now-for-cabinet-berths-in-nepal-reshuffle-ahead/story-wfwZmDbl8QPo1dukDKbsYN.html
22-07-2020||World||Swedish epidemiology boss says questioned Covid-19 strategy seems to be working||Sweden’s top epidemiologist said on Tuesday a rapid decline in new critical Covid-19 cases alongside slowing death rates indicated that Sweden’s strategy for slowing the epidemic, which has been widely questioned abroad, was working. Sweden has foregone a hard lockdown throughout the outbreak, a strategy that set it apart from most of Europe.Chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell of the public health agency said a rapid slowdown in the spread of the virus indicated very strongly that Sweden had reached relatively widespread immunity. “The epidemic is now being slowed down, in a way that I think few of us would have believed a week or so ago,” he told a news conference. Daily Covid-19 death rates as well as the number of infected in intensive care have been slowing gradually since April, with seven new deaths and no new ICU admissions reported by the health agency on Tuesday. Reported daily deaths peaked mid-April at 115. “It really is yet another sign that the Swedish strategy is working,” Tegnell said. It is possible to slow contagion fast with the measures we are taking in Sweden.”The slowdown in Sweden matched that in several countries that have accredited it to lockdowns. “We have managed to do it with substantially less invasive measures,” he said.Sweden’s death toll of 5,646, when compared relative to population size, has far outstripped those of its Nordic neighbours, although it remains lower than in some European countries that locked down, such as Britain and Spain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swedish-epidemiology-boss-says-questioned-covid-19-strategy-seems-to-be-working/story-e2lGaZh3iHiyoCjo9pJ9kM.html
22-07-2020||World||Pakistani journalist Matiullah Jan set free by abductors ahead of court appearance||Pakistani journalist Matiullah Jan was released on Tuesday evening, approximately 12 hours after he was kidnapped from outside a public school in the heart of Islamabad. Observers have said it is still unclear who kidnapped him and why but all fingers point to the spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).The decision to release Matiullah Jan may have been taken after Islamabad High Court ordered authorities to produce him before it on Wednesday morning.Camera footage of the incident shows Jan’s abductors included plainclothesmen as well as uniformed policemen, who were travelling in four cars.Soon after Jan dropped his wife outside the government school in Islamabad, the footage shows the other cars encircling his vehicle and taking the journalist into custody.Jan, who is no stranger to controversy, was summoned earlier this week over an alleged tweet against judges and the judiciary.A three-member bench of the top court headed by the chief justice is hearing the case in which he was to appear on Wednesday morning. The court in its contempt notice stated Jan in a tweet from his Twitter account on July 10 apparently used painful words against judges and the judiciary.Last week, Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Athar Minallah dismissed another contempt application against Jan, saying the dignity of independent judges “is not so fragile and it can’t be harmed by a tweet.”A number of journalists and media associations had voiced concern about the safety of the Islamabad-based reporter. His abduction had also elicited comments from ministers in the Imran Khan cabinet. Information minister Shibli Faraz had condemned the incident but at the same time told reporters that he did not have any information on who had picked up Jan.Jan was attacked in Islamabad in 2017 but he had escaped unhurt. He was travelling from Islamabad with his children when two motorcyclists threw a rock and smashed the windscreen of his car.Before that, Jan had said he was chased by another car at night and his windscreen was smashed in a similar attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-journalist-matiullah-jan-set-free-by-abductors-ahead-of-court-appearance/story-uAcdt8QvG7Gan781kybV2J.html

22-07-2020||World||Apology demanded from GOP lawmaker for Ocasio-Cortez remark||New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez accused a Republican colleague on Tuesday of angrily harassing her outside the Capitol over her progressive views in an encounter that a reporter said ended with the congressman using a sexist slur as he walked away.The No. 2 House Democrat demanded that Florida Rep. Ted Yoho, one of the House’s most conservative members, apologize to Ocasio-Cortez, one of the House’s most progressive, over Monday’s confrontation. A spokesperson for Yoho denied that the lawmaker had used a sexist slur, saying the Florida congressman had instead muttered “bull——” to himself to describe Ocasio-Cortez’s policies.There was little sign that Yoho’s GOP colleagues were rising to defend him, and the House minority leader said he would speak to Yoho.“We think everyone should show respect to one another,” Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told reporters about the episode, which occurred during an election year in which partisan divisions have been rubbed raw.In a tweet Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said she had never spoken to Yoho “before he decided to accost me” as they passed each other on the Capitol’s outdoor steps during a vote.“Believe it or not, I usually get along fine w/ my GOP colleagues. We know how to check our legislative sparring at the committee door. But hey, ‘b(asterisk)tches’ get stuff done,” she wrote, using one of the words Yoho reportedly used.A reporter for The Hill newspaper witnessed the encounter, the newspaper said. According to the news outlet, Yoho approached Ocasio-Cortez and said her recent comments connecting poverty to a crime surge in New York City during the coronavirus pandemic were “disgusting.”“You are out of your freaking mind,” Yoho added. Ocasio-Cortez told Yoho he was being “rude,” the article said.The Hill said as the two headed in opposite directions, Yoho uttered the sexist comment “to no one in particular.”Walking with Yoho was Rep. Roger Williams, R-Texas, another conservative. Heather Douglass, Williams’ spokesperson, said he didn’t hear the exchange and “would have immediately condemned that type of language towards any colleague.”Ocasio-Cortez fired back, saying Williams was lying about not hearing the conversation and had even participated in it, making his own remark about “throwing urine.”“When he undeniably sees another man engaged in virulent harassment of a young woman, just pretend you never saw it in the most cartoonish manner possible,” she wrote.Yoho, 65, is a member of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus and a foe of GOP leaders he’s considered too moderate like former Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. He’s retiring when his term ends in January.Ocasio-Cortez, 30, is a high-profile first-term congresswoman whose vociferous support for proposals like the Green New Deal has won her appearances in GOP campaign ads casting her as a liberal villain.Yoho spokesperson Brian Kaveney said in an email Tuesday that Yoho “had a brief member to member conversation” and had not called Ocasio-Cortez a name. He wrote that Yoho said “bull——” to himself, “summarizing what he believes her policies to be.”“It is unfortunate that Rep. Ocasio-Cortez is using this exchange to gain personal attention,” said Kaveny.Kaveny did not immediately respond to a follow-up email asking if Yoho would apologize.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said Yoho’s comments were “despicable and unacceptable” and require an apology on the House floor. By late afternoon Tuesday, there was no indication whether that would occur.“It was the act of a bully, of a person who is the antithesis of the person we are honoring this week, John Lewis,” said Hoyer, referring to the Georgia Democrat and civil rights hero who died Friday. He said Yoho’s action was “despicable conduct and it needs to be sanctioned.″Other congressional Democrats swarmed to Ocasio-Cortez’s defense on Twitter.Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who, like Ocasio-Cortez, is a member of the “Squad” of first-term congresswomen of color, wrote that Yoho had “perpetuated” the problem of violence against women with his “sexist verbal attack.”Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., tweeted that he, too, believes poverty can cause crime and said, “Wonder why Rep. Yoho hasn’t accosted me on the Capitol steps with the same sentiment?”___Associated Press writers Matthew Daly and Mary Clare Jalonick in Washington contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apology-demanded-from-gop-lawmaker-for-ocasio-cortez-remark/story-yekkDoXoAjcvwr2R7VDIJP.html
22-07-2020||World||Donald Trump says Covid-19 in US will get worse before it gets better||President Donald Trump warned on Tuesday that the “nasty horrible’” coronavirus will get worse in the U.S. before it gets better, but he also tried to paint a rosy picture of efforts to conquer the disease that has claimed more than 140,000 American lives in just five months.He also professed a newfound respect for the protective face masks he has seldom worn. He pulled one from his pocket in the White House briefing room but didn’t put it on.After a three-month hiatus from his freewheeling daily virus briefings, Trump returned to the podium, keeping the stage to himself without the public health experts who were staples of his previous events but keeping close to scripted remarks prepared by aides.Besides declaring support for masks as a way to fight the pandemic, he admonished young people against crowding bars and spreading the disease.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIt all marked a delayed recognition by Trump that the economic reopening he’s been championing since April — and, more importantly, his reelection — were imperiled by spiking cases nationwide.There were no guarantees how long Trump’s more measured tone, delivered with an eye to halting a campaign-season erosion of support, would last. Along the way Tuesday, the president still worked in jabs at the news media and Democrats for focusing on disease-fighting shortcomings in the U.S. as the rest of world also struggles with the virus. He also belatedly addressed bipartisan criticism of virus-testing delays that have hampered reopening plans.“It will probably unfortunately get worse before it gets better,” Trump said from the White House. But he also touted a reduction in deaths and progress on vaccines and treatments for Covid-19, which he referred to repeatedly as a the “China virus.” He continued his recent encouragement of Americans to wear masks when social distancing is not possible.“Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact,” he said. “I’m getting used to the mask,” he added, pulling one out after months of suggesting that mask-wearing was a political statement against him.Swaths of the country are now battling rising infections and growing deaths, and some states are once again having to close businesses and rethink school in the fall. Many retailers themselves are insisting their customers don masks.For months, the nation’s top health experts have pleaded with Americans to wear masks in public and steer clear of crowds -- calling those simple steps life-saving -- even as the president’s stance fueled a partisan social divide.The early evening show at the White House came as the next stage of the federal government’s response to the pandemic was being crafted on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers and White House officials were opening negotiations on a trillion-dollar-or-more “phase four” rescue package.For weeks, White House aides have pressed Trump to grow more disciplined in his public statements about the pandemic. On Tuesday, he steered clear of what has been a favored talking point: that widespread testing for the virus in the U.S. “created” more cases, as aides noted that was false and projected a lack of responsibility.Little more than three months from Election Day, Trump and his political team hoped that the podium spotlight would give him an edge against Democratic rival Joe Biden.“The vaccines are coming, and they’re coming a lot sooner than anybody thought possible,” Trump promised anew.As early as next week, the first possible U.S. vaccine is set to begin final-stage testing in a study of 30,000 people to see if it really is safe and effective. A few other vaccines have begun smaller late-stage studies in other countries, and in the U.S. a series of huge studies are planned to start each month through fall in hopes of, eventually, having several vaccines to use. Already, people can start signing up to volunteer for the different studies.Health authorities warn there’s no guarantee -- it’s not unusual for vaccines to fail during this critical testing step. But vaccine makers and health officials are hopeful that at least one vaccine could prove to work by year’s end. Companies already are taking the unusual step of brewing hundreds of millions of doses so that mass vaccinations could begin if the Food and Drug Administration signs off.Trump also acknowledged bipartisan criticism of delays processing testing results.“We’ll be able to get those numbers down,” Trump said, saying his administration was working to improve the availability of rapid, point-of-care tests like those used to protect him at the White House.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, told NPR Tuesday that he was glad Trump has begun to promote mask-wearing.“If we, during those conferences, come out and have consistent, clear, noncontradictory messages, I believe it will be very helpful in getting people on the track of knowing the direction that we need to go to get this pandemic under control,” he said.Biden, for his part Tuesday, launched into scathing criticism of Trump as he outlined the latest plank of his economic recovery plan, charging that Trump “failed his most important test as an American President: the duty to care for you, for all of us.”“He’s quit on you, he’s quit on this country,” Biden said.Earlier Tuesday, Trump took to Twitter to claim that “by comparison to most other countries, who are suffering greatly, we are doing very well — and we have done things that few other countries could have done!”In fact, the U.S. leads the world in confirmed cases and deaths from the virus -- and ranks near the top on a per capita basis as well.On Capitol Hill, some Republicans have broken with the White House in seeking additional federal funding for testing and contact-tracing in the next relief bill.Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, in a news conference, encouraged White House aides to “keep Trump away from the podium,” calling the president “a threat to public health.”Trump’s daily turns in the White House briefing room largely ended in late April after the president’s widely derided suggestion that injecting toxic disinfectant could help treat the coronavirus. The comment prompted widespread medical warnings against the potentially deadly move.Scrapping the briefings was welcomed by aides who believed they were dragging down the president’s poll numbers, particularly with older voters. However, with his trademark rallies largely on hold because of the coronavirus, the view in Trump’s circle is that he needs an alternate means to reach voters.And Trump missed the days when he would dominate cable television ratings with his early evening briefings. Tellingly, when he announced Monday that the sessions could return, he did so with an eye toward their time slot and a boast about ratings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-covid-19-in-us-will-get-worse-before-it-gets-better/story-I1uen0T1TAngumZqsufXlN.html
22-07-2020||World||Covid-19 outbreak reported at Texas federal medical prison||More than 500 women at a federal medical prison in Texas have tested positive for the coronavirus, in one of the largest confirmed outbreaks at a federal prison, the Bureau of Prisons said.The number of confirmed cases at the Federal Medical Center-Carswell in Fort Worth jumped to 510 on Tuesday, just two days after the Bureau of Prisons reported that 200 women there had tested positive for Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. Only the federal prison in Seagoville, also located in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, had more infected inmates, with 1,156 cases as of Tuesday.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“We’re like a whole bunch of hamsters in a cage chasing our own tails,” said Carswell inmate Holli Chapman.Three weeks ago, the prison had reported only three confirmed cases of the virus among inmates. One prisoner, Andrea Circle Bear, died in April. On July 12, 69-year-old Sandra Kincaid became the second woman to die there from the virus.FMC-Carswell holds female inmates with medical and mental health issues. It currently has 1,357 prisoners. Since April, many inmates have told the newspaper they were concerned the virus could spread through the prison.One of the inmates who has tested positive for the virus is Reality Winner, a former government contractor who is serving a five-year prison sentence after she pleaded guilty to mailing a classified report to a news organization.Carswell’s administration directed questions to the Bureau of Prisons. The agency said in a statement that it is taking precautions to stem the virus’ spread.“As with any type of emergency situation, we carefully assess how to best ensure the safety of staff, inmates and the public,” the agency said. “All of our facilities are implementing the BOP’s guidance on mitigating the spread of Covid-19.”Last week, several women at Carswell told the Star-Telegram that the facility did not have enough sanitizing supplies or protective equipment. The woman also noted that cells are not immediately cleaned after someone tests positive. Inmate Sandra Shoulders said mattresses used by women who have tested positive are piled up in a TV room.“We feel basically abandoned,” she said. “(Officers) are saying they’re doing all this stuff for us, that they’re in here with us. But they’re not the ones in 24-hour quarantine, left in a 6-by-6 cell with three other people with 10 minute showers, 10 minutes to be on the phone or email to communicate with their families.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-outbreak-reported-at-texas-federal-medical-prison/story-QzxZXCj3xIseJVHEMzkSRP.html
22-07-2020||World||Next coronavirus aid package could easily swell past $1 trillion||The price tag for the next Covid-19 aid package could quickly swell above $1 trillion as White House negotiators negotiate with Congress over money to reopen schools, prop up small businesses, boost virus testing and keep cash flowing to Americans while the virus crisis deepens in the U.S.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday promised a new round of direct payments to earners below a certain income level, similar to the $1,200 checks sent in the spring. President Donald Trump insists on a payroll tax holiday for workers. And Democrats want billions to outfit schools and shore up local governments.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and acting chief of staff Mark Meadows conferred privately with GOP senators before preparing to meet with House Speaker Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. Trump’s team is trying to broker a compromise between the GOP’s emerging $1 trillion proposal with the House’s more sweeping $3 trillion bill.Meadows told reporters the president wants to ensure the funding package “meets the legitimate needs that are before the American people.”With the pandemic showing no signs of easing, officials acknowledge the daunting challenge of trying to contain the coronavirus and prevent further economic distress. The U.S. has rising infections and a death toll of 140,800, more than anywhere else in the world. The health crisis is worsening just as emergency aid is about to expire.McConnell said Washington must develop a strategy to safely reopen schools and businesses until a vaccine can be found.“We need to carve out a new normal,” the Republican leader said.McConnell is poised to roll out the $1 trillion GOP proposal, a counter-offer to Pelosi’s $3 trillion House-passed plan as they race to strike a deal by the end of the month. That’s when a $600 weekly unemployment benefits boost and other aid, including a federal rental moratorium on millions of apartment units, expires.Also read: Mike Pompeo urges ‘entire world’ to stand up to ChinaMcConnell’s package wold send a fresh round of direct cash payments to Americans below a certain income level, likely $75,000 for singles, extend small business loans under the Paycheck Protection Program and create a five-year liability shield against what he warns is a potential “epidemic” of coronavirus lawsuits.It’s also expected to include at least $70 billion to help schools reopen and $25 billion in virus testing funds. Republicans want to replace the $600 weekly federal jobless benefit with a lower amount, to prevent the unemployed from receiving more aid than they would through a normal paycheck, Republicans said.But the president’s priorities are splitting his GOP allies in Congress giving momentum to Democrats as talks are underway.Trump wants a full repeal of the 15.3% payroll tax, which is split among employers and employees, and funds Social Security and Medicare. Experts say that alone would cost $600 billion. At a White House meeting on Monday, GOP leaders told Trump they preferred to include only a partial payroll tax cut.Also read: US accuses Chinese hackers of seeking to steal Covid-19 vaccine researchEasing the payroll tax is dividing Trump’s party because it does little to help out-of-work Americans and adds to the debt load. The tax is already being deferred for employers under the previous virus relief package. Supporters say cutting it now for employees would put money in people’s pockets and stimulate the economy.GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas was among several Republicans saying he’s “not a fan” of a payroll tax holiday.The administration also panned the push for more virus testing money, saying earlier allotments remain unspent.Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of the Health committee, said, “All roads to opening school, going back to work, opening child care lead through testing.”White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Tuesday the administration wants “targeted” funds for the next round of aid, rather than adding more to the existing pot. She said no one is holding up the money.Senate Democrats began investigating why the Trump administration has left almost half the testing money unspent.Democrats broadly dismissed the emerging GOP plan as favoring corporate interests over America’s working families. Schumer warned of repeating mistakes of spring when Trump pushed for states to ease stay-home orders and reopen.“That will not - will not - get the job done,” Schumer said.House Democrats have approved $100 billion as an education stabilization fund and Senate Democrats are seeking even more, $430 billion for schools and universities to re-open — with money for spacing students apart, buying masks for daily use and alternating bus schedules.The political stakes are high for both parties before the November election, and even more so for the nation, as the virus crisis and economic fallout hits cities large and small.Joe Biden, the Democrats’ presumed presidential nominee, stated his own priorities. The new package should “deliver a lifeline to those who need it most: working families and small businesses,” he said.After insisting in an interview Sunday that the virus would simply “ disappear,” Trump on Monday acknowledged a “big flareup” of Covid-19 cases. He announced plans to relaunch his daily televised briefings.But Trump’s focus on therapeutics and a vaccine is falling flat on Capitol Hill as lawmakers understand any Covid-19 cures remain months, if not a year, from widespread distribution in the U.S. The federal government is still struggling to provide basic medical supplies and personal protective equipment to hospitals and health care providers.Mnuchin vowed to stay on Capitol Hill for the next two weeks, determined to reach a deal by month’s end.The proposed virus aid package would be the fifth, following the $2.2 trillion bill passed in March, the largest U.S. intervention of its kind. The jobless rate has remained in double digits, higher than in the last decade’s Great Recession, and a federal eviction moratorium on millions of rental units approved in the last bill is about to expire.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/next-coronavirus-aid-package-could-easily-swell-past-1-trillion/story-uWghXOX98hvJjsbI1jAfhP.html

22-07-2020||World||Pakistani journalist Matiullah Jan ‘abducted’ a day before court appearance||The Islamabad High Court has ordered the relevant authorities to produce abducted journalist Matiullah Jan before it on Wednesday morning, local media reported on Tuesday. Jan was kidnapped from outside a local school on Tuesday morning, one day before he was to appear before Pakistan’s Supreme Court on a contempt of court notice.Camera footage of the incident shows that Jan’s abductors included plainclothesmen as well as uniformed policemen who were travelling in four cars. Soon after Matiullah Jan dropped his wife outside the government school in Islamabad, the camera shows cars encircling his car and taking the journalist into custody.Earlier, Jan, who is no stranger to controversy, was summoned over an alleged tweet against judges and the judiciary. A three-member bench of the apex court headed by the chief justice is hearing the case. The court in its contempt notice stated that Matiullah Jan in a tweet from his Twitter account on July 10 apparently used painful words against judges and the judiciary.Last week, Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Athar Minallah dismissed another contempt application against Matiullah Jan, saying that the dignity of independent judges “is not so fragile and it can’t be harmed by a tweet.”In the court order, Justice Minalla noted: “The dignity of a judge or a court is not dependent or resorting to the law of contempt. The judgments of a judge and the latter’s conduct is the measure of his or her integrity and independence.”A number of journalists have voiced concern about the safety of the Islamabad-based reporter.Journalists Aima Khosa in a tweet on Tuesday said that Matiuallah Jan has been taken off the air, pushed into legal cases and now abducted. “It appears there is a concerted effort to silence him,” she tweeted.In 2017, Matiullah Jan was attacked in Islamabad. However, he escaped unhurt. He was travelling from Islamabad with his children when two motorcyclists coming from the opposite side of the road threw a rock and smashed the windscreen of his car.Prior to that incident, he said he was chased by another car at night and his windscreen was smashed in a similar way. Those days, he said, he was working on a story along with another journalist who had also been attacked in the same fashion around the same time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-journalist-matiullah-jan-goes-missing-wife-claims-abduction/story-MjIIMdWl4jFWfidQkfS57M.html
22-07-2020||India||SC issues notice to Prashant Bhushan in contempt case||New DelhiThe Supreme Court on Wednesday initiated contempt proceedings against lawyer Prashant Bhushan for accusing the judiciary of destroying democracy and keeping courts closed during the lockdown in two of his tweets in two tweets last month.Issuing notice to Bhushan to respond by August 5, a three-judge bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said, “We are, prima facie, of the view that the aforesaid statements on Twitter have brought the administration of justice into disrepute and are capable of undermining the dignity and authority of the Institution of Supreme Court in general and the office of the Chief Justice of India in particular, in the eyes of public at large.”Twitter Inc. was also made a contemnor by the Court along with Bhushan. Senior advocate Sajan Poovayya, appearing for Twitter Inc told the Court that a tweet can be “disabled” only on a judicial order. “We are an independent platform unable to disable the tweet without an order from a Court.” When he asked the Court to pass an order to this effect, the bench, also comprising Justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari said: “Why should we direct? On your own you should have done it.” Poovayya told the Court that he would consult with Twitter and respond by the next date. The Court has also issued notice to Attorney General KK Venugopal for assisting in this case.Bhushan did not appear in court and was not represented by any lawyer. The Court order took note of the first tweet dated June 27, which was also carried in a national daily and the subsequent one on June 29, against which the Court received a petition for initiating contempt. The first tweet said the last four chief justices of India had played a role in the destruction of democracy. The second tweet was aimed at current CJI SA Bobde. Captioning a picture showing CJI sitting on a bike, Bhushan’s tweet, now part of the order, said: “CJI rides a 50 Lakh motorcycle belonging to a BJP leader at Raj Bhavan Nagpur, without a mask or helmet, at a time when he keeps the SC in Lockdown mode denying citizens their fundamental right to access justice!”Against this tweet, the court received a petition filed by Mahek Maheshwari on July 9. The matter was taken up on the administrative side. The court found that the Attorney General’s consent as required under the 1975 Rules to Regulate Proceedings for Contempt of the Supreme Court was not obtained. It was then decided to take up the matter as a suo moto petition on the judicial side to “pass appropriate orders”. the order of the Court said.This is the third contempt petition Bhushan will face. The first refers to a 2010 interview by Bhushan to Tehelka magazine alleging half of the previous 16 CJIs were corrupt. The hearing on this matter began in 2010 ; it was last heard in 2012. After a gap of eight years, this matter is listed for hearing on Friday before a bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra. Bhushan’s father and former Law Minister Shanti Bhushan intervened in this matter and filed a sealed cover giving instances of corruption against former CJIs.Last year, in a tweet on February 1, 2019, Bhushan accused the Centre of misleading the court on the decision to appoint M Nageswara Rao as interim Director of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Bhushan claimed that the High Powered Committee headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not decide on Rao as told to the court by Attorney General. Although he has apologised for the tweet, two contempt petitions by the Attorney General and the Union of India are still pending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-issues-notice-to-prashant-bhushan-in-contempt-case/story-KGsdOBwjJ5YUd1RTO8cSDN.html
22-07-2020||India||Pak files plea seeking a lawyer for Jadhav||Islamabad: The Pakistani government on Wednesday filed a petition in the Islamabad high court seeking a lawyer for former Indian naval officer Kulbhushan Jadhav to file a review petition against the death sentence awarded to him for alleged espionage. This comes days after India said two Indian officials, who met Jadhav on Thursday last when Pakistan provided second consular access to him since he was detained in March 2016, could not engage him on his legal rights. India said the two were prevented from obtaining Jadhav’s written consent for arranging his legal representation.In its petition, the Pakistani government submitted Jadhav, 50, has refused to engage a lawyer and file a petition. It added it is in “the national interest” that a legal representative is appointed on behalf of Jadhav for the review of his conviction and sentence, and for Pakistan to comply with the International Court of Justice (ICJ)’s order.The ICJ last year ordered Pakistan to provide consular access to Jadhav and review his death sentence by a Pakistani military tribunal. A Pakistani ordinance, promulgated ostensibly to comply with ICJ’s order, envisages an Indian consular official filing the review petition. The Pakistan government cited the ordinance and said Jhadav has a short period of time left to file an appeal. So far, neither Jadhav nor the Indian government, through its high commission in Islamabad, have filed a petition, it added.The two Indian officials on Thursday last met Jadhav to discuss filing the review petition in the high court against his death sentence.The meeting ended inconclusively with New Delhi accusing Islamabad of breaching its assurance of providing unimpeded access to Jadhav. The ministry of external affairs said when two Indian consular officials went to meet him, they found Pakistani officials with “an intimidating demeanour” near Jadhav and a camera being used to record the conversation. It added Pakistan’s “obstructive and insincere” approach during the meeting violated its assurance to the ICJ to implement the 2019 judgment. India said Pakistan has also failed to act in accordance with its own ordinance.Pakistan on Thursday reiterated its accusations that Jadhav was arrested in Balochistan in March 2016, and “confessed” to his involvement in terror activities. India has dismissed such charges and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani intelligence operatives from Iran’s Chabahar port, where he was running a business.ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan had violated Jadhav’s rights under the Vienna Convention. It stayed his execution and called on Islamabad to take all steps for an “effective review and reconsideration” of his sentence, including “enacting appropriate legislation”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-files-plea-seeking-a-lawyer-for-jadhav/story-yEx9OHc3LLA4kM31XA5YGK.html
22-07-2020||India||BJP leaders trying to topple govt, Gehlot writes to Modi||JaipurRajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Wednesday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said that Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and some other Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders were part of a conspiracy to topple his government in Rajasthan at a time the Centre and state should be working together to fight Covid-19.Chief minister Gehlot’s letter comes in the backdrop of his former deputy Sachin Pilot’s revolt against his government along with 18 Congress lawmakers. He wrote that a “very ambitious leader of our party” was also involved in the alleged attempt to topple the government.Gehlot added that the leaders involved in the attempts to bring down his government included Congress lawmaker Bhanwar Lal Sharma, who also allegedly tried to dislodge Bhairon Singh Shekhawat’s Bharatiya Janata Party government by trying to bribe MLAs in 1996.The Congress has suspended Bhanwarlal Sharma and another MLA, Vishvendra Singh, both from the Pilot camp, from the primary membership of the party for their alleged involvement in the conspiracy.“Then, I as state Congress chief, personally met then [Rajasthan] governor Baliram Bhagat and then prime minister Narsimha Rao and protested that by the horse trading elected government was being toppled [and that it] is against the democratic values,” he said.BJP’s Rajasthan president Satish Poonia said the language used by the Rajasthan chief minister in his letter showed that the state government was in minority. In response to Gehlot’s letter, Poonia wrote an “open letter”, saying the Rajasthan CM and his party were responsible for “anarchism and instability” prevailing in the state and they were instead blaming the BJP “without any reason”.Gehlot said he was saddened that when the Centre and the state should be saving livelihoods of people, the ruling party at the Centre was regularly trying to topple Congress governments, ignoring its Covid-19 management priorities. “The same accusation was levelled when the Madhya Pradesh government fell during Covid and it gave a bad name to your party,” he said.Gehlot said the spirit of the anti-defection law passed in 1985, when Rajiv Gandhi was the Prime Minister, and amended under Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s leadership at the Centre was being violated. He added that attempts were being made to destabilise democratically elected states governments.He expressed confidence that truth will prevail and his government will complete its full term. “I am not aware till what extent you are aware of this information or else you are being misled,” Gehlot said, citing examples of Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, where he said democratically elected governments were toppled through horse trading.The Congress has alleged Shekhawat’s voice can be heard in audio tapes purportedly recording conversations detailing a plot to topple the state government. Shekhawat has denied the charge and said he is ready for a probe.Sharma, too, has denied allegations against him, calling them fake.BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek accused Gehlot of trying to misguide the people through the letter and sought evidence of the allegations in it. “This letter is politically motivated and to misguide the public.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leaders-trying-to-topple-govt-gehlot-writes-to-modi/story-o7VskJgI1iLGnsdZzd7tjK.html

22-07-2020||India||Telangana govt orders closure of 100-yr-old Osmania General Hospital, new building likely to come up||The Telangana government on Wednesday ordered closure of the century-old building of Osmania General Hospital that was inundated with rain and sewerage water last week, drawing a lot of criticism from opposition parties.In a letter to the hospital superintendent, Telangana Director of Medical Education Dr K Ramesh Reddy asked him to vacate the building and shift the patients to other wards (in adjacent blocks).The DME ordered that the old building should be closed and sealed after intimation to his office. He said no activity will be undertaken in the building hereafter. “Any deviation from the above instructions will be viewed seriously,” Reddy said in the letter.President of Telangana Medical and Health Gazetted Officers’ Association Jupally Rajender said the process of shifting the patients and offices of the doctors in the OGH building had already commenced and it would be completed soon.“The building is dilapidated and is crumbling. We can’t take the risk of continuing the hospital in it,” Rajender said.In all, six wards and two operation theatres have been moved into new buildings in the same campus to prevent any untoward incident as the structure is crumbling. “The decision was taken to avert any accidents and in the best interest of patients,” in-charge superintendent of OGH Dr Pandu Naik said.The decision of the government to close down the OGH has lent credence to the apprehensions that the Telangana government is planning to demolish the OGH building, which is a notified heritage structure.Ever since heavy rains that lashed Hyderabad resulted in flooding of several wards in the hospital last week, there have been representations to the government from a section of doctors and some associations demanding that the old heritage structure be demolished to pave the way for a new multi-storeyed hospital complex.The members of the Telangana State Government Doctors Association who formed a Joint Action Committee (JAC) have been staging a dharna in front of the hospital for the last two days demanding that the government construct a new building on the OGH campus.The OGH is one of the oldest and largest hospitals in India constructed during the Nizam’s reign. While it started as the Afzal Gunj hospital in 1866 AD, the present hospital building was completed in 1919 on orders of the last Nizam of Hyderabad, Mir Osman Ali Khan. It was designed by British architect Vincent Jerome Esch and Nawab Khan Bahadur Mirza Akbar Baig in the Indo-Sarcenic style.In 2015, Telangana chief minster K Chandrashekhar Rao announced a plan to demolish the building. This sparked outrage among heritage activists, and he immediately retracted the proposal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-govt-orders-closure-of-100-yr-old-osmania-general-hospital-new-building-likely-to-come-up/story-WcgdM11EVNtoKKVpfsdNoM.html

22-07-2020||India||India can power post-Covid-19 global recovery, says PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday made a forceful pitch for foreign investment telling some of America’s top business and political leaders India has “what is needed to power the global economic recovery” from the ravages of the Covid-19 pandemic and there was a never better time to invest there.It was time, the prime minister said to them, for India and the United States to work in partnership to play “important role in helping the world bounce back faster after the pandemic”.“We have what is needed to power the global economic recovery,” Modi said, addressing the annual summit of the US-India Business Council (USIBC, a trade body)) virtually, pitching India as “a nation that you can trust”, in contrast, he did not say, with China, India’s rise means, he added, “a rise in global integration with increasing openness, a rise in your competitiveness with access to a market which offers scale”.As countries and businesses around the world seek to reduce their dependence on Chinese supply chains, hit first by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and then by the Covid-19 epidemic, India is positioning itself as the alternative destination, seeking to fight off stiff competition from Vietnam, whose saturation points are much lower in every aspect than India.Also read: ‘India, US need to focus on something ‘bigger’ as they talk trade’, says JaishankarThe prime minister said the recent crisis — the pandemic, — had showed the world it needed to pay more attention to “resilience against external shocks” and not just focus on scaling up efficiency and optimization, bywords for the shift of supply chains to China. And with that he segued into “aatma nirbhar Bharrat”, his government’s new motto, stressing increased domestic capability for manufacturing, restoring the health of the financial system and diversification of international trade. “There is global optimism towards India. This is because India offers a perfect combination of openness, opportunities and options. Let me elaborate. India celebrates openness in people and in governance,” the prime minister said, setting up a quick run-through of investment opportunities in India.Modi spoke of opportunities in the “frontier technologies” of 5G, Big data analytics, Quantum computing, Block-chain and Internet of things; in the agriculture sector; healthcare, which he said was growing at 22% a year; in energy, as India evolved into a gas-based economy; in infrastructure; in civil aviation; defense and space; finance and insurance.Investments are flowing in already. “Every year, we are reaching record highs in FDI. Each year is significantly higher than the earlier one. FDI inflows in India in 2019-20 were 74 billion dollars,” he said, adding, “This is an increase of 20 percent from the year before that.”Even during the ongoing pandemic,” Modi said, to illustrate his point. “In the middle of Covid, India has attracted foreign investment of more than $20 billion between April and July 2020.”While pitching India as a global powerhouse, the prime minister called for global economic growth to be “human-centric”, stressing a continuing theme for India. Last week, he had pressed UN member states to move towards a “new type of human-centric globalization”.“I firmly believe that our approach to the future must primarily be a more a more human centric . Our growth agenda must raise the poor and the vulnerable at the core,”the prime minister said, adding, “ease of living is as as important s ease of business.”At the same forum earlier, EAM S Jaishankar stressed the need for India and the United States to strive for something “bigger” even as they seek to resolve their trade differences.While resolving these “pending problems”, the minister said, referring to trade issues, is important and central to the relationship, “but beyond trade there is a much bigger connect between our two countries … a sort of knowledge innovation.Working together in their sphere, he added, “is what will set our relationship apart”.Commerce minister Piyush Goyal had said, at the same forum Tuesday, that India and the United States were just some phone “calls” away from wrapping up a limited trade deal. And he had had gone on to propose a “preferential trade agreement” as the next step, as the two sides got down to working on a larger and more robust and enduring Free Trade Agreement.The external affairs minister also spoke broadly of India-US relations, framing it in the larger contexts of geo-politics and people to people connections. He said the United States needs to “learn” to work with a more multipolar world, and go “beyond alliances”.Jaishankar’s session partner on Wednesday was Mark Warner, the Democratic senator who is co-chair of the Senate India caucus, who forcefully proposed India joins the United States to form the core of the “Alliance of the Willing”, a loose coalition of nations to confront China’s predatory use of technology to dominate the world.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is in London, also appealed to India to do more against China. “India has a chance to take global supply chains away from China and reduce its reliance on Chinese companies in areas of telecommunications, medial supplies and others”“India is in this positions because it has earned the trust of many nations around the world, including, the United States,” he added.The secretary of state, who has spearheaded the Trump administration’s sharpening attacks on China, reiterated US backing for India’s ban on 56 Chinese apps, including TikTok, and conveyed his condolences once agains for the death of Indian soldiers in the Galwan clashes, for which the US had held Beijing responsible.Pompeo reiterated US position on India generally. “We’re the oldest and most prosperous democracies in the world, and It’s important that democracies like ours work together. India is a rising U.S. defense and security partner in the Indo-Pacific.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-can-power-post-covid-19-global-recovery-says-pm-modi/story-MHKu1Ql9IJaK35dYrWqInI.html

The man and his three associates had planned her kidnapping to extort Rs 40 lakh from her parents, police said on Wednesday. The entire kidnapping attempt and the efforts of the woman and the two neighbours, one placing his scooter in the middle of the lane to block the passage for the bike the kidnappers were riding, was captured on two CCTV cameras installed at a building in the lane in east Delhi’s Shakarpur where the crime took place on Tuesday afternoon. Although the kidnappers’ bike slipped and its rider fell off after the neighbour tried to overpower him, the two suspects pushed him and managed to escape from the area. Watch: Mother fights off kidnappers, saves 4-yr-old child; incident on CCTV The two suspects are absconding and police teams are raiding their possible hideouts. The girl child’s uncle Upendra Kumar Gupta, 35, and his friend, Dheeraj, 34, whose motorcycle was used in the crime, have been arrested, said deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh. DCP Singh said that on Tuesday around 4 pm, the two men wearing helmets were loitering outside the child’s house when an elderly woman, who often visited the neighbourhood, found their activities suspicious and asked what they were doing there. The duo told her that they were sales executives and were thirsty. They asked for water from her but the woman said she was also an outsider. At this one of the men rang the doorbell of the child’s house. The girl’s mother came along with her and opened the gate. The duo asked for water to drink, believing that she would go inside to bring it. However, the woman had kept a bottle filled with water near the gate itself. As she was trying to pick the bottle up, one of them picked up the child and tried to flee on the bike with his associate, the DCP said. In the 44-second CCTV footage, the woman is seen pulling her daughter back and in the process, the suspects fall on the road along with their bike. The woman manages to get hold of her daughter. While the rider is trying to lift his bike, the other suspect is seen running away. A middle-aged neighbour runs behind them as soon as he witnesses the child’s kidnapping attempt, the video footage shows. In the second video footage, another neighbour is seen standing below a building while the two suspects are coming towards him. Sensing something wrong, the neighbour places his scooter in the middle of the lane and stands opening his hands to stop the suspects. He is seen pushing the biker, who lost control of the bike and fell off it. The neighbour then overpowered the other suspect. But both of them managed to set themselves free and escaped, the video footage showed. “It is because of the courage and the presence of mind of the two neighbours that the kidnappers failed to abduct the child and had to leave the bike behind before fleeing the spot. The bike’s ownership helped us identify the prime suspect, who turned out to the child’s uncle, and unearth the entire kidnapping conspiracy,” the DCP said. Officials said that the case would have remained a blind one had the police not got the bike, as the girl’s parents had no clue that her uncle was behind the entire kidnapping conspiracy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-woman-alert-neighbours-foil-abduction-bid-manage-to-save-4-year-old/story-UhnLmvA2mCfPfpwMH46waP.html

22-07-2020||India||Odisha’s highest single-day coronavirus surge crosses 1,000 cases, total deaths now 108||Despite continuing with lockdown in four of its hotspot districts and weekend shutdown in 15 other districts, the spread of Covid-19 in Odisha went unabated as the state recorded its highest-ever single day surge of 1,078 cases taking the total to 19,835. The fatalities due to the disease too rose to 108 with 5 more deaths being reported in last 24 hours.The highest surge of 1,078 cases came on the back of the state government upping the Covid-19 testings as well as increased sample positivity indicating more local transmission of the virus. In the last 24 hours, the 42 laboratories in Odisha tested 9,277 samples with a daily sample positivity rate of 11.62 per cent, higher than national daily sample positivity rate of 11 per cent. The daily growth rate of 5.74 per cent against country’s daily growth rate of 3.26% suggested faster spread of the infection despite strictest lockdown.In Ganjam district, where 6,362 cases have been reported so far, the highest single-day surge of 371 cases were detected in last 24 hours. Of the 371 cases in Ganjam, 369 were people outside quarantine homes and various Covid-19 frontline workers. In Khurda district, where 121 cases were detected, 91 came from Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation areas alone. Of these 91 cases, at least 40 cases came from a flour mill and slum area in the city.Other districts that reported large number of Covid-19 cases in last 24 hours were Malkangiri(66) and Cuttack(57).The quick spread of the virus in July could be gauged from the number of infections. In the month of June, when the weekend lockdown was in force in 11 districts, the state recorded 5071 cases. In July, the numbers till 21st have gone upto 12,290, more than double of what was reported in June, suggesting the little impact of lockdown on the spread of the virus.“We think that there is some irregularity in Covid-19 testing. In Ganjam, many people who are being taken to hospitals are not being informed that they are Covid19 infected and not given reports. Many people are being released before completion of quarantine period after being informed that they are now Covid-19 negative,” said Bhrugu Baxipatra, state BJP vice-president. “We suspect that as there is a shortage of beds, the recovery to positive ratio is almost same. If State government is trying to show more recoveries, then the situation might become serious in coming days.”Faced with rising number of cases, Odisha government in the last 2 days announced expenditure of Rs 55 crore for Ganjam, Khurda and Cuttack districts to strengthen Covid-19 management with added focus on surveillance and detection in slum areas. The fund will be spent from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. On Wednesday, chief minister Naveen Patnaik who spoke to CEO of Serum Institute of India Adar Poonawalla over video call sought his cooperation to begin early vaccination in Odisha once necessary clearances are obtained. Patnaik said the his officials will be in touch with the Serum Institute for this purpose.Meanwhile, opposition Congress and BJP trained their guns against the government alleging mismanagement of Covid-19 cases. Congress leader, Tara Prasad Bahinipati alleged there is absolute mismanagement of Covid-19 in Ganjam. “Had the State government had done testing in right manner, the rate of infection would not have been so high. The migrant workers who were kept in quarantine centres, were not given proper food and treatment which led to their sneaking out of the centres and infecting people around. The State government only focused on procurement of masks, PPEs and other articles, but did not take adequate steps for effective handling and treatment of the positive cases. When the situation went out of hands, the State government resorted to lockdown and shutdowns across the state,” he alleged.State BJP vice-president, Bhrugu Baxipatra also alleged that there was irregularity in Covid-19 testing. “In Ganjam, many people who are being taken to hospitals are not being informed that they are Covid-19 infected but not given reports. Many people are being released before completion of quarantine period after being informed that they are now Covid-19 negative. We suspect that as there is a shortage of beds, the recovery to positive ratio is almost same. If State government is trying to show more recoveries, then the situation might become serious in coming days,” said Baxipatra.BJD leader Pradip Panigrahi on the other hand demanded that the OPDs in hospitals be kept open as a significant number of people in the district suffered from diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney and heart ailments. “By closing the OPDs, there will be panic among such patients,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-s-highest-single-day-coronavirus-surge-crosses-1-000-cases-total-deaths-now-108/story-eEl6pmR6r89nKyO9JxneEM.html

Earlier, speaking at the summit, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo described India as an important partner and a key pillar of US President Donald Trump’s foreign policy. “We’ve invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the G-7, where we’ll advance the economic prosperity network,” he said.External affairs minister S Jaishankar, too, had advanced an argument saying India and the US needed to resolve the pending problems in trade relations and move into something bigger. He had addressed the summit earlier in the day.He added that the two countries had the ability to shape a larger global agenda since they had convergence on the “big picture”.He also advocated key principles including recognition of trusted talent, creation of more resilient supply chain etc for achieving the objective.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-ideas-summit-pm-narendra-modi-s-pitches-nation-as-global-investment-destination/story-QHVUwb3kkLC6wieZSCTzIO.html

22-07-2020||India||Bengal football ace Mehtab Hossain leaves BJP day after joining||Springing a surprise akin to his moves on the midfield, Mehtab Hossain, former captain of Bengal’s biggest football teams and archrivals, East Bengal and Mohun Bagan, left the Bharatiya Janata Party on Wednesday, less than 24 hours after joining it.Shortly after Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday targeted the BJP from the virtual rally of Martyrs’ Day, her party’s biggest annual event, Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh made a point by handing over the party flag to Hossain and some other personalities from different fields. “I joined the BJP because I want to serve the people,” said Hossain.The news made headlines in Bengal because Hossain has a huge fan following although he left the field a year ago. His joining was arranged by another former midfielder Sasthi Duley, who helped East Bengal win the ASEAN Cup in Indonesia in 2003 and joined the BJP in 2014 after retirement.On Wednesday afternoon, Hossain wrote a long note on Facebook saying his family and fans could not accept his “sudden decision.” Reiterating that his sole aim was to do something for common people, Hossain wrote, “The people, in whose interest I joined politics, are now urging me to leave it. Even my wife and children are not supporting my sudden decision.” He did not name the BJP even once.“I would rather remain among my fans and friends as the midfielder they knew. I don’t want my life to change. I am not part of any political party from today,” wrote Hossain.By the evening, the post was widely shared,Dilip Ghosh said Hossain left under pressure from the TMC. “It is possible that the people he is referring to owe their allegiance to the ruling party and pressured him to change his mind. However, I am sure Hossain will stay in touch with us,” said Ghosh.Duley who unsuccessfully contested the reserved Dhanekhali assembly seat in 2016, said, “It was Hossain who wanted to join the BJP and requested me to introduce him to Dilip Ghosh one month ago. They met twice before he joined the party.”“His decision to join was well thought and cannot be called sudden. His wife and family knew about it very well. He must be under pressure from some quarter,” Duley told HT. “Hossain’s volte face is faster than any move a footballer can make on the field,” quipped Duley.No TMC leader commented on the incident.Hossain’s phone was switched off throughout the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-football-ace-mehtab-hossain-leaves-bjp-day-after-joining/story-CgrFEMui5SgtVWgjmN3DYJ.html

22-07-2020||India||Gehlot’s letter to PM Modi includes a reference to ‘people’s mandate||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot has escalated his offensive against the BJP by writing to Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleging involvement of union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in a purported attempt to topple his government, according to PTI.The Congress has named Shekhawat, a senior leader of the BJP from Rajasthan, on several occasions as one of the leading players in an alleged plot to dislodge Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan. The state special operation group (SOG) has even named Shekhawat in an FIR registered in the matter. Shekhawat, however, has denied his involvement.Gehlot’s letter to the prime minister was written on Sunday in which he accused Shekhawat, other BJP leaders and some “over ambitious leaders” of his own party for being involved in the alleged “conspiracy”, according to PTI. The letter further states that the alleged attempts to bring down the Congress government is an insult to the people’s mandate and was an open violation of constitutional values, reports the news agency.Also Read: At CLP meet, CM Ashok Gehlot assures of win, attacks ‘betrayers’Gehlot is also said to have cited the examples of Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, the two states lost by the Congress over the past year, primarily due to defections from the party.Congress leaders had even produced three audio clips alleging Shekhawat could be heard on these clips discussing horse trading attempts to buy out MLAs in the state for the purpose of bringing down Gehlot’s government.The Congress had initially stressed on the fact that the alleged conspiracy against the state government was hatched with the blessings of the party’s senior leadership in Delhi.The Congress has been demanding that Shekhawat be removed from the Central cabinet and he submits himself to an ongoing probe to clear his name by giving his voice samples.Also Read: Modi govt’s raid raj’: Congress slams ED raids on CM Gehlot’s brotherThe BJP on the other hand has accused the Congress of distracting from its internal crisis precipitated by Congress leader Sachin Pilot’s rebellion against the party by blaming its political rival.Sachin Pilot and 18 of his followers MLAs have rebelled against Gehlot’s leadership alleging the government had failed to fulfill the promise made in assembly polls. The Pilot camp has also alleged ill-treatment by the government citing a SOG notice to former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot asking him to join a probe in alleged horse trading case.The Congress has alleged that Pilot and his followers are being actively backed by the BJP. Earlier today, the Congress party had accused the BJP leadership in Delhi of creating a ‘raid raj’ by misusing federal agencies to submit lawmakers to the cause of bringing down the Gehlot government in Rajasthan.The comments came after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) raided the premises of Gehlot’s brother Agrasen Gehlot in connection with an investigation into money laundering charges in the fertiliser scam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gehlot-s-letter-to-pm-modi-includes-a-reference-to-people-s-mandate/story-6uWalpL6k21jNrVnuSSDDL.html
22-07-2020||India||Traffic crawling back to pre-Covid level, highway construction may decline: Report||Traffic on national highways is bouncing back with electronic toll collection reaching nearly 75% of the pre-Covid lockdown level as curbs with the lifting of curbs while highway construction may decline by 10-13% overall as compared to last year, ratings agency Crisil said in a report on the road sector on Wednesday.The sector is giving mixed signals on recovery, the report noted. Toll collection at national highways in June has rebounded to its March level and touched 75% of February level, the report said. It also said regular traffic on highways had dipped by nearly 88% during April.“The Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdowns had virtually halted movement of people and goods in April and May, but curbs are being lifted slowly and the economy is beginning to hum…For an idea of how hard the pandemic had slammed the brakes, toll collection had dropped off the cliff from 11 crore vehicles paying in February 2020 to just 1 crore in April,” it said.The Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdowns had virtually halted movement of private vehicles and slowed the movement of goods in April and May. The Centre had issued multiple advisories to states to enable movements of goods. “The overall ramp up in toll collection has been faster than initially envisaged, the trends are encouraging so far and sustained for more than two months indicating that it is not only due to pent up demand. The average toll collections in the last fortnight of June, 2020 surpassed 90% of pre-Covid levels for many stretches,” said Rajeshwar Burla, Vice President, Corporate Ratings, ICRA Limited. The report also noted national highway construction spiked after a slump in April. “Construction across national highways is picking up, too. It rebounded to 637 km in May from just 210 km in April. But key construction months were lost in the lockdown and labour migration continues to pinch. Normalcy might return only after the monsoon. Overall, we are bracing for a 10-13% decline in highway construction on-year this fiscal,” it said. During the period, Centre increased spending on highway projects and spent Rs 18,700 crore in April-May which is more than a 46-fold jump from Rs 400 crore in the same period last fiscal, it said. “While this was mainly because milestone payments were made and to ease the cash flows of developers, it will have a trade-off – constrained future spending by the transport ministry,” it added. Project awarding, too increased by three times from April to May compared with the corresponding period last year. “But that was because of a backlog of already bid-out projects that were awaiting award following the lockdown,” it said. Around 9,000-9,500 km of highway construction has been completed till now while 7,000-7,500 km of work has been awarded, according to the report. National highway construction in the current financial year stood at 10,237 km as compared with 10,855 km the previous fiscal while 8,911 km were awarded in FY 20 compared with 5,470 the previous fiscal. “Net-net, while toll collection signal looks good, spending on roads may take a backseat given that priority in the rest of this fiscal will be on healthcare and social welfare spending. That would keep project awarding and recovery on a moderate path,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/traffic-crawling-back-to-pre-covid-level-highway-construction-may-decline-overall-report/story-imrjGlRcOboz2DOda0eONP.html
22-07-2020||India||SC seeks detailed response from Prashant Bhushan on contempt matter over his tweets||The Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday initiated suo motu (on its own motion) contempt proceedings against lawyer Prashant Bhushan for accusing the judiciary of destroying democracy and keeping courts shut during the nationwide lockdown restrictions, which were enforced from March 25 onwards in a bid to contain the spread of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, via his two tweets on June 27 and 29.A three-judge SC bench, headed by Justice Arun Mishra and also included Justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari, issued notice to Bhushan to respond by August 5. “We are, prima facie, of the view that the aforesaid statements on Twitter have brought the administration of justice in disrepute and are capable of undermining the dignity and the authority of the institution of SC in general and the office of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) in particular, in the eyes of the public at large,” the court said.San Francisco-based Twitter Inc. was also made a contemnor by the top court along with Bhushan.Senior advocate Sajan Poovayya, who appeared for Twitter, told the SC that a tweet can be “disabled” only on a judicial order passed by a court.“We are an independent platform unable to disable the tweet without an order from a court.”When Poovayya asked the court to pass an order to this effect, the bench said, “Why should we direct? On your own, you should have done it.”Poovayya told the SC that he would consult with Twitter and respond by August 5. The court has also issued notice to Attorney-General (A-G) KK Venugopal for assisting in this case.Bhushan did not appear, nor was he represented by any lawyer.The court order took note of the first tweet dated June 27, which was carried in a national daily.Bhushan put out another tweet on June 29 against which the SC received a petition for initiating contempt proceedings.The first tweet, which was reproduced in the order, stated, “When historians in the future look back at the last six years to see how democracy has been destroyed in India even without a formal Emergency, they will particularly mark the role of the SC in this destruction, and more particularly the role of the last four CJIs.”The second tweet was aimed at the incumbent CJI SA Bobde.Bhushan’s tweet, now part of the order, said, “The CJI rides a Rs 50-lakh motorcycle belonging to a BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) leader at Raj Bhavan, Nagpur, without wearing a mask or helmet, at a time when he keeps the SC on lockdown mode denying citizens their fundamental right to access justice!”The apex court received a petition filed by one Mahek Maheshwari on July 9 against the June 29 tweet.The matter was taken up on the administrative side. The SC found that A-G Venugopal’s consent as required under Rule 3 (c) of the Rules to Regulate Proceedings for Contempt of the Supreme Court, 1975, was not obtained. Then, the apex court decided to take up the matter as a suo motu petition on the judicial side to “pass appropriate orders”, the SC order said.This is the third contempt plea against Bhushan.Earlier, Bhushan, in an interview to news magazine Tehelka that was published on September 5, 2009, had alleged that half of the past 16 CJIs were corrupt.Though the contempt plea was initiated in January 2010 and was last heard on May 2, 2012, this matter has been listed again before a bench, headed by Justice Mishra, for July 24 (Friday).Bhushan’s father and former Union Law Minister Shanti Bhushan had intervened in the decade-old case and had filed a sealed cover giving instances of corruption against former CJIs.Bhushan had also accused the Centre of misleading the court on the decision to appoint M Nageswara Rao as interim director of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) via a tweet on February 1, 2019.The lawyer had claimed that the High-Powered Committee, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, did not decide on Rao as told to the apex court by A-G Venugopal.Later, the A-G and the Union of India had filed a contempt plea against Bhushan.Both the Tehelka interview and Rao appointment contempt pleas are still pending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-detailed-response-from-prashant-bhushan-on-contempt-matter-over-his-tweets/story-aQbG6wsWPZmfbljR2aCaQL.html

Gehlot has also named Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in his communication to the Prime Minister. The ongoing power tussle between Gehlot and his erstwhile deputy Sachin Pilot has now entered its second week.In his letter, reportedly written on Sunday, Gehlot wrote, “There have been despicable attempts to destabilize elected governments through horse-trading. I don’t know to what extent you are aware of all this or whether you are being misled.” Locked in a bitter power struggle with his former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot that has almost led to the collapse of the government in the desert state, Gehlot wrote to PM Modi alleging that the ruling party at the Centre had made attempts to offer money to Congress MLAs to defect.ALSO READ | ‘Emperors in Delhi’: Congress jabs PM Modi after raids on Gehlot’s brother“For some time, attempts are being made to destabilize democratically elected governments.

22-07-2020||India||US, UK, India’s Serum Institute scale up efforts to roll out Covid-19 vaccine by year-end: All you need to know||The United States, which is the worst-hit nation globally by the Covid-19 pandemic, has promised to pay USD 1.95 billion to purchase 100 million doses of a potential coronavirus vaccine, which is being developed by US pharma giant Pfizer in collaboration with Germany’s Biontech, the German firm said on Wednesday.“Americans will receive the vaccine for free consistent with the US government’s commitment for free access to Covid-19 vaccines,” the German firm said in a statement. Under the agreement, the United States government has placed an initial order for 100 million doses to be delivered if regulatory approval is granted for the experimental vaccine.Scientists in a number of countries around the world are involved in a frantic race to develop a vaccine to help stem the worst health crisis that the world has witnessed in over a century. More than 200 candidate vaccines are currently under process with roughly 24 of them at various stages of clinical trials involving human volunteers.The United States also has an option open to purchase as many as 500 million additional doses, the Biontech statement indicated.German pharma major Biontech and Pfizer have shortlisted their vaccine candidates down to two frontrunners and are waiting for regulatory approval to begin a mass trial involving 30,000 healthy volunteers, which may happen later this month.If successful results are achieved and regulatory approvals follow, Pfizer and Biontech are likely to manufacture up to 100 million doses by the end of 2020, and “potentially more than 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021”. Clinical trials so far have shown that their treatment triggers robust antibody and T-cell immune responses against the coronavirus, according to Biontech.Closer home, India’s Serum Institute has reportedly already started manufacturing the Oxford vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) for coronavirus. The company intends to manufacture two-three million doses by August end, Suresh Jadhav, Executive Director of Serum Institute has said. The Serum Institute of India on Tuesday said it would be starting trials of the Covid-19 vaccine candidate developed by Oxford University and British pharma major AstraZeneca by the end of August on up to 5,000 Indian volunteers after getting the necessary approval.The pharma company plans to launch the vaccine by June 2021 if all goes well. The Serum Institute of India is one of the global partners for the production of Britain’s Covid-19 vaccine on a large scale, once it gains regulatory approval.British pharma major AstraZeneca’s experimental Covid-19 vaccine was found to be safe and has managed to produce a significant immune response in healthy volunteers in the initial stages of clinical trial, according to data released earlier this week. Oxford University also announced satisfactory progress with the vaccine, making it one of the frontrunners among the vaccine candidates being developed around the world.The experimental vaccine did not display any serious side effects and produced antibody and T-cell immune responses in the volunteers on whom it was tested, according to the results of the clinical trials. Scientists involved in the trials have said the vaccine caused minor side effects more frequently than a control group, but some of these effects could be reduced by taking common paracetamol, with no serious harmful effects from the vaccine The vaccine has been called AZD1222 and was under development by pharma giant AstraZeneca in collaboration with scientists at Britain’s Oxford University. The varsity has tied up with Serum Institute of India to manufacture and supply the vaccine to India and over 60 other countries having a combined population of 3 billion, the company’s management has said.The new vaccine is a chimpanzee adenovirus viral vector (ChAdOx1) vaccine that expresses the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. It uses a common cold virus (adenovirus) that infects chimpanzees, which has been weakened so that it can’t cause any infection in humans, and then has been genetically modified to code for the spike protein of the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, according to scientists working with the pharma major.The widely-followed clinical trial is currently at an advanced stage, with ongoing trials in the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-uk-india-s-serum-institute-scale-up-efforts-to-roll-out-covid-19-vaccine-by-year-end-all-you-need-to-know/story-WGn4FVDGfNauz31QBs49sL.html

22-07-2020||India||Indian job seekers slowly losing interest in opportunities in US: Report||While the US remains the favourite destination for Indians looking for jobs overseas, there has been a substantial fall in the number of searches looking for employment opportunities in America, a report by global job portal Indeed has said.  According to the Indeed data, job searches for the USA fell to 42 per cent in June 2020 from a high of 58 per cent in January 2019. However, the US remained the favourite destination for Indians looking at jobs abroad, the report noted. A downward trend that predates impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, and corresponds instead with uncertainty around and tightening of the US immigration policy, it added.The data for this report is compiled and analysed from job searches on the Indeed platform.Indian job seekers remained keen to explore work opportunities across the globe, making up a significant fraction of those employed in various sectors such as technology, administration and management, sales and consumer marketing, among others internationally, the report said.Over the same period, there was a rise in searches for these roles in Canada, the UAE, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Australia and Qatar, it added.As a group, Indian job seekers are highly focused on tech in their job searches – almost nine of the top 10 clicked jobs by Indians to the USA are related to tech roles.  While looking for employment abroad, there is greater demand for jobs in this sector, especially for niche roles, including full-stack developer, development operations engineers, business analysts.“India is a unique market, not only in terms of its large and youthful labour pool, but also in the way that it is woven into the global economy. It is one of the few countries in the world that has a very high rate of mobility. People from India are willing to work in different parts of the world and return home for opportunities as well,” Indeed India MD Sashi Kumar said.This two-way migration connects India to the global labour force and means India holds tremendous potential in terms of supplying the world’s talent, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-job-seekers-slowly-losing-interest-in-opportunities-in-us-report/story-8FIdujtnlDvkw5kgXaZSPI.html

Pakistan says Jadhav was arrested on charges of espionage in Balochistan in March 2016 and sentenced to death by a military court a year later. Under Pakistan’s International Court of Justice (Review and Reconsideration) Ordinance, 2020, he only has a short period of time left to file a reconsideration appeal. So far, neither Jadhav nor the Indian government through its high commission in Islamabad have filed a petition, says the Pakistan government. .India has rubbished the spying charges against Jadhav and maintains that he was abducted from Chabahar in Iran.The two countries have wrangled over consular access to Jadhav.

22-07-2020||India||82% decline in triple talaq cases since law enacted by Modi govt, says Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi||There has been about 82% decline in triple talaq cases since the law against the “social evil” was put in place, minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said on Wednesday, terming August 1, when the legislation came into being as, “Muslim women’s rights day”.He also asserted the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, has taken its course whenever such a matter has been reported.In an article ‘Triple Talaq -- Big Reform, Better Result’ which was posted by Press Information Bureau, Naqvi said triple talaq or talaq-e-biddat was neither Islamic nor legal, but the social evil was still given “political patronage” by “merchants of votes”.“August 1, 2019, is a historic day in Indian parliamentary history when the bill against triple talaq was made a law despite the obstacle by so-called ‘champions of secularism’, including the Congress, Communist Party, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Trinamool Congress,” Naqvi said.August 1 became the day which ensured gender equality and strengthened constitutional, fundamental and democratic rights of the Muslim women, he said, terming it the ‘Muslim women’s rights day’.That day will remain a “golden moment” in Indian democracy and parliamentary history, the minister said in the article.“One year has passed since the law against triple talaq was passed and there is a decline of about 82 per cent in triple talaq cases thereafter,” Naqvi said, without elaborating on the figures of such cases.A law against the “social evil” of triple talaq could have been passed in 1986 when the Supreme Court had given the historic judgement in the Shah Bano case, he said.The Congress had an absolute majority in Parliament with more than 400 out of 545 Lok Sabha members and more than 159 out of the 245 Members in Rajya Sabha, but the then Rajiv Gandhi government used its strength in Parliament to make the judgement ineffective and deprive Muslim women of their constitutional and fundamental rights, Naqvi said.“The then Congress government had bowed down before the illogic of some ‘narrow-minded fanatics’ and committed a criminal sin to deprive the Muslim women of their constitutional rights,” Naqvi said.The Congress’ “mistake of the moment” became a “punishment of decades” for the Muslim women, he said.   “The Congress was worried for ‘vote ka udhaar’ (the loan of votes), while our government was worried for ‘samajik sudhaar” (social reform),” Naqvi said India runs on a Constitution, not on Shariat or any other religious textbook, the minority affairs minister asserted.Noting that earlier various legislations had been brought in the country to abolish social evils such as Sati and child marriage, Naqvi said the law against triple talaq has nothing to do with religion and was made purely to ensure gender equality by ending an “inhuman, cruel and unconstitutional practice”. “Instant divorce by verbally saying Talaq thrice is illegal. There were several incidents coming where women had been given talaq through letter, phone or even through messages and WhatsApp. Such incidents are unacceptable in a sensitive country and to a government committed to inclusive development,” Naqvi said.Several Muslim-majority nations of the world had declared triple talaq illegal and un-Islamic such as Egypt, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Syria and Malaysia.However, it took 70 years for India to get rid of this inhuman and cruel practice, Naqvi said.The minister said the month of August is recognised as one of revolution, rights and reforms in the Indian history -- August 8, Quit India Movement; August 15, Independence Day; August 19, World Humanitarian Day; August 20, Sadbhavana Diwas; and August 5, the abolition of Article 370.The Narendra Modi government made the law against triple talaq to make the Supreme Court’s judgement of May 18, 2017, effective.By enacting the triple talaq law, the Modi government has strengthened socio-economic, fundamental and constitutional rights of the Muslim women. The government is committed to social reforms and empowerment of all sections, Naqvi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/82-decline-in-triple-talaq-cases-since-law-enacted-by-modi-govt-says-mukhtar-abbas-naqvi/story-Yhi9ZigRyyf2AENCUC3alM.html

22-07-2020||India||Three foreign experts hurt after another explosion at Assam’s Baghjan oil well||Efforts to plug a blowout of an Oil India Limited (OIL)-operated natural gas well in Upper Assam’s Tinsukia district, which has been on fire since June 9, suffered a setback on Wednesday afternoon, when three foreign experts sustained burn injuries while working on controlling the blaze.The gas well located at Baghjan had witnessed a blowout – an uncontrolled release of gas or oil – on May 27 and caught fire on March 9, when two firefighters were killed and destroyed at least 13 adjoining houses.“There was no blast at the site as being reported. The foreign experts working at the site sustained minor burn injuries while trying to cap the well. They are all out of danger,” said Tridiv Hazarika, spokesperson, OIL.Officials said the incident took place, when the foreign experts, hired by OIL, were removing a spool from the well-head — a task carried out before installing a blowout preventer (BOP) to cap the fire and blowout. Work at the site was called off on Wednesday following the incident.The injured experts have been identified as Anthony Steven Reynolds, Craig Neil Duncan, and Doug Dallas, who work for Alert Disaster Control, a Singapore-based firm engaged by OIL in plugging the blowout.“Initially, the injured received first-aid by a doctor at the well site and later they were taken to the burn unit section of Astha Nursing Home in Dibrugarh. They were released after their burn injuries were attended to. The operations are likely to resume at Baghjan on Thursday,” OIL said in a statement.Work on capping the well was at an advanced stage, when the incident occurred on Thursday.OIL authorities said critical tasks such as excavation of ramps and cellar have been completed, and the process of capping the well, including installation of water pumps, is ready.“Constant water umbrella, dewatering of ramp/cellar works were being carried out to provide a safe working space for personnel (involved in capping the well),” the OIL statement added.Union petroleum and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan took stock of the situation and wished speedy recovery of the three foreign experts, who sustained burn injuries.“The well-control operation continues and capping of the well is expected shortly,” OIL tweeted.The well had a blowout during a workover operation, or major maintenance work, to extract gas from a new depth.While efforts were underway to control the blowout, the well caught fire and damaged 13 adjoining houses. Around 2,000 families were evacuated from the area and many of them are still living in relief camps.Though OIL had initially stated that the blowout/fire would be plugged in a month, there has been a delay in meeting the deadline due to heavy rains and flooding in the low-lying area, which has affected work for several days.The well is located close to the Dibru Saikhowa National Park (DSNP) and the ecologically-sensitive Maguri Motapung wetland, raising fears of environmental damage to the vicinity. Several studies by different agencies are underway to measure the extent of the damage.In June, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had ordered the formation of an expert committee to probe the blowout and subsequent fire and assess the damage caused to human life, wildlife, and the environment because of the industrial disaster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-foreign-experts-hurt-after-another-explosion-at-assam-s-baghjan-oil-well/story-mq75O0Kdwpc683A2y7OZeI.html
22-07-2020||India||Congress, BJP feud over violation of Covid-19 norms in Uttarakhand comes to a boil with charges flying||The feud between the ruling BJP and opposition Congress has intensified in Uttrakhand a day after Congress state president Pritam Singh and about 150 other party workers were booked for alleged violation of Covid-19 norms on Tuesday in Uttarkashi district.Citing the incident, Congress has accused BJP-led government of targeting its leaders in a bid to suppress their voice while the BJP has justified the action claiming Congress leaders’ political events held in public are hampering the fight against the pandemic. Pritam Singh had held a rally and a political event in Uttarkashi on Monday to protest against the rising fuel prices. On Tuesday, he along with about 150 other party members was booked for violating Covid-19 norms by allegedly holding the events without prior permission. This was the second case against him after he was booked in Dehradun on June 25 for the same offense in a similar case.Apart from Singh, another senior leader and former chief minister Harish Rawat was also booked for alleged violation of Covid-19 norms for holding a bullock cart rally in protest of the rising fuel prices in Dehradun on June 29. Also Read: Senior Uttarakhand cop warns criminals: Surrender or be ready to face consequences“What the BJP government is doing is nothing but vindictive action against our leaders. They are afraid of our aggressive posture against the BJP governments at the Centre and in the state over relevant public issues like rising fuel prices and bad handling of the pandemic,” said Suryakant Dhasmana, party state vice-president, who, too, was booked along with Singh on June 25. He termed the FIR to be a “tactic to suppress the voice of opposition.”“These are just dictatorial moves by the BJP, both in Centre and all other states where they are in the government. They don’t want the opposition to exist and raise their voice. In Uttarakhand, what they are doing with our leaders is part of that vindictive plan only,” said Dhasmana. The Congress vice-president also dared the government to “register as many cases as they want against the Congress leaders.”“Let them register as many false cases as they want. We will also see. But we want to tell them that we won’t stop raising our voices for the public and continue to raise their issues,” he said. Dhasamana also alleged that action against Congress leaders citing Covid-19 norms was discriminatory.“All the cases for violating Covid-19 norms are against our leaders only. If they are so worried about the Covid-19 norms, then why didn’t they take any action against BJP state president Bansidhar Bhagat, who got a temple opened in Haridwar and held prayers there? Was it not a violation of the Covid-19 norms?,” said Dhasmana adding, “We don’t have any demand from the government but have a clear message that we will not stop our protests.”The BJP however, justified the action saying Congress’ intention behind holding public events was not about opposing the government policies but about “hampering the fight against the pandemic.”“The actions taken against their party president Singh and former CM Rawat are absolutely justifiable. Their protests and rallies are helping in increasing the spread of Covid-19 and not curbing it,” said Devendra Bhasin, BJP state vice-president. Also Read: Uttarakhand releases guidelines for private hospitals for treating Covid-19 patientsBhasin said, “As far as the allegation of suppressing the opposition is concerned, that’s in the DNA of the Congress and not the BJP. What they did during the emergency everybody knows. There is no democracy inside their own party only.”The ruling party leader also dismissed the allegations of discriminatory action against Congress leaders and said, “Their demand to book our party state president stands no ground because he worshipped in a Haridwar temple with only three others in attendance while maintaining necessary social distancing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-bjp-feud-over-violation-of-covid-19-norms-in-uttarakhand-comes-to-a-boil-with-charges-flying/story-kvkMgnEeX2vr7XRcpaHNgM.html

Pilot has demanded a sum of Re 1 and a written apology before the Press for issuing “false and frivolous allegation” within seven days.On Monday, Giriraj Singh Malinga said at the talks held at Pilot’s house he was offered money to switch allegiance to the BJP. The MLA said he subsequently told chief minister Ashok Gehlot about the plan.Pilot had then said that he was “saddened but not surprised” and called the allegations against him of offering money to a party MLA to cross over to the BJP as “baseless”.He had also said this was a clear attempt to undermine his reputation and take the focus away from the substantive issue he has raised against the party leadership of the state.Gehlot has been insisting that Pilot is “hand in glove” with the BJP and has been trying to topple his government. Pilot and 18 other rebel Congress MLAs are currently in Manesar in Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachin-pilot-demands-apology-from-mla-who-alleged-bribe-offer-to-support-bjp/story-kDxTETIYmPt9Bc9tWimBwL.html

The deceased has been identified as Yaricharla Kiran Kumar, belonging to Thomaspeta in Chirala.Prakasam district Superintendent of Police Siddharth Kaushal said a case had been registered under Section 176 of the Criminal Procedure Code (custodial death).“Following instructions from chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, Guntur range Inspector General of Police J Prabhakar Rao has appointed Guntur district additional superintendent of police Gangadhar as special investigation officer to probe the incident. The case has been entrusted to Darsi deputy superintendent of police for an independent inquiry,” Kaushal said.The chief minister also announced a compensation of Rs 10 lakh to the bereaved family of Kiran Kumar.According to the police, on the night of July 18, Kiran Kumar along with his friend Shiny Abraham was riding a bike when they were stopped by the police near Kothapeta checkpost in Chirala. “The two were in a drunken condition. When constable Rami Reddy asked them why they were not wearing masks and were driving the vehicle in an intoxicated state, they picked up an argument and assaulted the cop,” the SP said.The constable alerted Chirala town-II sub-inspector Vijay Kumar, who rushed there and took the duo into custody. “While they were being shifted to the police station in the jeep, Kiran jumped out of the moving vehicle at Narayana School junction and fell on the road sustaining head injuries,” Kaushal said.Kiran was initially rushed to the government hospital in Chirala but was later shifted to a private hospital in Guntur, where he breathed his last on Tuesday night.The SP said his father, who was not aware of the factual position, filed a complaint with the police stating that his son was beaten indiscriminately by the police for not wearing a mask. “Preliminary inquiry revealed that Kiran had died of head injuries after he jumped out of the moving police jeep. Yet, we have ordered for a comprehensive inquiry,” he said.Telugu Desam Party general secretary Nara Lokesh charged the police with beating up Dalit youth Kiran for not wearing a mask which eventually led to his death.He sought to know whether the Dalits had no right to live in Andhra Pradesh. He reminded the authorities that in East Godavari district, too, the police had beaten up and got a Dalit youth tonsured in the police station premises for questioning the authorities and the government on the rampant illegal sand smuggling in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dalit-man-allegedly-beaten-by-cops-for-not-wearing-a-mask-dies-in-andhra-s-prakasam-district/story-CKacCITkoiJyoGoeUoxi6O.html

Speaking to a television channel, Jaishankar said on Monday that India will never join any alliance system in the future just as it never did in the past.“Non-alignment was a term of a particular era and geopolitical landscape. One aspect was independence, which remains a factor of continuity for us,” Jaishankar said while speaking on the topic of “Geopolitics of opportunity: As the world rebalances, how should India capitalise?”The minister’s statement comes in the backdrop of the worst chill in Sino-Indian ties in decades following the violent Galwan Valley clash in eastern Ladakh last month – and New Delhi carrying out a military naval drill with US aircraft carrier, Nimitz, near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands this week.Also read: Livid China ready to retaliate after US says shut Houston consulate in 72 hoursResponding to Chinese state media’s question on Jaishankar’s remarks, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin said China had taken note of his remarks.“China has noted relevant reports.

On Wednesday afternoon, part of Mahipalpur bypass near the airport in south Delhi caved in following heavy rainfall in the national capital region.Earlier in the day, a part of Ashoka Road in the heart of Delhi also caved in. The cave-in created a sinkhole of almost 10 feet by 10 feet in size and forced the police to barricade the area.“Road damaged near 10 Ashoka Road, probably due to sinking of a stormwater drainage system. The extent of damage is around 10 feet long. Barricading done at Ashoka road at Windsor Place and Andhra Bhawan,” the Delhi traffic police tweeted.. In another tweet it said, “Traffic is not allowed on the stretch between Windsor Place R/A to Jaswant Singh R/A on Ashoka Road. Kindly plan accordingly.” Heavy rain led to water-logging and disruption of traffic movement at several places, officials said. The Delhi Police posted alerts on Twitter to inform commuters about traffic movement in the national capital.Water-logging hit traffic near the Minto Bridge area in central Delhi for some time. Rain had sparked traffic snarls at several parts of the national capital on Tuesday also.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/roads-cave-in-as-heavy-rain-lashes-delhi/story-2mCFOIbSjHXdpi1uHhxEiI.html
22-07-2020||India||Once running for CM’s post, ‘sidelined’ CP Joshi key to Cong govt in Rajasthan||The irascible professor of psychology and former Central minister, CP Joshi, who thought his political career may end in 2018 Assembly elections if he fails to win the polls, is back in the limelight as the Rajasthan assembly speaker. His decision to issue a disqualification notice to 19 Congress rebel legislators, including former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, has been challenged by the rebels in the Rajasthan High Court.In the order on Tuesday evening, the division bench of Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Prakash Gupta said, “We further request the Hon’ble Speaker to extend the said petition till the delivery of orders by this court on July 24 and we direct accordingly.” Joshi said he was saddened by the use of word “direct” and objected to the court entertaining the petition. Also read: ‘Bring it on’ - Congress’ counterattack at BJP after ED raids Ashok Gehlot’s brother“It is within my powers to issue the notice. There are various Supreme Court judgments which give absolute powers to the Speaker to decide on disqualification of the legislators,” Joshi told reporters on Wednesday morning.“Nobody can intervene in 10th Schedule powers of the speaker,” he said while announcing that he was moving the apex court against the directions from the Rajasthan High Court to defer hearing on a petition of disqualification by party chief whip Mahesh Joshi against the 19 legislators till July 24.Before the Rajasthan crisis, Joshi, who studied metallurgy, physics and psychology, had never held such an important Constitutional post. He had been a minister in the Rajasthan government and was a Cabinet minister in United Progressive Alliance-2 government.Joshi started his political career as president of Mohanlal Sukhadia University (MLSU) students union before he was appointed as an assistant professor for psychology at the Udaipur University. His friends say that Joshi was a fan of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara in college and even kept a beard like the guerrilla leader. “He was a master orator and that impressed many leaders of that ere,” said one of his friends who wasn’t willing to be quoted.Impressed by his oratory skills, Mohanlal Sukhadia, longest-serving CM of the state and a tall Congress leader from Mewar, inducted him into the Congress party. He denied him ticket from Nathdwara in 1977 saying he was “too” young but gave him an assembly ticket in 1980 when Joshi was of just 28.Joshi was an MLA for 10 years – from 1980 to 1990 – when the Congress governments in the state were headed by leaders from Mewar. But he never found a place in their cabinets because he was considered to be from the rival Gulab Singh Shekhawat group. Joshi lost the 1990 and 1993 Assembly elections. “After losing the election, he returned to the university to teach and study. He took classes of PG students and enrolled for PhD,” said Professor Indra Vardhan Trivedi who has known Joshi since their hostel days around four decades ago.“The routine for 10 years when he was out of Assembly was to come to the university on a bicycle, teach statistics and visit his constituency – Nathdwara – every Sunday,” said Trivedi, who has twice been the vice-chancellor of (MLSU) and was appointed the VC of Govind Guru Tribal University in Banswara this week.He won the 1998 assembly elections and was inducted as a cabinet minister in the Rajasthan government.Ten years later, Joshi got the biggest leap of his political career when he was chosen as the president of the Rajasthan Congress before the 2008 Assembly election. The Congress won the state assembly election but Joshi lost, just by a vote. Many of his supporters believe that he lost the fight to become the CM and Ashok Gehlot became the CM again.“But, by then he got close to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and was made in-charge of several states including Bihar. He contested the 2009 Lok Sabha election from Bhilwara and won,” said Pramod Tiwari, a Bhilwara-based journalist.Despite being a first-time MP, Joshi was made a cabinet minister in UPA-II and got the all-important rural development ministry, handling the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, which was considered the coalition’s ticket to the second term in the government. However, in the middle of UPA-II, he was shifted to the road transport ministry while the rural development ministry was given to Jairam Ramesh.While serving as a Central minister, Joshi dabbled in cricket politics and became the president of the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) in 2009. In 2014 Lok Sabha polls, Joshi contested from Jaipur (Rural) and lost to newcomer Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore. Since then, Joshi was in political bewilderedness.As the Congress decided to give tickets to all stalwarts of the party to take on Bharatiya Janata Party in Rajasthan assembly polls of 2018, Joshi was asked to contest from Nathdwara, his political karambhoomi.During the campaign of 2018 Assembly election, Joshi made a controversial statement that Ram Temple in Ayodhya can be built only by Brahmins - a statement made apparently to woo the large Brahmin population in the constituency. His election pitch hovered around a buzz that Joshi could be the next chief minister if there is an intense fight for the post between Gehlot and Sachin Pilot.“I am sidelined in the party and my political career is ending,” Joshi told a journalist colleague during the campaign, indicating that he was not sure about his victory also. He won by 16,940 votes defeating BJP’s Mahesh Pratap Singh and was elected as speaker as Pilot and Gehlot fought for the CM’s post. And, this gave him a new innings in politics.Jaipur-based commentator Prakash Bhandari said Joshi’s tenure as Speaker has been one of the best in terms of political propriety and procedures. “He is like a headmaster in the Assembly and people respect him for that,” Bhandari said.Political commentator Mukesh Sharma said Joshi is sometimes considered a misfit for politics because of his straightforwardness and bluntness. “When he was the party president, he ruffled many feathers because he called a spade a spade, unlike a politician who would offer assurances even when something was impossible,” he said.Sharma said even his political opponent respect his knowledge. “I remember when Vasundhara Raje became CM for the first time in 2008, she invited experts from various fields to discuss her vision for the state and get their feedback. CP Joshi was the only one from the Congress in that meeting,” he said.Bhandari said Joshi, in the coming days, could define Rajasthan’s politics and his name would be there in the history for his role as a Speaker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/once-running-for-cm-s-post-sidelined-cp-joshi-is-key-to-congress-govt-in-rajasthan/story-OGpKkgHWst2q27jMw5mSVP.html
22-07-2020||India||‘Will quit RJD if political rival is inducted’: Raghuvansh Prasad Singh ahead of Bihar polls||With the Bihar assembly polls approaching, the rumblings within the opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) have become more audible with senior party leader and former union minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh firing a fresh salvo at the party’s top leadership by asserting he would leave the party in case his rival and Vaishali strongman Rama Singh is inducted into the party.“I have tendered my resignation from the post of vice president as a protest against the proposed induction of Singh. I have not withdrawn it and will not compromise on it. They have put his induction on hold but not taken any final decision. But, if the party ever inducts him, I will go a different way and quit the party,” Singh told Hindustan Times, over phone from his house in Vaishali.The veteran RJD leader, 75, recovering after battling Covid-19 also took potshots at the party’s adamant attitude to pressurize allies on accepting Tejashwi Prasad Yadav’s name as the Chief Ministerial face in the Grand Alliance by negating demands of smaller allies for discussion on the issue. He, however, underlined that it is a well established democratic norm that a CM candidate is always from the party with the biggest vote share and MLAs.“Hasn’t the RJD passed resolutions five times to reinforce that Tejashwi is the party’s CM’s face? This is utter sycophancy. Does it help in terms of the party gaining more vote share? No, the party would continue to enjoy the vote share it has. But, the allies should be taken into confidence on the CM candidate because the top post usually goes to the biggest party in any bloc. It will help in more unanimity,” he said.A prominent Rajput face in the party, Singh has been miffed over being sidelined in the party’s organizational set up and being denied a Rajya Sabha seat for some time, but had created a flutter on June 23, by resigning from the top party post on the party’s decision to induct his political rival Rama Singh. The induction was postponed then.Incidentally, the RJD veteran’s resignation from the party post had coincided with five RJD MLC’s defecting to the JD(U) in a coup ahead of the MLC polls for nine seats in June last week. Asked whether he was planning to switch over to the NDA, the 75-year old veteran maintained that ‘things would evolve at the opportune time’. But, he dropped hints about looking for new political options by quoting an anecdote from the life of Dr BR Ambedkar.“Ambedkar ji had said it was not in my hands to be born into the Hindu religion. But when he decided to change his religion, he was urged by many to reconsider. The social reformer had put two conditions before priests but they never got fulfilled. I am somewhat in that same situation,” he said, referring to statements made by JD(U) and BJP leaders giving him an offer to join their fold.Significantly, the long associate of jailed RJD chief was also critical of the choice of party’s nominees for the recent MLC seats especially the selection of one businessman turned politician Mohammed Farooq, calling it yet another example of ‘picking up outsiders’ for plump posts. He said the same had happened when party had given a ticket to Amarendra Dhari Singh in RS polls a few months back. “People are paratrooping in the party to become MLCs and RS MPs at the cost of loyal party workers. It does not make a party strong,” he said.There are also indications that the RJD brass is trying hard to mollify the temperamental leader knowing it could well have wider political ramifications in terms of votes and the party’s image ahead of assembly polls. State president of the RJD Jagdanand Singh said, the party had respected Raghuvansh’s stand and not inducted Rama Singh. “Isn’t the party going with what Raghuvansh Prasad Singh wishes?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-quit-rjd-if-political-rival-is-inducted-raghuvansh-prasad-singh-ahead-of-bihar-polls/story-q0FSxWXFZaWjwiiPDkBEyH.html

There is also a trough (area of low pressure) in the westerlies. Moist south-westerly winds are also blowing from the Arabian Sea. All these factors are contributing to thundershowers and rains,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre (RWFC).The monsoon trough is likely to shift to the east from Thursday onwards leading to a gradual reduction in rains.At present, the western part of monsoon trough is lying to the south of its normal position and the eastern part runs close to the foothills of the Himalayas.Besides, the convergence of moist southerly-southwesterly winds from the Bay of Bengal over the north-east and adjoining eastern India is likely to continue until Thursday.Also read| ‘Vanished as if never existed’: House collapses in seconds amid heavy Delhi rainsThe interaction between mid-level westerlies and lower level south-westerlies from the Arabian Sea over northwest India is likely to continue until Thursday.IMD in its Wednesday bulletin said rain intensity and distribution over northwest India is likely to reduce significantly from Thursday, but widespread and heavy rain is likely over central, east, north-east India, and Maharashtra during the next three days, according to IMD’s Wednesday bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-monsoon-deficit-drops-as-city-records-heavy-rain-again/story-wnrFVRgdrUwS6b5vHBeKKK.html

Earlier on June 22, Rao had said that the Telangana government would extend all support to the family of Colonel Babu. He had then appointed Santoshi as a Group-I officer during a visit to Suryapet town to see the family of the fallen soldier.The letter in June did not mention the designation and posting. Power minister G Jagadish Reddy had said that Santoshi would be given a posting in whatever department she would feel comfortable.Colonel Santosh Babu who was the commanding officer of the 16th battalion of the Bihar Regiment and 19 other soldiers were killed in a violent clash with Chinese troops on the night of June 15 along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Galwan valley. An unknown number of Chinese troops were also killed in the clash.Last week, defence minister Rajnath Singh met soldiers from that battalion in Ladakh and acknowledged their bravery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/col-santosh-babu-s-widow-appointed-deputy-collector-in-telangana/story-8XlnIyiAvJEoR3yg3n2dWN.html

Senior party leader and Delhi minister Kailash Gehlot also asked Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for a clarification on the issue.Tripura CM Deb had triggered a controversy by claiming that Punjabis and Jats are physically strong but were not mentally as sharp as Bengalis. He yesterday apologised for his comments and stated that he didn’t intend to hurt sentiments of the Jats and Punjabis.“I ask Dushyant Chautala, you’re also a Jat, if you’re feeble-minded or mad, then how did you become Haryana’s deputy chief minister? Chautala should ask for Tripura CM Biplab Deb’s resignation. We demand Biplab Deb’s resignation. Insult of Jats won’t be tolerated,” said Kailash Gahlot.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesDushyant Chautala’s party is running a coalition government in Haryana with the BJP as the senior partner. AAP has fought elections in Haryana, which has a sizable population of the Jat community.Gehlot also cited names of some prominent Jat leaders in an attempt to corner the BJP over Deb’s comments.“BJP goes to nooks and crannies to ask for votes from the Jat community and calls them dim witted and mad after winning elections. I want to ask the BJP if Sir Chotu Ram ji and Chaudhary Charan Singh were intellectually inferior,” Gehlot asked.Sir Chotu Ram was a leading Jat leader of the pre-independence India who formed the Unionist Party (Zamindara League) with the alliance of Hindu and Muslim agriculturists; Chaudhary Charan Singh was also one of the foremost peasant leaders of the country who served as India’s fifth prime minister.Also Read: Kejriwal announces scheme to deliver ration at doorstep of card holders in 6-7 monthsBiplab Deb’s comments have invited the wrath of several other political formations including the Akali Dal, which is an ally of the BJP in Punjab. Party leader and Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee president Manjinder Singh Sirsa had suggested that Deb should step down as chief minister and spend some time enhancing his knowledge about the Sikh community.On Monday, Congress, too, had hit out at Deb and demanded that the BJP’s central leadership take action against him.After the backlash, Deb asked for forgiveness in a series of tweets and said that he was proud of the contributions of the Punjabi and Jat communities in the freedom struggle of the country and had many friends among them.“I had expressed the views some people have about them. I am proud of Punjabi and Jat communities. I have lived among them for quite some time... If my statement has hurt anyone’s feelings, I apologise for that,” the chief minister said on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-demands-tripura-cm-s-sacking-tosses-curve-ball-for-dushyant-chautala/story-We9BpWHy1LmzKbKNPlP6fO.html
22-07-2020||India||Andhra CM Jagan Mohan Reddy inducts two ministers in minor cabinet rejig||Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Wednesday inducted two ministers – Chelluboyina Venugopala Krishna and Seediri Appala Raju into his council of ministers in a minor cabinet reshuffle.Andhra Pradesh governor Biswabhushan Harichandan administered the oath of office and secrecy to the two ministers at a simple and brief ceremony at the Raj Bhavan in Vijayawada.Apart from Jagan, assembly speaker Tammineni Sitaram, other cabinet ministers and a few public representatives attended the swearing-in ceremony. Entry into Raj Bhavan was restricted to only a few members in view of the Covid-19 pandemic prevailing in Vijayawada.The induction of the two ministers was required following the resignation of two senior members Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose and Mopidevi Venkataramana on Monday after their election to the Rajya Sabha. Both the leaders were sworn in as MPs by Rajya Sabha chairman and vice-president M Venkaiah Naidu in New Delhi on Wednesday.Seediri Appala Raju, who hails from the fishermen community, is a first time MLA from Palasa assembly constituency in Srikakulam district. A doctor by profession, Appala Raju attracted the attention of the chief minister with his pro-active measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 in his constituency.Venugopala Krishna, however, has nearly two decades of experience in politics. A businessman from East Godavari district, he had started his career in the Congress party since 2000. He had been a member of the Zilla Parishad twice in 2001 and 2006, before being made East Godavari District Congress Committee president between 2008 and 2012.Krishna later joined the YSR Congress party and unsuccessfully contested the assembly elections from Kakinada rural constituency in 2014. He fought the assembly elections again in 2019 from Ramachandrapuram and he won with a huge majority.Though the portfolios of the newly-inducted ministers were not finalised yet, an official in the chief minister’s office said Appala Raju might get the portfolio of fisheries, while Venugopala Krishna would be given roads and buildings.“There will be a vacancy in the post of deputy chief minister because of the resignation of Subhash Chandra Bose and the chief minister is likely to elevate present roads and buildings minister Dharmana Krishna Das as Deputy CM with the revenue portfolio,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-cm-jagan-mohan-reddy-inducts-two-ministers-in-minor-cabinet-rejig/story-4h2bEDRl942A7kCaCLTMdO.html

22-07-2020||India||Andhra Pradesh Governor asks govt to reinstate state election commissioner||Andhra Pradesh Governor Biswabhusan Harichandan on Wednesday directed that the state government follow the high court judgment of May 29 ordering reinstatement of retired IAS officer Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar as the state election commissioner (SEC).A communication to this effect was sent to chief secretary Neelam Sawhney from the Raj Bhavan’s secretariat in the morning.The latest development is a setback on the Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government which has been waging a prolonged legal battle with Ramesh Kumar after sacking him through an ordinance on April 10.The Governor’s directions follow Ramesh Kumar’s representation to him on Tuesday requesting that he be restored as the SEC as per the directions of the state high court.The Raj Bhavan communique said in pursuance of the representation given by Ramesh Kumar and the instructions given by the high court in the contempt case on July 17, the Governor was directing the government for taking necessary action as per the directions of the court in its order dated May 29.While there was no response from the Jagan government to the Governor’s orders till afternoon, an official in the CMO familiar with the development said the matter was referred to Advocate General Sriram Subrahmanyam for obtaining the legal position.“In the communique, the Governor had nowhere asked the state government to reinstate Ramesh Kumar. It is not a direction to restore his position. He only asked the government to implement the verdict of the high court. Since the state government had challenged the high court’s order in the Supreme Court, he cannot be reinstated as SEC,” the official said.The Jagan government had moved the Supreme Court again on Monday, seeking a stay on the high court taking up the contempt petition filed by Ramesh Kumar. It argued that the high court could not take up such a contempt petition at a time when the matter was pending before the apex court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-pradesh-governor-asks-govt-to-reinstate-state-election-commissioner/story-ghXgrSIMy5yz5XtyyqQAsO.html

It will allow the ED to attach properties of accused people and investigate shell companies if found involved in smuggling of gold.The case came to light after the Customs department seized 30 kg gold from a consignment that came in the name of an official of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on July 5. On July 9, the Union home ministry asked the NIA to probe the racket.The haul of 30 kg gold is said to be worth Rs 15 crore.The NIA has arrested four people, including the two key accused Swapna Suresh and Sadeep Nair, and Customs 13 in connection with the case so far. Sarith PS was the first accused who was arrested by the Customs department.The NIA had last week approached Interpol seeking a “blue notice” against Faisal Fareed, a Dubai-based person named as an accused in the Kerala gold smuggling case. The agency found that Fareed had forged the documents - seal and emblem - of the UAE embassy to ensure diplomatic protection for the baggage and the gold was to be used for terror activities.An Interpol “blue notice” is issued to collect additional information about a person’s identity, location or activities in relation to a crime.Two senior officials, the CM’s principal secretary M Sivasankar and IT fellow Arun Balachandran, were removed after their name cropped up and many others are under the scanner now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-joins-kerala-gold-smuggling-probe-registers-money-laundering-case/story-uwTsdtoYlrHsOYHs3cnokM.html

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to be present in person for laying the foundation stone on the occasion.Earlier, a member of the trust had confirmed that invitations will be sent out to prominent figures associated with the Ayodhya Ram Temple movement including former deputy prime minister L K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Uma Bharti and Vinay Katiyar for the ‘Bhoomi Poojan’ ceremony.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar’s name was also mentioned by a member of the trust as possible invitees but there was no formal confirmation. “Before laying the foundation stone, PM Modi will offer prayers to Lord Ram at the temple and Lord Hanuman at Hanuman Garhi Temple. All chief ministers will be invited to the programme,” Swami Govind Dev Giri, treasurer of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirtha Kshetra said in Pune.Shiv Sena has confirmed that Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will attend the ceremony; however, the timing of the foundation stone laying ritual has invited criticism from opposition party leaders such as NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Maharashtra Congress president Balasaheb Thorat.Also Read: Uddhav will attend Ram Mandir ceremony: RautWhile Pawar suggested that building a Ram Temple was not going to help in mitigating the present crisis engendered by the coronavirus outbreak; Thorat accused the BJP-led government at the Centre of using the ceremony to distract from its alleged failures on Covid management front.Another NCP leader had urged Thackeray to not attend the religious function alleging it was against propriety for someone holding a constitutional post in a secular democracy. However, the NCP had distanced itself from the comment.Ram Temple trustee Govind Dev Giri also said that not more than 200 people including 200 invitees will be present for the function and social distancing norms will be followed during the ceremony.

The operation has been halted now,” news agency ANI quoted Tridip Hazarika, the spokesperson of Oil India Limited, as saying.“Three foreign experts who were at the site are injured. They have been rushed to hospital,” Hazarika said.The damaged gas well is spewing gas uncontrollably for 56 days since a blowout - an uncontrolled release of gas and oil condensate - took place on May 27. Two firefighters of OIL also died at the site then.Over 9,000 people have been shifted to relief camps since the blowout at the well. It caught fire on June 9.Foreign experts brought in to put out the fire and plug the blowout were expected to complete the task by July 7. But flood caused by heavy rain inundated the area near the well and damaged roads and a bridge leading to the site affecting work for several days.OIL had said that various assessment and impact studies of the blowout as well as the blaze in villages and nearby forest areas by multiple agencies such as ERM India, TERI, CSIR-NEIST and IIT-Guwahati.“Total number of families surveyed till July 18 in both Tinsukia and Doomdooma circles is 1,751,” the Public Sectory Undertaking (PSU) had said.The well is located near the Maguri-Motapung Wetland and Dibru Saikhowa Biosphere Reserve, which are among the few remaining habitats for several endangered and range-restricted species. The blowout led to the uncontrollable flow of oil from gas and caused extensive damage to biodiversity and wildlife in the region. The wildlife includes endangered hoolock gibbons and the Gangetic dolphins.There are 17 oil and five gas wells in the Baghjan oil field.Last month, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) constituted an eight-member committee of experts to probe the blowout, subsequent fire and the damage it has caused to humans, wildlife and environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/huge-explosion-near-baghjan-oil-well-in-assam-3-foreign-experts-injured/story-aqT12p78JewpkBv89MYigI.html
22-07-2020||India||‘Emperors in Delhi’: Congress jabs PM Modi after raids on Gehlot’s brother||The Bharatiya Janata Party leadership in Delhi has created a ‘raid raj’ and is using federal agencies to arm twist lawmakers to bring down the Ashok Gehlot government, the Congress said on Wednesday after the Enforcement Directorate carried out raids at premises of the Rajasthan chief minister Gehlot’s brother. The raids are said to be linked to investigations into money laundering charges against Agrasen Gehlot into what has been described as a fertiliser scam.Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala, who has been camping in Jaipur to help the Gehlot government survive a rebellion led by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, said the latest round of raids were ordered by the BJP leadership after three previous attempts to arm twist Congress leaders and lawmakers did not succeed.The emperors in Delhi believe that they can crush any government at any point of time, Surjewala said. When the BJP’s attempts did not succeed, the central agencies were called in to help out.The first round started on July 13 when the BJP started executing its plan to dislodge the Ashok Gehlot government. Income tax officials had carried out raids on three business groups and individuals. Those raids targeted Rajiv Arora of Amrapali Jewels, who is also the Vice President of Rajasthan Congress, Dharmendra Rathore and Ratan Kant Sharma who owns the Fairmont hotel on the outskirts of Jaipur where the Congress has sequestered its lawmakers.“On July 20 and July 21, the CBI questioned MLA Krishna Poonia who brought laurels to the country in the Olympics. Why when BJP is conspiring to topple the government, CBI quizzed Poonia? Yesterday chief minister’s OSD Devaram Saini was also quizzed,” Surjewala said.Krishna Poonia and Devaram Saini were questioned in connection to the death of a police officer Vishnudutt Vishno who was found dead at his residence in Churu district on May 23.Surjewala said the raids and summons for questioning by central agencies may have succeeded in other states but would not succeed in Rajasthan.On Wednesday, Enforcement Directorate officials accompanied by a team of Central Reserve Police Force officials, started searches at six places in Rajasthan, four in Gujarat, two in West Bengal, and one in New Delhi in connection with the scam.ED officials have said Agrasen Gehlot is the owner of a company named Anupam Krishi, on which the Customs department has levied a penalty of Rs 7 crore for alleged violations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bring-it-on-congress-counterattack-at-bjp-after-ed-raids-ashok-gehlot-s-brother/story-CqGWdtVBgcQ3F8P11RTRoM.html

CBI prosecutor Manoj Chalandan opposed Rai’s interim bail plea, as jail authorities are taking appropriate measures to tackle the viral outbreak and all inmates are being looked after well.He also pleaded before the court that Rai is an approver in the case and cannot be released until the trial concludes.The special CBI court rejected Rai’s interim bail plea while considering the probe agency’s objections.Bora was killed on April 24, 2012, allegedly by Mukherjea, her second and former husband Sanjeev Khanna, and driver Rai, who has since turned a prosecution witness and approver in the case.The trio allegedly strangled Bora in the car on April 24, and later her body was dumped into a bag and kept overnight in a garage at Mukerjea’s house.The bag was taken to Pen village in Raigad district the following day and was set on fire. Initially, Bora’s remains were found in May 2012.The murder case came into light after the arrest of Rai in August 2015. He was arrested by Khar police for illegal possession of a pistol. During the questioning, Rai had confessed to Bora’s murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sheena-bora-murder-case-cbi-court-rejects-interim-bail-plea-of-driver-shyamwar-rai/story-i2WDmUkJN2yfOV1tYonh8J.html

The post-mortem examination was carried out on Wednesday morning and later the body was sent to his native place in Dhamtari district,” said Ajay Yadav, superintendent of police (SP), Raipur.The SP said initially, the youth was admitted to Raipur’s Dr. BR Ambedkar Memorial hospital, but was later shifted to a private hospital.Police said that he had sustained over 50% burn injuries.Raman Singh, three-term Chhattisgarh CM and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national vice-president, tore into Baghel-led state government’s “misrule and mismanagement”.“Misrule, mismanagement and the poor policy of the Congress have murdered the youth of the state … Bhupesh Baghel government continued to sprinkle salt on the wounds by calling the youth a mentally-ill patient,” ex-CM Singh tweeted.On July 29, the day the incident occurred, the state public relations department personnel had spoken to the members of the youth’s family and had claimed that he was mentally unstable for the past two years.The department had stated on the same day that the youth possessed two acres of land in his native village and also held a job card under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), 2005, scheme.“He had worked for 11 days in May under the MGNREGA scheme and had submitted an application to his village panchayat for making a YouTube film,” the department had said in a statement.However, his wife denied that he was mentally unstable.“We are suffering from an acute financial crisis due to which my husband was very worried. He is not mentally unstable,” she had told local media persons in Dhamtari on June 29.The state government had ordered a magisterial probe into the case the following day.The state government had said the key aspects of the probe would be the circumstances that led to his self-immolation bid, whether he was instigated by any person, the reason and the mode of conveyance by which he travelled to Raipur, and if he was indeed mentally unstable, then why no treatment was done by his family members.RP Singh, Congress leader, and state spokesperson, said any unemployed youth’s death is an unfortunate incident and the state government stands by the deceased’s family in their hour of grief.He, however, launched a scathing attack on ex-CM Singh and reminded him of precedence.“If the former CM is so sensitive about the death of this youth, then he shouldn’t forget about two similar incidents that had occurred during his regime. Records suggest that eight self-immolation bids were carried out during his 15-year reign.He should be apologetic and ashamed about his rule. Besides, his government didn’t give a single rupee for the treatment of those, who had died, under similar circumstances,” Singh alleged.The BJP is yet to respond to the ruling Congress’s allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-man-who-attempted-suicide-in-front-of-cm-s-house-on-july-29-succumbs/story-AP1yBJK1vUArepcMSgVtvJ.html

The former royal was shot dead by the police in Rajasthan’s Deeg a day after he crashed his jeep in a fit of anger into a helicopter being used by the then chief minister.The court also slapped a fine of Rs 10,000 on each convict.Judge Sadhna Rani Thakur announced the sentence. The convicts were taken to Mathura Central Jail immediately after the sentencing.The 11 police personnel are Kaan Singh Bhati (the former Deeg DSP), Virendra Singh, Sukhram, Jagram, Jag Mohan, Sher Singh, Padmaram, Hari Singh, Chhitar Singh, Bhawar Singh and Ravi Shekhar.The CBI had named 18 policemen in its charge sheet; four of them died during the trial and three others were acquitted.The verdict came 35 years after Singh was killed in police firing.Raja Man Singh was the younger brother of the last ruler of Bharatpur, Maharaja Sawai Vrijendra Singh, and son of Maharaja Kishan Singh. Born on December 5, 1921, he studied engineering in England and was a seven-time Independent MLA from Deeg between 1952 and 1984.Raja Man Singh’s daughter Krishnendra Kaur Deepa was the tourism minister in the last BJP government in Rajasthan. The CBI court hearing was shifted to Mathura from Rajasthan on a plea in the Supreme Court by her in 1990.Man Singh was shot dead along with his two supporters in police firing in February 1985 after an incident of violence in which then chief minister Shiv Charan Mathur’s helicopter was damaged. Mathur was campaigning for Congress candidate from Deeg, Brijendra Singh, who was contesting against Man Singh. Ahead of a meeting he was to address on February 20, Congress workers removed flags and banners of Raja Man Singh from the area. An enraged Singh reached the meeting venue with his supporters. He drove his jeep into the chief minister’s helicopter.Curfew was imposed soon after. The following day (February 21, 1985), Singh, according to Deepa, was on his way to surrender to the police who had registered a complaint against him when he was shot dead by Bhati and other policemen who stopped his jeep. Apart from Singh, his supporters, Thakur Sumer Singh and Thakur Hari Singh, were also killed in the police firing.Deepa said her husband Vijay Singh registered a complaint against the policemen charging them with murder. “We are happy there has been justice after 35 years,” she said.Vijay Singh was also in the jeep with the former royal when he was killed. “In anaj mandi (grain market) of Deeg, Kan Singh Bhati and other cops waylaid us before they started firing. I managed to survive the police attack,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/life-imprisonment-for-11-cops-convicted-for-rajasthan-ex-royal-s-murder-in-1985/story-ykEKaRlnjxsM8nxZLruRwN.html

A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by CJI SA Bobde approved the names and asked the Commission to submit its report in two months. The report shall also be given to the State government as per Commission of Inquiry Act. On Monday, the apex court had asked the UP government to consider appointing a retired Supreme Court judge and a former Director General of Police in a panel to probe the Dubey’s death in an encounter.“The state government has contacted Justice Chauhan and taken his approval. He is willing to devote time despite Covid situation and travel to Kanpur and Allahabad, ” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the bench as he shared the draft notification. According to the terms of reference, the Commission will investigate not only the incident involving encounter of Vikas Dubey but also probe the inaction of authorities which led to the gangster being released on bail despite facing over 60 cases. The bench had earlier held that this was the single most important factor that led to the incident in which Dubey was shot dead after he allegedly tried to escape and fired on policemen on July 10. The Commission will also probe why no efforts were made to cancel Dubey’s bail. The encounter of the intervening night of July 2-3 in which eight policemen were killed, will also be probed.“We do not want to tie the hands of the Commission by specifying the terms of reference. It should be kept as wide as possible,” the bench said.The secretarial assistance for the Commission will be provided by Centre.

22-07-2020||India||After Congress’ attack over journalist’s death, Mayawati says jungle raj in Uttar Pradesh||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Wednesday alleged there “was a jungle raj” in Uttar Pradesh and incidents of crime were rising in the state, soon after a 35-year-old journalist succumbed to a bullet injury in Ghaziabad after he was shot at by a group of men.Mayawati’s criticism of the Yogi Adityanath’s government in the state came soon after Congress’ Rahul Gandhi said the state was “promised Ram Raj” but got “goonda raj” after Vikram Joshi died early in the morning.The BSP president, however, did not mention Vikram Joshi’s death in her tweet in Hindi. She later tweeted her condolence to the family.“The way in which serious crimes, including murder and women’s insecurity, are increasing in Uttar Pradesh it is clear there is a jungle raj in the state rather than the law,” the former chief minister said in her first tweet.“In Uttar Pradesh, more than coronavirus, crime virus dominates the region. The public is affected by this. The government must pay attention to the issue,” she said.Vikram Joshi, who was on way on his motorcycle along with his two young daughters, was cornered by the group of men in Mata Colony and beaten up after he had lodged a complaint against one of them for harassing his niece. One of the attackers shot him on his head from close range and the bullet hit his head.Police said Joshi’s family did not allow them to take his body for the post mortem examination and demanded that they wish to speak to the district magistrate and the senior superintendent of police who later arrived at the hospital.The UP government later announced financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh to his family and also a job to his wife.“An economic assistance of Rs 10 lakh is assured with immediate effect for the family of the deceased by the chief minister. According to his wife’s ability, an appropriate job will be provided to her. As far as the education of their children is considered, they will be sent to a good school,” Ajay Shankar Pandey, Ghaziabad’s district magistrate, said.The help assured by the government, Mayawati later said, must reach the family as soon as possible.“The BSP is also demanding that whatever help has been assured by the UP government to the victim’s family today should be given on time. The victim’s family should not have to run from pillar to post,” she said in her third tweet.Kalanidhi Naithani, Ghaziabad’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) Ghaziabad, has said a case has been registered based on the CCTV footage and that nine accused have been arrested. “The main accused Ravi and Chotu have been arrested. Ravi had planned and Chotu shot at the journalist. Their illegal pistol was also seized. If anyone else’s name comes up that person will be arrested,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.“Police have taken the statements of the accused. Security arrangements have been made for the family,” Naithani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-congress-attack-over-journalist-s-death-mayawati-says-jungle-raj-in-uttar-pradesh/story-8JrugVy0k8yVlBjW4jpC0N.html

He assured the IAF’s top brass that all needs of the armed forces will be fulfilled.In his speech, Bhadauria said the IAF was well prepared to counter short-term and strategic threats and its units were evenly poised to counter any aggressive action by the adversary. He emphasised on the need to focus on the ability to handle situations at short notice for a robust response.The conference is being held days ahead of the IAF inducting its first batch of five Rafale combats jets acquired from France. They will be inducted at Ambala airbase on July 29.IAF is inducting the jets against the backdrop of heightened tensions with China. It can deploy the new Rafale jets in Ladakh sector as part of India’s overarching plan to strengthen its military posture in the region, where Indian and Chinese forces have been locked in a tense confrontation for months. A protracted process of disengagement began recently and is still ongoing.India-specific enhancements on the Rafales include cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases.India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016, as an emergency purchase to arrest a worrying slide in IAF’s combat capabilities.The possible deployment of Rafale fighters in Ladakh could be discussed at the commanders’ conference, where the air force brass is expected to focus on the border row with China, IAF’s preparedness and new purchases that have to be made quickly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-chief-says-poised-to-counter-any-aggressive-action-by-adversary/story-AJIzCQQWJesIFOjuh4FXaP.html

He tweeted a fake message on Twitter that the state government has announced reimposition of lockdown restrictions, starting Friday for the next seven days in a bid to contain the spread of the viral outbreak.“Looking at the situation of the pandemic, the Tripura government has decided to announce a seven-day lockdown from Friday (July 24),” the teenager had tweeted on Tuesday, masquerading as CM Deb.However, the police managed to track down the errant teenager and he confessed to his crime during an interrogation.“The boy was detained from his home on Tuesday.

22-07-2020||India||Twin naval exercises with US supercarriers signal QUAD has arrived||As four Indian naval ships participated in a two-day joint exercise with the American supercarrier USS Nimitz off the Andaman coast this week, another supercarrier USS Ronald Regan teamed up with navies of Australia and Japan to carry out a similar exercise 4,000 km away on the mouth of the contested South China Sea.The official statements on the exercises did not name China that has been trying to throw its weight around its neighbours. It didn’t have to as the danger is clear and present with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi clearly stating this week that Beijing was moving to the centre of the globe - in effect expounding the Middle Kingdom concept.The United States has emerged as the bulwark against China in the South China Sea and beyond, deepening partnerships with countries in Asia, Europe and Australia to secure Indo-Pacific from a bellicose China.The two exercises make it evident that India will be the principal ally to US in securing Indian Ocean Region while Japan and Australia will be key to protecting Pacific region.The message that put China at the centre of the United States’ focus was reinforced by US defence secretary Mark Esper late on Tuesday. Esper explained the presence of the US supercarriers in and around the South China Sea, which irks Beijing, “to back up the sovereignty of friends and partners and to reassure them that we will be there to defend those things” in the face of ‘China’s bad behaviour”.The four navies that participated in this week’s two exercises - US, India, Japan and Australia -- would be in the Indian Ocean later in November as part of the expanded Malabar naval exercise led by India. Australia is expected to be formally invited soon to the exercise.“This would be a QUAD exercise by default,” a military commander said, referring to the four-country Quadrilateral security dialogue or QUAD.The US, which plays the lead role in QUAD, has become a pivot against China; exercising with the Indian Navy in the Indian Ocean and Japan and Australia in the Philippine Sea near the mouth of the South China Sea.Mark Esper said the exercise in the Indian Ocean reflects the shared commitment of the US and India to boost naval cooperation in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific.The exercise with the Indian Navy was conducted beyond the Six Degree channel which separates Great Nicobar from Banda Ache in Indonesia’s Sumatra. The USS Nimitz, which reaches more than 23 stories high from the keel to the top of the mast, was coming down from the South China Sea into the Strait of Malacca.Simultaneously, USS Ronald Regan conducted the trilateral military exercise as a show of naval might in the Philippine Sea on the doorstep of the disputed South China Sea.“Throughout the cooperative exercise period, participants will operate and train together, exercising integrated maritime operations in an all-domain warfighting environment,” the US Navy said in a statement, pointing that the exercise would help their response “to any situation”.China claims much of the neighbouring South China Sea, though the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei also have overlapping claims in the waters. The US, in a marked change in stance on China’s disputes in the South China Sea, had described Beijing’s pursuit of offshore resources “completely unlawful” and condemned its “campaign of bullying to control” the disputed waters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twin-naval-exercises-with-us-supercarriers-signal-quad-has-arrived/story-8J11B7NURit4ZqpVBMP4VO.html
22-07-2020||India||Journalist Vikram Joshi who was shot in UP’s Ghaziabad, passes away||Ghaziabad: Vikram Joshi (35), a Ghaziabad-based journalist with a local Hindi newspaper, succumbed to his injuries at a private hospital early morning on Wednesday after he was shot at by a group of men in front of his two minor daughters on Monday late evening.The police arrested nine people in connection with the crime on Tuesday, while one suspect is absconding.Joshi, who was on way on his bike along with his two minor daughters, was cornered by a group of men at Mata Colony in Ghaziabad on Monday late evening and was roughed up. Soon, one of the attackers shot at him from a close range and he sustained bullet injuries in his head. “Joshi was admitted to the intensive care unit and was put on ventillator support. There were internal haemorrhage and acute blood loss due to the gunshot injury in his head. He suffered cardiac arrest and expired at 4:01 am on Wednesday,” said Dr. Sangeeta Garg, chief medical superintendent, Yashoda Hospital, Nehru Nagar, Ghaziabad.On Monday morning, Joshi’s family members refused to take his body away for a post-mortem examination and demanded to speak to the district magistrate (DM) Ajay Shankar Pandey and the senior superintendent of police (SSP), Ghaziabad, Kalanidhi Naithani, who later arrived at Yashoda Hospital.“The DM spoke to the deceased’s family members and offered financial help, including taking care of his minor daughters’ education and a job for his wife depending upon her educational qualification. Later, the family members allowed his body to be taken away for an autopsy,” said Rakesh Mishra, circle officer, City-1, Ghaziabad Police.The SSP, however, was unavailable for his comments, despite repeated attempts by HT.“The Uttar Pradesh (UP) government and district administration are concerned about the murder of Joshi. The state government has announced an Rs 10-lakh compensation to his family. Free education will be arranged for his two minor daughters. The family was also assured of a job to his wife as per her educational qualification,” said the district information officer.The police have identified the nine suspects as Ravi Kumar, Chotu (who goes by a single name), Mohit Kumar, Dalvir Singh, Akash Nath, Yogendra Singh, Abhishek Kant, Abhishek Mota, and Mohammad Shakir, while another one, Akash Bihari, is still absconding.All suspects are residents of the same locality in Ghaziabad.Earlier on July 16, a fight had broken out between Joshi’s family and the rival group after which both parties had approached the local police authorities in Vijay Nagar. The rival group alleged that Ravi Kumar -- one of the suspects behind the journalist’s murder --sustained severe injuries, while Joshi’s family alleged that the men were harassing the journalist’s niece.The police said that investigation is on over Joshi family’s allegations of harassment of the girl.The police said Ravi was hospitalised after the July 16 fistfight, but he sent his accomplices to physically assault Joshi on Monday late evening. Joshi was shot at in the presence of his two minor daughters. The incident was caught on closed-circuit TV (CCTV) cameras, where one of his minor daughters was seen crying for help after Joshi sustained bullet injuries in his head. “Nine people, including Ravi, have been arrested. One suspect is still on the run. The SSP has suspended the local police post in-charge and a departmental probe has been initiated against him,” Mishra added.The incident has snowballed into a raging political controversy, as former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday morning tweeted and offered condolences to Joshi’s family and also slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led UP government over its rising crime graph.“Vada tha Ram raj ka, de diya gundraj (Ram raj was promised but they gave gunda raj),” Gandhi tweeted.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee also weighed in on the incident.“My heartfelt condolences to the family members of Vikram Joshi, a fearless journalist, who passed away on Wednesday morning. He was shot in UP for filing an FIR to book his niece’s molesters. An atmosphere of fear has been created in the country. Voices are being muzzled. Media not spared. Shocking,” Banerjee tweeted.On Tuesday, Priyanka Gandhi, general secretary, Congress; and Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav also slammed the UP government and questioned the worsening law and order in the country’s most populous state.“The government has directed the Ghaziabad administration for all help to Joshi’s family and financial assistance. Besides free education to his children, his wife will get a job in the state government. The police have acted promptly in the case and nine people were arrested. An investigation is on in the case,” said Chandra Mohan, BJP’s UP spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/journalist-vikram-joshi-who-was-shot-in-up-s-ghaziabad-passes-away/story-ieGfxQnx2s8IPZ2DYJgKjI.html

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had predicted moderate to heavy intensity rainfall for Delhi and some parts of Haryana on Wednesday.This was the second time in three days that the area near central Delhi’s Connaught Place was flooded after rains. A 56-year-old man drowned on Sunday as he tried to navigate his mini truck through eight feet-deep water on the Minto Road underpass.Kundan Singh Mehra sat on his submerged vehicle for several minutes before his death, according to a video clip that was authenticated by his family members who said passersby did not try to rescue him. Fire officials, who rescued three others stranded there, said they were unaware there was a fourth person. Mehra’s body was later spotted by a linesman working nearby.Photos on social media also showed a Delhi Transportation Corporation (DTC) submerged under the bridge.At least one other person also drowned that day in a separate incident after the first spell of heavy rains in the national capital this monsoon.The flooding in several areas of the national capital led to a war of words between the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and opposition. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said all government and civic agencies must work together instead of indulging in blame-game at a time when the city is battling the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Raghav Chadha, the AAP’s spokesperson and vice-chairperson of the Delhi Jal Board, said the work was delayed due to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-s-minto-bridge-reopens-after-waterlogging-amid-heavy-rains/story-O6hrmNoBFbQp5u4oImxPFM.html
22-07-2020||India||CAG reports help enhance effectiveness of governance: Vice president||Several reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) have led to changes in regulatory framework, governance structures and delivery mechanism of the government, ensuring economy, efficiency and effectiveness of operations, vice president M Venkaiah Naidu said on Wednesday.“Today, the CAG has evolved as an enabler to Balasaheb’s vision that not only ensures public financial accountability but also acts as a friend, philosopher and guide of the executive,” he said, while unveiling a statue of BR Ambedkar in the CAG office in New Delhi.He said Ambedkar is the architect of the Constitution and one of the builders of modern India, which mandates the CAG to promote accountability, transparency and good governance through high-quality auditing and accounting and provide independent assurance to our stakeholders, the legislature, the executive and the public, that public funds are being used efficiently and for intended purposes.Though the history of the audit department is almost 160 years old, it was the Constitution that proved catalytic in transforming this organisation of the colonial era into an independent pillar of Indian parliamentary democracy, he said.“Today, CAG is a strong and credible institution and the credit for this must go to the framers of our Constitution, particularly to Dr Ambedkar, who had the vision to ensure independence and wide mandate to the CAG,” he added.Ambedkar’s life and work have inspired the nation and it is heartening to see the core values of CAG – independence, objectivity, integrity, reliability, professional excellence, transparency and positive approach – draw inspiration from his life and work, he said.He said corruption is a major malaise affecting growth and development and all stakeholders – the government, civil society and people – must endeavour to collectively stamp out the menace.“While the Constitution reflected the vision of Dr Ambedkar and its framers gave us one of the best living documents, it is for every Indian, be it an ordinary citizen or a person occupying high constitutional post, to ensure that the sanctity of our Constitution is upheld at all times and never violated. Otherwise, it will be tantamount to betraying the trust and faith of the founding fathers,” he said.“For all the citizens of India, the Constitution remains a sacred book and a guiding beacon on all matters. We should salute the constitution-framers for their vision and statesmanship in giving us a constitution that laid a strong foundation for our parliamentary democracy and stood the test of times,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cag-reports-help-enhance-effectiveness-of-governance-vice-president/story-auSwJu4KOsbLGMddYRwm7M.html

22-07-2020||India||‘Is it a crime to be a journalist in UP?’ Cong attacks govt over Vikram Joshi’s death||The Congress party went all guns blazing against the Yogi Adityanath-led government in Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday after Vikram Joshi, a 35-year-old journalist, died following an attack in Ghaziabad.Vikram Joshi had sustained a gunshot injury in the head after he was attacked by a group of men late on Monday night at Vijay Nagar of the city. Police have said Joshi was attacked by the men after he had lodged a complaint against one of them for harassing his niece.Senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said Joshi’s ruthless murder has exposed the face of “goondaraj” (rule by hooligans) in Uttar Pradesh as he listed a number of crimes against journalists in the state.“When the situation is like this in Ghaziabad which is adjacent to Delhi-NCR, then you can guess how goodaraj and jungle raj in Adityanath-led government in Uttar Pradesh are on their peak,” Surjewala said during a press conference.The senior leader related the sequence of events before and after Monday’s attack on Joshi as he criticised the law and order situation in the state.“Is it a crime to be a journalist in states ruled by the BJP? Are journalists now gangsters? Will the police not heed to calls by journalists like Vikram Joshi? Will journalists be killed by gangsters in broad daylight? The situation in Uttar Pradesh is pitiful,” he said.He said examples of such attacks of journalists and their families are important as he talked about the crimes against them.“And now Vikram Joshi is murdered ruthlessly in public. Where is Adityanathji? Where is the rule of law under the BJP? Is it the same Ram Rajya that BJP promised after it came to power?” he asked.Before that, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also termed the BJP-led Uttar Pradesh government as “goondaraj”, hours after Joshi succumbed to the bullet injury.“Journalist Vikram Joshi was killed after he protested against the harassment against his niece. My condolence to the family. They promised Ram Raj but gave goondaraj,” Gandhi tweeted.Several other leaders of the Congress party also attacked the Adityanath government on the same lines.Party leader and lawyer Abhishek Singhvi also expressed his shock over the incident.“Shocking jungle raj in #Ghaziabad area with journalist #Joshi, already known as the complainant in #FIR, being shot on a scooter while with his daughters, struggling in a coma with a bullet in the skull! Thank God daughters not hit. Shocking, scary, disgusting lack of fear of law & order! #UP.”Ajay Kumar Lallu, president in of Congress’ state unit, demanded the chief minster’s resignation. “The Ghaziabad incident has shocked the entire state. It’s a tragic incident. Nobody is safe in Uttar Pradesh. If it is not jungle raj then what is,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.“The government remains silent while criminals are becoming more active. While leaving home in the morning, people in the state worry whether they will be able to return in the evening or not,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-it-a-crime-to-be-a-journalist-in-up-congress-attacks-adityanath-govt-over-vikram-joshi-s-death/story-quCm89FoNFEJ6nGTVM4llO.html
22-07-2020||India||Rajasthan Speaker moves Supreme Court against HC order giving breather to Pilot camp||The political crisis in Rajasthan reached the Supreme Court on Wednesday with assembly speaker CP Joshi filing a speacial leave petition (SLP) against a high court order that asked him not to decide the disqualification notices he had issued to the group of 19 lawmakers led by Sachin Pilot.In his petition, Joshi called the order “illegal, perverse, and in derogation of the powers of the Speaker”.“The proceedings under the Tenth Schedule before the Speaker are proceedings of the legislature and as such cannot interfered with as repeatedly held by this Hon’ble Court as envisaged under Article 212 read with para 6(2) of the Tenth Schedule,” the Speaker said in his petition.The high court’s order restrained the Speaker from even calling and conducting the disqualification proceedings pending against the respondents till July 24, the petition said.ALSO WATCH | ‘With an innocent face...’: CM Ashok Gehlot’s fresh attack on Sachin Pilot The petition further stated that the high court order violated Kihoto Hollohan case decided by the Supreme Court in 1992.In that case, a Constitution bench of five judges expressly held that courts cannot interdict the Speaker from proceeding ahead at the quia timet stage (apprehension of injunction).The high court had on Tuesday told the Speaker not to move forward on the disqualification notices till Friday when the judges are expected to deliver its ruling.Sachin Pilot and 18 lawmakers close to him were issued disqualification notices last week on a complaint from the Congress that has accused them of trying to topple the Ashok Gehlot government.Joshi had announced his decision to move the Supreme Court at a press conference on Wednesday morning where he warned that they were “heading for a constitutional crisis”.“I don’t want a confrontation. I respect the judges... but the roles are well defined,” Joshi had told reporters.The Speaker has twice before deferred his deadline for action on the notices as the court proceedings continued beyond the expected time.The deferment on Tuesday is being construed as a breather for the Pilot camp.Mahesh Joshi, the Congress’ chief whip, had sought the disqualification of rebel MLAs from the assembly due to their abstinence from the CLP meet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/illegal-rajasthan-speaker-moves-supreme-court-against-hc-order-giving-breather-to-pilot-camp/story-SMAKGXnaMtXDnUIApPU7hK.html
22-07-2020||India||Rajasthan speaker moves SC against HC directive to defer disqualification proceedings till Friday||The Speaker of Rajasthan assembly moved the Supreme Court on Wednesday against the order passed by the Rajasthan high court deferring action on notices issued by him to Sachin Pilot and 18 dissident Congress legislators till July 24.Speaker CP Joshi said that according to the Supreme Court’s 1992 judgment in Kihoto Hollohan vs Zachillhu, the court cannot interfere with the speaker’s powers to decide a disqualification petition till he gives a final decision on such a plea.Such interference amounts to transgression by the judiciary into his exclusive domain, he contended. In this case, the speaker had only issued show-cause notice to the rebel MLAs and the court couldn’t have interfered at this interim stage, he said.“In Kihoto, a Constitution bench of the Supreme Court expressly held that courts cannot interdict the speaker from proceeding ahead. The proceedings under the Tenth Schedule before the Speaker are proceedings of the Legislature and as such cannot be interfered with...In view of the aforesaid, the (high court) order is ex-facie illegal, perverse, and in derogation of the powers of the Speaker under the Constitution and hencedeserve to be set aside,” the petition said.The Rajasthan high court had, on Tuesday, directed the speaker not to take any action based on his July 14 notice to the Pilot camp.This order was passed after Pilot and the other MLAs had approached the high court on July 15, challenging the speaker’s notice which had asked them to furnish an explanation by July 17 on why they shouldn’t be disqualified from the assembly for their conduct, which the Congress party alleged was detrimental to the interest of the party and showed their intention to quit the party.Pilot and Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot have been at loggerheads since the Congress government came to power in 2018 and Gehlot was made CM while Pilot had to settle for the post of Deputy CM.The tussle had come out in open earlier this month after Rajasthan police had sought to question Pilot over allegations against him attempting to pull down the Congress government in Rajasthan in cahoots with the BJP.Gehlot and Pilot had traded allegations before Pilot was eventually sacked as deputy CM. Without Pilot and 18 MLAs who are supporting him, the Congress government enjoys a wafer this majority in the 200-member strong assembly.The speaker’s notice to Pilot was based on the disqualification petition filed by the chief whip of the Congress in Rajsthan, Mahesh Joshi. He had in his plea cited the absence of the MLAs from two Congress legislature party meetings, held on July 13 and 14, despite specific instructions to attend it. This was cited as the main reason which showed the intention of the MLAs to leave the Congress.Pilot and the other dissident MLAs have maintained they never had the intention to leave the Congress and were exercising their right to criticise the party leadership and the functioning of chief minister Ashok Gehlot. In a democratic set-up, voicing disagreement with policies or decisions made by the party doesn’t amount to acting against the interests of the party, so as to lead to disqualification, they said in their petition.The speaker has maintained throughout that the petition by Pilot is premature since the Kihoto vs Hollohan judgment bars any interference by courts while proceedings are pending before the speaker.The high court had reserved its judgment on Tuesday after hearing the parties for three days and also said that it will pronounce its verdict on July 24. The speaker, however, approached the top without waiting for the order.He has sought urgent listing of the case.“In these circumstances, it is respectfully submitted that the impugned order (of Tuesday) which is in direct contravention to the law laid down by this court in Kihoto Hollohan is liable to be immediately stayed so that the dignity of Constitutional authorities envisaged by the Constitution is protected”, the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-speaker-moves-sc-against-hc-directive-to-defer-disqualification-proceedings-till-friday/story-mM6og72opiGx2Zxf03X7cK.html

The tweet was posted on June 29. Another tweet by Bhushan was posted on June 27 wherein he spoke about the role of four former CJIs in “destroying democracy without a formal emergency”.  When historians in future look back at the last 6 years to see how democracy has been destroyed in India even without a formal Emergency, they will particularly mark the role of the Supreme Court in this destruction, & more particularly the role of the last 4 CJIs“When historians in the future look back at the last 6 years to see how democracy has been destroyed in India even without a formal Emergency, they will particularly mark the role of the Supreme Court in this destruction, & more particularly the role of the last 4 CJIs,” Bhushan had tweeted.For Twitter, senior advocate Sajjan Poovayya appeared and informed the Court that Twitter can only disable a tweet on orders passed by the Court. He proposed the Court to pass an order to this effect but the Court refused. Nobody appeared for Bhushan.According to the rule of contempt, for a publication (including web/social media platform too), the author and the publisher, both are called out in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-issues-notices-to-prashant-bhushan-twitter-in-contempt-proceedings/story-qakEHM0Yj6sEqMn7v2GjDN.html

22-07-2020||India||Rajasthan Speaker to move SC over HC’s ‘intervention’ in rebel MLAs’ disqualification||Rajasthan Speaker CP Joshi said on Wednesday that he would move the Supreme Court (SC) against what he felt was an intervention in his authority to decide on an anti-defection petition.“We need to see if a show-cause notice on an anti-defection petition was beyond a Speaker’s authority,” he said in a press conference at his official residence on Wednesday morning.Joshi said in 1992, the SC’s constitutional bench had settled that Speaker was competent to decide anti-defection petitions.A division bench of the Rajasthan high court (HC) is hearing a joint petition by 19 rebel Congress lawmakers, including sacked deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, against the defection notice sent to them by Speaker Joshi.On Tuesday, the two-member HC division bench, comprising Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Prakash Gupta, posted the matter for next hearing on Friday.“We further request the Speaker to extend the said petition till the delivery of the order by this court on July 24 (Friday) and we direct accordingly,” said the HC order.The Speaker objected to the use of the word “direct” in the HC order and questioned the legal intervention, when the notice had been issued.The notice was served on the 19 rebel legislators following a complaint from the chief whip of Rajasthan Assembly Mahesh Joshi. The chief whip has stated in his complaint that the 19 lawmakers be disqualified for not attending two consecutive Congress legislature party (CLP) meetings on July 13 and 14.Pilot and other dissident MLAs challenged the disqualification notice in the HC last Friday following which the bench heard their plea on Monday and Tuesday.Speaker Joshi has put off his deadline twice for taking action on the notice because the court proceedings have exceeded the expected timeframe.Senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi, who argued on behalf of Pilot’s camp, cited that the HC’s power in this case cannot be curtailed and that it has the jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the matter.“Each and every judgement has to be read along with the facts prevalent in that case,” Rohatgi said.He also maintained that the Speaker’s order is against the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, which deals with anti-defection.Rohatgi pointed out the fundamental flaws in the Speaker’s notice and cited precedence to bolster his argument.He argued that the 19 Congress members of the Rajasthan legislative assembly (MLAs) were given only three days by Speaker Joshi to respond to his notice, but the complaint by the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Madan Dilawar regarding six turncoat lawmakers, who had left the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) last year to join the Ashok Gehlot-led government was yet to be heard.Rohatgi claimed that the proceedings “reek of malafide intent”.“Mind you, we are in the middle of the Covid–19 (coronavirus disease) outbreak and only three days’ time is given for the reply,” Rohatgi said.The deferment is being construed as a breather for the Pilot camp.Senior counsel Abhishek Manu Sanghvi argued the case on behalf of the Gehlot government after Rohtagi and senior advocate Harish Salve represented the Pilot camp.“Pilot’s petition is premature. It’s not maintainable,” Singhvi said. He contended that the Speaker is yet to adjudicate on the matter.Speaker Joshi’s counsel Prateek Kasliwal also weighed in.“It is wrong to accuse the Speaker of being biased. It is up to the Speaker to decide which matter he wants to take up first. If that argument is allowed, then people will begin questioning why their petitions have not been taken up first,” Kasliwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-speaker-to-move-sc-over-hc-s-intervention-in-rebel-mlas-disqualification/story-sX2y7ncojwu0EcPRLi6v2H.html
22-07-2020||India||Over 2,300 villages under water, 1.10 lakh hectare crop area destroyed in Assam flood; more rain likely today||The Northeastern states of Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur and Tripura are likely to receive heavy rainfall on Wednesday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.“Thunderstorm accompanied with lightning ia very likely at isolated places over Bihar, Jharkhand, Gangetic West Bengal, Odisha, Coastal Andhra Pradesh,” the IMD’s weather bulletin on Wednesday morning stated.Assam is already reeling under flood due to incessant rain and 24.19 lakh people in 24 districts are affected, a government report said. A total of 87 people have died in flood-related incidents.The Central Water Commission (CWC), which has been regularly releasing updates on the river level, said on Wednesday morning that the Brahmaputra is expected to rise 30 cm by Thursday evening. Other rivers like Dhansiri, Jia Bharali, Kopili, Beki, Gaurang, Kushiyara and Sankosh are also flowing above the danger mark.A report by Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) said that the mighty Brahmaputra is flowing above the danger marks in Dibrugarh, Dhubri and Goalpara cities, besides at Nimatighat in Jorhat and Tezpur in Sonitpur districts.The ASDMA report further said that at present 2,323 villages across Assam are under water and 1.10 lakh hectares of crop area has been damaged.The flood-affected districts are: Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Biswanath, Darrang, Baksa, Nalbari, Barpeta, Chirang, Bongaigaon, Kokrajhar, Dhubri, South Salmara, Goalpara, Kamrup, Kamrup Metropolitan, Morigaon, Nagaon, Golaghat, Jorhat, Majuli, Sivasagar, Dibrugarh, Tinsukia and Cachar.Massive erosion has been witnessed at different places of Majuli, Baksa, Sonitpur and Udalguri districts, it added.Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal visited the erosion hit areas of Tulsijhara village near Hagrama bridge in Chirang district on Tuesday and assessed the devastations caused by Aie river.Rescue personnel evacuated 869 stranded people by boats in nine of the affected districts on Tuesday and shifted them to safer locations.A total of 66 roads in six affected districts remain submerged or were damaged on Tuesday, according to ASDMA. Five bridges were damaged in Darrang and one in Barpeta on Tuesday.A total 397 relief camps and distribution centres have been opened in 18 districts where 44,498 people have taken shelter currently, the ASDMA report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-2-300-villages-under-water-1-10-lakh-hectare-crop-area-destroyed-in-assam-flood-more-rain-likely-today/story-KahQBSFBJAaZyVIHtiq3wM.html
22-07-2020||India||Silent spread of Covid-19 keeps scientists grasping for clues||One of the great mysteries of the coronavirus is how quickly it rocketed around the world.It first flared in central China and, within three months, was on every continent but Antarctica, shutting down daily life for millions. Behind the rapid spread was something that initially caught scientists off guard, baffled health authorities and undermined early containment efforts — the virus could be spread by seemingly healthy people.As workers return to offices, children prepare to return to schools and those desperate for normalcy again visit malls and restaurants, the emerging science points to a menacing reality: If people who appear healthy can transmit the illness, it may be impossible to contain.“It can be a killer and then 40 percent of people don’t even know they have it,” said Dr. Eric Topol, head of Scripps Research Translational Institute.Researchers have exposed the frightening likelihood of silent spread of the virus by asymptomatic and presymptomatic carriers. But how major a role seemingly healthy people play in swelling the ranks of those infected remains unanswered — and at the top of the scientific agenda.The small but mighty coronavirus can unlock a human cell, set up shop and mass produce tens of thousands of copies of itself in a single day. Virus levels skyrocket before the first cough, if one ever arrives. And astonishing to scientists, an estimated 4 in 10 infected people don’t ever have symptoms.The slyness of the virus remains on the minds of many scientists as they watch societies reopen, wondering what happens if silent spreaders aren’t detected until it’s too late.Travelers with no coughs can slip past airport screens. Workers without fevers won’t be caught by temperature checks. People who don’t feel tired and achy will attend business meetings.And outbreaks could begin anew.The first hintsAs early as January, there were signs people could harbor the virus without showing symptoms. A 10-year-old boy in China who traveled to Wuhan had no symptoms but tested positive, along with six others in his family who had coughs and fevers. More troubling was a report out of Germany: A business traveler from China spread the virus to colleagues in Munich, even though she appeared healthy.Still, many scientists remained unconvinced.The concept of people unwittingly spreading disease has never been an easy one to grasp, from the polio epidemic of mid-century America to the spread of HIV decades later.At the turn of the 20th century, a seemingly healthy New York cook named Mary Mallon left a deadly trail of typhoid infections that captivated the public and led to her being forced into quarantine on an East River island. “Typhoid Mary” remains a haunting symbol of silent spread.As Covid-19 emerged, health officials believed it would be like other coronaviruses and that people were most infectious when showing symptoms like cough and fever, with transmission rare otherwise.“We were thinking this thing is going to look like SARS: a long incubation period and no transmission during the incubation period,” said Lauren Ancel Meyers, a disease modeler at the University of Texas at Austin.Behind the scenes, scientists like Meyers were sharing their alarming finding with health officials. By scouring the websites of Chinese health departments, Meyers and her team found more than 50 cases between Jan. 21 and Feb. 8 where the person who brought the virus home didn’t develop symptoms until after infecting a family member.“When we looked at the data, we said, ‘Oh no, this can’t be true,’” Meyers said. “It was shocking.”Clues on a cruise shipRebecca Frasure, who contracted the virus while aboard the Diamond Princess cruise, sat in bed in Japan in late February, frustrated to be kept hospitalized even though she didn’t have any symptoms.“I’m perfectly healthy except having this virus in my body,” Frasure said.Without widespread and frequent testing, it’s impossible to know how many people without symptoms might carry it. The Diamond Princess, which idled in the Port of Yokohama, while the virus exploded onboard, enticed researchers.After an ill passenger tested positive, only those with symptoms initially got tests.Rein Houben, a disease tracker at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, set out to build a mathematical model to estimate how many infected people without symptoms were being missed. After four weeks, it indicated a startling three-quarters of infected people on the Princess were asymptomatic.At first, the researchers worried they had done something wrong. But they hadn’t, and they had their answer: Asymptomatic carriers “may contribute substantially to transmission.”In Washington state, similar clues emerged for Dr. Jeff Duchin as a team of investigators examined the Life Care nursing home — where the first major U.S. cluster of coronavirus cases broke out —and found health care workers were spreading the virus to other elder care facilities. They believed at least some of them were working while infected but before feeling symptoms.In March, more than half the residents at another nursing home who tested positive didn’t have symptoms, though most would go on to develop them.That underscored the need to shift gears and acknowledge the virus couldn’t be totally stopped.“This disease is going to be extremely hard to control,” Duchin recalled thinking.Unanswered questionsThe nose and mouth are convenient entryways for the coronavirus. Once inside, the virus commandeers the cell’s machinery to copy itself, while fending off the body’s immune defenses. Virus levels skyrocket in the upper airway, all without symptoms early on. Many scientists believe that, during these days, people can spread virus just by talking, breathing or touching surfaces.In the truly asymptomatic, the immune system wins the battle before they ever feel sick. That may have been what happened with Jessie Cornwell. After an outbreak at her Seattle assisted living facility, Cornwell tested positive for coronavirus, although she never had symptoms. She may have infected the Rev. Jane Pauw, who drove Cornwell to a Bible study meeting and later ran a high fever and tested positive.As it became clearer that healthy people could spread the virus, U.S. health authorities opted not to wait for scientific certainty. In early April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended people wear masks.Days later, Chinese researchers published a paper saying patients are most infectious two to three days before developing symptoms. Evidence continues to accumulate, and the CDC now estimates 40% of transmission is occurring before people feel sick.Still, doubt remains among scientists, most notably among the World Health Organization, which has discounted the importance of asymptomatic infection, though it recently began to acknowledge that possibility and advised people to wear masks.U.S. health officials blame China for delays in sharing information on silent spread. But Topol contends the U.S. could have mounted its own testing program with viral genome sequencing.That’s no small matter: Gaining scientific clarity earlier would have saved lives.“We’ve been slow on everything in the United States,” Topol said. “And I have to say it’s shameful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/silent-spread-of-covid-19-keeps-scientists-grasping-for-clues/story-O8siWIXtItWFgzGoWds1PN.html

22-07-2020||India||Rajasthan political crisis: Speaker to move Supreme Court against high court order giving breather to Pilot camp||The Rajasthan political crisis is set to reach the Supreme Court with assembly speaker CP Joshi headed to the top court against the high court that asked him not to decide the disqualification notices he had issued to the group of 19 lawmakers led by Sachin Pilot.The high court on Tuesday told the Speaker not to move forward on the disqualification notices till Friday when the judges are expected to deliver its ruling.Sachin Pilot and 18 lawmakers close to him were issued disqualification notices last week on a complaint from the Congress that has accused them of trying to topple the Ashok Gehlot government.CP Joshi announced his decision to move the Supreme Court at a press conference where he warned that they were “heading for a constitutional crisis”.Also Read: At CLP meet, CM Ashok Gehlot assures of win, attacks ‘betrayers’Joshi stressed that there were more than one Supreme Court verdicts that ruled the judiciary could not interfere before the assembly speaker delivered its ruling.“I don’t want a confrontation. I respect the judges... but the roles are well defined,” Joshi told reporters.“The Speaker has the complete authority to send a showcause notice. I have asked my counsel to file SLP in Supreme Court,” he added. Joshi said he is dismayed by the high court judgement.The Speaker has twice before deferred his deadline for action on the notices as the court proceedings continued beyond the expected time.The division bench of Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Prakash Gupta heard the petition filed by the Pilot camp challenging the disqualification notice from Speaker on Monday and Tuesday.Mukul Rohatgi, arguing on behalf of Pilot, mentioned that the high court’s power in this case cannot be curtailed and that it has the jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the matter.Rohatgi also maintained that the Speaker’s order issuing notices goes against the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution.He also said that while on one hand, the 19 Congress MLAs (including Pilot) were given only three days by the Speaker to respond to the notices, on the other hand, the complaint by BJP’s Madan Dilawar regarding six turncoat MLAs who left BSP to join Congress was yet to be heard. Rohatgi claimed that the proceedings “reek of malafides”.“Mind you, we are in the middle of Covid–19 and only three days time is given for reply,” Rohatgi said. The deferment is being construed as a breather for the Pilot camp.Also Read: Rajasthan cops stay put in Manesar, Delhi to quiz elusive rebel MLAAfter arguments from Rohatgi and Salve, Congress leader Abhishek Manu Sanghvi argued the case on behalf of Rajasthan Government. “Pilot’s petition is premature. It’s not maintainable,” he said. Singhvi’s contention was based on the fact that the Speaker has not adjudicated on the matter so far. Prateek Kasliwal, Counsel for Joshi, said, “It is wrong to accuse the Speaker of being biased. It is up to the Speaker to decide which matter he wants to take up first. If that argument is allowed, then people will begin questioning why their petitions have not been taken first. All arguments have concluded.”Mahesh Joshi, the Congress’ chief whip, had sought the disqualification of rebel MLAs from the assembly due to their abstinence from the CLP meet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-rajasthan-hc-breather-for-sachin-pilot-and-other-rebel-congress-mlas-speaker-to-hold-press-conference/story-AfGUbMNFLu49hoUXqM6V0H.html

That’s the target and I hope we can do that,” Poonawalla said in an interview to a news channel.The company will manufacture up to 70 million doses of the vaccine per month up to October as part of the special permission and plans to take it up to 100 million per month by December so that it is ready to hit the market once the final approvals are in place.If this goes to plan, the phase three trials will take two months after the patients get injected and the vaccine gets a final nod by November, he said, adding that in such a scenario, it can get introduced either in the “first quarter of 2021”.The company has already manufactured around 2-3 million doses of the vaccine for getting the process correct and also stabilising its machinery, Ponnawalla said, clarifying that these will never be used on humans.He added it is extremely likely that the Covid-19 vaccine would require two or more doses, like in the case of antidotes for measles and other diseases.“We have got a lot on the line and bet big on this (Oxford-AstraZeneca) candidate. And we really hope it works,” he added.Price of CovishieldPoonawala said they expect the vaccine to reach the people of India in large numbers by the first quarter of 2021. “We are going to give it at a very affordable price… We are planning to put it at about Rs 1000 or less than that… I don’t think any citizen of India or of any other country is going to have to pay for it because it is going to be bought by the government and distributed free,” he said.“It is going to be very affordable… in line with our general philosophy of giving everything at a very affordable price. We generally don’t want to make a profit at all, in fact, in the Covid crisis and after the pandemic is over, we may look at a more commercial price that could be available in the market,” he said.TrialThe trials of the Covid-19 vaccine candidate will start by the end of August on up to 5,000 Indian volunteers after getting the necessary nods and the company will launch Covishiled by June next year if all goes well.“The vaccine under development will be injected into 4,000-5,000 volunteers in Pune and Mumbai, which have high rates of coronavirus infections, as part of the crucial phase three of the trial which will determine if the antidote can be introduced in the market or not,” he said.Poonawalla said unlike the exclusion of older people in the initial phase of trials at Oxford, the Indian trials will include elderly people and health workers as well because the initial phase has conclusively proven the safety of the vaccine.InvestmentSII, Poonawalla said, is putting $200 million at risk by manufacturing nearly 300 million doses before the final nod to launch the vaccine in market.“We are making this application within the next 48 hours to the Drug Controller General of India’s office. They will probably take about 1-2 weeks on what kind of study and trial we will have to do,” Poonawalla said, speaking to the CNBC-TV-18 news channel.It will take another three weeks to inject patients in hospitals, he said, adding, “We are talking about a month or month and a half maximum from today...maybe even sooner.”Other than the process of applying for trials and having actual trials on humans in India, the company will also be applying for special permission to start manufacturing the vaccine in the country, which exposes it to a commercial risk if the vaccine fails at the last stage, he said.“If you look at the process right now, the risk of the opex (operating expenditure) which we are putting in is more than $200 million. If this vaccine fails, we will be down (by) $200 million,” he said, adding the expenses exclude the opportunity cost of using the same facility for some other purpose.Further plansPoonawalla also said SII is looking at external investors for the vaccine-related endeavour and added that it has tie-ups with five other vaccine candidates which will be housed into a separate step-down subsidiary, where the family will dilute its stake by 15-20%.Apart from the five tie-ups already forged, SII is in talks with two other candidates, he said, adding that a manufacturing plant with a capacity to produce 1 billion units of the vaccine per year will also get housed in the subsidiary.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/price-trial-timeline-of-serum-institute-s-covid-19-vaccine/story-ElHaypXDfhOpzNFeTTlfLL.html

Custodial deaths, Fake encounters, Toppling elected governments (money +), Intemperate language by the powerful, Persecuting the innocent, Highly questionable judicial verdicts. Save my country!” Sibal tweeted. In my country Has the " Rule of Law "become The law of " He who Rules "Custodial deaths Fake encounters Toppling elected governments ( money + )Intemperate language by the powerfulPersecuting the innocent Highly questionable judicial verdicts Save my country !With this tweet, Sibal continued the Congress’ attack on the government in the recent days. The attack has been led by Rahul Gandhi, who has been targeting the central government over the border row with China and a host of other issues.On Tuesday, he took a swipe at the Centre, listing the alleged “attempt to topple” the government in Rajasthan and the “Namaste Trump” event among its “achievements” in the Covid-19 times. He said due to such “achievements” of the government, the country is now “Aatmanirbhar (self-reliant)” in the fight against the pandemic.“Achievements of the government in the Covid-era: February - Namaste Trump, March - toppling the government in Madhya Pradesh, April - making people light candles, May - government’s sixth anniversary, June - Bihar virtual rally, July - attempt to topple the government in Rajasthan,” Gandhi said in a sarcastic tweet in Hindi.The BJP hit back, saying the Congress will become a “party of tweets” as it is doing no work among people and “losing” one leader after another.Union minister Prakash Javadekar responded to Gandhi, calling protests against the amended citizenship law, the Delhi riots in February the Congress’s “achievements” followed by loss of Jyotiraditya Scindia and power in Madhya Pradesh in March, and “incitement” of migrant workers in April.Sibal then released a video message in which he said that Javadekar should stop polluting the country’s politics with his harsh words and instead focus on better governance.Sibal said the BJP does not know how to govern but knows how to attack and use harsh words.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/has-rule-of-law-become-law-of-he-who-rules-kapil-sibal-s-sharp-attack-at-centre/story-8lG2Rq81HV3UjGQrBx933I.html
22-07-2020||India||US leading the world in Covid-19 testing, India second: Trump||The United States is leading the world in terms of Covid-19 testing and India is at second position, President Donald Trump said while giving an update on his administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.So far more than 140,000 Americans have died due to coronavirus and 3.8 million have tested positive. While the US economy is slowly coming back to normal, the pandemic is now spreading in the Sun Belt of the country.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“As one family, we mourn every precious life that’s been lost. I pledge in their honour that we will develop a vaccine and we will defeat the virus. We’re doing very well with vaccine development and therapeutic development,” Trump said at a White House news conference on Tuesday, his first on coronavirus after several weeks.Trump also said his administration will stop at nothing to save lives and shield the vulnerable.“We’ve learned so much about this disease. And we know who the vulnerable are, and we are going to indeed shield them,” he said.Trump assured that the vaccines against the novel coronavirus will be coming a lot sooner than expected.Replying to a question, Trump said the US is “leading the world” in terms of Covid-19 testing.“We’re going to be over 50 million tests,” he said, adding that “second country is India with 12 million (tests). Then you have seven million, six million, and four million. I think that we are doing a tremendous amount of testing.” The “China virus”, Trump said, is a vicious and dangerous illness.“It’s a nasty, horrible disease that should’ve never been allowed to escape China, but it did. It infected the world, and the world is suffering. But we’re going to get it taken care of, and we’re helping lots of other countries,” the US president said.On tackling the virus, Trump said his administration is developing a powerful strategy. “We’ve learned a great deal about it (Covid-19) and who it targets. We are in the process of developing a strategy that’s going to be very, very powerful,” he said.“Some areas of our country are doing very well; others are doing less well. It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better,” Trump said.He said the median age of those who succumb to Covid-19 infection is 78 years, adding that roughly half of all deaths have been individuals in nursing homes or in long-term care.“Young adults may often have mild or even no symptoms. They won’t even know they’re sick. They won’t have any idea that they have a virus. They won’t have any idea at all,” he said, adding that youth will act responsibly.Trump said the data shows children have the lowest fatality risk as 99.96 per cent of all virus fatalities are adults.“By understanding these risk profiles and learning how to treat the disease, we’ve been able to greatly reduce mortality in the United States,” Trump said. Several treatments are already available in the US that can significantly reduce the severity and duration of the disease, including remdesivir, he said.“We’ve learned best practices for treatment of the virus at every stage and have shared these findings with medical providers, and we’ve shared them all over the world. The relationship with other countries has been very strong. We’re all working together,” Trump said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-leading-the-world-in-covid-19-testing-india-second-trump/story-KoNjyXXGKWr7fsG49DccDM.html
22-07-2020||India||‘Risk of locust swarms migrating to Indo-Pakistan border from Somalia’: UN agency||There remains a risk that a limited number of locust swarms could migrate from northeast Somalia to the Indo-Pakistan border area during the remainder of this month, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of United Nations said on Tuesday.In its last situation update, the FAO said that in Somalia, ground and aerial control operations are underway against immature swarms on the northern plateau between Hargeisa and Garowe. The swarms are moving eastwards across the north and they could continue to migrate across the Indian Ocean to reach the summer breeding areas along both sides of the Indo-Pakistan border.“Control operations are in progress against hopper groups and bands in the Nagarparkar area of southeast Sindh near the Indian border in Pakistan. Groups of adults are maturing in Tharparkar and Cholistan deserts where laying is expected in areas that have already received monsoon rains. This will cause a further increase in locust numbers as hatching and hopper band formation occur in the coming weeks,” the FAO said.On the situation in India, the organisation said that adult groups and swarms are maturing throughout Rajasthan where laying is underway in many areas. So far, a few hopper groups and bands have formed but substantial hatching is expected in the coming weeks. There have been no recent reports of additional locusts in the northern states as most of the adult groups and swarms have returned to Rajasthan as expected.“We have an eye on FAO’s updates and ground situations. Every effort is being made to control locusts. So far, the state government and the organisation together have controlled locusts in about three and a half lakh hectare area,” said KL Gurjar, Deputy Director of Locust Warning Organization (LWO).The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) had recently said that locust attacks are posing a serious threat to food security in parts of East Africa, India and Pakistan as a result of changing climate conditions that can be linked to human activity.The specialised agency of the United Nations said extreme weather events and climatic changes such as increases in temperature and rainfall over desert areas, and the strong winds associated with tropical cyclones, provide a new environment for pest breeding, development and migration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/risk-of-locust-swarms-migrating-to-indo-pakistan-border-from-somalia-un-agency/story-mAx2d5KNSWNAGdZRn6uUGI.html

Multi-satellite data indicated that the bloom appeared for the first time since the entire mission records started since 1978,” Dr Babula Jena who led the research study said. The bloom, he said was mainly a result of upwelling of warm water as well as a combination of factors like availability of nutrients and sunlight which only help the bloom grow further. “The appearance of phytoplankton blooms within sea ice cover is of high importance with implications for atmospheric CO2 and global climate and demonstrates how the phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean would likely respond in the future under warming climate conditions and continued melting of Antarctic sea ice,” Dr Jena said.A polynya is a ‘hole’ in the Antarctic sea ice that occurs if ice begins to melt in the middle of the ice sheet, rather than at the edges as is usually the case.In September 2017, one such polynya - the Maud Rise - reappeared in mid‐September 2017 and grew to as large as 80,000 km2 by the end of October 2017, appearing like a large lake surrounded by sea ice. It is one of the largest known polynya and was last spotted in 1976.Back then too, the scientists at the NCPOR accurately explained the sudden and ‘abnormal’ melting of ice at Maud Rise seemingly in the middle of an otherwise thick sea ice sheet, that published in Geophysical Research Letter.It is within this polynya that the algal bloom has been recorded. Despite being high in nutrients, the seawater that surrounds Antarctica is not favourable for the growth of oceanic algae owing to the lack of sunlight and cold temperatures. The blooms occurred in October-November of 2017 during the austral summer and spring in the southern hemisphere. “With the frequent reoccurrence, the associated physical processes could possibly modify the region into a productive environment and likely have an impact on the regional ecosystem and carbon cycle. The occurrence of polynya and phytoplankton blooms may turn it into a potential sink of atmospheric CO2 through biological pumping and can be a major source of carbon and energy for the regional food web,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/warming-waters-drive-unprecedented-algal-blooms-in-antarctica-scientists-find/story-gryzNnXVvxb1ZFKhtYNCxK.html

Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe guidelines said hospitals should be registered under the Clinical Establishment Act, 2010, have a separate Covid-19 ward with separate entry and exit doors, 24x7 emergency and ICU facilities with specialists on-call.They also mentioned that hospitals can charge co-morbid patients for the original disease as per those set by them but only bare minimum extra cost to treat the patient for Covid-19—like that of personal protection equipment or PPE—can be charged.Uttarakhand reported 210 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, taking the tally to 4,849 with 85 recoveries.With 65 new cases, Dehradun district accounted for the highest number of cases in the state. The other districts that reported the coronavirus disease cases were Almora (5), Champawat (2), Haridwar (52), Nainital (15), Tehri (21), US Nagar (34) and Uttarkashi (16).Of the infections reported on Tuesday, 77 were found to be contacts of earlier detected positive cases while the others had returned to the state from places like Delhi-NCR, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Hyderabad, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu. Many had also come back from foreign countries.Eighty-five patients were also discharged from hospitals during the day with a maximum of 61 patients being from US Nagar.The rate of doubling of cases based on the last seven days now stands at 20.21 days, while the infection rate is 4.20%. The state has so far tested 1.27 lakh samples of which results of over 11,000 are awaited.In Nainital district, five sub-inspectors along with 13 police personnel tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday. All police personnel have been isolated at Susheela Tiwari Hospital in Haldwani. The close contacts of these police officials have also been quarantined.Sunil Kumar Meena, Nainital’s senior superintendent of police, on Tuesday ordered police officials to follow the lockdown rules like wearing masks properly and maintaining social distancing.All field staff have been asked to do their duty by taking full precautions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-releases-guidelines-for-private-hospitals-for-treating-covid-19-patients/story-czc2zH6PifAqdzgrq65a7L.html
22-07-2020||India||Senior Uttarakhand cop warns criminals: Surrender or be ready to face consequences||The Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), US Nagar, did some tough talking on Tuesday asking the criminals to either surrender or be ready to face the consequences.The newly-appointed SSP, Dilip Singh Kunwar, issued a stern warning to the criminals. He asked them to surrender in 15 days. He also said that the police will not hesitate in carrying out encounters for those who try to escape.“There are 144 wanted criminals including 45 who have a reward on their heads. The ones with reward should surrender before courts, police stations or police checkposts concerned in next 15 days while the remaining wanted criminals should surrender within seven days. The deadline will start from tomorrow (Wednesday),” Kunwar said on Tuesday, informing about his letter to his subordinates.“If the criminals don’t surrender, then they will arrest them. And if in the process of arrest if any criminal attacks police to escape it, the police will reply accordingly including encounter. Police will not hesitate to resort to encounter if needed in such cases,” he added.Emphasising on reducing the crime in US Nagar district, which borders Uttar Pradesh, the senior police officer said, “Criminals have no place in the society and are meant to be dealt with stringent possible action. I have instructed all COs and SHOs on the same lines.”Out of the 45 wanted criminals with bounty on their heads, some of them are from outside the district while others belong to US Nagar. Two of them have a reward of Rs 20,000 and Rs 10,000 while others have reward ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/senior-uttarakhand-cop-warns-criminals-surrender-or-be-ready-to-face-consequences/story-icWxrCnQoLzPy16di1WioI.html
22-07-2020||India||Delhiwale: The tomb of a single-screen||Old Delhi is all Urdu, Hindi and Punjabi. No argument about that. But it has at least one link to Latin, too. Here’s a landmark named after the Latin for “higher”— Excelsior.The single screen Cinema Excelsior stands on the main street of the congested Lal Kuan. The film theatre has been closed for many years, and now it exists like those anonymous Lodhi-era tombs littered across the city — it too stirs a fleeting curiosity for a way of life that is no more. This morning, a dog is lounging outside the locked metal grilles. A maze of power cables is hanging just above. The side panels are plastered with old movie posters, so tattered that it feels like they’ve been peeled off, put into a shredder, and pasted back again.Peer through the grilles to see the lobby inside. A splash of colours! Walls in green and grey. Red hoardings outlined in glowing yellow. A narrow staircase snuggling up into a corridor of sea blue.If only it was possible to squeeze through the grills and move about the lobby. It would then be like magically entering into a modernist painter’s three-dimensional art work.There’s also another set of staircase, very broad and imposing, emanating a silence that seems extremely fragile. As if the movie were soon to be over and that hundreds of footsteps were about to thunder on the steps on their way out.But this is only a small portion of the Excelsior, and doesn’t give a complete sense of the cinema hall’s majestic scope. To experience its true scale, you have to walk further ahead and turn left.The narrow alley trundles through a tunnel-like gallery, covered with a pair of arches. It opens into a much wider space, with a view of the theatre spread out to a great distance. The building’s yellow paint coating has faded off at various places, revealing the bricks beneath. A thick tall column graces a small flight of chipped steps — they resemble the segments of those old buildings one finds in the mansions of north Calcutta—evoking that familiar feel of dilapidated aristocracy.An arched window is framed towards the top, but it is blocked up with bricks as if some nihilist wanted to purposely destroy its straightforward beauty.Cinema Excelsior opened in 1938, and shut down in early 2016, according to Ziya Us Salam, author of the book Delhi 4 Shows: Talkies of Yesteryear. The last movie to be screened here was Deewana, he informs.There used to be another single-screen cinema nearby: the Chawri Bazaar Metro station stands in the place of ‘New Amar’.At the moment this alley is empty, save for a very ill-looking, very untidy mud-stained cat sitting atop a lamp post — she is intently watching at a pigeon perched on a power cable. A monkey suddenly appears and the cat escapes by jumping on the theatre’s roof.The cinema’s pediment has its name printed in Urdu script as well as in Roman, or Latin—obviously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-the-tomb-of-a-single-screen/story-A7Op78gtjBXuRjDhspWkeL.html
22-07-2020||India||Holding onto faith in the middle of the pandemic||A pandemic can be a test of God’s existence for man. How do you worship without a church, temple, mosque? What shape does faith take as thousands die of a viral infection every day?Back in his hometown of Bhopal since the first lockdown, Nizamuddin Siddiqui, 32, a senior research fellow at the OP Jindal law school in Haryana, has been watching with interest as his community navigates faith without a functioning mosque amid restrictions imposed for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.All large gatherings, including for religious purposes, have been barred since March. This has meant most temples, mosques, churches, gurudwaras and other places of worship have either been closed or functioning under very changed circumstances.“The masjid is our social and religious centre,” says Siddiqui. “The main challenge for us has been how to keep the mosque alive. You meet your neighbour there five times a day and suddenly there is a void. In future, you may even develop a habit of not going.”The issue is not one of being left without religion, he adds (he prays in his room and has access, via YouTube and WhatsApp, to his religious leaders), but of being left without a community. Even for those who do still go to the mosque, there must be social distancing; ablutions are done at home; talk and interaction are at a minimum.***In Varanasi, a city of over 2,000 temples, religion cannot be seen to be organising itself too differently from pre-lockdown times. A temple is not a museum, it can’t really be closed, says Vishwambhar Nath Mishra, the mahant of Varanasi’s Sankatmochan temple. “And so, my temple is open. I’m available to devotees online,” he says. “The pandemic is for human beings, not for God.”A recent Pew Research survey found that 24% of American adults had felt their faith become stronger during the Covid-19 pandemic; 2% said it had weakened. The majority said their faith hasn’t changed much (47%), and a large number (26%) said the question wasn’t applicable because they were not religious to begin with.The average Indian, says psychoanalyst Ashok Nagpal, has a different alchemy. “For us, religion is a socio-cultural encounter and to be able to replicate old habits maintained through institutions like the family is to be able to draw on inner recesses, and keep hope and faith alive. In times like these, it’s a force that releases new meanings and rituals.”Nagpal points to an interesting development — how the language of the state changed during the pandemic. “In a recent interview, the Delhi CM said no one institution can do everything on its own. That there would be lapses in management and he would learn from criticism and from lived experience. He then added that only thus can we all come together, in collaboration, something religion also preaches. In this way, he brought faith and governance together in secular language.”***For doctors, it is almost always the age of science. On a few occasions, though, Dr Hoshedar Tata, a professor of surgery, invoked god. While emerging from the OT to speak to a patient’s family, he would refer the matter upwards, says his student, Ambarish Satwik, now a surgeon with Gangaram Hospital, Delhi, and a writer. “For a man who was famously antipathetic to any superintending deity, this referral was never done shiftily or casually, but with the highest seriousness, almost as an act of faith,” says Satwik. As the patient’s family would move away, he would then lob at the small congregation of surgery students trailing him, Marx’s line: “‘To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions.’ But we do need to find out, he’d often say, “if God can heal oesophageal anastomosis.”’Gods have been seen as crisis managers through history. The cults of Mariamman, a village goddess of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, coincided with smallpox epidemics in the areas, as did Sitala’s in Bengal in the 17th century. But pandemics are hard to navigate for priests and religious institutions.Surender Shukla, a priest at Trimbakeshwar, Nashik, one of India’s most-visited Hindu pilgrim towns, knows he is in for a long wait. No temple is open in Maharashtra. As numbers rise steadily, months into the pandemic in India, it is unlikely that places of worship will return to anything resembling normalcy for months yet. Pratik Sharma, an event manager and Shiva devotee from Nashik, says he would rather be safe than make the trek to the city’s famed temples; he now prays before a framed image of Shiva at home.Donations have taken a hit, admits Sribash Bhattacharya, secretary of the Kali Mandir Society of Chittaranjan Park, Delhi. “On average, earnings from daily offerings, before the lockdown would be around Rs 2.5 lakh. To make up for low physical attendance, we started the puja online in end June and asked for a minimum of Rs 101 online deposit per person. We have had 489 deposits so far.”People of all faiths are feeling the pinch. Santosh Kambli, a third-generation artist who makes the idol of Lalbaugcha Raja, Mumbai, one of most revered of Ganesh pujas in Maharashtra, says the pandal committee is cancelling its festivities, which were due to begin on August 22, as its puja draws huge crowds. “But Bappa lives at Lalbaug. If you pass the spot, you will feel his aura,” Kambli says.On a YouTube channel, the disembodied voice of Father Stephen can be heard singing a psalm. He is one of three priests holding fort at south Delhi’s St Teresa church. Father Suresh fixes the camera on a stand. Father Julius leads the prayer.“At times, it does feel like a performance,” he says. “But then people start sending messages for prayer requests so you think this has meaning. Earlier 20 people would come for Mass, now 100 people watch live…. There have been requests that we continue this even after things get back to normal.”What does this say about the future of religious institutions and its clergy? Can access to technology, video calls, lead to a new kind of congregation? “These questions are not new,” says Archbishop Anil Couto of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese, Delhi. “Organised religion has always faced the question of an unmediated, private relationship with God but the vibe that I’m getting is that people want to come to a place of worship.”Delhi churches are closed till at least end-July. “The problem is that unlike temple ceremonies where darshan involves people coming and going ours [as in Islam] is worship in a congregation,” says Father Julius.But faith will endure. John Dayal, spokesperson for the All India Catholic Union, says religions and ideologies and persuasions including atheism and agnosticism will survive Covid-19. “This tussle is good. It keeps the quest alive,” he adds.Jasjit Chugh, a practising Sikh, says: “Religious ceremonies require the attendance of people even if you do away with crowds.

22-07-2020||India||GMR, BHEL show interest in private train project||The GMR group, which owns and operates two airports in the country, Bombardier India, Spanish coach and component maker CAF, rail PSUs RITES and Bharat Heavy Electricals are among 16 companies which have shown interest in the private train project, sources said on Tuesday.The other companies include the Hyderabad-based Medha Group, which had bid for the Train 18 project, RK Associates and Railways’ tourism and catering arm IRCTC Sterlite Power, Bharat Forge and JKB Infrastructure, they said.The 16 firms attended a pre-application conference on the private train project held on Tuesday. The Railways has however officially not revealed the names of the companies which participated in the meeting. This is the first initiative of private investment for running passenger trains over the Indian Railway Network. The project would entail private sector investment of about Rs 30,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gmr-bhel-show-interest-in-private-train-project/story-6As6xEfdgwERUAI4cQ9sPI.html
22-07-2020||India||Fall in hospitalisations in 2017-18 compared to 2014||Did Indians get healthier between 2014 and 2017-18? After all fewer Indians reported ailments or required hospitalisation in 2017-18 as compared to 2014. The findings of the latest survey on the state of India’s health by the National Statistical Office shows that the number of Indians reporting ailments dropped by 2.1 percentage points in rural areas and 2.7 percentage points in urban areas between 2014 and 2017-18. These findings are based on ailments reported by people in the 15 days preceding the survey. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();The survey also found that the share of the population admitted to a hospital in the year preceding the survey dropped by nearly one percentage point in both rural and urban areas between 2014 and 2017-18. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Interestingly, the proportion of those reporting ailments and those hospitalised rose between 1995-96 and 2014, according to three NSO surveys on health in this period. Infection was most common ailment It was also the most cited reason for hospitalisation. One in three ailing people reported having suffered an infection. Cardiovascular disease was the second most reported ailment, followed by endocrine and metabolic disorders (body’s over- or under-production of certain hormones and disorders affecting the body’s ability to process certain nutrients and vitamins), and respiratory diseases.Three in four ailing people suffered one of these diseases. However when it comes to hospitalisation,infection was also the leading cause for hospitalisation (31.5% people were hospitalised with an infection). While cardiovascular disease was the second most reported ailment, it was the fourth biggest cause of hospitalisation, trailing injuries and gastrointestinal diseases.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Most do not have health insuranceNearly 86% people in rural India and 81% in urban India are not covered by health insurance . As a result, about four in five Indians pay for hospitalisation out of their household income or savings. Indeed, 13.4% people in rural areas and 8.5% in urban areas borrow money to pay their hospital expenses. These figures significantly vary among states. For example, nearly everyone in rural Goa and 98% people in urban Goa pay for their hospital expenses out of their household income or savings, while only 52% people in rural Andhra Pradesh and 65% in urban Andhra Pradesh use household income or savings. Andhra Pradesh has the highest proportion of people who borrow money to pay for hospital expenses – 28% in rural areas and 16% in urban areas. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Rs16,000-25,000 paid for each hospital visitA single case of hospitalisation costs on average Rs 16,676 in rural India and Rs 26,475 in urban areas. As expected, being admitted in a private hospital costs a lot more than a government hospital – six times more in rural areas and eight times more in urban areas. A spell of hospitalisation in urban areas costs ~38,822 in a private hospital on average, compared to ~4,837 in a government hospital.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Indians spend 7 days in hospital on averageOn average, a person who is hospitalised in India stays admitted for 6.9 days. But a person admitted to a private hospital is likely to stay admitted for a day more than a person admitted to a government hospital. Nearly 71.7% patients in government hospitals and 66.4% in private hospitals are discharged in less than seven days. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();The time spent in a hospital also depends on the kind of ailment a person has. For example, a cancer patient admitted to a hospital spends an average of 13.2 days in the hospital while one with an eye ailment spends only three days. Psychiatric and neurological patients spend the second highest time in hospitals, 8.7 days on average, followed by those admitted with injuries, who spend 8.3 days on average.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Professor Indranil Mukhopadhyay, who teaches public health at Jindal School of Government and Public Policy, said it needs to be studied why the number of people reporting ailments and those being hospitalised has dropped. “It’s very strange and counterintuitive because throughout the world there’s no evidence that utilisation of healthcare has dropped with increasing income and availability of health care,” he said.However, he said one reason for a drop in the number of people reporting ailments could be the seasonality of the survey. “It’s for the first time in two decades that a full round of the health survey was conducted, which means that it was conducted throughout the year unlike six-monthly surveys in the past two rounds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fall-in-hospitalisations-in-2017-18-compared-to-2014/story-w19gRXpFljpcwurBsV4NUO.html
22-07-2020||India||12 held for ostracising health staff in Bengal||Sending a strong message against social ostracism of front-line Covid-19 workers, the West Bengal government arrested 12 persons in separate incidents since Sunday.On Sunday, eight persons, including a government official and his school teacher wife, were held for allegedly harassing a block development officer at Arambagh in Hooghly district.Seven of the them were sent to judicial custody for a week by the court on Monday, while a woman, suffering from a heart ailment, was granted bail. In a separate incident on Tuesday, the police arrested five persons from southwest Kolkata, for allegedly heckling a government doctor, Saikat Basu, and his brother, Sudipta Basu, on Tuesday. A section of the neighbours had asked Saikat to stay indoors or stay away from the locality. When he was going for duty on Tuesday, a few neighbours heckled him and his brother, when he intervened.“This is probably the first time that so many people have been arrested for ostracization,” said a senior police officer, who did not wish to be named.This comes after the Global Advisory Body, headed by Nobel laureate Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee, had urged the West Bengal government to act against persons for ostracizing workers and family members of Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-held-for-ostracising-health-staff-in-bengal/story-kZE17rqbe8ExpEo0T1CwyJ.html
22-07-2020||India||Amarnath Yatra cancelled due to spike in coronavirus infections||The Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board (SABS) on Tuesday cancelled the annual Amarnnath Yatra in the wake of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, which has infected over 1.19 million people across India and affected more than 14,600 people in Jammu & Kashmir.The board is headed by the lieutenant-governor of J&K, Girish Chandra Murmu, who took the decision at the at the 39th meeting of SABS, held through video conference.The Amarnath cave is considered to be one of Hinduism’s holiest shrines, and hundreds of thousands of devotees undertake the annual pilgrimage in the South Kashmir Himalayas.“Based on the prevailing circumstances, the board decided with heavy heart that it is not advisable to hold and conduct this year’s Shri Amarnathji Yatra and expressed its regret to announce the cancellation of Yatra 2020. The board is aware of and respects the sentiments of millions of devotees and to keep the religious sentiments alive. The board shall continue the live telecast/ virtual darshan of the morning and evening aarti. Further, the traditional rituals shall be carried out as per past practice. Also, the Charri Mubarak shall be facilitated by the government,” said an official spokesman.Charri Mubarak is a ritual in which the holy mace of Lord Shiva is taken from Dashnami Akhara temple in Jammu to the holy cave, marking the beginning of pilgrimage.The meeting was attended by chief secretary BVR Subrahmanyam, SABS’s CEO Bipul Pathak, and other senior officers of board. They discussed the Supreme Court order on July 13 that left the decision to conduct the Yatra was left to the state administration after assessing the ground realities; the arrangements for the annual event; and how the pandemic has pushed the health care system to the limit, people aware of the proceedings said.J&K has kept religious places and places of worship closed for the public since the start of the nationwide lockdown in March.Cases have spiked in the region this month, with around 49% of the state’s total cases coming since July 1.The Amarnath Yatra was curtailed in 2019 following inputs of terror threats. The pilgrimage starts in mid-July and goes on till mid-August. On August 5 last year — when the Union government nullified Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution that gave special privileges to Jammu & Kashmir, and converted into two Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh — restrictions were imposed in the region on movement and other daily activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarnath-yatra-cancelled-due-to-spike-in-coronavirus-infections/story-8bxmBaD8mW93ZusNVQST0L.html
22-07-2020||India||Different forms of lockdown across India as cases spike||At least half of India’s population is under various types of lockdowns — full, partial or weekend — according to orders issued by different state governments over the past few days.States such as Bihar, Sikkim, Nagaland are under complete lockdown; West Bengal has announced a two-day lockdown every week, and states such as Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have opted for weekend lockdowns.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageSeveral districts such as Kamrup Metropolitan district in Assam, which includes capital Guwahati, Srikakulam in Andhra Pradesh and Raipur in Chhattisgarh are among 326 districts of the total 734 districts in the country that are under some kind of lockdown. The national lockdown across India was lifted after 68 days from June 1. But the union home ministry has allowed state governments to enforce lockdowns or any other restrictions to control the spread of Covid 19.Since the lifting of the lockdown, the number of Covid cases in the country has almost doubled from 604,993 on June 1 to 1,153,428 on July 20.“Lockdown is not a solution for controlling Covid-19,” Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa said on Tuesday as he ruled out extension of the week-long shutdown in the capital city of Bengaluru and elsewhere. “We were successful at the beginning in controlling the COVID, but in recent days, especially in Bengaluru, COVID cases have increased....I want to tell the people of the state that for the control of the virus, lockdown is not the solution. The solution is wearing masks and maintaining social distancing,” Yediyurappa said.However, some more districts across India enforced complete lockdown to control the spread of Covid on Tuesday.The Ballia district administration in Uttar Pradesh, for instance, decided on Tuesday to extend the lockdown in the district headquarters and adjoining areas till July 26. The lockdown was imposed on July 3. “Following the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the district, the lockdown has been extended till July 26 in district headquarters and adjoining areas,” said District Magistrate Hari Pratap Shahi.Thoubal district in Manipur was put under lockdown till July 27 and urban areas of Durg, Korba, and Bilaspur districts in Chhattisgarh came under lockdown restrictions from Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/different-forms-of-lockdown-across-india-as-cases-spike/story-8d6KnHwVi2nV5VBaDZWZMP.html
22-07-2020||India||15 per cent population may have virus antibodies, says private lab data||A new analysis by a private laboratory has indicated that nearly 15% of the country’s population may have developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.Thyrocare, a private diagnostic laboratory shared data from 60,000 antibody tests across 600 pincodes that it conducted over 20 days. Of those 15% tested positive for antibodies. Dr A Velumani, Promoter, Chairman, Managing Director and CEO of Thyrocare had tweeted on July 17 that 180 million Indians may have been already silently immunised in India. “Too good to believe. Hope kits do not have high false positives.”According to Thyrocare’s data the highest positivity rate for the antibody test is in Bhiwandi, Thane at 47.1% . The lowest positivity rate was found to be in Alibag in Maharashtra at 0.7%.Thyrocare used Elisa (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and Chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) antibody tests to arrive at the findings.Independent experts said the findings cannot be generalised. According to the ICMR’s (Indian Council of Medical Research) antibody testing survey, less than 1% of the population – 0.73%--in non-containment zone districts was found to have contracted Covid 19. That was conducted in mid-May.Interestingly, the Thyrocare findings are in sync with the results of an antibody testing survey in Delhi that were released Tuesday and showed that 22.86% of the population has been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. “Its good that a private laboratory has conducted as many as 60,000 antibody tests. ICMR had conducted around 20,000. However, the numbers are too low to generalise. I don’t know if most representative areas are covered and population heterogeneity is also a factor,” said Amit Singh, associate professor, Centre for Infectious Disease Research, IISc, Bengaluru.“From the list of areas it appears that the focus has been urban or semi-urban areas. We cannot generalise the findings for rural areas. Johns Hopkins says 70% of the population should grow antibodies for herd immunity. So what is the significance of these findings?” asked Dr Shobha Broor, former head, microbiology department, AIIMS, Delhi.“We considered random tests conducted between June 28 and July 19 in only those areas where we have conducted at least 50 tests. I have shared the data with ICMR. By July 30, I expect to do 1.2 lakh tests which will give us a clearer picture,” said Velumani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/15-per-cent-population-may-have-virus-antibodies-says-private-lab-data/story-mUddIj9kxI4vRzYu4KMUiI.html
22-07-2020||India||Ministry warns against public use of N-95 masks with valves||The Union health ministry on Monday warned against the “inappropriate” use of N-95 masks, particularly those with valve respirators, by people other than designated health workers. Dr Rajiv Garg, the director general of health services, wrote to principal secretaries (health) of all states and union territories (UTs), and national health mission directors in this regard. “It is to bring to your knowledge that the use of valved respirator N-95 masks is detrimental to the measures adopted for preventing the spread of coronavirus as it does not prevent the virus from escaping out of the mask. In view of the above, I request you to instruct all concerned to follow the guidelines on the use of face mouth cover and prevent inappropriate use of N95 masks,” the letter read.Dr Shobha Broor, former head, microbiology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, said, “The masks with valves were widely used to prevent air pollution exposure. But it is not suited for Covid-19 because during expiration, droplets can leak out, infecting other people.”Using N-95 masks with valves is recommended when pollution levels are high because they do not allow carbon dioxide to accumulate inside the face cover, experts said. But the same valve — used for exhalation — could act as an easy passage for germs and endanger those in close proximity if the user has an infection.The government, in April, had issued an advisory on the use of home-made protective cover for face and mouth, asking people to wear it, particularly when they step out of their residences.The advisory stressed that such face covers must be washed and cleaned daily, and recommended the use of used cotton cloth to make these covers. The colour of the fabric does not matter but one must ensure that the fabric is washed well in boiling water for five minutes and dried well before making the face cover. Adding salt to this water is recommended, it said.Listing the procedure and condition for home-made masks, the advisory stated that masks must fit the face perfectly and that no gaps are left on the sides.The advisory urged people to wash hands thoroughly before wearing the face covers, switching to another fresh one if the face cover becomes damp or humid, and never reusing it after single use without cleaning it. “Never share the face cover with anyone. Every member in a family should have separate face cover,” the advisory stated.(with inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ministry-warns-against-public-use-of-n-95-masks-with-valves/story-CM2b8yKcrD4U1SZ4gRAMXI.html
22-07-2020||India||HC to give Rajasthan order on Friday, asks Speaker to defer move||Former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and 18 rebel lawmakers from the Congress who are loyal to him won protection from possible disqualification proceedings till July 24, with the Rajasthan high court reserving its verdict on their challenge of these proceedings till then. The decision is bound to heighten uncertainty in the state where the Congress government has a wafer-thin majority after the rebellion. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has hardened his stance against his rival and former deputy Pilot, terming him good for nothing, much to the discomfiture of some members of the party’s central leadership who are still hoping that Pilot can be mollified. The disqualification notices were issued on July 14 by Assembly speaker CP Joshi.A division bench of chief justice Indrajit Mahanty and justice Prakash Gupta reserved its verdict on Tuesday after hearing the case over three days.It also directed the speaker to defer action on the notices till July 24. Pilot and other MLAs had approached the high court on July 15 challenging the speaker’s notices that asked them to furnish an explanation by July 17 on why they should not be disqualified from the assembly for their conduct, which Congress party has alleged is detrimental to the interest of the party and shows their intention to quit the party. The speaker’s notice was based on the disqualification petition filed by chief whip Mahesh Joshi, who in his plea, cited the absence of the MLAs from two Congress Legislature Party meetings -- held on July 13 and 14 -- despite instructions to attend, which showed their intention to leave the party. The chief whip also cited statements made by some of the MLAs and their allegedly hostile conduct against the party as grounds of their intention to quit the party. Pilot and other dissident MLAs have maintained that they never intended to leave the Congress party and were merely exercising their right to criticize the functioning of the CM. Arguing for the MLAs, Mukul Rohatgi challenged the speaker’s notice stating that his action reeked of bad faith since the notice was issued to the MLAs without any application of mind and on the very same day the chief whip filed his complaint.“Consummate reading of these facts leaves no manner of doubt that the decision (to suspend MLAs) is a foregone conclusion. What was the tearing hurry?” he demanded. Rohatgi also pointed out that the Speaker gave the MLAs only three days to respond to the notice which also stated that the disqualification plea would be decided ex-parte (without hearing the MLAs) if they failed to respond in writing within the prescribed deadline.“No reasons were recorded for issuing the notice”, he said.Senior counsel Devadatt Kamat appearing for speaker rebutted this, stating that reasons are not required to be furnished as per the assembly rules.The Speaker has maintained throughout that the petition by Pilot is pre-mature since, as per the 1992 SC judgment in the Kihoto Hollohan case, the court can interfere only after the Speaker decides the disqualification petition. Rohatgi asked the court to distinguish the current case from the Kihoto Hollohan case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-to-give-rajasthan-order-on-friday-asks-speaker-to-defer-move/story-KCJeT6Z02yVuzAdVo1jWYK.html
22-07-2020||India||Live screens, shifts in House Covid-19 plan||Giant screens, engineers from the National Informatics Centre (NIC) on call, provisions for possible latency — these are among the issues Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and their teams are wrestling with as they finalise plans to hold sittings of the Lok Sabha across both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha chambers to meet the requirement of social distancing made necessary by the Covid-19 pandemic. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe plan is to stagger timings of the two Houses so that they never sit simultaneously, and hold sittings of each across both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. The exact timings of each House have not been finalised yet. HT learns that the government is likely to call the session after August 15. Also part of the plan are fibreglass or plexiglass sheets between seats, reduced workforce across the Parliament complex, working over weekends to ensure the Houses can sit for enough time, inputs from multiple ministries, teething technical troubles and countless queries—all part of an ongoing, mammoth exercise to hold Indian Parliament’s monsoon session in these uncertain times.With 770 seats across the two Houses, India has the world’s fourth-largest Parliament by number of lawmakers after the UK, Italy and France. Holding a session is such a big affair that Naidu and Birla have already met six times to strategise. Both are familiar with every small detail of Parliament complex, but they undertook field visits to physically check how MPs could sit across different areas.The ministries of home affairs, health, urban development, and civil aviation and CPWD were consulted in the last few weeks, a top functionary added, as aspects related to logistics, security, and health were worked out. Seating arrangement The Lok Sabha MPs will sit in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha chambers, the galleries of both houses, and the Central hall. Similarly, the Upper House MPs will be divided between the two Houses and the galleries. The Lok Sabha has 529 members. The Rajya Sabha has 242. The Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha chambers can accommodate 60 and 158 lawmakers respectively if strict social distancing norms are followed. The galleries of the Upper House (barring the press gallery) can seat another 67 MPs. The Lok Sabha galleries can seat 132. That works out to a total of 417 spots, enough to seat the Rajya Sabha members. The remaining Lok Sabha members will be seated in the Central Hall — typically, these will be members with no business in the House. Central Hall can seat another 190. A second functionary said that Central Hall will largely be treated as a “buffer area”, which means it will be filled last, and only with people who do not need to be in the House to conduct some business. A third functionary added that the expectation is that attendance will not exceed 420, which means that the hall will not be needed. Vigyan Bhawan, another prospective venue that can hold at last 200 MPs, was ruled out as it has facility for telecasting live proceedings, and it will be difficult for MPs and ministers to shuttle between Parliament and Vigyan Bhavan through the day.An idea for the Houses to sit on alternate days was shot down as it would have meant a longer stay for MPs from other states in Delhi. A Rajya Sabha official said that Naidu “has even received suggestions to hold proceedings on Saturdays and Sundays. MPs told him since there will not be much to do (outside the House), it is better that the House sits on weekends too, so that the session can be wrapped up early.”Health concerns On a typical day, around 3500 people visit Parliament complex. That will come down. “We decided only those who are absolutely essential for the daily proceedings would be allowed to enter. It means reduced staff for ministers, select visitors and limited parliament officials,” said the top functionary.In addition to fibreglass or plexiglass dividers in the House chambers, the health plan also includes jet-sprays with disinfectants that will be used in public spaces and on vehicles, hand sanitizers that are placed across Parliament complex, more medical staff and additional ambulances to attend to emergencies. Birla and Naidu are aware that if any lawmaker tests positive after attending Parliament, they will come in for criticism and are ensuring that every precaution is taken, the second functionary said.Technical issues As the plan to sit across two Houses was being crystallised, officials pointed out to Naidu that there would be latency and that if a Rajya Sabha member seated in the Lok Sabha chamber said something, it would reach Naidu and the Upper House’s system with a fractional lag. So, the proceedings might get slower this time as both the chair and the members will need to provide for these lags. NIC, the government’s IT arm, will send engineers who will sit in both Houses and supervise the live proceedings that will be shown in giant screens in both Houses. The NIC officials will also help presiding officers mute members in the other chamber. And the interpreters of each House will sit in their respective Houses and interpret for members looking at live proceedings in one House and at the screen in the other.Naidu is also in touch with senior Opposition leaders such as Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, The main subject of discussion is the pandemic’s trajectory, especially in Delhi. The possible peak of infections may eventually settle the fate of the monsoon session of Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/live-screens-shifts-in-house-covid-plan/story-07lZ8xsePmmSNxNqdCvgUJ.html
22-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The math was always in favour of a vaccine being developed.A June article in the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH) cited an earlier paper by Chi Heem Wong, Kien Wei Siah and Andrew W Lo to show that vaccines for infectious diseases have a 33.4% chance of successfully traversing the various phases of a clinical trial. Once it clears the pre-clinical stage, a vaccine for an infectious disease (and Covid-19 is one) according to the article has a 76.8% chance of clearing Phase 1 trials and entering Phase 2. The success rate drops off a bit in Phase 2, to 58.2%, but it picks up in Phase 3 (which is understandable) to 85.4%.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage The calculations presented in the paper are not probabilities that can be multiplied – which means the probabilities of success in each of the phases can’t be multiplied to arrive at the final success rate, which makes it difficult to predict the success of trials that combine two phases. Many of the Covid-19 vaccine candidates are doing this, in an effort to reduce the development time. But given that there at least four very promising candidates that are now in or entering Phase 2/3 trials (the ones from Moderna, Oxford-Astra Zeneca, Cansino, and Pfizer-BioNTech), the chances of success are definitely much higher than 33.4%. This writer’s opinion is that the probability could be as high as 50%. And a one-in-two chance doesn’t sound bad at all.According to the World Health Organization, there are around 160 vaccine candidates in development, with 20 already being tested on humans. Monday’s news from Oxford-AstraZeneca and Cansino -- that their candidates produced immune reactions in subjects, didn’t cause any significant adverse effects, and produced both antibodies and T-cells (the first attack the virus; the second attack infected cells, and they also remember how the infection looks and react similarly the next time) -- is more than anyone could have hoped for. There’s no doubt that the first vaccine for Covid-19 will be here soon, perhaps even by the end of the year (both AstraZeneca and one of its partners, India’s Serum Institute, have started work on manufacturing the vaccine – in anticipation of it clearing Phase 2/3 trials).That’s the good news.But there’s still a lot we don’t know yet. We do not know what the correct dosage is. Based on the studies released Monday by Cansino and Oxford-AstraZeneca – both used two shots of the vaccine – it is likely that the first vaccines for Covid-19 will be double-shot ones, which makes not just production but also the vaccination process that that much more complex. We do not know how long the vaccine can protect someone from the virus. We do not yet know about the long-term side effects (if any) of the vaccines that look so promising (but which have only been tested for weeks). And we do not know if it will protect everyone the same way – especially across race and age.All of these mean that the hope we feel at the initial success needs to be tinged with caution, even as we cheer the companies racing to develop a vaccine.Vaccine development has traditionally been a risky business – not just because of the success rate, but also because the timelines involved (8-10 years) meant that developers were taking a big chance that the disease targeted by the vaccine would still be relevant (and a problem) a decade into the future. From that perspective, the reduced development timelines for the Covid-19 vaccines lessens the risk to some extent. And scattered antibody tests carried out around the world indicate that the disease hasn’t been prevalent enough to cause herd immunity.On Tuesday, the results of one such survey for Delhi were released (see here).They showed that 22.86% (after adjusting for sensitivity and specificity of the tests) of a random sample of 21,387 people surveyed across Delhi’s 11 districts between June 27 and July 10 had antibodies to Sars-Cov-2, showing that they had been infected at some stage. That’s a high proportion, although a similar survey in New York returned a similar number, 19.3%. Even assuming a five percentage point error margin in the Delhi sero survey, this means at least 17.86% of the Capital’s population may have been infected.We do not know enough about Covid-19 to infer what kind of immunity this confers on someone – temporary or permanent. And if it is the first, how temporary? At 17.86%, the number of cases in Delhi works out to 3.54 million (the number of reported cases is 123,747). Delhi has seen 3,663 deaths on account of Covid-19 till Monday. The death rate works out to a little less than 0.1%. That’s exactly the same as the death rate for the common flu in the US. Which could mean one of two things – we have significantly undercounted the number of dead; or Covid-19 isn’t as dangerous as it was originally thought (see page 4).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-ILuSl2AxHQusKw3VzrUPnJ.html
22-07-2020||India||Maharashtra to start rapid antibody tests soon||To gauge the spread of Covid-19, the state government plans to start rapid antibody tests from August. The state health officials will zero in on the kit by the end of the next week, while a four-member committee has been formed to analyse the accuracy of the available antibody testing kits. In Maharashtra, more than 3 lakh people have been infected with Covid-19 since its outbreak in March. Medical experts believe that as 80% of the patients are asymptomatic, a large number of the silent carriers are not accounted for. To identify such people, the Indian Council Medical Research (ICMR) has given the state government permission to start rapid antibody testing. Antigens are molecules that stimulate an immune response. Antibodies (immunoglobulins) are Y-shaped proteins produced by the immune system in response to exposure to antigens. An antigen test reveals if a person is currently infected with a pathogen, while the antibody test tells if he was infected over the month. “Just like the national sero survey, the kits will be used for identification of people carrying the antibodies for Sars-Cov-2 that causes the infection. Unlike the rapid antigen kits, the antibody kits will not be used for diagnosis of patients,” said Dr Sudhakar Shinde, chief executive officer of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana.In the first week, Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies are produced and gradually, the body starts developing IgG antibodies that stay in the blood for almost a month. “Depending on the types of antibodies and their concentration, we can estimate if the person is in the early stage of infection or the stage of recovery,” said Dr Lancelot Pinto, an epidemiologist from Hinduja Hospital. By the end of next week, the state will decide which testing kit is to be used. A four-member committee headed by Dr Shinde will test all available antibody test kits and send their findings to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for approval. “There are so many testing kits which have been recently developed by different companies and scientists. We will run tests on all those kits to find its accuracy. There are several determinants and parameters,” he said. Dr Ranjit Mankeshwar, JJ Hospital’s dean, who is also part of the committee, said the kit will mostly be used among frontline warriors. “As it is not a diagnostic tool, it will mostly be used among doctors, volunteers who are involved in screening, treatment and contact tracing. We are yet to decide if the kit will be used for mass screening in containment zones,” he said. In April, the central government had procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody testing kits from China. The Maharashtra government procured 75,000 for testing. But before the process could begin, the Central government withdrew the kits after some of them were found faulty. According to experts, although antibody testings don’t give 100% accurate results, it can be useful to understand the pattern of the spread of the virus and surveillance among the population. “Antibody testing gives false reports too, but it can help in analysis of a larger community. It is not a perfect science, but can be helpful in a population with a large number of asymptomatic patients,” said Dr Om Srivastava, city epidemiologist and a part of the state task force for Covid-19.Antigen and antibody testAntigens are molecules that stimulate an immune response. Antibodies (immunoglobulins ) are Y-shaped proteins produced by the immune system in response to exposure to antigens. The first antibody produced is Immunoglobulin M (IgM). After seven-14 days of the exposure, the second antibody, Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is produced, which stays in the body for a long period.An antibody test reveals if a person was exposed to an infection, by detecting the type of antibodies in the blood. If the test is done too early, before the antibodies are produced, the result may be negative. An antigen test reveals if a person is currently infected with a pathogen. Once the infection is cured, the antigen disappears, but antibodies remain in the body for a month. “As it is not a diagnostic tool, it will mostly be used among doctors, volunteers who are involved in screening, treatment and contact-tracing,” said Dr Ranjit Mankeshwar, JJ Hospital’s dean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-to-start-rapid-antibody-tests-soon/story-cLKh5xMjUYXQGabYkwlt4J.html
22-07-2020||India||Jammu and Kashmir crosses 15,000-mark in 145 days with 608 new Covid-19 cases||Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday recorded nine Covid-related deaths and 608 positive cases, taking the UT’s tally to 15,258, officials said. The UT has crossed the 15,000 mark in 145 days.Of the new positive cases, 502 are from Kashmir and 106 from Jammu division. Among these, 87 patients have a travel history to affected regions. Officials said nine more people had succumbed to the disease, all of them in Kashmir. With this, the death toll in the UT has risen to 263, with 243 fatalities reported in Kashmir and 20 in Jammu division till date.The UT, particularly Kashmir valley, is witnessing an increase in death toll and infections for the past one month. As many as 162 people have died in the last 21 days alone. The J&K government has collected 14,002 samples of labourers arriving at Qazigund toll post between July 14 to 20 for Covid-19 testing. Of these, as per official sources, 113 non-local labourers have tested positive for the novel coronavirus so far while reports of thousands of people are still awaited. The influx of labourers has triggered concern among health officials. They say the influx will stretch the already overburdened health services and infrastructure in the Valley.Kashmir divisional commissioner Pandurang K Pole on Tuesday said all incoming migrant labourers will undergo Covid-19 testing in their respective districts from July 23.Three-member team formed“The laborers will be tested in the respective districts of work,” he said and has directed all DCs to constitute three-member teams and train them for smooth conduct of antigen testing of all laborers.Active cases in the UT stand at 6,540 after 181 more patients recovered on Tuesday. A government spokesperson said 36 people were discharged in Jammu division and 145 in Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-crosses-15-000-mark-in-145-days-with-608-new-cases/story-8fDWjDsCrMh8Rh6PO0GG9K.html
22-07-2020||India||Positivity rate of antigen tests in Delhi: 6.33%||Around 6.33% of the people tested using rapid antigen kits in Delhi were infected with Covid-19, according to the data by the union health ministry. A total of 336,172 people were tested using the method between June 18—when it was rolled out in Delhi—and July 21, said Rajesh Bhushan, officer on special duty, health ministry, in a press briefing.However, at least 348 infected people did not test positive by this point-of-care method that can give results within 15 minutes. Only about 0.7% of people who exhibited symptoms similar to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) were re-tested using the gold standard RT-PCR test.“Of those who were found negative, 2,294 symptomatic people underwent an RT-PCR test. And, 348 or nearly 15% of these samples tested positive,” said Bhushan.The test is highly specific—99.3% to 100%—meaning anyone who tests positive using the kit definitely has the infection. However, with a lower sensitivity—50.6% to 84%, depending on the viral load—the test may throw up a false negative for people who might have the infection.Hence, the testing protocol states that any symptomatic person who tests negative has to be retested. There are chances, however, of some asymptomatic positive cases being missed.“What this shows is that the rapid antigen test is not as sensitive as the RT-PCR test; it is rapid and scalable but cannot replace RT-PCR. Having said that, states where a higher number of cases are being reported cannot depend solely on the time-consuming RT-PCR, as the turnaround time would be very long and there would be delays in measures to be taken. Now, even pooling of samples [a method where tissue sample pools are created by pooling a certain number of randomly selected tissue samples (of the same population) together] isn’t helping as most pools are testing positive,” said Amit Singh, associate professor, Centre for Infectious Disease Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru.“To check the results on field, the government can try testing via RT-PCR tests and rapid antigen method simultaneously for some samples to see how many positive cases are being missed. In Delhi, the decline in the number of cases coincides with the picking up of the rapid antigen tests; more than 50% of the tests are done using this method,” said Singh.Others, however, said that quickly detecting even some of the positive cases can help reduce the total burden of the infection.“The rapid antigen tests are used to quickly test a huge number of people, which would never have been possible with just an RT-PCR test. Now, for example, if 20 persons among a 1,000 are missed out, a successive RT-PCR will detect, say, 17 of these cases. Even if we miss the three people, we are still doing better because all the 20 people might have been missed if the testing had not been scaled up. Testing and isolating people early on helps reduce the further spread of the infection,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.In Delhi, initially, the tests were restricted to people living in containment zones, then expanded to hospitals, and are now available in dispensaries as well.The kits come with a sterile swab, an extraction tube, a viral lysis buffer to break open the cells for the test, and a Covid-19 antigen test device. Once the sample is collected, it has to be placed in the extraction tube that inactivates the virus reducing the bio-safety requirements. Once the sample is mixed properly, it is stable only for an hour. The cap of the extraction tube has to be replaced by a nozzle and 2-3 drops of the solution have to be put in the test well. The test can be interpreted between 15 and 30 minutes.Delhi casesDelhi recorded 1,349 fresh Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, taking the city’s tally to over 1.25 lakh, while the death toll mounted to 3,690, authorities said.After reporting new cases in the range of 1,000 to 2,000 for nine consecutive days, fresh infections in the national capital had dipped to 954 on Monday.Twenty-seven fatalities were recorded in the last 24 hours, according to a Delhi health department bulletin issued on Tuesday.The number of active cases stood at 15,288, marginally up from 15,166 on Monday.The national capital had reported its highest single-day spike of 3,947 on June 23.The Tuesday bulletin said the death toll due to Covid-19 has risen to 3,690 and the total number of cases have mounted to 1,25,096.The death toll stood at 3,663 on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/positivity-rate-of-antigen-tests-in-delhi-6-33/story-0nW7jsM64qztwsldrtXDcP.html
22-07-2020||India||Sero survey shows 23 per cent may have been Covid positive in Capital||Close to one in four people in Delhi may have been exposed to the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19, the results of government-conducted blood sampling across the Capital indicated on Tuesday -- findings that prompted experts to suggest the city may have surmounted the peak of the epidemic, and could potentially alter the city’s response mechanism to combat the pandemic.The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) tested 21,387 people at random from across Delhi between June 27 and July 10 and results announced on Tuesday showed that 23.48% of these had antibodies for the virus in their blood. Adjusting for false positives and negatives based on the performance of the kit, 22.86% of the population may have been exposed to the virus, officials announced. “The implications can be interpreted both ways; the positive side to it is that the city has definitely crossed its peak as far as Covid is concerned, and that the fear of case explosion in the city that we were grappling with a month or so ago is gone,” said Dr Sujeet Singh, the head of NCDC, in an interview to HT. He added, however, that the numbers also illustrate that about 77% of the city is still vulnerable and people cannot afford to lower their guard and abandon precautionary measures such as social distancing or wearing masks.If the findings are extrapolated to the estimated 19.98 million population of the national capital, the 22.86% translates to 4.53 million people who may have been infected by the Sars-Cov-2 virus and recovered, potentially building an immune response that – at least in the short term – protects them from reinfection.The statistics also have an implication for how deadly Covid-19 is believed to be. To date, the Capital has recorded 125,096 confirmed cases and 3,690 deaths, translating to a fatality ratio (in this case, known as case fatality ratio) of 2.95%. But if the number of actual cases is taken to be 4.53 million, the fatality rate comes to 0.08%. The 22.86% would have likely grown since July 10, the last day when samples were collected. A growing number of people who may be protected from infection is crucial for the epidemiological phenomenon known as herd immunity, in which an infectious disease stops spreading in a population if it does not find adequate number of vulnerable people. Experts have put this number between 40% and 65% for a disease like Covid-19.“The findings are suggestive of infection during mid-June, and since then we have seen a decent increase in the number of cases that means more people are exposed to the virus, and the disease prevalence could be higher. Also, it wasn’t a door-to-door sample collection that also means about 5-10% of the population probably was missed. If you factor in all these variables then the prevalence should easily be around 40%, which is good,” said Jugal Kishore, head, community medicine department, Safdarjung Hospital.“It also means the susceptible population is going down, which suggests that epidemic is moving downwards towards its end,” he added.The findings come a day after peer-reviewed studies showed two vaccine candidates were safe and effective, including the one developed by UK’s Oxford University that is largely seen as the front runner. “The biggest silver lining for me is that if we have such high population that was exposed in past but did not largely display serious symptoms or succumbed then it as good as a vaccine,” said NCDC’s Singh.There are, however, still several unanswered questions.“Since these many people have developed antibodies, there will be some immunity against the disease; however, what is pertinent to determine is the level of immunity; whether there will be reinfection among recovered patients, or will there be longer immunity against it,” he added. The results are being studied by the Delhi government to determine if there needs to be a change in strategy. “This captures the state of recovery from Covid-19 infection in mid-June, which is a month ago. We will consult with public health experts and epidemiologists to determine if the future course of Delhi’s strategy against Covid-19 should change in light of these survey results or not,” Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office said in a statement on Tuesday. In an interview to HT on Saturday, Kejriwal had said he was eagerly awaiting the results because they would indicate that the public was approaching the herd immunity level. “I am anxiously awaiting the results of the survey -- the findings will indicate to what extent the virus has spread. And, most importantly, whether Delhi is inching towards herd immunity,” he said.The Union health ministry on Tuesday said that the findings showed “only 23.48% of the people are affected in Delhi, which has several pockets of dense population”. “However, a significant proportion of the population is still vulnerable. Therefore, the containment measures need to continue with the same rigour,” it added.A serological test involves collection of blood of individuals to check for the prevalence of IgG antibodies that develop roughly around a week after infection and can be detected for months. Delhi’s results mirror findings in other cities with large outbreaks, such as New York city. In a study published by researchers from Mount Sinai Hospital on June 29, around 19.3% of people in the city had been exposed to the virus through April 19. New York city, like Delhi was in India, was one of the first hot spots in the United States. It has now brought its infection under control while new clusters pop up across the country, similar to the case with Delhi and rest of India.The findings of any serological study into Covid-19, however, is subject to reliability of the test. According to an advisory by the United States’ Centers for Disease Control updated on June 30, a positive antibody test may also mean that a person has “antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses (called coronaviruses), such as the one that causes the common cold”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sero-survey-shows-23-may-have-been-covid-ve-in-capital/story-KWjeR7r13onM4KoqeGRjXN.html
22-07-2020||India||Govt tells makers of apps to stick to ban or face action||The Union government has asked the makers of 59 mobile applications from mostly China-based companies to comply with its ban order or risk further action, reminding them it is illegal for them to remain accessible in India in any manner.The apps were banned in late June and the government cited concerns to national security. The move came in the middle of unprecedented tensions with China following the first deadly military confrontation between the two countries earlier that month.According to an official who asked not to be named, the communication follows up on a set of questions sent to these developers about the location of centres and the data collection they carry out.The ministry of electronics and information technology (Meity) has now conveyed that “if we come across any instances where you are not banned, or still accessible or available in the territory of India, then action will be taken against you in compliance with the company law,” the official, who asked not to be named, told HT citing the letter sent to these developers.The government on June 29 banned TikTok, CamScanner and UC Browser among these 59, saying they were prejudicial to sovereignty, integrity and security of the country. At least some of these companies, such as TikTok which had a wide userbase in the country, shut down their services shortly after the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-tells-makers-of-apps-to-stick-to-ban-or-face-action/story-0RQLdV6ss2f9HXPD3GaI4O.html
22-07-2020||India||After antigen test came negative, Odisha official dies of Covid-19||An additional district magistrate of Odisha’s Covid hot spot Gajapati district died of Covid on Tuesday.Karunakar Raika quarantined himself after developing Covid-like symptoms six days ago, but his condition turned serious on Monday after which he was given oxygen. The 55-year-old officer was in charge of the Covid hospital and Covid care centres in Gajapati that has recorded 718 cases and five deaths.An antigen test and a TrueNat test of his swab sample were taken on Tuesday morning but came back negative, officials said. An antigen test looks for the presence of a foreign molecule that induces an immune response in the body while a TrueNat test is a mobile version of the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test that tests for the presence of the Sars-Cov-2 virus.After both tests results came negative despite Covid-like symptoms, swab for an RT-PCR test was sent to the MKCG Medical College and Hospital in Berhampur town. The RT-PCR test result came on Tuesday evening and confirmed the presence of Sars-Cov-2 virus in the body, said Gajapti district collector Anupam Saha.Epidemiologists said it is quite possible for an antigen test and TrueNat test to produce a false negative. “Since in antigen testing the virus or its genetic material is not amplified, the swab sample may have too little antigen to be detected. This could produce a false negative result. Similarly, in TrueNat test, the portable chip-based diagnostic machine detects an enzyme called RdRp that is found in the RNA of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. However, ICMR has cautioned that it’s not always accurate. The RT-PCR is still the gold standard of Covid-19 test,” said Dr Binod Patro, a senior epidemiologist of AIIMS, Bhubaneswar.In May, the ICMR revised its testing guidelines to allow the use of the TrueNAT system for confirmation of Covid-19. In TrueNat system, a computer chip detects the Sars-CoV-2 gene in the swab.The death of the officer came as the total number of Covid deaths in Odisha climbed past 100 and the total infections stood at 18,757. Though the state government imposed lockdown in hot spots of Ganjam, Khurda, Cuttack, Jajpur districts and Rourkela Municipal Corporation area since July 17 and weekend lockdowns in 19 districts, cases have spiraled in recent weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-antigen-test-came-negative-odisha-official-dies-of-covid-19/story-mexn2sUk81IzitVOmbpWeJ.html
22-07-2020||India||Contempt case against Bhushan over tweets||New Delhi The Supreme Court has initiated suo moto criminal contempt proceedings against advocate Prashant Bhushan over his tweets about the judiciary.The petition is listed for hearing on Wednesday before a bench comprising Justices Arun Mishra, BR Gavai and Krishna Murari.While Bhushan has been named as the first contemnor, the suo moto contempt has also been initiated against the Indian arm of Twitter, Twitter Communications India Private Limited with its registered office at Bandra (East) in Mumbai.It wasn’t immediately clear which tweet or tweets by Bhushan provoked the contempt action against him. Bhushan has made tweets critical of the court and some of its judges on two instances. HT is not reproducing the contents of these in the event that they are not the matter of judicial scrutiny. The suo moto contempt petition was registered by the Court Registry on July 9.Advocate Prashant Bhushan speaking to HT said, “It is quite early to say anything. Let us wait till the Court issues notice. At present it is mere speculation that the Court has possibly issued notice on my CJI on Motorcycle tweet or an earlier tweet where I said about the role of past CJIs in destroying democracy without a formal emergency.”Bhushan faces two other contempt petitions in the apex court. One was filed against him in 2010 by senior advocate Harish Salve acting as Amicus Curiae (friend of the Court). Bhushan in an interview to Tehelka magazine, published in September 2010, alleged that in his view half of the past 16 CJIs were corrupt. He also criticised former CJI Justice SH Kapadia for deciding the Niyamgiri mining case involving Vedanta/Sterlite despite holding shares in Sterlite.It now emerges that this petition, which was last heard by the top court on May 2, 2012 has been listed on Friday for hearing before the same bench that is to take up Wednesday’s criminal contempt case. The contempt petition was held maintainable by a three-judge bench on November 10, 2010 following which the case was heard on 17 occasions. Interestingly, Bhushan’s father and former Law Minister Shanti Bhushan filed an application bringing on record the instances of corruption against six CJIs. This was produced in a sealed cover ; the Court is yet to open the seal.The other contempt petition against Bhushan was filed in March 2019 by the present Attorney General KK Venugopal and the Union of India through Secretary to the Government , C Chandramouli. In their separate contempt petitions, they highlighted a February 1, 2019 tweet by Bhushan alleging that the Government misled the Court about the appointment of M Nageswara Rao as interim Director of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). That matter too is being heard by a bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra.As the appointment of Nageswara Rao was challenged by Bhushan in a PIL, the A-G informed the Court that the High Powered Committee of January 10, 2019 took the decision to appoint Rao. Countering this, Bhushan tweeted that he spoke to Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge, one of the Selection Committee members, who confirmed to him that the decision on Rao’s appointment was not taken by the committee.During the proceedings, Bhushan accepted that he made a “genuine mistake” on his part and apologized to the Court. A-G Venugopal agreed to withdraw his contempt plea. Meanwhile, Bhushan filed an application seeking Justice Mishra’s recusal from the case on the grounds that he did not expect to get a fair hearing from Justice Mishra in the contempt case. Following this, the centre remained firm that the contempt plea should not be dropped. The court decided to examine whether it was open for anyone to criticize the court proceedings in order to influence public opinion and to what extent this affects the rights of litigants and administration of justice. The matter was last heard in April 2019.Bhushan refused to comment on both the contempt petitions pending against him since March 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/contempt-case-against-bhushan-over-tweets/story-CWH5Wzbd4xiT94vqDt0X2N.html

Since large scale gatherings and meetings with many people in attendance are not allowed for sometime, the Sangh will shift focus on smaller, regional meetings,” said a functionary.The Sangh leadership is expected to hold discussions on the recent national and international issues including the India-China face-off; bilateral relations with Nepal, the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on economy and jobs and the upcoming Bhoomi Pujan in Ayodhya that will mark the beginning of the Ram Temple construction, the persons aware of the details said.Economy and the employment sector are expected to be the area of focus at the three-day meeting, which will be attended by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and seven other top functionaries. A senior functionary said, the Sangh is concerned by the severe impact that the pandemic has had on economy, particularly the small and micro manufacturing sectors. “Job losses and winding up of business have been a fallout of the pandemic, but the Sangh leadership is keen that the government should offer help to the small and micro sectors to revive. This was also discussed ahead of the government’s announcement of an aatmanirbhar package. There will be further discussions based on the feedback from the ground on the steps that can be taken to ensure production is back on rails,” said the functionary. The Sangh and its affiliates have already lauded the government’s efforts to cut dependence on China and have been aggressively pushing for scaling indigenous production. It has also backed India’s response to China. RSS general secretary, Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi, in an interview to a Sangh publication said the people of this country will support the current dispensation on steps being taken on the standoff between India and China along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh.On whether the Sangh has any concerns about the upcoming Ram Temple in Ayodhya, a second functionary said there are no differences between the Sangh and the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust.Since March, when the Sangh cancelled the meeting of its highest decision making body, the Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha in the wake of the pandemic, this is the first formal meeting of the functionaries. In June, meetings between a few functionaries including RSS general secretary and BJP functionaries were held in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-top-brass-begins-3-day-meet-in-bhopal/story-8lHtHWNwpCYGIvToO5BHoJ.html
22-07-2020||India||Mamata kicks off election campaign with virtual rally||Gujarat cannot rule all states in the country and Trinamool Congress (TMC) will return to power through a historic victory in the 2021 Bengal assembly polls, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said at a virtual rally on Tuesday. Flagging off her election campaign a year before the polls, Banerjee focused her attack solely on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Centre.Banerjee did not name Prime Minister Narendra Modi or home minister Amit Shah, but referred to Gujarat, their home state, instead.Calling the BJP “outsiders,” she talked of Bengal’s heritage and pride. “Gujarat will not rule Bengal. There is a conspiracy against our government. I faced a lot of humiliation in life. I am not a machine. I have feelings. I will not tolerate this. Remember that an injured tiger can be dangerous,” Banerjee said in her 75-minute address.Banerjee was addressing the TMC’s biggest annual show — a public rally in Kolkata in memory of the 13 youth Congress workers killed in police firing in Kolkata on July 21, 1993. In view of the pandemic, giant screens were installed in public places and TMC offices across the state.Banerjee accused BJP of using money to win state elections and overthrow opposition governments in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. She accused the Centre of introducing “kaala kanoon” (dark laws) and destroying India’s economy and democracy.The chief minister made an array of promises such as free ration, medical treatment and free education to the underprivileged. She said that Bengal has surpassed other states in many fields, including poverty alleviation.Last year, the rally was held after the BJP had won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats. This time around, the BJP has set an agenda to win 200 of the 294 assembly seats.“Don’t think that people have forgotten how you (BJP) want to divide people using the National Register of Citizens and National Population Register. Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians are all citizens of India,” said Banerjee.“Railways, Air India, Coal India Limited et al are being sold off. I am sorry that you are in power at the Centre. If Gujarat has to rule all states then what is the use of the Election Commission of India, the judiciary, the other parties? Let there be one party and a Presidential form of government,” said Banerjee.“I invite those who joined other parties to return. I am inviting dedicated youths to join us and work on the field. We want the next line of leadership,” said Banerjee.The BJP dismissed Banerjee’s claims, while the Congress and the CPI(M) also attacked her.BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, “In 2019, her party dreamt of seeing her as prime minister, but we won 18 seats. This is her last martyr’s day speech as chief minister. In 2021, we will give permission for the rally but it will be reduced to a street corner meeting,” said Ghosh.The BJP also welcomed five public personalities from different fields, including Mehtab Hossain, former captain of the Mohun Bagan and East Bengal football teams, into its fold on Tuesday afternoon.“I am predicting that in 2021, Banerjee will have to seek help from the Congress and CPI(M) to survive. She is shaken by the BJP,” said Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha.Md Salim, CPI(M) politburo member and former Lok Sabha member, said, “Banerjee is making tall promises while her government has failed to control the pandemic, stop looting of ration and generate employment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-kicks-off-election-campaign-with-virtual-rally/story-QZiMTlWVktWhN9nmtFwmFN.html
22-07-2020||India||Lalji Tandon, a people’s man who loved Lucknow||About a month ago, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath called on an ailing Lalji Tandon, the governor of Madhya Pradesh. Lying on a hospital bed in Lucknow, Tandon discussed development projects for the impoverished Bundelkhand region that stretches across the two heartland states.“I am in Raj Bhawan and can push some projects,” Tandon told Adityanath.That was not to be. The 85-year-old veteran Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader died early Tuesday morning after spending nearly six weeks in hospital for breathing problems, fever and kidney and liver complications. He is survived by his wife and three sons.His life and four-decade-long political career ended in the city he lived in and loved.In Lucknow, thousands knew him personally and he knew them by their first names. He was known for his love of local delicacies, his culinary prowess and his revival of the Lucknow Holi procession, where Muslims and Hindus participated with equal vigour, underlining the unique Ganga-Jamuni syncretism of the city.Also read: PM Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh condole Madhya Pradesh Governor Lalji Tandon’s deathHe forayed into electoral politics in 1971 after being elected corporator from old Lucknow. A two-time member of the Legislative Council, the state upper house, and three-time member of the legislative assembly, Tandon quickly grew used to comfortably win elections from the Muslim-dominated Lucknow West assembly constituency. He won his first assembly election in 1978.At the height of the Ram temple movement in the 90s that propelled the BJP to power in Uttar Pradesh, many crucial meetings were held at Tandon’s Mall Avenue residence, which also became the nerve centre for talks between the BJP and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) ahead of the short-lived coalition government in 1997.In 2002, when the BJP extended outside support to BSP and Mayawati became chief minister for the third time, Tandon became her ‘rakhi’ brother. The relationship between the two parties soured within a year, but he laughed away all the criticism he faced.His personal moment of pride came in 2009 when he inherited mentor and former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s Lok Sabha seat of Lucknow. An emotional Tandon described himself as Atal’s ‘khadau’ (slippers). By then, he had served as cabinet minister in UP thrice, holding the power, urban development, housing, and finance portfolios, among others. He would go on to win the Lok Sabha election by over 40,000 votes.Ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, Tandon handed over Vajpayee’s constituency to defence minister Rajnath Singh. His son Ashutosh Tandon became a cabinet minister in 2017 and holds the urban development portfolio.Also read: Lalji Tandon had over 40-year-long political career, was close to Atal Bihari VajpayeeIn May 2018 Tandon became the governor of Bihar, a post he held for 11 months before moving on to Madhya Pradesh in July 2019. Throughout his two stints, Tandon frequently visited Lucknow and served Lakhnavi cuisine in both Raj Bhawans. He would tell people, “Lucknow is much more than kebab and nawab -- it’s every street has a rich heritage, history, culture and cuisine.”In Lucknow, innumerable tales circulate about his close relationship with Vajpayee, with whom he shared a passion for Lucknow’s unique culture and cuisine. Their ties were summed up by state cabinet minister Surya Pratap Shahi at the launch of Tandon’s book in May 2018: “ I remember how difficult it was to meet Atalji without Tandon’s nod,” Shahi said.He was of the opinion that secularism ran in the blood of Lucknowites. He loved sipping coffee in the city’s decades-old coffee house and host heated debates.When asked why he hadn’t written a book on Lucknow cuisine, Tandon once said, “No chef or cook can give information on Lucknow cuisine or spices as I can -- the real taste of Awadh. Do you know there are 1,000 types of sweets, 20 kinds of ‘laddoos’, ‘rabri’ and ‘malai’?” The book, Ankaha Lucknow, which talked about the history, architecture and cuisine of the city, was launched by vice president Venkiah Naidu in May 2018“This book tells the real story of Lucknow. It may create some controversies too. But history can’t be distorted; truth cannot be hidden,” Tandon had told this author. That was Lalji Tandon, a people’s man who didn’t hesitate to call a spade a spade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lalji-tandon-a-people-s-man-who-loved-lucknow/story-A17N1QxQmIeRPIGomffIPK.html
22-07-2020||India||Kerala gold smuggling case: NIA custody of accused extended||Swapna Suresh, Sandeep Nair and others had conspired together and separately to damage the country’s monetary stability by destabilising the economy by smuggling large quantity of gold from abroad, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) said on Tuesday, even as a special court on Tuesday extended their custody till July 24.In a report submitted in the Special NIA court, the central investigation agency probing the Kerala gold smuggling case, which came to light on July 5, said that it is suspected that the accused used the proceeds to finance terrorism through various means.The report further stated that the accused deliberately used the diplomatic baggage of United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a cover to transact illegal business, which may have serious repercussions in India’s diplomatic relations with the UAE government.Suresh worked at the UAE consulate general’s office before she joined as an operational manager of the Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited under the state IT Ministry in 2017. Nair was a former employee of the Consulate as well. Meanwhile, Suresh’s bail plea stated that she was being implicated in the crime on a wild imagination without any basis and the case was the offshoot of the political rivalry between the state and central governments, triggered by the colourful and fictitious stories aired by the media.The NIA charged five persons under Sections 15, 16, and 17 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) soon after 30 kilos of 24-carat gold, estimated to be worth at least Rs 15 crore, was uncovered from a carton addressed to an attache of the UAE Consulate, who has since left the country.In a related development, Kerala higher education minister K T Jaleel will be questioned in connection with the case, a senior official aware of the investigation said. Last week, Jaleel had said that he had accepted a sponsorship for food worth Rs 5 lakh from the UAE Consulate to distribute as ‘zakat’ (alms, one of the five pillars of Islam).A list purported to show Suresh’s phone records were leaked to media which indicated that she had spoken to the minister. The purported list showed nine calls in June, with the duration ranging from 64 seconds to 195 seconds. Suresh also got in touch with the minister’s office.Jaleel clarified that he had spoken to Suresh in her capacity as a consular employee in connection with Ramadan kits being offered by the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram. However, state ministers are not supposed to directly interact with the representative of a foreign country and it is against diplomatic protocol and norms. “All such contributions will have to come through the MEA only,” said former diplomat T P Sreenivasan.“The conduct of the minister is punishable under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act. We have requested the PM to include this also in the ongoing probe into smuggling,” said Congress parliamentarian and United Democratic Front convener Benny Behnan. The Bharatiya Janata Party has sought his immediate resignation. “I did not accept direct money or fund. I accepted ‘zakat’ to distribute it to poor people in my constituency. I did it through a government agency. It is sad such a humanitarian move is mired in a controversy,” Jaleel said adding that during Diwali and Christmas, foreign missions often perform similar acts of goodwill. The smuggling case,monitored by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, is being probed by the Customs (Preventive) Division, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, the Intelligence Bureau, and Enforcement Directorate. The agencies have arrested 15 people in connection with the case till now.Two senior officials, including chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s principal secretary M Sivasankar, were removed after their name cropped up in the investigation.“We hope the probe will not take a political colour,” said senior CPI(M) leader K N Balagopal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-nia-custody-of-accused-extended/story-CeQoRgCgsTn2U5WySHgtjM.html
22-07-2020||India||Survey results show that Delhi has definitely crossed infection peak: Dr Sujeet K Singh||Dr Sujeet K Singh, the director of the Union health ministry’s National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), who has been spearheading India’s Covid-19 surveillance strategy through the centre’s integrated disease surveillance programme network, spoke to Rhythma Kaul about the implications of Delhi’s sero surveillance findings; the strategy to deal with the disease outbreak in the wake of these results; and whether it means people have developed immunity against the disease, among other issues. Edited excerpts:Delhi’s sero surveillance results are out. What does the data imply?The implications can be interpreted both ways -- the positive side to it is that the city has definitely crossed its peak as far as Covid is concerned, and that the fear of case explosion in the city that we were grappling with a month or so ago is gone. The exponential increase of cases in Delhi is not a worry anymore. The challenge, however, is that it cannot be said categorically that the outbreak has ended as there is still susceptible population -- about 77% as per the sero surveillance data -- and cases are still being reported. So we cannot afford to drop our guard or be complacent. We have to be vigilant at all times and follow all preventive measures to the T.Also read | Nearly 1 in 4 Delhiites exposed to Covid-19: Sero-survey dataNow that the Delhi sero surveillance data is out, what impact will it have on the containment measures?It is important data to guide containment strategies from now on. Earlier, same measures were being used, but now we have the opportunity to devise a customised approach both for low prevalence and high prevalence districts. For example, in some eight districts where the disease prevalence was found to be quite high (above 20%), the focus now will be on identifying the population at risk and bringing it under surveillance. The high-risk population would be the people above 60 years of age, and those who are immuno-compromised because of any health conditions. These people need special focus, as this section has stayed protected by being largely indoors all these months. Those districts with low prevalence will need us to start aggressively testing, tracking and treating its population, as these districts have higher percentage of susceptible population that has not been exposed to the virus.Will there be any follow up of this surveillance exercise?This exercise cannot be a one-off and needs to be repeated periodically to know the exact burden from time to time. The figures that we have today are not current figures as most samples were collected between June 27 and July 5, and the infection must have happened around mid-June because it takes about two weeks for IgG antibodies to develop. To establish a trend this type of survey needs to be repeated and it will be repeated in coming months. Will there be any follow-up studies done related to this sero-survey to know more about the quality of antibodies or duration of its presence in the body?We will be following up on the results as there is lots more that we need to know. We will be monitoring a select population from the number of 20,000-odd people surveyed for this sero surveillance on a regular basis, especially those who have shown a high volume of antibodies (titre) in their sample. These people will be monitored at three months, six months and till the completion of a year, to see whether they still posses antibodies against the disease, and even if they do how has the volume changed over a period of time.Also read | Covid-19: Govt wants you to stop wearing valved N95 masks. Here’s whyWhat is the significance of knowing that these many people have developed antibodies; does it mean they have protection against the disease?Since these many people have developed antibodies there will be some immunity against the disease; however, what is pertinent to determine is the level of immunity; whether there will be reinfection among recovered patients, or will there be longer immunity against it. We don’t have answers to these crucial questions yet; and evidence for or against it needs to be established through robust scientific studies.What is one thing that you are most happy about from the survey results?The biggest silver lining for me is that if we have such high population that was exposed in past but did not largely display serious symptoms or succumbed -- then it as good as a vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/survey-results-show-that-delhi-has-definitely-crossed-infection-peak-dr-sujeet-k-singh/story-0hc7o9DH7Rd32mzh6RwL7O.html

The team questioned Saini for nearly two hours, while Poonia was quizzed for about two-and-a-half hours at her residence, an official said on condition of anonymity.This was the second time Poonia, an Olympian, was questioned in connection with the matter. The agency quizzed her for nearly three hours at her Jaipur residence on Monday evening.On May 23, Vishnoi, an SHO at the Rajgarh police station in Churu district, was found hanging from the ceiling of his official residence. Two suicide notes were recovered from Vishnoi’s mobile phone – one addressed to his parents and the other to then superintendent of police, Churu. One of the notes, still being verified, appeared to suggest that Vishnoi indicated he was trapped in “dirty politics”.Shorty after the incident, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party and its ally Rashtriya Loktantrik Party alleged that Vishnoi was being pressured by Congress MLA Poonia, a charge she has denied. The two parties demanded a CBI probe.The questioning comes at a time when Gehlot is locked in a political battle with Sachin Pilot, who has been ousted from the posts of the deputy chief minister and the state Congress president.While the Rajasthan government recently withdrew its default consent to the CBI to probe cases in the state after its July 19 notification, the state government itself handed over the probe into Vishnoi’s death on June 4.On Tuesday, the CBI said Poonia and Saini were not being treated as suspects at this point. The official said that the questioning was being conducted to seek clarification on certain aspects of the case. Saini, who is a Rajasthan police officer posted in the chief minister’s office, said: “I am extending full cooperation and provided all required information.”Poonia said: “I have nothing to do with the suicide. I am cooperating with the CBI and will answer all their questions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-quizzes-cm-gehlot-s-osd-mla-poonia/story-mCQf2JnYYaYxLF0qObM9XO.html
22-07-2020||India||Delhi govt to consult experts to assess if a change in Covid-19 strategy is needed||After a test to identify Covid-19 antibodies in a randomly chosen sample of 21,387 across Delhi’s 11 districts shows that almost one in every four residents of the city has antibodies, indicating exposure to the virus , the Delhi government said it will consult medical experts to assess whether the Capital needs a change in its Covid-19 strategy. Antibody tests are conducted to assess prevalence; the presence of antibodies in people indicates that they have at least short-term immunity against the disease. The survey, conducted in Delhi between June 27 and July 10, was aimed to determine the extent of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)’s spread in the city. Interestingly, the number of daily new cases in Delhi started declining from around the end of June and at least some experts believe that the worst is behind the Capital. Responding to the survey results released by the Union ministry of health and family welfare on Tuesday, the Delhi government said the Covid-19 situation in the Capital has improved . It said the daily new cases now have come down to around 1,300 and that at the time of the survey, more than 2,000 new cases were being added every day. “The results of the sero-prevalence study conducted by NCDC in Delhi show that on an average, across Delhi, the prevalence of IgG (Immunoglobulin G) antibodies is 23.48% in the population. This captures the state of recovery from Covid-19 infection in mid-June, which is a month ago. We will consult with public health experts and epidemiologists to determine if the future course of Delhi’s strategy against Covid-19 should change in light of these survey results or not,” Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office said in a statement. To be sure, the 23.48% prevalence is still lower than the 60% or 43% required for herd immunity (based on various studies). When a certain proportion of the population is exposed to the virus and has antibodies, the infection can’t travel very far before encountering someone immune to it -- thereby breaking the chain. This is called herd immunity. The government’s current Covid-19 strategy is focused on testing and isolating. Delhi has tested 43,708 people per million of its population till Tuesday as per the delhifightscorona web portal. These tests are a combination of RT-PCR confirmatory tests, rapid antigen tests which are quicker in terms of its results but are non-confirmatory and CBNAAT and TrueNAT tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-govt-to-consult-experts-to-assess-if-a-change-in-covid-19-strategy-is-needed/story-a2r893EMC1B0N48id93GUP.html
22-07-2020||India||Rahul takes a dig, Javadekar hits back||New Delhi: Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday took a swipe at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government, listing the alleged “attempt to topple” the government in Rajasthan and the “Namaste Trump” event among its “achievements” in the Covid-19 times. He said due to such “achievements” of the government, the country is now “Aatmanirbhar (self-reliant)” in the fight against the pandemic.The BJP hit back at Gandhi over his regular tweets against the central government, saying the Congress will become a “party of tweets” as it is doing no work among people and “losing” one leader after another.“Achievements of the government in the Covid-era: February - Namaste Trump, March - toppling the government in Madhya Pradesh, April - making people light candles, May - government’s sixth anniversary, June - Bihar virtual rally, July - attempt to topple the government in Rajasthan,” Gandhi said in a sarcastic tweet in Hindi.Gandhi has been repeatedly attacking the government over its handling of the Covid-19 situation and also questioning its planning to combat the pandemic. Union minister Prakash Javadekar responded to Gandhi, calling protests against the amended citizenship law, the Delhi riots in February the Congress’s “achievements” followed by loss of Jyotiraditya Scindia and power in Madhya Pradesh in March, and “incitement” of migrant workers in April.He said May marked the sixth anniversary of the Congress’ loss of power at the Centre while the party “advocated” for China in June and then it was “finished” in Rajasthan in July.“Rahul Gandhi is tweeting on a daily basis. It seems the Congress will become a party of tweets as they are doing no work among the people and losing one leader after another. A frustrated and depressed party is trying to launch all sorts of attacks on the government,” Javadekar told reporters.He said Gandhi’s mocking reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to the people to light candles is a reference to the masses and also to “corona warriors” as this was aimed at motivating these emergency workers.“People are standing with Modi. The Congress has become helpless,” he said.Javadekar also said India has done much better than countries such as the US and Brazil in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.“Rahul baba, note India’s achievements in ‘war against Corona’. India has the least average cases, active cases and death rate than the US, Europe and Brazil. By making fun of candle lights, Rahul Gandhi ji you have insulted the people of India and brave corona warriors,” he later tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-takes-a-dig-javadekar-hits-back/story-EnpgH9kOOivKMkexAQotIP.html
22-07-2020||India||Coronavirus crisis: Spread wider, but impact less deadly||The Sars-Cov-2 virus is much less deadly and far more transmissible than previously thought, results from a serological survey conducted in the national capital indicated, and its findings suggested the city could be closer to achieving herd immunity than previously believed, according to experts.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) tested 21,387 people at random from across Delhi between June 27 and July 10, a survey that showed that 23.48% of these had antibodies for the virus, which causes Covid-19, in their blood. Adjusting for false positives and negatives based on the performance of the kit, 22.86% of the population may have been exposed to the virus, officials announced. Extrapolating the serological prevalence data against recorded deaths in Delhi puts the state’s Covid fatality rate at 0.08%, against 9.7% for severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), 34% for middle eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers), 2.5% for Spanish Flu 1918, and 1.3% for H1N1 2009/10 (swine flu). The new coronavirus, according to these results, may therefore be less deadly than these, but far more transmissible since it has caused manifold more infections.  Delhi’s 22.86% number is higher than what has been established till now for New York, London and Tokyo. According to studies from these cities, New York had a Covid-19 serological prevalence of 19.3%, London 17.5%, Madrid 11.3%, Geneva 10.8%, and Tokyo of 0.1%. “The antibody positivity rate reported in the Delhi Covid-19 antibody survey is among the highest in the world, matched only by New York. Even while accounting for false positive results from other coronviruses and the higher likelihood of such results in asymptomatic persons, the result indicates a high level of transmission,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India.High prevalence because of undetected infection means India’s case fatality rate would be significantly lower than 2.43%, which is calculated based on recorded deaths among diagnosed cases. Prevalence is likely to be higher still since people who may have had mild disease in the early course of the pandemic may have lost protective antibodies. “Antibodies have been known to decline in three months, some of those infected early on may not have tested positive. These false negatives may partly balance the false positives,” said Dr Reddy. “While this is good, we must continue to vigorously implement public health measures to contain the transmission so that lives can be saved,” he added.This means herd immunity may have already started setting in, said another public health expert. “Around half the population is not susceptible to infection because of various reasons, such as cross immunity or geographical isolation. This unexplained phenomenon is what Dr Karl Friston calls ‘immunological dark matter’, because we know it exists to account for what is happening but we can’t see it. So if you account for 20-25% prevalence and 50% natural immunity, you have at least 70% of the population with some amount of immunity to Covid-19,” said Dr Dileep Mavlankar, director, Indian Institute of Public Health-Gandhinagar. Dr Friston is a neuroscientist at University College London in the UK, and has done several modelling studies to predict the progression of the Covid-19 pandemic.“This means that the benefits of herd immunity against Covid-19 may set in even with a seroprevalence of 20-30%,” Mavlankar said.“Of the nearly 3,000 antibody samples that we analysed, we did not find any difference in the quality of antibodies among the various age groups. Although samples from people 60 years and older were few, the proportion with antibodies against the infection was the same as young age groups. The belief that older adults do not develop antibodies that leads to higher mortality rates among them is simply not true,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences. The focus should be on preventing a potential second wave in a few months. “We don’t know how long the immunity last, as it could be short duration immunity, as with common cold caused by coronaviruses, or last for decades. Testing-and-tracing people must continue to prevent a potential second wave till a vaccine is available,” said Dr Reddy.“The survey results indicate that about a quarter of the population has been exposed to the infection. Our response should continue to focus on core public health measures – detect, test, trace contacts, isolate and treat - while promoting physical distancing, hand hygiene and wearing of face masks. All possible efforts should continue to be made to break the virus transmission chains,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, World Health Organisation South East Asia Region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spread-wider-but-impact-less-deadly/story-4rM1owBujUafNfCbwD45pK.html
22-07-2020||India||MLAs’ disqualification: HC to decide on July 24||Jaipur Former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and 18 rebel lawmakers from the Congress who are loyal to him won protection from possible disqualification proceedings till July 24, with the Rajasthan high court reserving its verdict on their challenge of these proceedings till then. The decision is bound to heighten uncertainty in the state where the Congress government has a wafer-thin majority after the rebellion. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has hardened his stance against his rival and former deputy Pilot, terming him useless ad worthless, much to the discomfiture of some members of the party’s central leadership who are still hoping that Pilot can be mollified. The disqualification notices were issued on July 14 by Assembly speaker CP Joshi.A division bench of chief justice Indrajit Mahanty and justice Prakash Gupta reserved its verdict on Tuesday after hearing the case over three days.It also directed the speaker to defer action on the notices till July 24. Pilot and other MLAs had approached the high court on July 15 challenging the speaker’s notices that asked them to furnish an explanation by July 17 on why they should not be disqualified from the assembly for their conduct, which the Congress party has alleged is detrimental to the interest of the party and shows their intention to quit the party.The speaker’s notice was based on the disqualification petition filed by chief whip Mahesh Joshi, who in his plea, cited the absence of the MLAs from two Congress Legislature Party meetings -- held on July 13 and 14 -- despite instructions to attend, which showed their intention to leave the party.The chief whip also cited statements made by some of the legislators as well as their allegedly hostile and prejudicial conduct against the party as grounds of their intention to quit the party. Pilot and other dissident MLAs have maintained that they never intended to leave the Congress party and were merely exercising their right to criticize the functioning of the chief minister. In a democratic setup, voicing disagreement with the policies or decisions taken by the party does not amount to acting against the interests of the party so as to lead to disqualification, they argued in their petition.Arguing for the MLAs, Mukul Rohatgi challenged the Speaker’s notice stating that his action reeked of bad faith since the notice was issued to the MLAs without any application of mind and on the very same day the chief whip filed his complaint.“Consummate reading of these facts leaves no manner of doubt that the decision (to suspend MLAs) is a foregone conclusion. What was the tearing hurry?” he demanded.Rohatgi also pointed out that the Speaker gave the MLAs only three days to respond to the notice which also stated that the disqualification plea would be decided ex-parte (without hearing the MLAs) if they failed to respond in writing within the prescribed deadline.“No reasons were recorded for issuing the notice”, he said.Senior counsel Devadatt Kamat appearing for Speaker rebutted this, stating that reasons are not required to be furnished as per the assembly rules.The Speaker has maintained throughout that the petition by Pilot is pre-mature since, as per the 1992 judgment of the Supreme Court in the Kihoto Hollohan case, the court can interfere only after the Speaker decides the disqualification petition. Rohatgi, however, asked the court to distinguish the current case from the case of Kihoto Hollohan, which upheld the Constitutonal validity of the 10th schedule (the anti defection laws). “Kihoto must be read in the context of the (facts of the) case. Kihoto doesn’t say that if an MLA criticises chief minister, the high court will be powerless. Kihoto cannot be used to oust my challenge at the preliminary stage”, Rohatgi submitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mlas-disqualification-hc-to-decide-on-july-24/story-aaxsU9646fc13TYM745f1M.html
22-07-2020||India||Amid tensions with China, Esper hails India-US security ties||At a time when China is engaging in “systematic rule-breaking” and coercion, the US sees its growing security cooperation with India as “one of the all important defence relationships of the 21st century”, US defence secretary Mark Esper said on Tuesday.The exercise in the Indian Ocean between Indian Navy warships and a US Navy carrier strike group led by the USS Nimitz reflects the shared commitment of the two countries to boost naval cooperation in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific, he added.Delivering a speech on the US strategy and vision for security in the Indo-Pacific during a virtual event organised by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Esper didn’t directly refer to the India-China border standoff but made numerous references to what he described as rule-breaking and coercive behaviour by Beijing, especially in the South China Sea and against members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean).He made a special mention of warming India-US security ties, which in recent years have expanded to the 2+2 dialogue between the foreign and defence ministers and big ticket deals for defence hardware, including aircraft and missile systems.“I want to highlight our increased defence cooperation with India, one of the all important defence relationships of the 21st century,” he said. “We conducted the first ever joint military exercise last November and as we speak today, the USS Nimitz is conducting combined exercises with the Indian Navy in the Indian Ocean, demonstrating our shared commitment to stronger naval cooperation in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific.”Esper added: “We also continue to grow our defence sales and look forward to a robust 2+2 ministerial dialogue later this year to build on this progress.”On the other hand, China has continued to engage in “systematic rule-breaking, coercion and other malign activities” amid the Covid-19 crisis, while the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has engaged in “aggressive behaviour” in the East and South China Seas, including sinking a Vietnamese fishing boat, harassing Malaysian oil and gas development, and escorting Chinese fishing vessels into Malaysia’s exclusive economic zone, he said.Asked about the India-China standoff during the question-and-answer session after his speech, Esper said the US is monitoring closely “what’s happening along the Line of Actual Control (LAC)”. He said the US was “very pleased to see that both sides are trying to de-escalate the situation”.In response to a separate question, Esper said the exercise between the Indian Navy and the carrier strike group led by USS Nimitz “shows the growing cooperation between our countries and our ability to project power into the region and to sustain it with our allies and partners”.The US, he noted, is encouraging Indo-Pacific nations to expand intra-regional security relationships and networks of like-minded partners. In this regard, he pointed to the logistical support agreement finalised by India and Australia in June.Esper also referred to what he said was China’s “catalogue of bad behaviour” that accompanies a pattern of disregard for international commitments, failure to uphold commitments under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and disregard for the rights of other countries under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).China, he added, bullied Asean nations out of an estimated $2.6 trillion in potential offshore oil and gas revenues and cut off access to important fishing grounds even as it made incursions into waters around Japan’s Senkaku Islands and looked the other way as North Korea violated UN Security Council resolutions related to its nuclear programme.“We call on China’s leaders to abide by the international laws and norms that China and the Chinese people have benefited greatly from over the years. While we hope the [China] will change its ways, we must be prepared for the alternative,” he said....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-tensions-with-china-esper-hails-india-us-security-ties/story-k31oMZNAw0UUX0wyhvCCiK.html
22-07-2020||India||Focus on envoys to Bangladesh, Taiwan as India seeks to boost relations||As a string of ambassadorial appointments were finalised this month, attention was focused on the new envoys to Bangladesh and Taiwan, two countries with which India is keen to boost relations in the post-pandemic situation.Gourangalal Das, the former joint secretary (Americas) in the external affairs ministry who played a key role in arrangements for US President Donald Trump’s visit to the country this year, has already left for Taipei to take over as the representative in-charge of the India Taipei Association.Vikram Doraiswami, the additional secretary in-charge of international organisations and summits at the ministry and the former head of the Indo-Pacific, will head to the Bangladesh capital Dhaka as the new envoy, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.The two appointments signal the importance attached by the external affairs ministry to relations with both Bangladesh and Taiwan, the people said.They also come against the backdrop of the border standoff with China. There is a concerted effort to counter China’s fresh attempts to woo Bangladesh, while experts and analysts have called for India to upgrade its relations with Taiwan at a time when both countries are dealing with the fallout of tensions with China.Under the “One China policy”, India doesn’t have full and formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Taiwan established the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center (TECC) in New Delhi in 1995 as its representative office while India set up the India Taipei Association at the same time to promote ties in fields such as trade, investment, education, science and technology and tourism.Das, who belongs to the 1999 batch of the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) and is fluent in Mandarin, has done two stints in the Indian embassy in Beijing during 2001-04 and 2006-09. He also served as deputy secretary in the Prime Minister’s Office during the term of Manmohan Singh and as a counsellor in the Indian embassy in the US.Doraiswami, who is from the 1992 batch of IFS, is set to replace Riva Ganguly Das as the envoy in Dhaka. She is expected to take over as secretary (East) when the incumbent, Vijay Thakur Singh, retires in September. A former journalist who speaks Mandarin and French, Doraiswami also served as joint secretary (Americas) during 2012-14 and as the envoy to Uzbekistan and South Korea. He too had a stint in the Prime Minister’s Office.He will head to Bangladesh at a time when India is looking to boost bilateral cooperation by enhancing connectivity between the two sides. Various initiatives have been taken in the past few years to promote connectivity and both sides recognise that increased connectivity by air, water, rail and road offers mutually beneficial opportunities for economic cooperation between Bangladesh and India, especially the northeastern states, the people cited above said.On July 16, the two countries launched the first trial movement of containers by sea from Kolkata to Agartala via Chattogram port in Bangladesh. This was done under an agreement to use Chattogram and Mongla ports for movement of Indian transit cargo through Bangladesh.“This could create a win-win situation for both economies. The two countries signed an agreement on coastal shipping in 2015 and an agreement on the use of Chittagong and Mongla ports for trans-shipment of goods to and from India in October 2018,” said one of the people cited above.This agreement and standard operating procedures permit movement of goods in Bangladesh via waterways, railway, road or multi-modal transport. Eight routes are part of the agreement to enable access to the northeastern states.These routes include those linking Chattogram and Mongla ports to Agartala in Tripura, Dawki in Meghalaya, Sutarkandi in Assam and Srimantpur in Tripura.“Once this gets fully implemented, it will reduce distance, time and logistical cost for transporting goods from the rest of India to the northeastern states and will be a win-win for both economies. The advantages that will accrue to Bangladesh include job creation, investments in the logistics sector, integration of supply chains and promotion of business services such as finance and insurance,” the person cited above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/focus-on-envoys-to-b-desh-taiwan-as-india-seeks-to-boost-relations/story-MRIOv59ckNXT7mkvUZByTK.html
22-07-2020||India||US open to talks on security tax burden on Indian professionals||New DelhiThe US has finally agreed to discuss with India differences over a social security tax levied on Indian professionals employed in America -- the first step towards reaching an agreement that could allow Indians working in the US to be repaid social security deposits when their work visas expire, and they return to India, three officials said.According to an industry estimate, Indians working in the US forfeit almost $1 billion annually in social security tax. For the first time in almost a decade, the US recently acknowledged that social security tax is a bilateral issue and agreed to discuss it, said the officials cited above, who work in three different ministries, requesting anonymity.“Last week, (US) commerce secretary Wilbur Ross told commerce minister Piyush Goyal that the issue of social security tax could be discussed. This is certainly an extremely important development that India was trying bring on the table for several years without much success,” one of the officials mentioned above, who works in the ministry of external affairs, said.Indian workers, particularly information technology (IT) professionals, make social security contributions in the US when they work there, but most of them come back home before they are eligible to withdraw money from their social security contributions. An agreement on the issue would save them this financial loss.A second person, who works in the commerce ministry, said Goyal raised the matter in a conversation with Ross on July 16 and the US commerce secretary’s response was positive. Ross offered to arrange a meeting between the US Social Security Administrator and Indian officials to discuss the matter and find a possible solution, this person added.It is expected that a team of Indian officials representing the ministries of external affairs, commerce and labour will take this matter further.“This has opened up the possibility of initiating exploratory talks. A final solution will emerge after several rounds of talks, which may take several months. But at least we are moving in the right direction,” the first official said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi brought up the issue in February this year during President Donald Trump’s India visit.Addressing a joint press conference with the US president at Hyderabad House in New Delhi on February 25, PM Modi had said, “I have requested President Trump that the contribution of our professionals, in terms of social security, should be discussed further within the framework of a totalization agreement. This will be of mutual interest to both of us.”A totalization agreement is an international tax treaty that seeks to eliminate dual taxation on social security and medicare taxes in the United States. Shivendra Singh, vice president and head of global trade development at the National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom) , an industry association representing the $180 billion technology industry, said a totalisation agreement would provide huge relief to the Indian employees n the US. “Further, in order for the negotiations to proceed, as we are told, considering that statute dictates the requirements, the US Congress’s needs to pass legislation to change these regulations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-open-to-talks-on-security-tax-burden-on-indian-professionals/story-YDg71LU3Beo9d29pFUVAsL.html
22-07-2020||India||Navy deploying MiG-29K jets to key bases in north||The Indian Navy is in the process of deploying its MiG-29K fighter jets to key air force bases in northern India amid the ongoing border tension with China in the sensitive Ladakh sector, people familiar with the developments said, asking not to be named.The navy has a fleet of at least 40 MiG-29K fighters, of which 18 are deployed on India’s sole aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, and the rest are based in Goa.Some of the jets are being moved from Goa to IAF bases in the north keeping in mind the current security scenario, said one of the officials cited above. IAF has moved several of its fighters from bases in North India to the Ladakh sector as part of India’s plan to strengthen is military posture there, said a second official. It was not immediately clear in what role the naval fighters will be used.“If assets and operational pilots are available, why not utilise them?” said naval affairs expert Captain DK Sharma (retd).The Indian Navy has been a part of the military’s ongoing efforts in the Ladakh sector.The navy’s P-8I maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft have been used for surveillance in the region, while their primary role encompasses carrying out anti-submarine warfare, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance of the oceans. The P-8Is, imported from the United States, carried out similar surveillance missions during the 2017 Doklam standoff.The navy has also been active in the Indian Ocean region, where it is keeping a close watch on possible Chinese naval activities. On Monday, a US Navy carrier strike group, led by USS Nimitz, conducted maritime drills with Indian warships in the Indian Ocean, against the backdrop of the India-China border standoff. The passage exercise involved a total of eight Indian and US warships.The drills also came at a time when tensions have mounted over China’s activities in South China Sea, where the US Navy just conducted a major exercise that involved two carrier strike groups.The navy has been on an operational alert in the Indian Ocean, where scores of warships are ready for any task in the aftermath of the border row. It has positioned warships along critical sea lanes of communications and choke points under its mission-based deployment model and the vessels could be diverted for any mission.Indian warships are deployed from the Persian Gulf to the Malacca Strait, and northern Bay of Bengal to the south-east coast of Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navy-deploying-mig-29k-jets-to-key-bases-in-north/story-QjTIQWOhxrBSqfhJdw3FqJ.html
22-07-2020||India||Ahead of Bengal polls, NIA asked to probe ’09 Rajdhani hijack||Ahead of West Bengal assembly elections next year, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) has asked the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to investigate the 11-year-old case of the hijacking of the Bhubaneswar-Delhi Rajdhani Express train by PCAPA (Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities), people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. PCAPA is an alleged overground outfit of Maoists and they were demanding the release of their jailed leader Chhatradhar Mahato. The hijacking happened in Jhargram. Interestingly, the Mamata Banerjee led Trinamool Congress (TMC) earlier this year indicated that it would like Mahato to work for the party in West Midnapore, where he wields considerable influence among tribals. The Bharatiya Janata Party has already made inroads in the region and won the Jhargram Lok Sabha seat last year. The West Bengal government released Mahato on February 1 after the Calcutta High Court commuted his life term to 10 years.TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee said in February that he would be glad if Mahato joins the party. The BJP’s state unit chief Dilip Ghosh claimed after TMC’s statement that Banerjee was inducting Maoists to revive its dwindling fortunes. The BJP and the TMC are engaged in a bitter political battle in the state. The BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats last year, up from the two it won in 2014. Assembly elections in the state are scheduled early next year. The people cited in the first instance said MHA handed over the investigation to NIA in April this year citing three main grounds – it involves a proscribed outfit; the original FIR registered by state police in Jhargam on October 28, 2009 includes sections 121 and 121A of Indian Penal Code (pertaining to waging war against India) which fall in category of scheduled offence; and that case merits probe under UAPA Section 15C as it deals with kidnapping/hijacking of persons to threaten sovereignty of India.The NIA has registered a case under various sections including 121, 121A, 506 (criminal intimidation), 341 (wrongful restraint), 148 (rioting) of IPC as well as railways act and a full-fledged investigation has begun already, an officer said. The central agency is also looking to invoke UAPA (unlawful activities prevention act) although the original FIR doesn’t mention the terror angle, officials added.This also means that West Bengal government and police’s consent need not been taken to go ahead with the NIA probe in the decade old case.Mahato, the leader of the Lalgarh movement, a popular uprising of Adivasi villagers backed allegedly by the Maoists (the Communist Party of India - Maoists) in 2008, was arrested on September 26, 2009 by the state CID from Jhargram for an alleged attempt on the life of former Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in Kantapahari area of West Midnapore district on November 2, 2008. Subsequently, around 500 activists of PCAPA, who were guided by 25 armed Maoists, hijacked the Bhubaneswar-Delhi Rajdhani on October 27, 2009 near the Banstala station at Jhargram demanding the release of Mahato. The train was under their control for five hours before CRPF and state police commandoes reached the spot forcing the hijackers to flee.“For the past 7-8 years, NIA has extensively investigated all Maoist-related cases including murders, bomb blasts, attack on security forces, their funding and drugs smuggling and has a robust data on all Maoist sympathizers. It is crucial to solve the mystery and larger conspiracy behind this hijacking in 2009,” said one of the people cited in the first instance. Raju Banerjee, Vice President of Bengal BJP, said – “Mahato was the right hand of top CPI (Maoist) leader Kishenji. He is being brought by TMC as the entire Adivasi votes has shifted to the BJP so Mamata Banerjee wants to use him to get the tribal votes back. But they (TMC) won’t be able to win”.The TMC refused to comment on the development. Mahato also could not be reached.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-bengal-polls-nia-asked-to-probe-09-rajdhani-hijack/story-spu1SNlkWh98Ll9gimj0KI.html
22-07-2020||India||NDRF teams put on alert as toll due to floods climbs to 90||The flood situation remained grim in several parts of the country as the number of deaths in rain-related incidents reached 90 on Tuesday. According to Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), 24 of the state’s 33 districts are still reeling under floods. Nearly 44,500 people uprooted by flood waters are still taking shelter in 397 relief camps where local administrations are trying to ensure social distancing and safety protocol to prevent outbreak of Covid-19.Two more deaths due to drowning were reported from Nagaon and Morigaon districts on Tuesday taking the total number of deaths to 85 this season. Kaziranga National Park, 90% of which is under water, has lost 116 animals, including 88 hog deers and 11 rhinos, to the floods.Chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal visited the erosion hit areas of Tulsijhara village near Hagrama bridge in Chirang district on Tuesday and assessed the devastations caused by Aie river.In Meghalaya, at least five people have lost their lives and over a lakh have been affected in the plain belt of West Garo Hills, area district collector Ram Singh said. Most victims hail from Tikrikilla community. Chief minister Conrad K Sangma announced ~4 lakh ex gratia to the kin of deceased. Union Home Minister Amit Shah called the CM and assured all support in dealing with the flood situation in the state.In Bihar, heavy rainfall in catchment areas of river Gandak led to the discharge of excess water from Valmikinagar barrage in West Champaran district, flooding parts of north Bihar.Several rivers except the Ganges continued to flow above the danger mark and flood waters have hit nearly 400,000 people in eight districts, a disaster management department bulletin said.The bulletin, however, did not mention any loss of human life or cattle. “All the embankments are safe and there is no breach in any of them,” water minister Sanjay Kumar Jha said.Meanwhile, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has positioned 122 teams across the country to tackle the flood and heavy rain situation during the ongoing monsoon season. A force spokesperson said 85 rescue and relief teams have been pre-positioned in “vulnerable” states and has ordered all its 12 battalions to be prepared(With Agency Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ndrf-teams-put-on-alert-as-toll-due-to-floods-climbs-to-90/story-kDfQhChuaPBLyBfR8GPv2K.html
22-07-2020||India||35 years on, 11 cops convicted for Rajasthan ex-royal’s murder||A special Central Bureau of Investigation court in Mathura pronounced 11 policemen, including a former Deputy Superintendent of Police (SP), guilty on Tuesday in the controversial 1985 murder of Raja Man Singh who was shot dead by the police a day after he crashed his jeep wilfully in a fit of anger into a helicopter being used by the then chief minister .The quantum of punishment will be announced on Wednesday.The CBI named 18 policemen in its charge sheet ; four of them died during the trial and three others were acquitted. The convicted police officials include Kan Singh Bhati who was DSP of Deeg in Rajasthan’s Bharatpur.The verdict came 35 years after Singh was killed in police firing. Raja Man Singh was the younger brother of the last ruler of Bharatpur, Maharaja Sawai Vrijendra Singh, and son of Maharaja Kishan Singh. Born on December 5, 1921, he studied engineering in England and was a seven-time Independent MLA from Deeg between 1952 and 1984.Raja Man Singh’s daughter Krishnendra Kaur Deepa was the tourism minister in the last BJP government in Rajasthan. The CBI court hearing was shifted to Mathura from Rajasthan on a plea in the Supreme Court by her in 1990.Man Singh was shot dead along with his two supporters in police firing in February 1985 after an incident of violence in which then chief minister Shiv Charan Mathur’s helicopter was damaged. Mathur was campaigning for Congress candidate from Deeg, Brijendra Singh, who was contesting against Man Singh. Ahead ofa meeting he was to address, Congress workers removed flags and banners of Raja Man Singh from the area. An enraged Man Singh reached the meeting venue with his supporters. He drove his jeep into the chief minister’s helicopter. Curfew was imposed soon after. The following day, February 21, Singh, according to Deepa, was on his way to surrender to the police who had registered a complaint against him when he was shot dead by Kan Singh Bhati and other policemen who stopped his jeep. Apart from Singh, his supporters, Thakur Sumer Singh and Thakur Hari Singh, were also killed in the police firing.The 11 police personnel convicted are Kaan Singh Bhati, Virendra Singh, Sukhram, Jagram, Jag Mohan, Sher Singh, Padmaram, Hari Singh, Chhitar Singh, Bhawar Singh and Ravi Shekhar.Krishnendra Kaur Deepa said her husband Vijay Singh registered a complaint against the policemen charging them with murder. “We are happy there has been justice after 35 years,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/35-yrs-on-11-cops-convicted-for-raj-ex-royal-s-murder/story-OonuoocveRArbn3u3XdJOO.html

A trial court in 2017 held him guilty of corruption and conspiracy in the allocation of the coal block in Jharkhand to Kolkata-based company Vini Iron and Steel Udyog Ltd (VISUL).The CBI has almost concluded its probe in the allocation of Parbatpur coal block to Electrosteel Castings for their proposed pig iron plants at Khardah in West Bengal and Kalahasti in Andhra Pradesh. The Odisha-based Electrosteel allegedly acquired about 48.5 per cent shares of an Andhra Pradesh-based private company and the allocation was made for a plant of the latter which never independently applied for a coal block.The CBI has alleged that Electrosteel resorted to the sale of 50,162.42 metric tonnes of middlings dishonestly to another private company based at Jharkhand and the company disposed of 42,500 metric tonnes of inferior ungraded coal, jhama and slurry to the non-approved end users.(With input from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-seeks-jharkhand-govt-s-nod-to-prosecute-madhu-koda-in-coal-block-scam/story-WURxKLSNaQ1sL2Z179Zu0L.html
22-07-2020||India||India struggled to gain influence due to 3 foreign policy ‘burdens’: Jaishankar||India has had to struggle mightily to gain influence in a domain that could have come more easily earlier as its foreign policy carries “three major burdens” from its past -- Partition, delayed economic reforms and prolonged exercise of the nuclear option, says External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar.The former diplomat makes these remarks in his new book “The India Way: Strategies for an Uncertain World”, which is scheduled for release on September 7.With the period from the 2008 global financial crisis to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic seeing a real transformation of the world order, Jaishankar analyses the challenges India faces and spells out possible policy responses.Also read: How India can act as a global bridgeAs India rises in the world order, it should not only visualise its interests with great clarity but also communicate them effectively, he writes in the book.Jaishankar says India’s foreign policy carries three major burdens from its past. “One is the 1947 Partition, which reduced the nation both demographically and politically. An unintended consequence was to give China more strategic space in Asia. Another is the delayed economic reforms that were undertaken a decade and a half after those of China … the 15-year gap continues to put India at a great disadvantage.” The third, Jaishankar says, is the prolonged exercise of the nuclear option. “As a result, India has had to struggle mightily to gain influence in a domain that could have come so much more easily earlier...” He terms his book an “effort to contribute to that endeavour, encouraging an honest conversation among Indians, without discouraging the world from eavesdropping”.In a statement, publishers HarperCollins India says the very nature of international relations and its rules is changing and for India, this means optimal relationships with all the major powers to best advance its goals. “Jaishankar analyses these challenges and spells out possible policy responses. In doing so, he is very conscious of balancing India’s national interest with international responsibilities. He places this thinking in the context of history and tradition, appropriate for a civilisational power that seeks to reclaim its place on the world stage,” it says.Also read: The power gap with China | HT EditorialAccording to Jaishankar, international relations may be mostly about other nations, but neither unfamiliarity nor indifference lessens its consequences. “So, rather than allow events to come upon us, these are better anticipated and analysed.” “I have had a ringside view of recent global changes. Above all, interacting with our own leadership over many years at different levels of hierarchy had a value that is difficult to put in words. From that, the big takeaways were the importance of defining strategic goals, recognising optimal outcomes and appreciating the interplay of politics and policy,” he writes in the book.Publisher Krishan Chopra says the book brings clarity to a complicated scenario and indicates the path forward.Jaishankar had earlier served as the Foreign Secretary (2015-18), Ambassador to the US (2013-15), Ambassador to China (2009-13), High Commissioner to Singapore (2007-09) and Ambassador to the Czech Republic (2000-04).He has also had other diplomatic assignments in embassies in Moscow, Washington DC, Colombo, Budapest and Tokyo, as well as in the Ministry of External Affairs and the President’s Secretariat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-had-to-struggle-to-gain-influence-in-foreign-policy-due-to-3-past-burdens-s-jaishankar/story-GqzlvcpEnRUB1aYMCoYm6H.html
22-07-2020||India||Pilot camp hits back at Gehlot, demands apology, resignation||Former Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Hemaram Choudhary on Monday condemned the “intemperate language” used by Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot against his former deputy Sachin Pilot, saying this shows that he is “flustered” by the turn of events in the state.Choudhary, who is one of the 18 Congress MLAs supporting Pilot in his fight against Gehlot, is a former minister and a six-time legislator from the Gudamalani constituency in Barmer. He added that Gehlot has “hurt the sentiments” of the people of Rajasthan with his remarks against Pilot, and must apologise for them.“This is unfortunate. If he doesn’t apologise, the people of Rajasthan will teach him a lesson and never forgive him for this,” he said, indicating the thinking within the Pilot camp.ALSO WATCH | Rajasthan legal chess game: Gehlot vs Pilot explained in 3 simple moves A prominent Jat leader of Rajasthan, Choudhary, in turn, attacked Gehlot for “history of deceiving” those under whom the party had won the assembly elections.Also read: Omar Abdullah fumes after Chhattisgarh CM links his release to Sachin Pilot“In the past, we have seen what happened to Parasram Maderna and CP Joshi, and this time Pilot — after the Congress came to power under their leadership. They were overlooked, and Gehlot became the chief minister thrice,” Choudhary said.Meanwhile, another Pilot loyalist, Vishvendra Singh, who was sacked as a state minister, accused the Rajasthan government of “strangling” democracy. Assembly speaker CP Joshi has issued disqualification notices to 19 Congress legislators, including Pilot. They have approached the Rajasthan high court against the move. The speaker has told the court he will not take any action on the basis of the notices until 5.30pm on Tuesday. A court verdict in the matter is expected on Tuesday.Choudhary contended the Congress came to power in the 2018 assembly elections -- when it won 99 seats in the 200-member assembly -- only because of the hard work put in by Pilot after the party was reduced to 21 seats in 2013.Also read | ‘More concocted allegations coming’: Sachin Pilot after MLA’s bribe chargeReiterating that the rebel Congress legislators who are supporting Pilot will not join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), he said their only demand is the immediate replacement of Gehlot. “He should resign. The Congress cannot fight the next elections under his leadership. No pre-poll promise or even a single point in manifesto had been fulfilled so far. We are in the Congress and how can we go to the people with him as our leader and when we have given them nothing,” Choudhary said.Asked why the rebel legislators were not heeding the Congress leadership’s repeated demands to rejoin the “family” and air their grievances within the party fold, he said: “In Rajasthan, there is no democracy in Congress party. It has become Ashok Gehlot’s Congress. And the Congress leadership has shut doors on us by sending the disqualification notices to us. So, what do we do?”Choudhary also said the audio tapes that were leaked on social media -- they purportedly indicate a plot to bring down the Congress government in the state -- were “fabricated” to malign the Pilot loyalists.“We have not done anything wrong and are not scared of any threats. We have not done anything against the party and our only demand is to change the leadership in Rajasthan. I want to tell all that we will definitely emerge victorious,” Vishvendra Singh said.The Pilot camp also released a video of former Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and current Congress legislator Giriraj Singh Malinga, who on Monday alleged that Pilot had offered him money to join the BJP. In the video, Malinga was seen refuting claims that he was offered money during the June 19 Rajya Sabha elections. At that time, Malinga had dismissed media reports that he was offered to vote against the party candidate in the polls. The Congress won two Rajya Sabha seats while the BJP bagged one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilot-camp-hits-back-at-gehlot-demands-apology-resignation/story-y80qrMsFhpho5LDOinpfWP.html
22-07-2020||India||Covid-19 rapid antigen tests high on accuracy, but protocols crucial||About 1,365 (0.54%) of the 262,075 people who tested negative for Covid-19 through antigen tests are believed to have showed symptoms for the disease, and, among these, 243 (17.8%) were found to have the virus through lab tests, according to data with the government that appears to address some concerns over the rapid kit’s accuracy, although experts said the protocols and the opinion of diagnosticians in each case may have a bearing on this. Between June 18, when testing with these kits began in the national capital, and 10:15am on July 15, there were 281,555 rapid antigen tests (RAT) of which 19,480 people were found positive for the virus. From the 262,075 people who were negative, 1,365 people showed symptoms of Covid-19 and were referred to take a test through the RT-PCR method, which is regarded as the most accurate type of test yet for detecting the Sars-Cov-2. Of these, 243 were eventually found to be positive, meaning they had a false negative on a rapid antigen test, which has been crucial to ramping up testing – and thus tracing and isolation of active cases – in the country. “The follow up testing on RT-PCR is only for symptomatic negative persons on rapid tests as per the protocol laid down by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). RAT negative persons are administered the RT-PCR tests only after due clinical classification by the medical officer in charge at the concerned antigen centre,” said Manish Sisodia, Delhi’s deputy chief minister who is currently also heading the health department at present. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage As per ICMR guidelines, symptomatic persons who test negative in the rapid antigen tests should be followed up with an RT-PCR test. Rapid antigen detection tests are quicker (take up to 30 minutes compared to 2-5 hours in RT-PCR test). The accuracy levels of these kits are such that if someone tests positive, they are considered a ‘true positive’ case but a negative result might be a false one, which is why those with symptoms are advised to go for an RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) test. The government’s data, seen by HT, showed that of the 11 districts in Delhi, Southwest conducted the maximum number of rapid antigen tests and hence, had the highest positive cases through this technique. It has carried 39,804 antigen tests of which 3,798 were positive, while 38 among those who tested negative were followed up with an RT-PCR test, of which 11 tested positive. Also read: Beaten projections but can’t be complacent, says Delhi CM on Covid-19 situationShahdara district conducted the maximum follow-up RT-PCR tests on RAT negatives. In all, 648 symptomatic persons were sent for follow-ups, of which 123 tested positive, the highest among all districts. Dr Lalit Kant, former head, division of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases, ICMR said that the process also depends on the judgment of the medical officer screening the people at the testing centres.“In this season, more and more people develop ILI and SARI symptoms, which are Covid-19 symptoms too. So, the number of symptomatic persons already must have increased in Delhi by now. Clear guidelines must be issued to all medical teams of every district that no symptomatic persons should be left without and RT-PCR test. Anyone with cough and fever should be tested,” said Kant.Dr T Jacob John, virologist and former professor at Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu said it is unlikely that across Delhi only 1,365 of the roughly 262,000 persons who tested negative in the rapid tests could have been symptomatic.“The antigen tests in Delhi started off from the containment and buffer zones which anyway should have increased the number of positive results. Widespread use of rapid tests is a good thing that Delhi is doing. But, this needs to be backed up with RT-PCR tests on all symptomatic RAT negatives because RT-PCR is the most accurate testing method so far. Otherwise, it would defeat the purpose of scaling up testing. The perception among the public that a negative result in the antigen test is the final word in a person’s Covid-19 diagnosis needs to be changed by the authorities,” he said. John further added that simple statistical extrapolation of the government data showed that if 17.8% people tested positive in follow-up RT-PCR tests out of the RAT negatives, then over 46,000 persons could, potentially, have had a false negative. “However, the sample size of 1,365 persons is too small. This statistical extrapolation can only give an indication. It is also indicative of the fact that in Delhi, post peak transmission of Covid-19 continues,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rapid-antigen-tests-high-on-accuracy-but-protocols-crucial/story-Nt9lT1Kzd1EqUhN4nlnN7L.html
22-07-2020||Editorials||Undermining Sushant Rajput’s tragic death||Sushant Singh Rajput died by suicide last month. This was tragic. Rajput — a young man from outside the world of cinema — had truly come into his own in the Mumbai film industry, with a range of critically-acclaimed and commercially-successful films. His death sparked an outpouring of grief in the film industry, in his home state of Bihar, and across urban and semi-urban India.But the tragedy has now taken a somewhat bizarre turn. His death should have triggered a conversation about mental health, and the insecurities that are driving young people to take extreme steps. It should have triggered a conversation about the structure of the film industry, and the pressures even stars — and Rajput was a star — work under. And yes, it should have triggered a debate about the power matrix in the industry.But what has happened is that, driven by social media, an entire narrative has been constructed about how Rajput was a victim of a nepotistic industry, which only favours its own. Nepotism is a real problem in Bollywood. And that debate must take place. But this narrative, and all kinds of conspiracy theories, have now found their way into the police investigation into Rajput’s case. A suicide merits an investigation. But in this case, film reviewers who may have rated Rajput’s films poorly are being called for questioning; producers who may not have done a project with Rajput are being held accountable; talk show hosts who may have joked about Rajput are being blamed; actors who had little to do with Rajput are using it as an opportunity to project themselves as the subaltern battling an entrenched elite. This is not the way structures of power can be interrogated. Instead, it smacks of mob justice. It ignores the complex factors that drive a person to the end. It appears driven by political motivations. And it undermines Rajput’s life, legacy, and tragic death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/undermining-sushant-rajput-s-tragic-death/story-CkxnynGXKITipH4DDeUhoM.html
22-07-2020||Editorials||A reality check of the health sector||As India confronts the worst health crisis of a century, the gross inadequacies in its health system have been exposed. It is clear that a radical overhaul of the health sector must be an important element of the post-pandemic policy framework. Any such effort has to first recognise ground realities. The latest National Statistical Office (NSO) report on the consumption of health services in India can be an importantreference point. The most important finding of the report is a bit counter-intuitive. It shows that both the share of Indians reporting themselves sick and getting hospitalised fell between 2014 and 2017-18. While this appears like good news, it is important to be cautious. Statistical and material reasons could have driven this change. The 2017-18 report is based on a full-year survey, unlike six-monthly surveys in the past two rounds. Seasonality can be a big factor in health outcomes. The year 2017-18 is also when the economy entered a deceleration phase. This was also the year when unemployment was at high levels. The poor in India tend to under-report illnesses. This is not surprising, as an overwhelming majority have to pay for health expenses from their own pockets. To be sure, the latest report does not account for coverage under Ayushman Bharat scheme which was launched in September 2018. But did worsening economic conditions force people to forego even necessary medical care? Hospitalisation can be expensive for most Indians. An average hospitalisation case cost Rs 16,676 and Rs 26,475 in rural and urban areas, respectively. The average monthly wage of a regular worker — the best employment category in India — was Rs 15,504.Affordability is not the only red flag in the report. Infections are the biggest reason for ailments and hospitalisations in India. A lack of personal and perhaps clinical hygiene — hospitals spread infections as well — makes citizens even more vulnerable to pandemics such as the current one. Critics rightly underline the importance of allocating more resources to ramp up the country’s health sector. Resources are needed, but so is behavioural change, show the latest NSO findings. India has to take this into account while planning a revamp of the health policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-reality-check-of-the-health-sector/story-KGUz9IQxD6Ir3Q0KdyOiOL.html
22-07-2020||Editorials||In Delhi, the good and bad news | HT Editorial||One-fourth of Delhi’s residents have possibly been infected by Covid-19. The outcome of an official serological study in the city’s 11 districts showed that 23.4% have IgG antibodies. With 21,387 samples, the study was conducted at the end of June, early July, the objective was to assess the spread of Covid-19, and a rigorous sampling method, according to an official release, was followed. The findings are deeply instructive. For one, it shows that Covid-19 has spread way beyond what official daily cases suggest. Two, the spread of the disease — and the knowledge about the spread — is not necessarily a negative thing, for the study also shows that a majority of these cases have been asymptomatic, and patients have recovered — without even perhaps knowing it. Three, it suggests that the fatality rate due to the disease is possibly lower than what is known so far. India has had, compared to other countries, lower deaths due to Covid-19 in any case, but this is measured against the number of known cases. If the cases are higher, and if deaths are not being under-reported, then the fatality figures will go down even more. But the study also shows the scale of the challenge. If this is the outcome in Delhi, one can assume that the disease has spread far and wide across the country — not measured by official statistics. Delhi has done well in recent weeks by ramping up testing, being transparent, instituting home isolation protocols, increasing hospital beds and care centres. Other states must follow the lead, and the Centre should assist them in conducting serological studies. This will help them respond better. There is also a lesson for citizens who may have turned complacent in recent weeks. You could be next, if you haven’t had it already. Follow basic protocols, wash your hands, wear masks, and restrict activities. You owe it to yourself and to society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/in-delhi-the-good-and-bad-news/story-8BW5Ids6GGUM207NuYefiO.html
