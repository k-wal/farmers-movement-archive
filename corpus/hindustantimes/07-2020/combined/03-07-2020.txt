Every day of the lockdown brought with it images of workers, left with no incomes and social security, making their way home, hungry and tired, laying bare the realities of India’s fragile labour market. In sharp contrast to the tragedy unfolding on our highways, several state governments set about “reforming” labour laws by quite literally doing away with crucial protections in a bid to make themselves more attractive to business and revive their economies.These contradictory responses to the lockdown are a product of well-known truths about India’s labour market and unconscionable policy failure. More than 90% of India’s workforce is informally employed. About three-quarters is either self-employed or casual labourers, with no income and employment security or benefits. India’s organised sector too is characterised by stagnant wages, and a decrease in the proportion of employees with social security benefits. Juxtaposed against this is a complex and ominous legal regime for labour regulation. According to a study by Teamlease labour-capital relations are governed by 463 Acts, 32542 compliances and 3048 filings. This governance regime does relatively little to protect labour. Moreover, its complexity and associated red tape have contributed to the persistence of informality.It is this reality, and not the urgency to attract global capital, that needs to drive the debate on labour law reform. Yet, in the rush to promote ease of doing business, deregulation of labour has taken precedence over the real debate India should be having —how to rebalance regulation to enhance the bargaining power of labour without unnecessarily constraining capital. As a contribution to this rebalancing, here are some basic principles and empirical realities that a debate on genuine reform ought to consider. First, the challenge of State capacity. Indian capital’s frustration with labour laws stems from the fact that laws are being implemented in an environment that incentivises arbitrary implementation, corruption and abuse of the coercive powers of the State. This is a consequence of a deadly cocktail of bad laws and weak regulatory capacity, particularly relating to dispute resolution and grievance redressal.Second, the imbalance in the relative economic strengths of capital and labour. India is a labour-surplus economy and labour markets are characterised by the presence of monopsony. These realities make a strong theoretical case for robust labour laws but, at the same time, risk laws being rendered ineffective by the forces of supply and demand. Therefore, labour law reform must go hand in hand with robust social security. Consider, for instance, the important role Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) played in driving rural wages upward. Greater freedom to hire and fire may make the labour market more dynamic, but in the absence of social security, they undermine labour bargaining power. Strengthening MGNREGS and Public Distribution System (PDS), and combining that with some form of social security, ought to form the backbone of a renewed reform effort.Third, the shifting global economic landscape. Against the backdrop of trade wars and retreating globalisation, it is likely that the East Asian pathway of exporting its way to prosperity in a global labour market may no longer be available for India. At the same time, the ever-expanding role of information technology will continue altering labour markets significantly. In the gig economy for instance, it is a computer that navigates relationships between labour and capital. Think of the Uber and Ola driver or the Swiggy delivery person — the workers simply do not directly engage with employers. As the global economy responds to these changes, how will international capital reorganise itself? How will local economies reshape their growth paths and what implications this will have on labour- capital relations?Fourth, the structural changes in India’s labour market post the 1991 reforms. The spatial concentration of growth has resulted in increased inter-state migration, placing new pressures on labour markets. This has been accompanied by an increase in temporary or contract workers. Contract workers now account for a third of workers in the manufacturing sector. They are dependent on intermediaries (or contractors) who are as powerful in shaping labour-capital relations as employers themselves. Meditating this dynamic is complex because contractors operate informally, a consequence of poorly designed laws. Labour law reform will need to contend with the challenge posed by the omnipresent contractor and the role he plays in shaping labour-capital relations, and yet manages to stay outside the direct purview of the law.Finally, implicit in the narrative on labour reforms is the assumption that every other aspect of the economy is working well, and fixing labour laws will unleash latent growth potential like a volcano. The reality, of course, is quite different. Other factor markets such as land and capital have a plethora of problems and putting all the reform eggs in the labour-law basket is bound to disappoint. Above all, India’s governance and labyrinthine administration pose binding constraints on the growth process. Disempowering labour through poorly conceptualised reforms will only exacerbate these challenges, not resolve them.Reforming and simplifying labour laws is the need of the hour. But doing this right requires a fresh debate. One that contends with economic realities on the one hand and revisits first principles of what makes good laws (and good economics) on the other. Above all, we need to step away from entrenched positions of growth vs labour rights, which lead to a zero-sum discourse. Protecting rights is not just a moral imperative in a democracy, but also an investment in boosting overall productivity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/a-blueprint-to-protect-labour-rights-without-constraining-capital-opinion/story-PWfCgpaUHa8Ky6cDZWz3QI.html
03-07-2020||News||Arriving at a new normal in India-China relations | Opinion||The ongoing stand-off between the Indian and Chinese forces in eastern Ladakh is a fork in the road, fundamentally reshaping the direction of the bilateral relationship. Over the last few years, the architects of the gradual thaw and developing partnership between the two sides, which began in 1988, had been warning about the withering of old mechanisms that had kept the peace on the disputed boundary.Despite the pageantry of informal summitry, the strategic guidance provided by the leaders to their respective militaries has clearly not succeeded in stemming incidents. In November 2019, the minister of state for defence, Shripad Naik, told Parliament that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had transgressed into Indian territory 1,025 times between 2016 and 2018. Roughly a third of these incidents took place in 2018. In April that year, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping held the first of their two informal summits. Recent reports suggest that the number of transgressions across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) increased significantly in 2019.In fact, over the past decade or so, both India and China had seemingly settled into a routine characterised by episodes of scuffles, transgressions and incursions at different locations along the boundary. Some of these, of course, drew greater attention and were more intense than others. This had become an uneasy pattern. The loss of life in the Galwan Valley, the first in 45 years, on June 15 presents a clear break in this pattern.The current scenario, therefore, throws up a new challenge for diplomats, military personnel and political leaders on both sides. While we cannot return to the ways of the past, it is important to arrive at a new normal. Doing so, however, will first require PLA to step back and the ground situation in eastern Ladakh to return to the April status quo. This will not be easy and will not happen quickly, if at all. It will likely require more than military-level engagement, which is largely what has taken place over the past month. In the interim, it is important for India not to let its guard down militarily. It must consider demonstrating asymmetric, low-intensity escalatory options in other sectors and theatres. Economic measures, on the other hand, need to be carefully calibrated, keeping in mind the costs to the Indian economy. Cutting off one’s nose to spite one’s face will be strategic folly. If and when de-escalation is achieved, it will need to be followed by sustained high-level engagement and significant political capital being spent. Given the differences in the governance systems of the two countries, the political cost is, of course, going to be far higher for any Indian leadership than for China’s leaders. The fact that conflict doesn’t serve either side’s strategic interests is likely to encourage the two leaderships to consider bearing the cost of engagement. Does that mean that we should rule out the possibility of conflict? No, it doesn’t. But it does mean that both sides will incur extremely heavy costs in case of conflict. For all its bluster, a conflict will seriously retard Beijing’s march towards its centenary goals. At the same time, even with significant political engagement, the structural fault lines between India and China imply that a new normal will not be any less volatile. This will complicate political decision-making going forward.There are tactical and strategic factors driving the current stand-off, which derive from these structural fault lines. While there is a significant power asymmetry between India and China, both are experiencing a simultaneous rise. Both sides have greater capacity today than at any point since the formation of the modern Republic of India and the People’s Republic of China. This translates, for instance, into enhanced infrastructure development on the boundary, which can spark insecurity in itself. At the same time, both sides also have coinciding and expanding circles of interests, which lead to new sources of friction. This has been evident in the jostling for influence and crossing of old redlines in the broader Indian subcontinent. Now place all this in the context of the geopolitical flux that prevails in the world — a flux characterised by not just China-United States (US) competition but also socio-political chaos in the US, the unpredictability in its foreign policy, and ambivalence with regard to alliance partners and global institutions. In such an environment, one can only expect increased volatility between India and China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/arriving-at-a-new-normal-in-india-china-relations-opinion/story-blkf7cuSWAtGy4e5IBS1iL.html

The government will take a decision on punishing or acquitting these officials only after that.”The department on June 30 wrote to the five giving them 15 days to present their side.“There is ground for punishment on the basis the accusations proved by the inquiry officer against you. If you want to say something in self-defence, send it in written within 15 days, failing which it would be considered you have nothing to say,” reads the department’s letter.The magisterial probe that indicted the five was conducted by the then Jalandhar divisional commissioner B Purushartha. After a prolonged inaction in the case, the probe report was made public by the Punjab Human Rights Organisation (PHRO), an NGO, in December last year.In the probe, Purushartha had concluded that Kashmir Singh provided a fire tender and a water tanker without the MC’s permission while Bhatia and Krishan failed to ensure that no function was organised in the area without due approval. Also, the then superintendents of the MC’s advertisement branch Pushpinder and Girish were held responsible as posters and banners of the event were put up without any nod.PHRO investigator Sarbjit Singh Verka said, “It is good that the proceedings are going on against officials of the MC and police. But unfortunately, no proceedings have been initiated against the politicians responsible for the tragedy.”Local Congress leader Sourabh Madaan Mitthoo, who is considered as close to Congress MLA and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, was the main organiser of the Dussehra function.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2018-amritsar-dussehra-train-tragedy-now-judicial-probe-indicts-two-serving-3-former-mc-officials/story-QcEnQTiLx1rJTBhuyedRmN.html

It had sought directions seeking quashing of some standing orders issued against the interest of these inmates.On Friday, appearing for the petitioner, advocate Maninder Singh told the court that the situation is appalling because the inmates have been denied access to television, radio, magazines and newspapers. He said the main petition should be decided as the mental health and psychological well-being of these inmates was in peril as the ‘mulaqat’, which was their only connection to the outside world, has been stopped for now. “It is pertinent to mention that most of these prisoners do not qualify for interim bail ..,” the plea read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tihar-s-high-security-inmates-want-resumption-of-meetings-with-families/story-FdlYZGYZDJAvxVxIKMKRrI.html

03-07-2020||Delhi||Tablighi Jamaat: Delhi high court advises city court on disposing of foreigners’ cases||The Delhi High Court has issued a slew of suggestions to a city court for speedy disposal of the cases related to the several foreign nationals connected to the Tabligihi Jamaat congregation. Over 120 Malaysian nationals and 11 Saudi Arabia nationals had moved the court seeking speedy disposal of the cases.Justice Anup J Bhambhani suggested that considering the large number of charge sheets and supplementary charge sheets -- 48 and 11, respectively -- and the number of accused, the Saket Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) should post all charge sheets for a case management hearing on the same day.The court said that the CMM may divide the cases into batches and sub-batches according to the nationality of the accused, and offences alleged, or on some other rational and useful basis. It also said that the CMM may also designate a specific date and time when exclusively these mattes would be taken-up, which could even be a non-working day, so that adequate time and resources could be devoted to facilitate expeditious disposal.According to the plea, the Malaysian nationals, who were arrested by the Delhi Police and charge sheeted, were being in the custody of the High Commission of Malaysia in a hotel in the city. It said the court was yet to take cognizance of the charge sheets. The cognisance of the charge sheet is slated for July 6Justice Bhambhani, in an order passed on Wednesday, said that after cognizance is taken, the CMM may take up on its suggestions on segregating the cases following responses from the accused. It also added that cases where the accused are plead guilty or enter into plea bargains may be disposed of first.The court also said that the Embassy or High Commission concerned may be requested to arrange for the appearance of the accused via video-conferencing. It said that the CMM is also free to devise her methods for the speedy disposal of the cases.Appearing for the petitioners, senior counsel N Hari Haran had contended that while many of the accused would be willing to plead guilty or enter a plea bargain in order to seek early closure of the cases, the process may take a very long time if they are unguided.According to the charge sheets, all the foreign nationals have been booked for violating visa rules, violating government guidelines issued in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic and regulations regarding Epidemic diseases Act, Disaster Management Act and prohibitory orders under section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure.They have also been charged for disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant, negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life, malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life and disobedience to quarantine rule of the IPC and relevant sections of the Foreigners Act.The matter would be now heard on July 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/tablighi-jamaat-delhi-high-court-advises-city-court-on-disposing-of-foreigners-cases/story-ny74QkVqcqEmcSsaLVmpQO.html
03-07-2020||Chandigarh||Four fatalities, 494 new cases in Haryana||Haryana on Friday recorded four Covid-19 deaths and 494 fresh infections, taking the total number of cases in the state to 16,003, officials said.The four patients who died were from Faridabad. Also, 672 more people across 18 districts got cured of the disease. Among these, the highest 390 patients were from Faridabad district.There was a significant decline in the number of active cases from 4,657 to 4,057 as compared to last Friday, primarily due to an escalating recovery trajectory. The total number of cured persons on Friday stood at 11,691, which is more than 73% of 16,003 positive cases.The medical bulletin said there were 59 critically ill patients, including 18 on ventilator support, while 3,998 patients have mild symptoms.Faridabad with 156 fresh cases was the top contributor to the tally on Friday, followed by Gurugram at 130 and Sonepat at 46.

03-07-2020||Chandigarh||Badals using Covid crisis for taking political mileage: Capt||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday lashed out at Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal and Union minister Harsimrat Badal, accusing them for “misleading the people of the state to promote their petty political agenda in the midst of the Covid crisis”.In a statement, the CM said the concerted manner in which the Badal couple is running a campaign of lies has exposed their double standards.Amarinder also flayed Sukhbir over his allegations of embezzlement in distribution of ration by the Congressmen in Punjab, and said the MLAs were supporting his government’s efforts to ensure that nobody goes hungry. The MLAs are close to the people and well placed to help out those in immediate or urgent need, which is what they have been doing, he added.Amarinder said Sukhbir’s allegations that the foodgrains received by the state government had not been distributed among the people were totally incorrect.“The fact was that the quantity of food grains received by the state government till June was more than the figures given by Sukhbir, with over 90% of it distributed. Under the PMGKAY, the wheat allocated to the state was 212164 MT, of which 199091 MT had been distributed, while of the 10800 MT Dal allocated, 10305 MT had been distributed,” said the statement.In addition, under the ATMANIRBHAR scheme of GoI, wheat(per person) and dal (per family) was provided for 14.14 lac persons, and the state, after grounding the wheat to flour, added dal to make it 1 kg per person and put in 1 kg sugar on its own. In fact, the state government had distributed 17 lakh packets to migrant labourers at the cost of Rs 69 crores from its own funds, with 10 kg atta, 2 kg dal and 2 kg sugar, he added.“This data was sufficient to show that Sukhbir’s claims and allegations on foodgrain distribution were unsubstantiated and baseless, and as usual, the SAD chief was indulging in double standards”, said the chief minister.Taking on Harsimrat Badal on the issue of fuel VAT, the chief minister said if she was so concerned about the impact of the escalating fuel prices on the common man, why did she not pressurise the Union Government, in which she is a cabinet minister, to put a stop on the uncontrolled hike in prices of diesel and petrol for 22 straight day.He said Harsimrat seemed to have had no problem with the central government earning more than Rs 2 lakh core from the fuel price hike ,but when it came to her own state, which was reeling under an unprecedented fiscal crisis and was struggling to cope with the Covid pandemic, she found it anti-people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/badals-using-covid-crisis-for-taking-political-mileage-capt/story-Wjsgbha4tXsAdMVTgkdxsO.html
03-07-2020||Gurugram||Pandemic effect: Warehousing hit in NCR but e-commerce could be bright spot||The Covid-19 pandemic hit the warehousing industry in Delhi-NCR hard with an almost 32 per cent decline in demand this year as compared to the same period in 2019, according to a report released by consultancy firm Knight Frank India.“The demand for warehousing in NCR saw an upward swing in FY2019. However, due to the on-going pandemic, occupiers and developers have become cautious,” said Mudassir Zaidi, executive director (north), Knight Frank India. “Demand from the e-commerce segment is expected to rise, albeit for mid-sized facilities along the national highway- 48 (NH-48) belt to capitalise on essential services demand from Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Greater Noida and other peripheral consumption centers.”Warehousing is spread along the Kundli–Manesar–Palwal (KMP) Expressway and Kundli–Ghaziabad–Palwal (KGP) Expressway and NH-48 around 2000 acres is under various stages of development for warehousing, said experts. Ramesh Menon, CEO of Certes Realty, said that around 200 acres in the region has been converted into warehouses but absorption of this space declined as both manufacturing and consumption took the hit. “The slowdown has hit every sector and warehousing also slowed down but it is likely to pick pace by August (with the opening up of the economy),” he said. The Knight Frank report, however, said that NCR remained the foremost warehousing market in the country and recorded the highest volume of leasing at 8.6 million square feet (msf) in first six months of 2020. Over a period of three years NCR recorded a compounded annual growth rate of 45 percent, it added.Chandranath Dey, head of industrial operations and business development at consultancy firm JLL India , said, “Due to shortage of labour it is difficult to increase supply (to warehouses) but there is an upswing in flexible rent transactions and agreements are being signed.”The report also said that NCR has a development potential of 75% more warehousing space in the region. The current space is reported to be 57 million square feet (mn sq ft) with a potential of expansion to 100 mn sq ft over 4,178 acres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/pandemic-effect-warehousing-hit-in-ncr-but-e-commerce-could-be-bright-spot/story-Rf5vllwP4gDEEuYqsPr2nJ.html
03-07-2020||Gurugram||Home buyers of delayed realty projects hit by lockdown as courts, H-Rera function at a limited capacity||Homebuyers of several delayed real estate projects in the city have been hit hard by the ongoing nationwide lockdown as several governmental agencies and the courts continue to function at a limited capacity. Around 50 buyers of ILD Greens project in Sector 37C staged a protest outside the office of Haryana-Real Estate Regulatory Authority (H-Rera) on Friday for a delay in the delivery of their flats. They also demanded that the authority should conduct online hearings in the matter. The project was launched in 2008. However, three towers in the project, comprising 400 flats, are yet to be completed, said the homeowners association. “We want the authority to hold hearings online and take necessary action so that buyers, who are paying both EMIs as well as rent, can get their flats at the earliest,” said Rajan Soni, president, ILD Greens flats buyers’ association.Several homebuyers in the city have been hit hard by a delay in the completion of real estate projects due to the ongoing lockdown. Homebuyers claim that their cases are not being heard due to closure of consumer and judicial courts and because institutions, such as H-Rera and town and country planning departments, which oversee real estate development in the state, are functioning at a limited capacity. Reacting to the complaints of the home buyers, SC Kush, member, H-Rera, Gurugram, said that the authority is regularly holding online hearings for project-related complaints but complaints from buyers will be accepted only after July 15. “We are holding online hearings for all the cases that are already listed with us. The matter of ILD Greens will also be heard soon,” he said. However, he failed to mention any specific date on which the matter may be heard. When asked about the delay in the project, Alimuddin Rafi Ahmed, chairman of the real estate company of the project, said, “The true facts of the case are not being reported. A mitigation plan has been submitted to H-Rera and the residents’ welfare association (RWA) has requested for an audit of the mitigation plan and the company’s finances. We have fully cooperated with our clients so far and have completed two towers of the project, namely towers 6 and 7. We will apply for the occupancy certificate within two weeks after obtaining necessary clearances. As per the mitigation plan, Tower 2 of the project will be completed soon.” Like ILD Greens, buyers of Unitech Anthea project in Sector 70, whose final resolution plan was supposed to be submitted to the Supreme Court by a government-appointed board on March 19, are also dejected as the plan was not submitted on the aforementioned date. “The submission of the final plan has been delayed by almost three months. The hearings in the court have also not taken place. It now appears that the takeover of the real estate company by a government-appointed board did not prove to be beneficial to the buyers,” said Vivek Tyagi, president of All India Association of Unitech Homebuyers.Tyagi says that around 21,000 home buyers of Unitech have been left in the lurch after the company failed to deliver them their flats. Out of the 21,000 home buyers, around 8,000 to 9,000 are from Gurugram, he added.Amitabh Das, vice president, business development, Unitech, said that the final resolution plan of the Anthea project is in final stages. “We will submit the same in the apex court as soon as the court reopens,” he said. The buyers of another prominent project in Manesar are also facing similar issues. Homebuyers claim that despite the court giving directions to the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC), nothing much has progressed in the last two years since both the land and the project were handed over to the corporation in March 2018.“Over the past two years, a number of hearings have taken place in the apex court. We had great hopes of a resolution as the court had fixed March 25 as the final date of hearing but due to the lockdown, it was postponed,” said Hari Om Sharma, one of the 250 buyers, whose money is stuck in the project. Buyers said that they have been paying both rent and EMIs — which is putting a tremendous financial burden on them. “Many people have lost their jobs while being stuck with delayed projects. The government needs to help us out,” said Sharma.Another city project in Sector 103, which was supposed to be resurrected, after the Delhi High Court gave directions for its revival in February 2020, has been similarly hit by the lockdown. A total of 517 home buyers, whose money is stuck in the project, say that the lockdown has brought the project to a standstill. “Due to the lockdown, all governmental agencies, such as DTCP, and the courts have stopped functioning. Although work has started at a limited capacity, it is difficult to meet and coordinate with promoters, government officials, lawyers and other stakeholders,” said Priti Nath, spokesperson for the home buyers association of the project.Despite several attempts, developers of the projects in Manesar and Sector 103 could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/home-buyers-of-delayed-realty-projects-hit-by-lockdown-as-courts-h-rera-function-at-a-limited-capacity/story-NHe3XodWJiaHNlwO1zxQ0L.html
03-07-2020||City||35 waterlogging points to have extra vigil during monsoon||Gurugram: More than a month after 79 waterlogging points were identified in the city, officials on Thursday categorised 35 of them “most critical” that will be monitored more closely to prevent flooding during the ongoing monsoon months. Each of the 35 spots carries a high volume of traffic that needs more attention, said officials.The 35 points were selected by officials of the district administration, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), and Gurugram police in a meeting at the PWD rest house in Civil Lines.All the vulnerable points will be monitored using CCTV cameras, the officials said, adding that each spot will have a set of teams assigned for removing accumulated rainwater with the help of motor pumps and super suction machines. The move is aimed at minimising inconvenience to commuters travelling along these stretches, they said.On May 29, officials had identified 79 waterlogging-prone points in the city, and said that they would undertake a two-week assessment of all these points individually to ascertain their drainage condition.“While we will be continuing to monitor all 79 points, 35 of these have been further sub-categorised as the most critical due to them being located on major roads such as Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, Sohna Road, and Golf Course Road that carry a high volume of traffic. We will be monitoring these 35 points even more extensively to ensure remedial actions can be executed immediately if there is heavy rainwater accumulation at any of them,” said Raman Sharma, chief engineer, MCG.Sharma said that all these points will be monitored via CCTV cameras, and teams have been appointed for each of them to initiate desilting or suction operations during waterlogging.The 35 “most critical” points include Hero Honda Chowk, Narsinghpur-Khandsa stretch, Signature Tower, Atul Kataria Chowk, Rajiv Chowk, stretch opposite Ambience Mall, and MDI Chowk -- all located on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway.Besides, Subhash Chowk, Vatika Chowk, Bakhtawar Chowk, CH Bakhtawar Singh Road, and T-point next to Good Earth Mall -- all located in close proximity to Sohna Road -- are among the most vulnerable spots.Other key points include Huda City Centre, Iffco Chowk, AIT Chowk and Bristol Chowk on Golf Course Road, a portion of Gurgaon-Faridabad Road located opposite Valley View Society, and crossing near Vyapar Kendra in Sushant Lok 1.Meanwhile, during a press conference on Friday, MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh said that waterlogging-prone points have been identified across the city where “necessary measures and trial runs have been undertaken”.In trial runs, water from several fire tenders is released at high pressure at a particular point at once, to ensure there is knee-deep water. The time taken for water to seep or recede through stormwater drains is accordingly measured to assess if the drainage is proper, and if not how many motor pumps and suction machines would be needed in the eventuality of waterlogging to disperse all of it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/35-waterlogging-points-to-have-extra-vigil-during-monsoon/story-fSNcSEfSJ7cINsVO5reuVM.html
03-07-2020||Chandigarh||Readers’ take: Chandigarh not geared up for monsoon this year||Prioritise projects in case of tight deadlinesWaterlogging during the monsoon is a real problem, and one expects more problems this year due to the lockdown because of Covid-19 and the resultant labour shortage which led to slow development work such as recarpeting of roads or cleaning of the drainage system. However, it is still not too late and pending work can be prioritised and completed quickly if the authorities have the will. The administration can also arrange for night shelters for the homeless, especially near hospitals, for people to stay away from the rain, and provide free food and clothing to the poor as people get less work during the monsoon. Use of plastic should be curbed and all waste thrown in dustbins to prevent blockage of drains. Avinash Goyal, ChandigarhInfrastructure should be well maintainedEvery year the story is the same. Road gullies are not cleaned before the onset of monsoon. Tenders are floated every year and public money is spent on this account, but nothing changes. Many areas remain waterlogged and roads get potholes. Chandigarh MC has been regularly coming up with excuses that the requisite funds have not been received and work hasn’t continued because of the Covid-19 lockdown. One wonders why all the works are not carried out regularly and left for the last minute? In my opinion the system is corrupt and no one is interested in completing the work on time. Instead of getting such work every year on tender, why is equipment and trained staff not available with the MC to execute the job and to check the damages and maintenance thereof at regular intervals? Sham Sunder Sharma, Chandigarh.Residents have a role to play tooMajority of the city’s drains and alleys still require cleaning, for which MC teams are toiling hard. Also, being educated citizens, it’s our duty to dispose of garbage in designated bins and ensure these are not dumped elsewhere to block and choke drains. Keeping in mind the oncoming monsoon season, MC officials must ponder over the old saying: “The more you sweat in peace, the less you bleed in war.” Avik Seth, ZirakpurDeal with trouble spots on priorityDoubtlessly, MC would not have been able to ensure the timely execution of pre-monsoon projects such as maintenance of roads and drains due to the long lockdown and absence of labour. But at this juncture it would not be advisable to carry out work related to recarpeting of roads when the monsoon is just around the corner. Therefore, at the moment, corporation staff should check areas prone to waterlogging and clear them quickly. The sewerage system should also be cleaned up. Surinder Paul Wadhwa, Mohali.Futile to expect any changesIt’s a fact that the MC has never in the past, nor at present, been capable of finishing any project on time. Every year our roads become nullahs. A number of suggestions will be made in the debate, but what happens after that? Nothing will happen, no suggestion will be taken up by the authorities for action and things will keep moving as they are doing now. We are being governed by a system in which no one is answerable to anyone unless you file an RTI. But how many RTIs can one file to live a life that one really deserves?Gurpreet S Malhotra, Kansal villageSolutions nowhere in sightMonsoon preparedness has been hampered by successive lockdowns so road repair and drainage cleaning work has slowed down. Safai karamchars were busy with sanitisation work, spraying chemicals manually in affected areas. Let’s hope the staff concerned will now catch up with the pending work to clear gully traps and choked underground drainage pipes. Garage lanes in category 1 and 2 of Manimajra Housing Complex, which have an initial design defect, get flooded every year. Despite regular appeals by the resident welfare association to the MC, and assurances by the successive chief engineers, a permanent solution is nowhere in sight.SC Luthra, Chandigarh No time for delaysThe MC should ensure that road gullies are cleaned without delay. Waste material and garbage too should be removed from near the rain water gutters and by the roads. Recarpeting , repair and patchwork on all the roads should be done immediately. All obstructions should be removed from pavements with ease of movement for pedestrians. Streetlights should also be repaired or replaced. Drainage systems near all roundabouts should be cleaned and waste removed from public dustbins. Areas around public places, including the main markets (especially the grain market), should be cleaned regularly.Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, MohaliDon’t expect miraclesWith revenues drying up and administration and Central government slashing budgets for the coming months, MC officials have no way out and cannot carry out any project in the current financial year. Even when the MC had enough money in hand, there was no relief for its residents from monsoon woes and to expect the same in the epidemic year is asking for a miracle. Any project this year will be written off and people will face the same problems this time too.Suresh Verma, ChandigarhSome areas need workSome areas in the city need work. The MC has to ensure that all damaged roads are repaired and drains are cleaned with no water stagnation anywhere to prevent mosquito breeding.Divanshi Bansal, Chandigarh Prevention of water-borne diseases important The tricity is definitely not ready to face the monsoon. Open drains, uncovered manholes, dug up roads and road gullies full of mud and choked with polythene bags and dry leaves have made residents’ lives hell. The monsoon showers as usual will bring the city to a grinding halt with most of the roundabouts, parking lots and streets flooded with rain water. Swift action needs to be taken to clean road gullies to avoid waterlogging. Infections and rainy season go hand in hand. The issue of water-borne diseases is more about prevention than care. The summer is already here, so first of all clean water should be made available to the residents. Dr Shruti K ChawlaPrune trees, repair damaged drains immediatelyDamaged and leaking drains should be repaired. Potholes should be filled up before the monsoon season as driving gets to be a nightmare and risks of accidents increase. Tiles around the trees should be removed because they weaken the grip of the tree’s roots and often lead to the uprooting of trees during a storm. The trees should be pruned because falling branches too cause injuries to pedestrians. To prevent water-borne diseases defogging drives should be conducted and stagnant water should be cleared. Awareness should be created among the people about not allowing water to stagnate and taking other such measures. Saikrit Gulati, ChandigarhEffective planning need of the hoursRecarpeting of roads has been deferred till the end of the monsoons. The authorities woke from their slumber only when waterlogging was reported in various parts of the city after a recent deluge. Road gullies, manholes and sewage lines need to be cleaned well before the monsoons, but it took the recent flooding to wake the authorities concerned from their slumber. Effective planning is the need of the hour to face the monsoons. SK Khosla, ChandigarhCover the drainsHope something is done to cover the drains. Fines should be imposed on people who are careless with garbage disposal.Yasmin D Khosla, PanchkulaCheck power linesAccording to data, around 30 people die in India due to electrocution in a single day, but in the rainy season, the risk of electrical shocks are doubled, so power lines and junctions should be checked on priority before the rains. Priyam Aggarwal, ChandigarhEngineers, MC officials should be held accountable got lapsesTop engineers of Chandigarh administration and of the MC should be answerable for the fact that problems such as waterlogging and choking of drains keep recurring in a modern, well planned city with no concrete action plan made in decades. The storm water drainage system has virtually collapsed as it is unable to contain rainwater. Flooding and caving in of roads, potholes and erosion of road surface are common in the monsoon. These are death traps for commuters and also result in traffic snarls and accidents. Things can improve if the authorities sincerely want to make this city world class and put in real efforts to upgrade its design.

03-07-2020||City||Gurugram: Classes for college students may be given out via TV, radio||Gurugram: The state higher education department is exploring multiple options, including radio, television, and web-based platforms for disseminating lessons as colleges remain closed in view of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. On Thursday, the department issued an order to colleges stating that it is planning to telecast lectures of all subjects for the academic session of 2020-21 and had appointed nodal officers for the same.Earlier this week, the department had said that plans were underway to transmit lessons via radio for students who didn’t have access to smart devices for digital lessons. Along with radio, the telecast of lessons is aimed at increasing the reach of the remote-learning campaign. Nodal officers appointed by the department have been asked to identify resource persons who will be delivering lessons in different subjects across the state. The selected resource persons have been asked to submit videos of lectures to the department before July 15.Dr Hemant Verma, deputy director, higher education, said that the department was working on various options that could be used to disseminate lectures to students and television broadcast was one among them. “We are working on multiple options that can be used for continuing lessons till colleges remain closed. Besides radio, we are also working on online development and delivery of content. We may also use television channels or Edusat channels for reaching out to students. Plans are being chalked out and once the details are finalised, we will be able to initiate transmission,” said Verma.Pooja Khullar, principal of Dronacharya Government College, said that the department was planning to revive Edusat channels for colleges, and teachers have been asked to create lectures for the same. “Many years back, Edusat channels used to be run across colleges. These channels are now being revived to ensure that lessons can be transmitted to students in the current circumstances. Lessons will be delivered through radio and there is a possibility that these lectures might also be telecast on TV. Schools have used this model and a similar model might be put in place for college students,” said Khullar.Satyamanyu Yadav, the principal of Government College in Sector 9, said that Edusat channels can be revived without much hassle as most colleges are equipped with the needed infrastructure. “Edusat channels used to work some years back but had become defunct due to various reasons. The infrastructure for disseminating these lectures is already available in the college and the equipment that was not functioning is being made operational again. More students will be able to access the lessons with video transmission,” said Yadav.The department has also asked colleges to provide data on students who don’t have access to smartphones. Khullar said the issue of digital divide had recently come up during a meeting where principals had said that many students didn’t have access to smartphones for online lessons. “Colleges have a science fund as part of which students get a grant. During a recent meeting, a representative had suggested that smart phones could be provided to students for online classes. Most students, especially girls, don’t have phones. The department is trying to work on improving accessibility and various options are being explored,” said Khullar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-classes-for-college-students-may-be-given-out-via-tv-radio/story-xlIHqmvLpf4kn2HeYHF3UP.html

The students can apply to their parent institution with a copy to university for change of centre, it added.“They issued a notification to lure us that the students may opt for any centre they want and there was no mention about any kind of fees for this. But now, they are forcing students to pay Rs 5,000 for this which is a huge amount,” DSAP said in a statement.Dr Raj Bahadur, vice-chancellor, BFUHS said that no fee has been asked to be charged from students, who are opting to change examination centre.Sources, however, said this happened due to random online system and university has taken up the matter with competent authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bfuhs-charging-5-000-for-changing-exam-centre-allege-dental-students/story-ivRru6hum9tajhYOc049mO.html
03-07-2020||Gurugram||53% of Covid-19 patients in city hospitals from outside Gurugram||Over half of the 327 Covid-19 patients in Gurugram’s hospitals are those who are residents outside the district. Out of the 40 hospitals, where more than 1486 beds have been reserved for Covid-19 treatment, there are 173 coronavirus patients from outside the district.Data from hospitals on Thursday showed that 76 were from Delhi, 42 from Uttar Pradesh, 33 from other parts of the country, 21 from other districts of Haryana and one foreign national -- together making 53% of Gurugram’s hospitalisations. The list, officials said, is incomplete as some hospitals were yet to provide information.The district health department on Friday confirmed 130 new Covid-19 cases, taking the total count of the persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus in Gurugram to 5,699. Out of these, 1,178 are active cases, while 4,425 people have recovered. The number of fatalities due to Covid-19 stood at 96 with 60 deaths being attributed to co-morbidity issues.Union home minister Amit Shah in a meeting with the chief ministers of Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh on Thursday had advised the states to coordinate their response to the Covid-19 outbreak by focusing on timely hospital access. Earlier, Shah said that the Delhi-NCR has to be considered as one unit for the Covid-19 management. Four major cities – Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad and Gurugram – together have over 100,000 cases.In Gurugram, the district administration had directed at least 40 hospitals to reserve 25% of their total bed capacity for patients infected with Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19. The city has 4000 hospital beds, out of which 1486 beds are for Covid-19 patients. Out of the total available beds, 130 beds are allocated in three government hospitals -- All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Jhajjar (50 beds), ESIC Hospital in sector 9 (58) and Polyclinic in sector 31 (22). “There are 679 Intensive Care Units (ICU) beds and 327 ventilators, out of which 192 ICU beds and 92 beds with ventilators are reserved to manage Covid-19 cases in the city,” said Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, on Friday while addressing the media. “Utilisation of beds for Covid-19 is a dynamic process. The district has enough availability of beds, more than to treat patients,” he said.Vivek Kalia, nodal officer for Covid-19 hospital management, said, “Post analysing the data being received from the hospitals, we can surely say that substantial Covid positives are preferring home isolation. Besides, more than 50% of the patients presently hospitalised in Gurugram hospitals are from out of district which clearly reflects faith people have in the city’s medical facilities.” Of the 1178 active cases in the city, 797 patients are in home isolation, 53 in district Covid care centres and 328 in isolation facilities and hospitals.Kalia said, “There should be no suspicion, apprehension and fear among residents about bed availability and district’s preparedness to tackle the Covid-19 situation.”Gurugram is one of the first few cities to treat initial Covid-19 patients, including 14 Italian tourists who were detected to be positive with coronavirus in March and were admitted in Medanta Medicity. Patients from other parts of the city were also admitted in other big hospitals.A senior state official privy to the matter, said, “Patients coming to Gurugram for treatment is not a matter of concern as we have enough beds available for the treatment. In case, there is a surge in the number of critical care patients, the issue will be taken up by officials in the state and central government.”Amit Sharma, founder and CEO of eExpedise Healthcare, Gurugram-based company that is involved in medical tourism, said that in the last decade the city had emerged as an important destination for domestic and International patients. “The city has quality care. Due to high spending capacity, people want that quality treatment. Therefore, many of the private hospitals offer five-star care this means they offer luxury rooms, preferential diet, and personalised care.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/53-of-covid-19-patients-in-city-hospitals-from-outside-gurugram/story-B5sqyJWV5I5kyfVLs87PKM.html
03-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram records 130 new cases of Covid-19, ramps up testing||The district health department on Friday confirmed 130 new Covid-19 cases, taking the total count of the persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus in Gurugram to 5,699. Out of these, 1,178 are active cases, while 4,425 people have recovered. The number of fatalities due to Covid-19 stood at 96 with 60 deaths being attributed to co-morbidity issues.Out of the active cases, 797 are currently in home isolation, 53 are in district Covid care centres, and 327 have hospitalised. “In the last few days, there has been a slowdown in Covid-19 infection and the recovery rate has improved. At present the recovery rate of the district is 77%. Nearly 91% of the of those who are in home isolation do not have any health issues,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), in a press conference on Friday. Data shows that test positivity rate of the city has also come down to 12.4% which had touched 51% in the first week of June. Officials said that Covid-19 testing has increased substantially in the city, reaching a mark of more than 2,400 daily. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), said, “The plan is to conduct more than 2,000 tests every day. The number of positive cases might increase in the next few days and the positivity rate might vary. Cases will continue to be reported but the positivity rate has to be maintained between 5% to 8%.”On Friday, 2,402 samples were taken which included 552 samples taken by private labs and 1,850 by government labs. This number also includes the antigen testing. According to Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram’s testing rate is higher than other cities of the National Capital Region (NCR) cities. Ashok Sangwan, divisional commissioner, said that more people should get tested for Covid-19 as testing is the most effective way to contain the spread of the virus. “People who are suspicious of contracting the virus should get themselves tested after getting a prescription from a medical practitioner. They should be home isolated till they get the test results,” said Sangwan.Currently, Gurugram shares 29% burden of the active Covid-19 cases in Haryana. The state has till now reported 16,003 cases, out of which 4,057 are active while 11,691 have recovered. At least 255 deaths have been reported in the state so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-records-130-new-cases-of-covid-19-ramps-up-testing/story-F1TnMCniyeWIcDF4nUifvI.html
03-07-2020||Gurugram||Second round of serological survey to begin next week||The second round of serological survey to test the prevalence of the coronavirus disease among Gurugram’s residents will be held next week, health department officials said on Friday.The survey is being conducted to detect unreported cases as the person may have been asymptomatic and did not know they had contracted the virus. In the survey, a test called enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) will be used to detect antibodies that the body’s immune system produces to combat the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes the infection. The first round of 182 such tests were done by June 24 that found 32 persons positive.“We were given 460 ELISA kits, and still have 278 left. Most, if not all, will be used in the next survey exercise that will likely be held from Tuesday. We may also start on the weekend itself if preparations can be made,” said Dr. Ram Prakash, district epidemiologist. He added that the health department has begun compiling a list of individuals from whom blood samples will be sought. The tests will not be conducted at random“There are 20 categories that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines recommend for serological studies, from healthcare workers, frontline workers, people with compromised immunity, and those who have already had the disease before. We will be conducting the tests across the district, with some focus on large outbreak regions,” said Prakash.Experts explained that seropositive diagnoses are not helpful in determining the extent or severity of a patient’s infection, but is a valuable epidemiological tool to determine the prevalence of a disease within a community. An ICMR study conducted in 75 districts across the country, for example, found that less than one percent of the population – 0.73% - in non-containment zones had developed antibodies.However, such data has not yet been extrapolated in Gurugram. “A sample size of 182 people will not really give us a clear picture of prevalence. It is too small. We will take the reports from all 460 kits and analyse them to see how much of the district’s population has developed antibodies. By extrapolating the data, we would be able to say, with reasonable certainty, the total number of people who have been infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Gurugram,” said Prakash.According to Dr. Prabhakaran Dorairaj, vice president of research and policy at the Public Health Foundation of India, however, even 460 is quite small. “Even if the right kinds of subjects are selected, it will not adequately represent the whole of Gurugram’s population. If the goal is to get a correct picture of prevalence, then the department must first classify the district into two areas: old Gurugram and new Gurugram. Within these areas, you have to use socio-economic data at the ward level and census enumeration block level to create a sample representative of the larger demography of the city. That will tell you how prevalent the disease really is in Gurugram,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/second-round-of-serological-survey-to-begin-next-week/story-BpscnUwdkDeym7tXlZfxzI.html
03-07-2020||City||Gurugram: MCG to award RWAs sum for development if residents pay up property dues||Gurugram: If more than 80% residents in a particular locality have paid their property tax dues to the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), their respective Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) would be given 5% of the entire sum for setting up sanitation, waste segregation and composting plants.The announcement was made by MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh during a presser held at the John Hall in Civil Lines on Friday.Singh though later clarified that the amount to be given would not exceed a maximum of Rs 5 lakh per RWA, and that the incentive would be applicable to only those RWAs which have more than 500 properties in their areas.It is not the first time such an initiative has been announced by the civic agency for residents’ bodies. In May 2017, RWAs of sectors 4, 7 and 14, Shivaji Nagar, Shivpuri, Jal Vayu Vihar and Maruti Vihar received Rs 5 lakh each from the MCG for getting more than 80% of their residents to pay their property taxes.According to MCG officials privy to the matter, the move is beneficial for both the civic body and the RWAs as the latter will encourage residents to clear their property tax dues to get the 5% sum from the MCG.They further said that this move will help increase MCG’s revenue as parting with just 5% of the total sum will be a small fraction of the overall collection.“Our property tax collection this fiscal has been abysmal. We have only generated around Rs 18 crore since April. Hence, we have introduced this incentive to boost our overall collection,” said an MCG official privy to the matter, asking not to be named.The MCG commissioner said that the move “is an incentive to not only encourage RWAs to get their residents to clear their property dues but also to improve aspects of sanitation and waste mechanisms in their respective areas.”Some RWAs have already started preparations for this.“We will be conducting a meeting via video conference on Monday to discuss the necessary formalities needed for procuring the 5% sum from the MCG, as more than 80% of our residents have paid their property dues. In the meeting, we will also be exploring the different ways we can use the sum to improve sanitation, waste segregation and composting units in our locality,” said Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson for DLF Qutub Enclave RWA.During the press conference, the MCG commissioner also said that the Haryana government has given a 30% rebate on property tax to residents which can be availed till July 31.PLANTATION DRIVEThe MCG commissioner also said that the MCG is undertaking a plantation drive from July 27 to August 2 for which RWAs and NGOs have demanded more than 85,000 saplings from the civic body.He said that overall, 245 requests were received from RWA and NGOs, in which they had demanded 85,000 thousand saplings for plantation and last week, while 8,500 saplings were planted in the first drive, held on June 27 and 28, in collaboration with 29 RWAs.The MCG has four nurseries in the city, located at Biodiversity Park, Kadipur village, Sector 15 Part I, and Sector 46, from which RWAs and NGOs are being distributed with saplings of ornamental shrubs, medicinal and native plants and trees by the civic body, free of cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-mcg-to-award-rwas-sum-for-development-if-residents-pay-up-property-dues/story-FvUJyxvK5NdkOHYGy9CWcO.html
03-07-2020||Delhi||Construction workers should not be denied benefits due to change in address: Delhi High Court||The Delhi High Court has directed the state government to not collect the present address of construction workers or the Aadhaar details of their family at the time of their registration with the welfare board.A bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar said that the Delhi government’s Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare (BOCWW) Board was not justified in seeking these details. The court said that the workers were mostly migrants and, therefore, they may change their address every time they take up new jobs. “The Board should, therefore, not require the applicants to provide their present address and, instead, should be satisfied by requiring the applicants to disclose the name, address and registration number of the establishment where the applicant is working,” the bench said.The court’s order comes while hearing a plea by social worker Sunil Kumar Aledia filed through his advocate Shiven Verma, seeking directions to the Delhi government to provide relief to workers and labourers, including cash transfers, to all who had registered in the last two years. On Thursday, advocate Shyel Trehan, who had also filed an application claiming that the benefits of various schemes for the construction workers was not being implemented, said that the registration forms have been asking for the “Present address” of the workers. She also said that the details sought also include the aadhaar card details of the family members.Appearing for the Delhi government , its additional standing counsel Sanjoy Ghose, told the court that the move was taken in case the Board comes up with some scheme for the benefit of family members of the applicant. He submitted that there are schemes for providing benefits to the children of construction workers for their education, marriage, etc.However, the court said that the details when there is rush as well as urgency for grant of renewal of registrations due to the pandemic, the collection of information about the family members with their Aadhar Cards details should be suspended, at least, in respect of those applicants who are seeking renewal of their lapsed registration.Advocate Trehan told the court that in rural parts of India, dates of birth may not be correctly recorded and known to the applicants and quite often, the dates of birth are randomly filled by the applicants even while obtaining their Adhaar Cards. Hence there can be mismatch in the dates of birth as disclosed in the Adhaar Card, and in the application form.The court said that the officers, in such cases, should call the concerned person and resolve the problems. It asked the Board to make necessary changes in the application form and said that changes should also be brought in the website considering that it has to deal with lakhs of workmen. It said that the Board has sufficient funds and hence there should not be any difficulty in the updating the system.The bench said that the Board should make endeavour to reduce the requirement of uploading documents only to the bare minimum for the purpose of registration/ renewal of registration.“For the purpose of renewal, the Board should not require submission of documents, which the applicants have submitted at the time of initial registration,” the court said. It also asked Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA) to look into the aspect of appointing volunteers for helping in the registration process after Secretary DSLSA Kanwaljeet Arora told the court that he can appoint 100 lawyers for the purpose.The matter would be now heard on July 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/construction-workers-should-not-be-denied-benefits-due-to-change-in-address-delhi-high-court/story-dJzt8mMrlH9dqOcf9qDtFK.html
03-07-2020||Delhi||HC declines plea seeking mandatory plasma donation||The Delhi High Court declined to entertain a plea that sought to make obtaining plasma from patients who had recovered from Covid-19, either at home or at a hospital, mandatory. It asked the Delhi government to treat the plea as representation. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan said that people could not be coerced to give an undertaking to donate plasma before receiving treatment for Covid-19 and it had to be voluntary.“We cannot force people to donate plasma. Treatment cannot be forceful. What kind of world we are imagining?” Justice Jalan remarked during the hearing.Appearing for the petitioner, his counsel claimed that the Centre and Delhi government were not taking effective steps to ensure sufficient availability of plasma to treat Covid-19 patients. However, the court said that it could not pass such directions and added, “Suffice it to say [the plea] would be treated as representation on the basis of the law and procedure. The respondent shall also look into the suggestion of the petitioner in accordance with the rules and regulations and procedure of the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-declines-plea-seeking-mandatory-plasma-donation/story-vQCvxOhmhAy2mPBECVn66N.html
03-07-2020||Chandigarh||Former PRTC MD to help Pbi varsity tide over financial crisis||A former bureaucrat has been appointed honorary adviser to vice-chancellor Prof BS Ghuman to help Punjabi University, Patiala, to tide over the financial crisis. A retired IAS officer, Manjit Singh Narang, who is credited with changing the fortunes of the Pepsu Road Transport Corporation three years ago, will not charge any money and will also not receive any perks and official vehicle for his new assignment. Narang retired in 2019.The university issued orders regarding Narang’s appointment in anticipation that it will be approved by the syndicate. This is for the first time since the university’s inception that an adviser has been appointed to assist V-C in financial matters. “I will help the university find ways to improve its financial condition. I am already in touch with the varsity authorities and will likely join by next week,” said Narang.During his stint as managing director of the PRTC from 2016 to 2019, Narang brought the corporation back on track by not only clearing its liabilities worth Rs 200 crore, but also turning it a money-spinning undertaking from an operational loss of Rs 5.6 crore in 2019.During his tenure in the PRTC, Narang resolved court cases regarding liabilities of pensioners of over Rs 150 crore. Narang first initiated with replacing around 400 old buses with new ones, besides ensuring plying of full fleet of 1,073 buses, besides ensuring that a proper route time table is followed. Besides, an increase in daily receipts and operating on monopoly routes, helped PRTC come out of the red. One of the officials said the department of higher education has roped in the former bureaucrat to look at the university finances. The fund-starved university is not able to meet its monthly committed expenditure, including salaries and pensions.“The department has already briefed Narang about his role which is mainly to advise the university on income generation, besides working upon austerity measures to curtail expenses. Narang has been asked to work in coordination with vice-chancellor and other senior functionaries to revive varsity’s finances,” he said.However, the move has invited criticism from professors and student bodies. “We are not against any individual but condemn the varsity administration for creating such post to cover up its failures in handling the situation,” said Prof Kesar Singh Bhangoo from the department of economics.As per budgetary proposals for this fiscal, the varsity expects an income of ₹380 crore, while the expenditure is pegged at ₹676 crore, leaving a massive ₹296-crore deficit. The university also has an overdraft of ₹140 crore, which is expected to touch ₹150 crore by the end of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/former-prtc-md-to-help-pbi-varsity-tide-over-financial-crisis/story-UOgbP2MOdM6xN94JcCGTQL.html

03-07-2020||Chandigarh||HOUSE-TO-HOUSE SURVEILLANCE: Punjab starts testing all Covid-19 symptomatic patients for tuberculosis||The Punjab government on Friday decided to conduct medical tests for tuberculosis (TB), a serious bacterial disease that affects the lungs, along with the Covid-19 tests of all symptomatic patients in the state.The health officials say since people get similar symptoms for Covid-19 and TB and as both the diseases are fatal, Covid-19 symptomatic people in the state will now also be tested for TB. Also, the patients who will first get tested for TB, will have to get Covid-19 tests done. “In June, the Punjab health department had launched a door-to-door campaign to medically screen all residents in the state for Covid-19 as part of a community surveillance project. Under this house-to-house surveillance project, the Covid-19 symptomatic patents are being tested for the disease and the state government is maintaining a record of co-morbidities of every person, above the age of 30. In an effort to detect the tuberculosis patients in the state at an early stage, the medical teams will now conduct tuberculosis tests for every Covid-19 symptomatic patients,” said state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar.As per data from the health department, Punjab had recorded 58,000 tuberculosis cases in 2019 on an average. Also, over 2,000 people in the state die of tuberculosis every year.“Since people diagnosed with tuberculosis suffer from cough and fever, and Covid-19 infection also shows similar symptoms, there is a high chance that Covid-19 patients also suffer from TB, or vice versa. Under the surveillance project, the health department has already screened over 39 lakh population in the state, till now, and has maintained their record. Many symptomatic people were tested for Covid-19 and among them, some were tested positive,” said Dr Bhaskar.“The medical teams in all districts have been directed to conduct tuberculosis tests along with Covid-19. The tuberculosis tests and treatment is also free of cost from the government hospitals. The 39 lakh population will not be tested again but if anyone will show symptoms, they will be tested for both diseases. We aim to complete the surveillance project till July 15”, Dr Bhaskar added.LUDHIANA WORST HIT WITH TB “Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, many of tuberculosis patients remained undiagnosed and this is a worrisome situation as the disease has serious outcomes and can increase transmission in the community. As per records, 182 people after every one lakh population in Amritsar are TB patients. Ludhiana, with 190 persons per lakh population, is the worst-affected district in the state,” said Dr Naresh Chawla, nodal officer for TB in Amritsar, adding that on average, district records 425 TB cases, every month.Till now, 9 lakh people of Amritsar have been screened through the state’s surveillance project. Of them, 3,638 people tested for Covid-19, out of which 117 were tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/house-to-house-surveillance-punjab-starts-testing-all-covid-19-symptomatic-patients-for-tuberculosis/story-yhkgP1vFQcT9drOm9rPVcP.html

By introducing Happiness Curriculum, Mission Buniyaad and Entrepreneurship Mindset Curriculum, we tried to connect education with the life of children. I’m proud we are taking steps in the right direction.”Both government and private schools are physically shut since March in view of the pandemic. The classes, however, have continued virtually through different mediums such as video-conferencing, audio and video lessons.LEAD will make textbooks, study material and course content as per the syllabus of CBSE, NCERT and Delhi government’s curriculum accessible to students. Support study material produced by Delhi government teachers will also be available on this portal. Through this portal, developed by the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT), the Delhi government will upload its curriculum on the ministry of Human Resource Development’s (HRD) online platform, Diksha. “It is a way for us to connect and share our programmes and experiences with the entire country. The online portal will enable us to learn from the teaching-learning experiments and experiences of other states. It is going to be a mutual sharing and enlightening experience for us all,” Sisodia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-launches-e-portal-for-its-students/story-5Vq79SYPgRDhugvZlXHq1N.html
03-07-2020||Chandigarh||Pilot project for Covid rapid antigen testing from next week in Punjab||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday gave the go-ahead for launching a pilot project for Covid-19 rapid antigen testing from the coming week.On the successful completion of the pilot rapid antigen project, which will cover a minimum of 1,000 tests, such testing would be done on the migrants coming back to the state in the wake of reopening of industries and for work in paddy fields.The state government will procure rapid antigen testing kits to scale up its Covid testing capacity, which is even now higher than the Government of India mandate of 140 tests per million per day in regions with positivity factor of less than 10%.With positivity rate of just 2%, Punjab is already conducting 242 tests per million per day.PEOPLE COMING FROM OTHER STATES TO REGISTER ON COVA APP Notwithstanding the Government of India’s revised guidelines replacing home quarantine for domestic travellers with self-monitoring, the CM ruled out any such move in Punjab in view of the large number of people coming to the state every day from Delhi/NCR, where cases were currently spiralling.The CM also made it clear that no vehicle should be allowed to enter Punjab without a stringent monitoring mechanism in place. He was reviewing the Covid situation and preparedness in the state with senior government and health officials through video conference.Chief secretary Vini Mahajan assured the CM that strict monitoring would be ensured of all entrants, with private players being roped in to ensure implementation of home quarantine with phone-based monitoring and regular visits.Further, all entrants to the state would be required to mandatorily register themselves either on the COVA app or the government web portal, and the registration certificate, with bar code, should be carried on the vehicle windscreen. Those without the certificate print-out on their car screens would be stopped and made to register on the spot, at the border, before proceeding, she said, adding that with requirement of passes done away with in Unlock 2.0 by the Government of India, e-registration would help in monitoring and tracking of incoming domestic travellers.The chief secretary further said that with the Government of India gradually withdrawing from supply of PPE kits and medicines etc to states, and Punjab receiving only Rs 72 crore so far this year, the CM may need to intervene in seeking additional funds and continuation of supplies from the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pilot-project-for-covid-rapid-antigen-testing-from-next-week-in-punjab/story-gwcUqpvvArReilyHRUdn3J.html
03-07-2020||City||9pm deadline, ban on serving liquor eating into sales of Ludhiana restaurants||Ten days after the state government allowed restaurants to resume dine-in services, while most in Ludhiana continue to keep their doors closed due to low footfall, those open say the response is far from satisfactory.Though the district administration recently extended the business hours to 9pm, restaurateurs say the timings are still not conducive for the dinner service, when most customers normally turn up, while others stay away during the day due to the searing heat.As per the standard operating procedure (SOP) to contain the spread of Covid-19, the Punjab department of home affairs had allowed dine-in facility at restaurants with only 50% occupancy or 50 guests, whichever is less, from June 24, provided they comply with social distancing and other guidelines prescribed by the Union health ministry. Earlier, restaurants could only offer takeaway or home delivery.But, business owners say they are not even getting 20% of the normal footfall.Vishal Malhotra, proprietor of Bistro Flamme Bois, Pakhowal Road, said, “Low response is majorly due to unsuitable timings. Majority of our patrons are businessmen and industrialists. If they close their shops or factories at 8pm, how can they arrive at restaurants with family before 9pm?”Owner of Basant Restaurants, Bhupinder Basant said, “We have opened only the unit at Feroze Gandhi market in anticipation of poor response. We are also dealing with shortage of workers. Residents are still cautious of fear of infection, and are therefore, still preferring home delivery or takeaway.”Government’s prohibition on opening bars is also putting a dent in restaurants’ business. “Confusion still prevails in the market on whether liquor can be served or not, due to which we have not resumed the service,” said Sachin Goyal, owner of Penthouse on Ferozepur Road.Deputy excise and taxation commissioner Pawan Garg said, “Liquor can be served at restaurants situated in hotels, but not at individual restaurants.President of the Ludhiana Hotel and Restaurants Association, Amarvir Singh said, “Most of the lounges in the city are closed as bars are not allowed to open. Many restaurant owners have followed suit to avoid losses, while others have limited their services to home delivery.”A new dining experience Visiting restaurants with the safety protocols in place is proving to be a new experience for dine-in customers.“Though the usual hustle bustle is missing, the peaceful ambience is welcome. It’s refreshing to step out with family for a culinary experience after months of home isolation. But, one should take precautions,” said Sandeep Singh, a customer at The Table by Basant in Feroze Gandhi market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/9pm-deadline-ban-on-serving-liquor-eating-into-sales-of-ludhiana-restaurants/story-94U9hDwobbw3osjW23ilYJ.html
03-07-2020||Noida||Met predicts light rain today||Mercury levels are likely to drop by two to three degrees by Saturday evening, bringing much-needed respite from the heat, along with moderate rain in the Noida region, the weather department predicted on Friday.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Noida, Ghaziabad and other parts of western Uttar Pradesh, which so far have largely been deprived of rain despite early arrival of monsoon, will see ‘light’ rain towards Saturday evening and ‘moderate’ or ‘good’ rainfall towards Sunday.“Light rain is expected towards Saturday evening in Noida and adjoining regions, while Sunday and Monday can experience moderate or good rain. Rainfall is likely to continue for a few more days after that. This will bring respite by bringing the mercury down. We expect a drop in mercury by at least two degrees by Saturday, while on Sunday the maximum temperatures will drop further by at least five degrees,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.On Friday, the maximum temperature for Noida stood at 41.6 degrees Celsius, five notches above the season’s average, against 39.7 degrees a day earlier. The minimum temperature was recorded at 30.4 degrees Celsius, three notches above the season’s average against 29 degrees a day earlier. Saturday is likely to see maximum temperature of 39 degrees Celsius.According to the weather department, while the first week of monsoon has turned out to be a ‘weak-phase’ for the region, rainfall would oscillate between light and moderate till July 15 and pick up intensity only after that.“The monsoon, for this region, had been going through a weak phase. It depends on a lot of weather conditions, including the trough line or pressure line which is currently over southern Rajasthan and slowly moving towards north. So, by Saturday evening we expect it to arrive in this region, and most of the parts of western Uttar Pradesh and Delhi-NCR. For a few days, the region will see rain, however proper rainfall of moderate to heavy category will only come to the region after July 15 and last till August 30,” said Srivastava.Rainfall recorded below 15mm is considered light, between 15 and 64.5 mm is moderate, and above 64.5mm is heavy.The IMD had announced the early arrival of monsoon, with officials stating that its first time in the past four years that due to the favourable weather conditions winds, etc, the monsoon arrived earlier than usual.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/met-predicts-light-rain-today/story-j7SiwCSMr0NHknxCArfnjL.html
03-07-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab’s GST collection improves, registers 69% jump over May||In what signals a pick-up in economic activity after two months of national lockdown, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection in Punjab posted an increase of 69% in June 2020 over the previous month.The state government has reported the collection of Rs 869.66 crore in June as against Rs 515 crore in May. The June figure is 8.36% lower than the GST revenue in the same month of 2019 when the state’s collection, including both state goods and services tax (SGST) and integrated goods and services tax (IGST), stood at Rs 949 crore, according to the data available with the taxation department.This gap was a lot wider in May when the GST collection was 48.4% short of last year’s Rs 998 crore. In April, the state’s goods and services tax had dived by 85.63%, going to Rs 156 crore from Rs 1,086 crore in the corresponding month last year.The upswing in collections came as the state government started partially easing the coronavirus-induced lockdown in phases in May to open the markets and industry. The tax collection numbers are being widely seen as the first sign of a revival of economic activity even though the business sentiment in several sectors, including hospitality, travel, and tourism continues to be abysmal.An indirect tax expert, however, said that any conclusion on the extent of economic recovery based on the goods and services tax collections of the past three months would be a hasty one as more data needs to be analysed. He said the collection figure of a month does not reflect the revenue of that month alone as the central government had extended the deadline for filing returns with interest given the Covid-19 situation.“A detailed analysis of collections for February to June after all the returns are filed can give a more accurate picture. However, the sense of despondency that had set in at one stage is not there now. There is cautious optimism for the future,” he added.Amid the present crisis, the improved collections will be a financial relief for the cash-strapped state government that has had to rely heavily on market borrowings to meet its spending needs, particularly fixed liabilities such as salaries, pensions, and debt servicing.In the first three months the current financial year, about Rs 4,200 crore, including Rs 1,600 crore in June were raised from the market through the auction of government securities. The release of GST compensation of Rs 2,866 crore for the months of December 2019 and January and February 2020 in the first week of June also helped.The Punjab government had imposed curfew – one of the first states to take the drastic action – on March 23 to check the spread of Covid-19. The state’s announcement was followed by a 21-day national lockdown the day, paralysing most of the economic activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-s-gst-collection-improves-registers-69-jump-over-may/story-M45GKJYllG87TLScRWYBuK.html
03-07-2020||Noida||Bringing relief to allottees, Noida reduces interest rate on property dues||Following a state government’s directive, the Noida authority on Friday said it will start levying a lower interest rate of 8.5% on dues on properties that include residential plots, industrial plots, institutional plots and others except for group housing land. Earlier the interest rate was 9.5 % and even higher for some properties which were allotted by the Noida authority. The state government had issued an order on June 9 directing the Noida authority to lower the interest rate on dues against property allotments. The revised interest rate, which the authority expects will help in recovering dues, will be applicable on payments from July 1.“We will start charging interest rates of 8.50 % beginning July 1 as per the current marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) of State Bank of India (SBI). This rate will applicable till December end, 2020 as the MCLR will remain same for this year and is up for revision next year,” said Ritu Maheshwari chief executive officer, Noida authority. The MCLR fixed by SBI is 7.3 % and the authority has imposed 1 % additional charge as administrative expenses on it and the interest rate has been fixed at the round figure of 8.5%, said the order issued by the authority.“It is quite a big relief to allottees old and new, who have outstanding dues to pay. Earlier the interest rate was not as per the existing MCLR,” said Surendra Nahta, president of Micro Small Medium Enterprise Association (Noida).“The step is taken to encourage the allottees to pay dues so that we can recover our revenue. We hope allottees will take benefit of this order,” said Maheshwari. The authority, however, is yet to order a lower interest rate on payments against group housing land. On June 10, the Supreme Court had ordered the Noida and Greater Noida authorities to charge only 8% interest on due payments against group housing land. The interest rates on group housing rates would often go up to 15-23% after the authorities levied more interest on late payments. Developers had moved the apex court demanding lower interest rates claiming that high rate of interest would render their realty projects non-profitable. Noida authority officials said they are still examining the court order and are yet to take a call on revising interest levied on payments against group housing land.The authority allots land for residential, institutional (school, college or other educational projects or MNCs), industrial projects and among others on instalment basis. After accepting 30% of the land cost, it allots the land and also gives possession of the same to the successful allottee. The allottee can pay the remaining 70% in instalments within three years time at an interest of 8.5% (earlier 9.5%). If an allottee defaults on the instalments, then a 3% compound interest is added to base simple interest, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/bringing-relief-to-allottees-noida-reduces-interest-rate-on-property-dues/story-aPpSWt7waLtcJKrkuEzf2L.html
03-07-2020||Chandigarh||Admn submits report to Centre on Faridkot farmer burning cane crop||The Faridkot administration has submitted a report to the Centre on an incident wherein a farmer from Sadiq village in the district burnt his standing sugarcane crop on 2 acres of land. Jagtar Singh, who was unable to find buyers for his crop due to the lockdown, had set his crop on fire on June 30. In the absence of any sugar mill in the area, he used to sell cane to juice sellers. But he had no buyers left as they too were out of business for the past over three months.After the incident, the Union ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare had sought a report from the district administration.“The government of India asked to submit a report over the incident. The report was prepared with assistance of agriculture department and it was submitted to the union ministry on Thursday. As paddy season was on the peak, the farmer wanted to clear his field to sow paddy. He was not able to sell the standing crop,” said deputy commissioner Vimal Kumar Setia. AGRICULTURE DEPT TO HELP THE FARMERChief agriculture officer Harnek Singh Rode said it was a very unfortunate incident that a farmer burned his sugarcane crop as he failed to find buyer for the crop. “The district agriculture department has decided to assist the farmer to sow paddy crop in his fields. The department will provide saplings of paddy crop, pesticides and weedicides to him free of cost. A team has visited the village and assured him all kind of assistance,” he said.“As there are many other farmers in this area who grow sugarcane, we have proposed that cooperative societies should be asked to set up small jaggery manufacturing units all over the district. There is high demand of jaggery in the state so it will provide farmers a platform to sell their produce,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/admn-submits-report-to-centre-on-faridkot-farmer-burning-cane-crop/story-0MlmX5wL9fp0XlzV4w1BfM.html
03-07-2020||Noida||GB Nagar to scale up antigen tests to make up for slow RT-PCR||The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration on Friday announced it would scale up rapid antigen testing taking into account the limitations of the slower RT-PCR testing.The Uttar Pradesh government had tasked the district to target 1,000 on-site antigen testing and 3,000 lab-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test every day during the 10-day special drive to test every household in the district.“But, the laboratories testing samples through RT-PCR in the district are not able to incorporate such a huge influx of RT-PCR samples every day due to its limited capacities, we have decided to increase the testing through rapid antigen kits to its optimum level. Also, the reports of rapid antigen kits come within some hours,” said GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY .At present, the district can process 2,000 RT-PCR tests in a day, he added. “That is why, we have decided to increase the rapid antigen test to meet the stipulated target of sampling 4,000 persons a day. Out of 1695 samples collected through rapid antigen kits on Friday, 52 samples tested positive. Our teams have also collected 1,519 samples through RT-PCR tests and their results will come in a few days. Apart from this,two samples have also been taken through TrueNat machines, of which no one was tested positive,” the DM said. Around 1333 teams were deployed for the exercise.TrueNat test is usually used to detect tuberculosis and the Indian Council of Medical Research had recommended this also for widening the range of options for testing Covid-19 patients. The DM said with the help of 1,500 surveillance teams and 40 sample collection teams formed for the special drive, the district will reach its target of collecting 4,000 samples a day soon. “Surveillance team comprises three civil volunteers and at least one ASHA or other auxiliary health worker, conducts door-to-door surveys to collect information on people with symptoms of the coronavirus disease,” he said. About the 40 sampling collection teams – each of them comprising at least one doctor, one health worker and some support staff, Suhas said that they have been properly trained. “They have been asked to maintain the cold chain as the kits get spoiled in a temperature above 30 degree Celsius. They are taking samples carefully as the mercury has risen up these days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-to-scale-up-antigen-tests-to-make-up-for-slow-rt-pcr/story-zlDGGq5rsDgwlgTzlO9gFJ.html
03-07-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Now, more cases coming up in Punjab’s urban pockets||With the opening up of commercial and other activities, more Covid-19 cases are being reported in the urban pockets of Punjab as compared to the rural areas, reveals the latest data of the health department.While the state’s cities and towns had only 20% of the total cases till April, the figure went up to 32% by June-end.State Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said, “Till April, the rural areas were home to around 80% of the total cases. But with the commercial activities resuming and the state and the central governments issuing guidelines to increase timings of movement, the urban segments have witnessed more cases in May and June.”Till mid-May, more cases were recorded in rural areas as majority of the patients at the time were Sikh pilgrims from Maharashtra’s Nanded who returned to their villages.“As wheat harvesting was also on, the migrant workers who had come from other states also contributed to the infection tally in rural areas till April. That is why 20% of the patients were from urban areas with majority of them having come from overseas,” said the nodal officer.He said the biggest reason behind the surge in cases in urban segments is the violation of social-distancing norms in crowed places.MAJORITY OF CONTAINMENT ZONES IN TOWNS, CITIESThe health department has classified various zones in the state according to the reported number of cases. Whereas a locality with 2-4 cases is categorised as a cluster, the areas with 5-14 cases are declared as micro-containment zone. On the other hand, the areas with more than 15 cases are declared containment zone.At present, the state’s all four large outbreaks are in the urban pockets of Sangrur, Amritsar and Ludhiana. Of Punjab’s 34 containment zones, 20 are in towns and cities with most of the cases there having surfaced in June, shows the data.“Almost all these areas in urban or semi-urban areas are crowded as they have high-population density. As people living in these areas venture out to earn livelihood, the risk of getting infected is more,” a department health official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-now-more-cases-coming-up-in-punjab-s-urban-pockets/story-2JveCU47SzuEWgPnBri3SI.html

The suspect, who lived in the same neighbourhood, has been arrested by the police.The police said that victim and his daughter were alone in the house when the suspect, identified as Shafir (single name) entered it around 3am. He inflicted multiple stabbing wounds on the man, Abdullah, first and then strangled the minor after she woke up hearing her father’s cries so that he could not be identified later, they added.“The suspect is the nephew of the victim and was reportedly involved with the latter’s wife. A couple of months ago, the victim came to know about their relationship and objected to it. He also denied entry to the suspect in his house. All this infuriated the suspect and he murdered the man and his daughter,” said Keshav Kumar, circle officer Sahibabad.Abdullah ran a grocery shop on the ground floor of his rented house. His wife had gone to her parent’s house in Hapur with their three other children some three or four days ago.“Seeing an opportunity, the suspect planned the murder. After the double murder was discovered, police took help of electronic surveillance and also scanned the footage of nearby CCTV cameras to nab the suspect. We came to know that the suspect maintained regular touch with the victim’s wife over the phone. After he was called for questioning, he broke down and narrated the entire murder plot,” Kumar added.The body of the two victims was discovered by their neighbours who came to check on him after Abdullah did not open the sho Friday morning. The police said that so far involvement of any other person in the double murder has not come to the fore and they are probing the incident further. A case for murder has been registered at the Sahibabad police station.“Both the bodies were sent for autopsy and the suspect is being questioned for the whereabouts of the murder weapon which will soon be recovered,” Kumar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-kills-uncle-and-his-nine-year-old-daughter-in-sahibabad-arrested/story-XDDLWoyHMdRmjUEhTQymaL.html
03-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Health dept asked to create more ventilator beds, bring down death rate||Ghaziabad: To bring down the rising number of deaths due to Covid-19, the divisional commissioner has asked the Ghaziabad health department to create at least 40 beds with ventilators in the district.During a Covid-19 review meeting held on Friday in Ghaziabad, Anita C Meshram, the divisional commissioner, also asked the health officials to ensure testing of all those who have influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in containment zones across the district.At present, the district has a total of 28 beds with ventilators for Covid-19 patients, the officials said.“The commissioner most importantly has directed to create 40 to 50 ventilator beds so that serious patients get timely treatment. For this, our officials are in talks with several private hospitals. It is proposed that the state government may acquire about 20% of their ventilator beds. For the acquired beds, prescribed payment will be made,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.The health department has given its nod for paid Covid-19 treatment to at least five private hospitals in Ghaziabad where there is availability of ventilator beds. “Currently, in the government set-up, we have eight ventilators at our L2 hospital at Sanjay Nagar, while 20 more are available at our L3 hospital. Earlier, there have been several deaths when patients were getting referred to Meerut. The district administration and the health department have also been asked to work in close coordination so that patients are referred to appropriate hospitals -- L1, L2 or L3 -- as per their health conditions,” CMO said.Apart from rising number of Covid-19 cases, which have seen a considerable spike in June, the death rate in Ghaziabad has also emerged as a main cause of concern for the district administration. According to the official data, Ghaziabad had a total of 59 Covid related deaths to its tally till July 3 and stood third after Agra and Meerut in terms of fatalities. At present, Ghaziabad has a share of 7.75% of total deaths in the state.Also, while Ghaziabad had witnessed 305 Covid-19 cases till May 31, the tally went up to 1,632 between June 1 and July 3 in the district. On directions of the Uttar Pradesh government, a massive surveillance drive has been initiated in the six districts of Meerut division where thousands of teams are conducting door-to-door survey in order to find out people with symptoms of ILI and SARI, besides those having co-morbid conditions.The health officials also said that they have made operational a 300-bed L1 category hospital at SRM University campus, Modinagar.“The facility has been made operational with 300 L1 beds at present, and we are trying to get more beds in order to deal with rising cases. We are expecting that more cases will emerge after the surveillance drive has started on July 2 and we need to get more Covid beds for admission of patients. At present, we have to admit L1 patients to our L2 and L3 hospitals due to non-availability of L1 beds,” CMO added.On the first day of the surveillance drive, 2,029 teams surveyed 135,460 houses in order to find out ILI and SARI cases. The other teams also took up 775 rapid antigen tests and 34 patients were found positive, the officials said. The health department has also got in touch with various residents’ welfare associations and other social groups in order to ramp up antigen testing. Last month the district received 8,000 antigen kits, while another set of 11,000 test kits were received on July 1. Under the surveillance drive, the Ghaziabad district has received a target of conducting 1,000 RT-PCR samples and 3,000 tests with the help of antigen kits. On July 2, the health teams collected 990 samples for RT-PCR test, the officials said.Meanwhile, state officials said that they had conducted random sampling of 5,508 persons in 75 districts of UP recently, in which vendors and those employed at dhabas were covered.“Of 75 districts, 50 positive cases were found in 19 districts. The random sampling is being done for different vulnerable groups and this is also creating awareness among them about how to deal with Covid-19,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s principal secretary (health).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-health-dept-asked-to-create-more-ventilator-beds-bring-down-death-rate/story-74RkSd5JmW2TFokpAaADJO.html

MMRDA informed the court that it had complied with the compulsory compensatory plantation of trees and hence should be permitted to fell the trees. However, the court said that as the TA had recommended plantation of 115 additional saplings and identified the spot for the same, MMRDA would be able to carry out the felling only after planting the 115 saplings.A bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice N J Jamadar while hearing an interim application filed by the MMRDA in public interest litigation filed by tree activist Rohit Joshi was informed by advocate Saket Mone along with advocate Subit Chakrabarty appearing for MMRDA that on June 12, 2020, the HC had permitted MMRDA to transplant 69 trees and fell 23 trees for the freeway.The bench had directed the MMRDA to do the transplantation under the supervision of the Tree Authority, Thane. The site supervision was undertaken by all stakeholders including the petitioner and on June 26, 2020, the TA submitted a report to the HC expressing satisfaction on the proposed site for transplantation and compensatory plantation. It also submitted that the MMRDA has to plant 115 saplings for the 23 trees they proposed to fell apart from the 69 trees that were to be transplanted.On Friday, when MMRDA submitted that it had completed the compensatory plantation and should be permitted to fell 23 trees, the bench referred to the TA report and directed that even if MMRDA had already planted saplings they would have to plant additional 115 saplings in the identified site and only then would they be permitted to fell the 23 trees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-restrains-mmrda-from-felling-23-trees-in-thane-till-115-saplings-planted/story-2XcpU7KAJ7c6LWi8n8WvJP.html

He said it might make a difference in cops dealing with Africans in India without them making personal comments or insults.Following the rebuke, police told court that cops found using racial words in official records will face disciplinary action and efforts will be made to sensitise regarding not using offensive language while preparing documents.It was informed that a circular has been issued sensitising the officers in field.The court said that if a witness or an accused uses derogatory racial term, he should also be taken to task. “It is the attitude of the police that requires reformation and if the process of change comes about, ushered by the police instructions to lower level, only then can we truly achieve meaningful and proactive ‘colour blindness against social and biological prejudice’,” the judge said.“Crime or suspicion of commission of crime is to be dealt with in accordance with law and there is nothing personal about it for any policeman, as the offence is against the state and the laws should be enforced in a reasonable manner and by the procedure established by the law,” the judge added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/racial-abuse-hc-judge-asks-if-anyone-has-seen-god-his-skin-colour/story-n4qOq1tgix9EqGWF9WbzdJ.html

03-07-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University students told to vacate hostels||As many as 150 students of Panjab University who were living in hostels on campus have been left in lurch after they were told to vacate the premises by university administration on Friday.Students expressed their resentment over the varsity’s move and protested outside vice-chancellor Raj Kumar’s office for over six hours. The protesting students also tried to enter the office but were not allowed by the security guards.Mukesh, who lives in boys’ hostel number five, said, “I live in Prayagraj and there is no direct transport to go back. I am a research scholar and there is no internet facility in my village. It is not feasible for me to vacate the hostel in this situation.”In a circular issued by dean students’ welfare (DSW), hostel residents who belong to Haryana, Punjab, UP and other states of the region were advised to vacate the hostels immediately.“Many students live far away and are at risk of getting infected while travelling. Some students cannot afford to hire private vehicles to go back,” said Gurdeep Singh, a resident of boys’ hostel number three.Various students’ organisations also extended their support to hostellers. Rahul Kumar, vice-president of Panjab University Campus Students Council (PUCSC) said, “This decision should be reviewed and a meeting should be held with student representation for a conclusive decision.”PU DSW SK Tomar said, “Hostellers were waiting for exams but amid uncertainty, PU is being closed till July 31. Teachers and students are not coming to campus and Covid-19 cases are on the rise. Students, especially those who belong to nearby states, were requested to leave the hostel.

03-07-2020||Chandigarh||Road fatalities: Office transit hours most risky in Chandigarh||Most fatal accidents in Chandigarh took place between 6am and 9am and 6pm and 9pm, the time slots when people go to or return from work, while almost half of those killed comprise of people in the age group of 16 to 40, making them the most vulnerable. This has been revealed in the report compiled by the Chandigarh traffic police for 2019. According to it, there were 104 fatalities in 100 accidents in 2019, a slight increase from 98 deaths in 97 road mishaps in 2018. This year, so far, there have been 17 road fatalities, as compared to 35 till July 1 last year, said deputy inspector general of police (DIG, traffic) Shashank Anand on Friday.The time slot of 6pm-9pm account for 21 of the total 100 fatal accidents while 16 happened between 6am-9am. “These are the office transit hours, which is why maximum number of vehicles are on the road, leading to the highest number of fatal accidents,” said deputy superintendent of police (DSP, traffic administration) Kewal Krishan, adding that keeping this fact in mind, more number of traffic cops are deployed during these hours.Umesh Sharma, professor in the civil engineering department at Punjab Engineering College (PEC) who specialises in traffic and transportation system management, said: “It needs to be seen why are most fatal accidents happening when roads are the busiest, because the trend is usually the opposite. Most people are in a hurry when they’re getting late, which might be causing these accidents.” Sharma said traffic needs to be segregated further and two-wheelers should avoid using the same lane as cars, as this puts them at risk.With 51 of the total 103 victims, where the age was known, being 16 to 40 years old, DSP, road safety, Jaswinder Singh said: “We are organising frequent awareness sessions for the youth at the Children’s Traffic Park in Sector 23. We have recently been working with delivery boys and educating them to wear helmets for their own safety.”Jagdish Singh Sarpal, a traffic marshal, said: “Youngsters from villages on the city’s periphery usually don’t follow traffic rules, putting themselves and others in danger. Special nakas need to be set up at the entrances of these villages so that the offenders can be booked and made aware about the importance of following rules.”Bikers most vulnerable, motorists accused in most casesAccording to the report, two-wheeler riders were the most vulnerable, accounting for 46 (44%) of the 104 people killed, though down from 46% in 2018. Even as the administration is trying to rejuvenate pedestrian paths and cycle tracks under the smart city plan, those on foot or bicycles remain vulnerable, comprising of 34% and 10% victims, respectively, just 1% drop from 2018 figures in both cases.“The junctions where pedestrian paths meet the main road are not properly designed. Ideally, underpasses must be made for the safety of cyclists and the pedestrians,” said VK Bhardwaj, former chief engineer of the municipal corporation. He also raised concern over footpaths being used for parking vehicles, leaving no space for the pedestrians to walk.Meanwhile, cars caused the most number of accidents — 41 of 87 cases where the accused vehicle was identified. This was followed by two-wheelers and trucks, in 15 cases each. Road safety activist Harpreet Singh said: “Most car drivers behave as if the whole road belongs to them, due to which such fatal accidents take place. Mostly, two-wheeler riders have to suffer.”Also, it has come to light that vehicles from Punjab caused the most number of accidents while local population remained most vulnerable. Out of 70 cases in which the vehicle registration number was known, 27 were from Punjab while 22 were from Chandigarh. In the 53 cases where the victim was on a vehicle, 32 were registered in Chandigarh, 14 in Punjab and six in Haryana.“The emphasis this year will be on bringing the number of fatal accidents down,” said DIG Shashank Anand. “Ever since we have installed six speed radars with display boards in December 2019, there has been no fatal accident at these vulnerable points,” he said, while adding the number has been low this year due to the lockdown as well.ROAD FATALITIES REPORT FOR 2019There have been 17 road fatalities this year as compared to 35 till July 1 last year Year Fatal mishaps Deaths2019 100 1042018 97 982017 103 1072016 144 1512015 124 1292014 124 131BOX 2AWhat was accused drivingCar 41Two-wheeler 15Truck 15Unknown 12Bus 8Auto 3Canter 3Tractor 1Crane 1BOX 2BWhat was victim driving Two-wheeler 46On foot 36Cycle 10Auto 7Car 3Truck 1Rehri 1BOX 3When mishaps took place6am-9am 169am-12pm 1512pm-3pm 83pm-6pm 136pm-9pm 219pm-12am 1212am-3am 123am-6pm 3BOX 4What was age of victim0-15 616-40 5141-60 30Above 60 16||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/road-fatalities-office-transit-hours-most-risky-in-chandigarh/story-llxG4iN0KuvHP84DIi7wJL.html

This comes despite the amendments in the Motor Vehicle Act, brought into effect in September, which increased the fine amount and punishments for many traffic violations.Most of the challans were issued for driving without helmet, one of the offences against which stricter punishments were brought in. Besides an increase in the fine amount from Rs 300 to Rs 1,000, the penalty against riding a two-wheeler without helmet now also involves suspension of the driver’s license for three months.Deputy superintendent of police (DSP, traffic administration) Kewal Krishan said, “All children above the age of four have to wear helmets now, and only turbaned Sikh men and women have been exempted.” The number of challans for this is also the highest since 2014 as per data.DRUNKEN DRIVING CASES COME DOWNMeanwhile, the number of challans for drunken driving have come down significantly from 6,489 in 2018 to 4,596 in 2019. Speaking about this, officiating chief traffic marshall, Suresh Sharma said, “A fall in the number is surprising as the number of nakas has actually gone up. With the fine amount now increased to Rs 10,000, people behave more responsibly now and get a designated driver or a taxi to take them home than risk getting challaned.” Even in 2018, the number had slightly decreased as compared to 2017. Sharma added that the hiked penalties of other traffic offences were beginning to lose their effect now which is why the number of total traffic challans had increased in 2019 as compared to previous years.Calling the result encouraging, Member National Road Safety Council, Government of India, Kamal Soi said, “Higher numbers indicate that the traffic police are keeping up enforcement. I would urge them to be more scientific with their challaning, and focus on offences that lead to fatal accidents—such as speeding and drunken driving, but their recent campaign of issuing e-challans for speeding is also likely to bring down road fatalities. “||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-2019-saw-the-highest-number-of-traffic-challans-in-4-years/story-TT6ER7xZFkkZUnKw96t85J.html

03-07-2020||Chandigarh||GMADA throws spanner in Mohali MC’s plan to implement Street Vendors’ Act||Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has put a spanner in the plans of the municipal corporation to implement the Street Vendors’ (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act 2014, which has already been delayed by five years. As per GMADA, some of the sites proposed by the MC are not lawful as per land use. On the other hand, the civic body has failed to stop illegal vendors from operating in the main markets of the city. The worst-hit areas are Phases 7, 3B1, 3B2, 9, 10, and 11.The Act aims to register and rehabilitate street vendors and save them from exploitation at the hands of enforcement officers. It also calls for proper rationing of urban streets and spaces.In the three years since the process of vendor identification began, sites are yet to be approved by the town vending committee. The only development made in the last five months is that the civic body has issued identity cards to 200 of the 993 vendors under the Act.Mandip Mendiratta, senior town planner, GMADA, said, “The MC had proposed several sites, which are in parking or land-use wise not lawful for us, so, we cannot permit them.”In January this year, MC decided that to first implement the Act in Phase 7 as pilot, where as many as 139 vendors are registered. MC commissioner had even asked the agency that conducted the survey to mark the space in the parking areas, but the plan had fallen flat as market welfare association and area councillor of Phase 7 rejected the civic body’s plan.However, municipal commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said, “We wanted to start the pilot project in phase 7, but market welfare associations are opposing it. Now, we will be approaching GMADA to finalise the sites and land in Mohali belonging to them only.”The agency that conducted the vendors’ identification survey had earmarked around 15 sites in Phases 10, 11, 7, 3B1 and 3B2, but GMADA refused, citing that these were prime locations.IDENTIFICATION PROCESS STARTED IN 2015As many as 993 vendors were identified in an MC survey that was initiated in 2015. The civic body had hired a private company to carry out the survey. Initially, the firm had identified at least 2,295 vendors, but the MC House found anomalies in the survey and ordered a fresh one. In 2017, the civic body had identified 993 moving and stationary vendors.Phase 3B2 market welfare association president Jatinder Pal Singh said, “We have requested the authorities concerned on multiple instances to take action against illegal vendors, but nothing has been done so far. The parking lots are left with no space as vendors have encroached upon the area.”The issue of encroachments is debated on in every House meeting, but in vain, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gmada-throws-spanner-in-mohali-mc-s-plan-to-implement-street-vendors-act/story-Hh00rkcf100O1iKH98dncM.html

Addressing party workers in Ambala, Chautala said, “The government was adamant in opening liquor vends during the lockdown. We opposed the decision and told them that people will come out of their homes and create nuisance if liquor vends are opened. However, both the chief minister and home minister Anil Vij are “bachelor nomads” (chhade malang) and did not pay heed since they don’t have small kids at home. The state government has developed drug and liquor mafia and shields those who are involved in kidnapping and extortion.”On his brother Ajay calling his meeting with Ashok Tanwar as “zero meeting zero”, Abhay said, “Ajay should know how he became hero from zero. He should remove his Chautala surname and his misunderstandings will be cleared.”Ambala district president Shishpal Jandheri claimed that nearly 150 political leaders from the BJP, JJP, Congress and others parties joined the INLD on Friday. In Yamunanagar, Chautala claimed that the present BJP-JJP government will collapse after the Baroda by election. On removal of PTI teachers in the state, he said the state government should have gone to the court for a review after the Supreme Court’s order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/abhay-chautala-meets-party-workers-in-ambala-yamunanagar/story-mnKARcQkgqhTPbsk2bSVRP.html
03-07-2020||City||From Non-SCS to IAS: Haryana govt’s move to shortlist candidates on basis of written test challenged before CAT||The Manohar Lal Khattar government’s June 9 order that Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC) will conduct written test and shortlist non-state civil service (Non-SCS) officers to fill five Indian Administrative Service (IAS) posts has run into a legal hurdle.On Friday, the Chandigarh bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) issued notices to the Centre, Haryana government, Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) and HPSC to submit a reply before July 14 when the case will come up for hearing.“The prayer of the applicant for interim relief will be considered on the next date of hearing,” the CAT bench stated in its order after senior advocate, Rajesh Garg, pleaded to set aside and quash the June 9 notification. The CAT heard the case via videoconference due to Covid-19 pandemic.THE CONTENTIONSAt the root of the arguments of senior counsel was June 9 notification that he said “indirectly” conferred upon the HPSC the power to conduct parallel examinations even as in any case the state does not have this power.“The impugned order is contrary to Article 246 of the Constitution of India as the state government cannot usurp upon the powers of the central government to make rules related to the IAS,” the senior counsel argued.Surender Singh Dahiya, 52, who is a additional director, agriculture department, has moved the CAT.The petition points out that an extensive syllabus has been prescribed, providing a handle to the state government to oust candidates of “outstanding ability and merit” in spite of having the best service record.“It is trite law that what is not permissible to be done directly, cannot be allowed to be done indirectly,” reads the petition.The petitioners’ senior counsel further stated that the state government ‘s order is also against regulation 5 and 6 of the IAS (Appointment by Selection) Regulations, 1977, which categorically states that the suitability of a person for appointment to service is to be determined by scrutiny of service record, personal interview and confidential record of the officer concerned to adjudge the outstanding ability and merit of a candidate.The condition incorporated by the state government vide June 9 notification to the extent of conducting written examination is arbitrary and is liable to be quashed and set aside, senior counsel of the petitioner said.THE CONTROVERSYThe June 9 order of the state government allows HPSC to recommend candidates (non-SCS officers) not exceeding five times the number of vacancies after conducting the written examination.This is for the first time that non-SCS officers in Haryana will have to take a written examination to get appointed to an IAS post. Until now, the non-SCS officers in Haryana were appointed to such posts on the basis of their service record.The HPSC will prepare a merit list based on the marks obtained in the written examination and recommend names to the state government for onward submission to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC).The three-hour written examination will have 100 multiple-choice questions with five options. The examination will have negative marking and for every wrong answer, 25% marks assigned to the question will be deducted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/from-non-scs-to-ias-haryana-govt-s-move-to-shortlist-candidates-on-basis-of-written-test-challenged-before-cat/story-Y27DtUipj4XDRNvXnGdjXK.html

03-07-2020||Delhi||Kawar Yatra cancelled: Local DJs bear the brunt in Shravan month||The month of Shravan is all about worshipping lord Shiva. But what’s also a constant in this holy period is the sight of Kawars or Kawadiyas. This year, however, there wouldn’t be any sort of blaring music and raring boys dancing on the roads as the pandemic has led to Kawar Yatra being called off, like most other events. And with the lakhs of devotees, who would otherwise have been preparing to walk barefoot at this time of the year, what will also take a hit are the local DJs who usually set up their consoles inside the trucks or at roadside tents to make way for deafening music! “Hum Mahakawar group ke liye bhejte the har saal... sound system, one vehicle to carry it, and one boy to operate. All this for eight days for ₹50,000. But this year, pehle shaadiyon ki booking nahi hui because wedding guest list got reduced to just 50 people or lesser, and then came the cancellation of Kawar Yatra. I’m worried that this uneventful time will continue till the end of the year,” says Karan Kumar from Gurugram-based Karan Sound System.At a time that would have otherwise been the peak business season for Krishna DJ from Gurugram, he is sitting idle at home. “We used to provide DJs to around six to seven Kawar groups, and each one of them has paid us a good amount in the past. Last year, the maximum we earned from one group was ₹90,000,” says Krishna. Like others, he too, has been forced to shut shop due to the pandemic, and knew that the Kawar Yatra will get cancelled this year. But, Krishna is unable to fathom the loss that he has thus suffered, and adds, “The best part of proving our system to a Kawar group was that we didn’t fear that they would haggle the price.”  One of the songs created during previous years’ Shravan monthAnd when it comes to the songs that played on these music systems, it won’t be wrong to say that from Bollywood to Bhojpuri, there was a presence of most music industries in a specially curated list dedicated to Shiva. The local DJs share that they planned their playlist months before Shravan, to stand out among the rest. “I always selected a very popular playlist for Kawariyas, but this time everything seems off. Not only the yatra got banned but no one seems interested in even listening to music or new songs created to appease Mahadev. No new chartbuster has come out till now varna to gaano ki line lag jati thi,” says Delhi-based Mahesh Paswan, who has provided DJ on rent to Kawariyas, for several years now.Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kawar-yatra-cancelled-local-djs-bear-the-brunt-in-shravan-month/story-lLF8vVQYRJepAtCOUeEtBK.html
03-07-2020||Mumbai||3 Indian companies show interest for monorail rakes: MMRDA||After cancelling the bidding process for acquiring monorail rakes, where the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) received bids from two Chinese companies, the authority on Friday said that it is in talks with three Indian companies for manufacturing the rakes.The authority is hoping for Make-in-India coaches for monorail following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for ‘Aatmanirbharta’ or ‘self-reliance’. A senior official from MMRDA said, “We are in talks with Indian manufacturers like Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML), Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) and Titagarh.

With public transport like the Delhi Metro being non-operational, and car pools being limited to two people per car, city folks are ruing about the current situation. Radhika Mehta, a professional residing in Vasant Kunj says, “My company has made cuts in our salary owing to the current economic situation. In such circumstances, it’s becoming very difficult for me to pay for hiked fuel prices. The metro is not plying, and I don’t want to spend exorbitant money on taxi fares. It’s a hole in the pocket to commute safely every day in my own vehicle. I think investing in biofuel powered cars and hybrid cars is the only permanent solution to counter such unpredictable rises in fuel rates!”  #PetrolPriceHike #DieselPricenowadays ppl looking at petrol* price: Rs 80.13 pic.twitter.com/sHreztmfjZDenizens who have to travel as part of their jobs are also left in a tricky situation and are struggling to make ends meet. Rajat Kumar, a pizza delivery boy and resident of Arjun Nagar, rues, “Our reimbursements are fixed. The boss cannot increase our salary components if there’s a hike in petrol price, and at this point we can’t even ask the company to increase our salary when everyone knows that there’s hardly any business. We are already feeling the pinch due to less work, and at times like these a constant rise in petroleum prices has come as such a blow that I have started cycling to work now! I leave my motorbike parked at my office premises. What else is the option for low-income groups like us?” The increase in rates of other products has also added to the overall economic distress of denizens. Sanjay Sinha, an IT professional residing in Malviya Nagar, says, “Unlock 1.0 had come with an increase in prices of almost every product or service. Ordering food from restaurants is more expensive now, as they are demanding higher delivery charges. Salons are charging fee for keeping their premises clean, and even vegetables are getting costlier. And then comes the increase in petrol prices as an added problem. I have no choice left but to put myself at the risk of travelling in buses for now... But how long can I do this? Everyday, I live in the fear of getting Covid-19 since so many people are still not wearing masks on the roads.”Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/fuel-price-hike-denizens-switch-to-cycling-plan-to-buy-electric-cars/story-NuWAHhqIwV3ogqxGRwigZJ.html

CM also expressed gratitude to the Union minister for taking into consideration the liquidity of distribution companies (discoms) and a decision to infuse liquidity worth ₹90,000 crore.He said that discom and HPSEBL have already made pending payments up to March. However, liabilities worth ₹540 crore for March and April were pending, he added.Thakur said that the state government provided relief of ₹47 crore to the industries and hotel units for the lockdown period by deferring the demand charges and waivers. He said that the government also deferred the bill payments to provide relief to consumers.“Power demand due to the lockdown fell by 40% to 45% resulting in a loss of about ₹319 crore to the HPSEBL,” said Thakur.Thakur added that the state government has proposed to install about 1.52 lakh smart electricity meters in Shimla and Dharamshala towns in the coming years.He said that although the Union government has a provision of providing a fixed grant for special category states like Himachal, it should be fixed as per the actual cost so as to put a minimum burden on about 22 lakh consumers.CM said that last year the state government allocated 778 MW project to SJVNL, 499 MW project to NTPC and 520 MW project to NTPC for execution on Chenab Basin.He said that SJVNL and the Himachal government were also planning to set up 1,000 MW solar power mega park in Kaza and this would require a proper and effective mechanism for power evacuation. He said that the state government has already written a letter in this regard to the Union power secretary.Union minister RK Singh assured the Cm that the Centre would sympathetically consider all the genuine demands of the state government. He assured that steps would be taken to evolve a mechanism for power evacuation from the far-flung areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cut-interest-rate-on-loans-provided-through-pec-and-rec-jai-ram-thakur-urges-centre/story-KrpxmRSIvUCp3rEbBjT6nO.html

A SPONTANEOUS PROTESTOn June 9, Markanda, who was touring his constituency, reached near Kaza, when he was stopped by locals at the village gate.The locals wanted the minster to follow the quarantine norms formulated by the Committee For Preventive Measures and Sustainable Development’ (CPMSD), a joint forum comprising youth and women groups and five monasteries of the valley.In tribal areas, collective decisions may override the government orders as local communities have been given powers of self-governance under various statues. Soon after the Covid-19 outbreak in India, the Spiti CPMSD banned the entry of outsiders in the valley.In April end when the government allowed people to enter the state, the committee enforced strict quarantine on all returnees.On that day, the committee members had gathered at the village gate to discuss some local issues with the administration when Markanda arrived there.“Our protest was spontaneous and driven by a sense of security,” said Sonam Dolma, president of Kaza Mahila Mandal.“We were scared of the virus and wanted Spiti valley and our children to be safe,” she said.Dolma said that the quarantine norms framed by the CPMSD were applicable to all including their family members.She added that the minister had reached Spiti for the second time in less than a fortnight without observing travel restrictions.“No one is immune to the virus. Keeping our safety in view we asked him to return or follow quarantine norms,” she said adding that the police harassment started the very next day.Maintaining that efforts of the locals kept Spiti valley corona free, Dolma said that the government should allow the Spiti residents to follow their own set of rules.“We will also write to the deputy commissioner and the government to withdraw cases filed against us,” she added.MARKANDA DEFENDS SELFMeanwhile, Markanda said that he was visiting Spiti to end a strike by BRO labourers and was to return to Shimla to attend a meeting.“I appreciated the locals’ decision and left immediately. However, later I came to know about some political involvement in the protest. Some people present in the protest raised pro-Congress slogans,” he said.Markanda added that the cases were registered by the police suo moto.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hp-govt-hints-at-withdrawal-of-cases-filed-against-kaza-women-for-preventing-entry-of-agri-minister-in-spiti-valley/story-eJbLprJDJOQFbILhCuAwoO.html
03-07-2020||City||Frontline warriors account for 12% Covid-19 infections in Haryana||Frontline warriors, including doctors, paramedics, police personnel and government officials, account for 12% Covid-19 infections in Haryana, as per the data provided by the state health department. The frontline warriors are more prone to the virus owing to their duties in Covid-19 hospitals, containment zones, quarantine centres and testing labs.Till June 28, 748 (5.41% of total 13,829 patients) health workers, including doctors, nurses and other hospital staff had tested positive for the disease. Also, 779 (5.6%) police, army and government officials are also among the cases in Haryana so far. Dr Suraj Bhan Kamboj from the Haryana Health Services said, “The health department officials are working very hard and many of them got infected while on duty. However, there is no need to worry as most infected health workers have recovered and resumed their duty.” He said as of now no health worker in the state has succcumbed to the virus. “Proper guidelines have been issued to ensure the safety of doctors and paramedic staff. More doctors have been recruited to reduce work pressure,” Kamboj said.Despite the increase in number of cases, the morale of doctors in the state remains high. Dr Anjali, ENT specialist at the Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College and Hospital, said she tested positive for the virus on April 6 after coming in contact with Karnal’s first Covid-19 patient, who died a few hours after his samples were taken.“It was shocking and I was worried about my husband and 2-year-old daughter. My family and colleagues supported me. I recovered and joined duty after 26 days,” she said.Haryana had reported its first Covid-19 death on April 4 after a sub-inspector died at the Maharaja Agrasen Hospital in Delhi. On June1, another police official posted in Gurugram had also succumbed to the infection. However, most policemen have defeated the virus and returned back to duty soon after their quarantine period was over.Lata Rani, assistant sub-inspector in Panipat had tested positive along with her two brothers and parents on April 24. She had to remain off duty for more than a month as she took about 25 days to recover.“Being a public servant, police officials have to deal with several people daily and that is why most infected cops, including me, don’t know their source of infection,” Lata said. As per the information, top-level police officials take regular reports about infected cops and all facilities are provided to them. Karnal range inspector general of police Bharti Arora said directions have been issued to the district police heads to monitor all policemen and provide facilities if any of them test positive for the virus. So far, only two police officials from Karnal range got infected and both have now recovered, the IGP added. Haryana director general of police Manoj Yadava said, “We cannot say that there is rise in coronavirus cases among police officials. The number of infected policemen is very low as compared to other states. The job is risky but all precautionary measures are being taken to ensure that our policemen remain on duty without getting infected. We have issued a detailed protocol and even training was suspended to avoid the spread of virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/frontline-warriors-account-for-12-covid-19-infections-in-haryana/story-yzHZNjccyy4DwQmzlLxp3M.html

I was shocked to read the horrific details! I’m a dog lover and so is my family; we have been feeding 400 street dogs everyday at T3 Terminal for the last nine years. We have also rescued and adopted many dogs, and couldn’t bear the fact that the dogs in the viral picture will be killed and eaten.

Nidhi Mishra, an animal rights activist from Posh Foundation, Noida, says, “This is so inhuman; the practice of killing and eating dogs has become a tradition in Nagaland. This all happens in an open street market, so what values are they passing on to the youngsters? This is not a celebration, and should be banned right away!”  This is shocking, pls raise your voice, This barbaric act must stop. @Manekagandhibjp @CmoNagaland @DGP_Nagaland @PetaIndia https://t.co/rR77q7BLf9Bollywood celebs have also been tweeting vociferously against the brutality that the dogs are meted with, at this animal market, and expressed their concern over the issue.

A farmer, Amit Narwal of Kathura village in Sonepat, was glad to see the group of 27 migrants that arrived from Bihar’s Araria and Purnia areas in a bus specially arranged by local farmers. “This year the input cost for paddy cultivation has increased. The labourers are charging Rs 4,000-Rs 4,300 per acre for paddy sowing against last year’s Rs 2,700-Rs 2,800. After negotiation, the workers settled at Rs 4,000 per acre. We will also be providing them three meals a day and accommodation facility. Many workers are asking us to share the travel expense of Rs 4,000 per person,” he said.Another farmer, Praveen Kumar of Kahlpa village, said though the labour shortage had been resolved, they were burdened because of the increasing prices of diesel. “The government has increased the MSP of paddy to Rs 53 per quintal, claiming that it will provide relief to the farmers, but at the same time it has hiked diesel prices to Rs 11 per litre,” he said.HAPPY HOMECOMING FOR MIGRANT WORKERSMigrant workers said that they were happy to be back in Haryana. 50-year-old migrant worker Sibu Singh of Bihar’s Araria said that he had been coming to Baroda and Gohana areas to work in the paddy fields for the last 13 years.“I paid Rs 4,000 as bus fare to reach a village in Sonepat but I am happy to be back. It was very difficult to make ends meet in Bihar. Now, I am earning Rs 500 per day,” the migrant worker said.Another worker from Bihar, Ram Avtar, said he had hardly earned Rs 8,000 at his native village in Bihar in April and May but he had earned over Rs 4,000 in the last 10 days alone by working in paddy fields.“We have strong relations with the landowners in Haryana. We have been working in the fields for the last 10 years. We used to stay in Haryana for eight to nine months,” Avtar said.Agriculture expert Ramandeep Singh Mann said a rise in diesel prices will cost farmers Rs 400 per acre.“The increased MSP of paddy will benefit farmers. They will earn Rs 1,272 per acre but rise in diesel price (if farmers irrigate fields with pumps) will cost them Rs 860. Moreover, the cost of labour has increased by 40% and that of pesticides by 15%. The rise in paddy’s MSP will not increase farmers’ income this year,” Mann said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-farmers-glad-to-have-migrant-labour-back-in-paddy-fields-fret-over-hike-in-diesel-prices/story-VKdcnBqCVw1agIAwuMecXP.html

The protesters demanded regularisation of jobs, timely payment of salaries and the release of dearness allowance instalments. Around 11.30am, around 100 protestors gathered outside the outpatient department (OPD) of GNDH and raised slogans against the state government. The protest lasted two-hours, during which the protesters suspended all Covid-related duties.Punjab Nursing Association’s Amritsar edition president Narinder Bhuttar said, “Trade unions across the country had called a nationwide protest against the planned dilution of labour laws in several states and the treatment of workers during the Covid-19 outbreak. Joining the protest, members of the Punjab Nursing Association and paramedical staff boycotted their duties and staged a protest at GNDH.” “Since the Covid-19 outbreak, nurses and paramedical staff have been risking their lives to treat patients but the state government is not issuing our salaries on time nor are they regularising the jobs of contractual workers,” he said.A member of the Amritsar Nursing Union, Veena Kumari, said, “The newly recruited nurses and paramedical staff, who are only being paid Rs 10,000 per month, should get their whole salary.”PROVIDE PENSIONS, SAYS NURSING UNION “The government is not providing pensions to medical staff who have been recruited after 2004. Since they are also dealing with Covid-19 patients, the government should formulate new policies to promote and motivate medical staff. The government should provide them pensions so that the staff does not have to worry about money in case they get infected.”Bhuttar said, “The government of India had asked all state governments to change the nomenclature of nursing personnel. In every other state, staff nurses are designated as nursing officers but the Punjab government has not implemented the Centre’s orders, which should be implemented on priority.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/paramedical-nursing-staff-stage-protest-in-amritsar-demand-job-regularisation/story-dMePU5TcN589wmHYGYM5NK.html

The draft Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2020, which if put into force will replace the EIA Notification of 2006 for all future industrial projects.According to Dalmia the EIA 2020 draft will have drastic ecological impacts and will leave irreversible damage to the ecological resources.“Clearing of large forests for projects like coal mining, pharmaceuticals, dams and other industries, without detailed environmental clearance or assessment studies (as seen in the Vizag gas leak and etalin hydropower project), will severely affect the balance of the earth,” said Dalmia.“Mining is one of the activities that will become more widespread with the new EIA amendment as the validity for environmental clearances have increased for the industry,” she further added.The members of the campaign have also written to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi through an email on June 28 after lack of response from Prakash Javadekar, union minister for environment, forest and climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/student-unions-support-campaign-against-draft-eia-2020-led-by-pune-based-anjali-dalmia/story-JOmefxoG0oKxFKpg8YlerJ.html

Today when the news of ace choreographer’s demise – due to cardiac arrest – broke, many who were regular viewers of her dance show, poured their heart out in Khan’s appreciation.  Megha Aggarwal, a Gurugram-based teacher, says, “I was in my class 12 when this dance show had started. And I always thought that all the actors are good dancers and a non-dancer can’t try luck in the film industry. But Saroj ji’s dance show changed my perception. Once I started learning from her, virtually, I realised that anybody can dance! There was so much grace in her moves, and though I learnt a lot from her, that poise is still missing in my performance. I was telling my 9-year-old daughter about the dance show a few days ago, and this news today morning made me feel like I have lost my dance guru.” The connect that everyone felt with Saroj Khan was quite unique. Madhurima Sharma, a homemaker from Delhi, recalls, “Haath seedha rakhenge, ungliya nahi khulengi, ab iski ko dobara karenge... that’s how she used to talk and teach us. Even though we used to learn from her virtually, there was something special about it. The bond that my sister, mother and I shared with her was very strong. I remember that we used to joke about her mannerisms like any other student mocking a teacher in the class. We had even started calling her masterji like the young girls who were part of the show and danced as students in the background. Those were the days... She was truly one of the best choreographers of the Hindi film industry and everyone will miss her charm and strictness, which could be felt even as we watched her on the TV screen.” Some of Khan’s fans say that they will also go back to her dance classes and cherish those moments of learning from her, one more time. “I have decided to learn once again from her, and this time my daughter will also accompany me. She doesn’t know much about the legend that Saroj Khan was and I want her to know that,” says Mamta Goel, a Delhi-based homemaker, adding, “We will together attend classes on YouTube and if all goes well, we can then perform and create a dance video as a tribute to her. I’m also asking my friends’ circle to learn from Khan’s dance classes.” Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/saroj-khan-fans-in-delhi-ncr-will-miss-masterji-s-dance-class/story-7L44C8dy3xRp3QRyN72lJP.html

Thus, the BMC should not issue notices for cutting of trees during this period, and stop plans to axe trees till the outbreak is over.“Common citizens are locked inside their homes and are under the continuous threat of the Covid-19 outbreak. In such a situation, the BMC has issued multiple tree-cutting notices from June, for which citizens are called, to submit their objections (if any). However, due to the state-wide lockdown, citizens are incapacitated to move out of their homes and visit the site to inspect the trees,” Birwadkar said in his letter to the BMC.As per rules, the civic body has to seek suggestions and objections from citizens before permitting tree cutting for any project. “Citizens are not allowed in BMC ward offices to inspect the proposal documents. Due to the lockdown many citizens are even unaware of the tree cutting notices,” the letter further added. Since June 6, the civic body started issuing public notices for cutting trees in the city, around three months after it put up the last public notice on the issue, on March 18.Birwadkar said, “There is no scope to conduct visits to the site as there are restrictions of travelling beyond 2-km stretch, and under such a scenario, the BMC should not propose tree cutting or issue public notices for it. No trees should be cut during this period. If the BMC does so, I will be forced to move court.”However, civic officials said that there cannot be restrictions put on cutting of trees or on trimming owing to monsoon. “Many trees are proposed for developmental works, and in many cases it is necessary to cut trees or their branches, considering they may fall off anytime during monsoon. Hence, such a restriction cannot be made,” a BMC official said. Jitendra Pardeshi, chief of BMC’s garden department, was not available for comment despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/don-t-cut-trees-during-lockdown-activist-tells-mumbai-civic-corporation/story-fqj9SlZ1A83icQ9pBUm2pM.html

Expressing his dissatisfaction over the contact tracing in Ambernath and Badlapur, Tope pointed out that 1,500 new cases are being added to the district’s numbers every day.A two-hour-long meeting was held at the Kulgaon Badlapur Municipal Council, with health department officials, medical association members and elected representatives.“In the coming 10 days total five testing labs will be set up to cater to places like Badlapur, Ulhasnagar- Ambernath, Bhiwandi, Mira Bhayader and rural parts of Thane district. This will speed up the testing and these cities will not have to depend on Mumbai testing labs,” said Tope.“In Ambernath and Badlapur, contact tracing of Covid patients is not satisfactory. The authorities are tracing with the ratio of 1:6 (six contacts per one patient) which should increase to 1:15. I have asked them to follow up on this and isolate at least 15 contacts for one infected person so that there is a better chance of breaking the chain,” he said.rThe health minister pressed for the need to increase the number of ventilators and oxygen beds in these cities, and directed the civic bodies to take help from the doctors of Indian Medical Association (IMA). A 50-bed intensive care unit will be set up at Harne Ayurvedic college in Badlapur soon, he informed. Tope asked officials to prepare a dashboard for the entire district to check the availability of beds.He also urged the local civic bodies to admit patients on first-come-first basis, instead of sending them back to their residential city.

Tomatoes, which are supplied through Himachal Pradesh, are the worst hit with the price rising from Rs 35 per kg to Rs 60 per kg in a week. “Due to the recent spell of rains in Himachal Pradesh, a lot of tomatoes have been damaged. Hike in fuel prices will cause the vegetables prices to rise even further in the coming days,” a UT market committee official said. Prices of vegetables like capsicum, ladyfinger, cabbage and ladyfinger have also increased, with farmers warning other vegetables will also be affected. Prahlad SIngh Bhamia, a farmer from Fatehgarh Sahib in Punjab, said, “We have lost a majority of bittergourd crop due to the recent thunderstorm in Punjab. Because farmers didn’t know for how long the lockdown will last, we didn’t plant new crop. It can take at least a couple of months for the new crop to get ready, which may cause shortage of supply and increase in prices.”Officials of the Punjab Mandi Board said apni mandis could help bring the prices down. “Right now vendors are moving in streets and need to make a profit. As wholesale prices start to rise, vendors won’t earn enough and will stop bringing vegetables to houses.

Identifying these molecules may help with drug discovery and examining existing drugs, approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), that can be repurposed to treat Covid-19.Using computational biology techniques, the three-member team at NCBS, which is a biological centre of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, found that only one in 10,000 screened molecules has the potential to target the protein. “The choice of target protein, NSP1, is both unique among research at this time and important based on the role the NSP1 protein plays. It stalls host gene expression, could degrade host mRNA, and protects viral (self) mRNA from degradation. It is a great interactor with other proteins as well,” said R Sowdhamini, professor of biochemistry, NCBS, and corresponding author of the study which has been accepted by the Journal of Biosciences of the Indian Academy of Sciences.Researchers said narrowing down to these 33 molecules, which have exhibited stability and strong interaction with the Sars-Cov-2 protein, will save significant time on toxicity tests because some are used in FDA-approved drugs such as Remdesivir — currently being repurposed — while small molecules are mostly found in plants. In the virtual screening of the molecules with NSP1, the team described FDA-approved anti-viral drugs such as Remdesivir and Edoxudine as “promising” as Covid-19 treatment. Esculin and Acarbose, which are prescribed for inflammation and diabetes respectively but are not anti-viral drugs, were also found to have potential to inhibit the protein.The 33 molecules which displayed stability in their interaction with NSP1 are found in lactose, glycyrrhizic acid from liquorice plant (also referred to as athimathuram or yastimadhu); corilagin from pomegranates; galangan from blue ginger (also referred to as galangal or sitharathai); and gingeronone and shogaol from both ginger and blue ginger.Having started work based on new computational research since early March, the team said identifying 33 molecules will also translate into saving time, money and effort in experimental examinations.“We have recommended a set of promising small molecules to bind to NSP1. We hope some of these ligands (molecules) could be useful to combat Covid-19,” said Sowdhamini.Over the last three months, the team used computational docking algorithms to investigate how the ligands (molecules) would interact to inhibit the protein.“Scores were provided depending on the strength of favourable and unfavourable interactions. More negative the scores, higher the chance for that molecule to be a potential inhibitor for the NSP1 protein,” said Abhishek Sharma, a joint PhD student in two laboratories and first author of the study.Sharma added, “After two rounds of filters, the top-ranking molecules were considered. These docking runs took approximately 20 days of computing time, followed by analysis and literature survey”.Vikas Tiwari, PhD student of the laboratory and the one who performed molecular dynamics simulations to yield the small molecules with the most stable interactions with the NSP1 protein, said, “We found that the small molecule or ‘ligand’ stays on with the protein and does not fly away during our simulations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/researchers-identify-33-molecules-that-can-target-1-covid-19-protein/story-jK8MpYyk654BIs8aW5r1TN.html
03-07-2020||City||Day 1 of complete lockdown gets good response in Thane and Kalyan-Dombivli||Day 1 of the 10-day complete lockdown saw good response in Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli and Ulhasnagar on Thursday. In Thane, though most citizens remained indoors, there were some incidents of crowding at markets, which were allowed to remain open. After police intervention, the markets were closed and residents were sent back home. The traffic police seized 316 vehicles across the Thane commissionerate and issued 2,744 challans throughout the day to motorists for flouting lockdown norms.Amit Kale, deputy commissioner of traffic said, “We took action against a total of 800 vehicles and collected fines worth of ₹13 lakh.”Police patrolling at city’s prime spots continued for the whole day, with several areas, especially the residential complexes, being barricaded to restrict the movement of people.With only 55 of the total 120 Thane Municipal Transport (TMT) bus services operating on Thursday, most people in essential services found it difficult to reach the railway station. Santosh Badavte, 48, a postal department employee, said, “My office is at Mumbai Central and I reside in Kharegaon. I travel by TMT buses to reach the station, but the frequency was very less on Thursday and I had to walk to station.”Deputy civic commissioner Sandeep Malvi said TMT services will only be available for those in essential services or for cases of emergencies.On Thursday, Thane city reported 395 new cases and 11 deaths. The total case count now stands at 9,530, while the death toll is 333.Similar actions were taken in the neighbouring corporations of Bhiwandi, Kalyan-Dombivli and Ulhasnagar too.Shops remained shut, while very few less vehicles were seen on the streets. Most of the containment zones were sealed with barricades prohibiting movement. The police kept vigil at all the major roads of the city as well as the internal residential areas.Thane police commissioner Vivek Pansalkar who visited the city, said, “The response on the first day was very good, as most residents stayed indoors. A team of police also made announcements at societies to make residents aware about it. We need to follow it strictly.”Kalyan-Dombivli civic commissioner Vijay Suryavanshi informed that more than 1,000 employees of the corporation were on the field with the police to ensure the norms were followed. On Thursday, Kalyan-Dombivli witnessed its highest-ever daily rise in Covid cases. The 560 new cases took the total number to 7,485, while the death toll rose to 127 after three deaths.Meanwhile, the Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC) extended its lockdown in micro-containment zones till July 12. It had earlier imposed a complete 15-day lockdown since June 15.“Apart from essential services, no other shops will remain open in the containment zones. Grocery stores will be open from 11am to 3pm, while dairy stores from 8am to 10am and 5pm to 7pm. Ward officers and local police stations have been alerted and they will ensure that all rules are maintained in containment zones. Action will be taken against those found loitering within the containment zones,” said Pankaj Ashiya, commissioner, BNCMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/day-1-of-complete-lockdown-gets-good-response-in-thane-and-kalyan-dombivli/story-tjQhjRF4ZsmVqCbpS2i7DI.html
03-07-2020||City||Classes to be discontinued if fee is not paid: VIBGYOR Schools to parents||Mumbai: Despite parents of VIBGYOR Group of Schools protesting against the institute’s decision to hike fees, the management has issued them an ultimatum to pay the fees or face action. In an email addressed to parents on Wednesday, the school stated that it “will be compelled to discontinue (online) classes for students who have not paid fees upto July 2020.”The email further stated, “For parents who have still not paid any fees for the academic year, it will be assumed that you are no longer interested in your ward continuing to study at our school. As a consequence, we will initiate the de-enrolment process for your ward from 13 July, 2020.” “We have provided a plethora of payment options to parents to pay fees in an easy manner. A large majority of our parents have been paying on time and they have nothing to worry about. Yet, the quality of learning being provided is suffering on account of a small number of parents who have not paid yet. Timely payment of fees will enable us to ensure academic continuity for our students” said the school’s official spokesperson.Parents said that the school was pressuring them to pay the hiked fees amid the Covid-19 situation.“We had requested the school to scrap the fee hike that it had imposed early this year, as parents are unable to pay the hiked amount, owing to job losses and pay cuts. The school has not responded to our concerns even once,” said the parent of a student from the Goregaon branch.On June 28, parents from different branches of the school across the state held an online protest against the 8-10% fee hike the school. They had also said that the school had not given learning materials to their children as they refused to pay the hiked amount. On May 8, the state issued a government resolution (GR) stating that schools should stay all fee hikes for the current academic year. The GR had also allowed parents to pay fees in instalments. However, the Bombay high court on June 26 stayed the GR after several organisations of private school owners petitioned the court.‘Cancel Class 9 and 11 re-exams’Shivnath Darade, the secretary of Shikshak Parishad, a teachers’ body in the state, wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday, requesting for the cancellation of Class 9 and Class 11 re-examinations. In his letter, Darade said that while students who fail these classes can attempt a re-examination as per the government rules, this exam cannot be conducted owing to the restrictions imposed as a result of the lockdown. “Such students will miss out on classes for the next academic year if exams are delayed any further and there will be additional stress on them. They should thus be promoted to the next class, considering the current situation,” he said in the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/classes-to-be-discontinued-if-fee-is-not-paid-vibgyor-schools-to-parents/story-VHcblEun1IORuf7c63RLwJ.html

They live in Dhakoli and Phase 10, respectively. A 33-year-old man, a resident of Sector 91, who had recently returned from Spain, was also found infected. The fourth patient, a 43-year-old man from Kurali, also has a travel history to Delhi. Civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh said the family contacts of these patients will be tested. Of the 280 cases in the district, 198 have recovered and four have died. There are now 78 active patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-doctors-among-four-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-mohali/story-FCtGkT8kDYyylAUiLHKtNK.html
03-07-2020||Mumbai||Can’t convert coaches into ICUs for Covid patients: Railways to Bombay HC||It is not possible to convert railway coaches into intensive care units (ICUs) to treat Covid-19 patients without making extensive structural modifications and other major changes, the railway administration had informed the Bombay high court (HC) on Monday. The affidavit had been filed in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) by activist Naresh Kapur, suggesting that the railway coaches be converted into treatment facilities. The affidavit had stated that these coaches are converted to isolation facilities to augment Covid care and as a temporary measure, till train services resume. If any other major changes are carried out, the immediate re-use of the converted coaches for the purpose of travelling will become impossible without carrying out modifications again, the railways has claimed. The judges on Thursday dismissed the PIL, stating they had no doubt in their mind that the authorities “shall not leave any stone unturned to preserve the lives of citizens” and provide proper and adequate health care and medical treatment to those in need. The bench also recorded its appreciation for the concerns expressed by Kapur, which has resulted in the introduction of the rapid antigen test for detection of Covid-19 immediately instead of the long-drawn tests.In his PIL, filed through advocate Prerak Choudhary, Kapur had complained about the shortage of beds for treatment of Covid-19 as well as non-Covid patients across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, and suggested that railway coaches should be converted into treatment facilities. Kapur’s petition had also stated that the inefficient management of the coronavirus outbreak had resulted in the complete breakdown of the healthcare system within the region, with the cases rising at an alarming rate.Acting on the PIL, a bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice MS Karnik had on June 23 called for an affidavit stating why CR and WR did not consider it necessary to convert railway coaches into intensive care units (ICU) for Covid-19 patients.The railways in its affidavit on Monday had stated that the changes will require detailed design support and elaborate facilities that are made available at the stage of manufacturing. It had also claimed that Central Railway (CR) has converted 482 non-air conditioned coaches on 24 rakes – spread over the central line across Maharashtra – into isolation facilities, by removing the middle seat and converting one toilet at the end of the bogey into a bathroom. The first cabin near the entrance can be used as store and/or paramedic area.Similarly, the Western Railway (WR) has also converted 410 non-air conditioned coaches on 18 rakes into quarantine facilities and kept the rakes at important junctions along the line from Mumbai to Bhavnagar in Gujarat.Meanwhile, the court has rejected Kapur’s prayer for a direction to order the state and civic authorities to reopen all hospitals, nursing homes and dispensaries, which have been closed either due to departmental orders or judicial orders, to meet the needs of Covid-19 as well as other patients.“Granting the prayer would amount to tinkering with administrative or judicial orders and such course is plainly impermissible,” the bench had said while rejecting the prayer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/can-t-convert-coaches-into-icus-for-covid-patients-railways-to-bombay-hc/story-Jjri9C4FxdBWICwuba1OGJ.html
03-07-2020||Mumbai||1,311 children in Mumbai tested positive for Covid since March: Civic corporation||Although minors constitute less than 1% of the total number of Covid-19 cases, more than 6,000 children in Maharashtra and 1,311 in the city have contracted the infection since March. Data provided by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) shows 54% of these cases were among boys and 46% were in girls aged between 0 to 10 years. So far, seven minors have died of the infection.Doctors said children with low immunity and comorbidity may be particularly vulnerable to the infection. Detecting the infection in a Covid-positive minor is more challenging than in adults as 85% of the reported cases were asymptomatic. “Only 10% children show symptoms like cough and fever. Some even develop diarrhoea. But we still don’t know the exact symptoms among children,” said Dr Bhupendra Avasthi, trustee, Surya Maternity Hospital.There is also speculation that infants may be vulnerable with 10 newborns contracting Covid-19 either from their Covid-positive mothers or by cross-transmission in hospital. A report on Covid-19 in minors was submitted by the state health department to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in mid-May. “Cases of Covid-19 among children don’t even constitute 1% of the total. They do relatively better than adults because of their innate immunity and healthier lungs. As they mostly don’t have additional risk factors like obesity, diabetes and hypertension, their recovery rate is higher,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer. At present, there are seven beds in paediatric intensive care units (PICU) for Covid-positive minors in Mumbai, of which six are occupied and there are 30 neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), of which 29 have newborn babies who are critically-ill with Covid-19.“Almost 70% minors are from outside Mumbai due to unavailability of Covid NICU and PICU in their districts. This often means a delay in their treatment, which deteriorates their health condition especially among children with weaker immunity and compromised lungs,” said paediatrician Dr Mukesh Aggarwal, from King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital.With few reported cases, there are questions surrounding Covid-19 in children. Approximately 5% of minor patients have needed treatment in intensive care units (ICU). “There is no treatment as children aren’t showing symptoms like other [adults],” said Dr Avasthi. Recently, some Covid-positive children in the city exhibited symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease, which causes inflammation in the walls of some blood vessels and can cause cause permanent damage to coronary arteries. Kawasaki disease usually occurs among children below five years and early symptoms include rash and fever. However, Dr Avasthi said, “Kawasaki-like child patients are present, but no confirmed case has been identified till now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/1-311-children-in-mumbai-tested-positive-for-covid-since-march-civic-corporation/story-53FQNA9ikNbHxdKKG1LOGL.html

According to Jawhar police, a group of 13 youngsters from Ambika Chowk in Jawhar had gone to the waterfall around 3.40pm. While some of them stayed on the banks, two youngsters entered the water and were swept away due to strong currents. Three others dived in to save them, but they also drowned.The five victims have been identified as Nimesh Patel, Devendra Phaltankar alias Bala, Devendra Wagh alias Dadu, Prathamesh Chavan and Jai Bhoir alias Rinku, said inspector Appasaheb Lengare from Jawhar police station. The rest of the group panicked and looked for them. After they could not find any of them due to strong currents, they informed the police. The police, in turn, alerted the fire brigade and the disaster management team of Palghar district. After conducting a search for nearly four hours, bodies of all five youths were found, said Lengare. “We have sent the bodies for post-mortem at Cottage Hospital in Jawhar. Reports are awaited,” said Lengare. He added that the post-mortem reports would confirm if the youths were under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident. The police have registered a case of accidental death. A police officer said that none of the victims knew how to swim.The waterfall has three falls and is at least 50 feet deep.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/jawhar-waterfall-trip-turns-tragic-as-five-youths-drown/story-FtZ2XZ5i1zjxkNiMp0rm6O.html

After four hours, the team found the venue in Sagarli village and stopped the wedding. The girl, who hails from Ahmednagar, was sent home while the groom, his parents and the bride’s parents along with a relative were arrested. Among the accused are Satish Jadhav, 26, the groom; his father Sahebrao Jadhav, 54; and mother Shobha Jadhav, 48. Assistant police inspector Maruti Andhale said he got a call from an unknown person alerting about the child marriage. He said, “We only had one-line information that a child marriage was going to take place around 1.30pm in Dombivli (East). It was already 1.00pm when we got the call and Dombivli (East) is a big area, making it difficult to locate the venue. We divided 30 officers in five teams and launched a search operation.”After four hours of searching every marriage and community halls, police found the house where the wedding was taking place around 5pm. Andhale said, “By the time we reached Sagarli village, the wedding ceremony was completed. We asked for the girl’s birth certificate, but they didn’t have it. Our women officer spoke to the girl and found that she was around 16-years-old. Then, we arrested the groom, his parents, the girl’s parents and the uncle under Child Marriage Act, though they have all been released on bail. We have sent the girl home with her family members.”The groom is a driver while his parents are labourers. The girl hails from the economically weaker section of the society and her parents sell vegetables in Ahmednagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-step-in-to-stop-child-marriage/story-j6CFm6oGUusUy2WFKyD42M.html
03-07-2020||Mumbai||Citizens, MNS demand discount on power bills||In a meeting with state energy minister Nitin Raut on Thursday, citizen representatives from Mumbai and Thane along with political leaders from the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) demanded discounts on power bills, quick redressal on complaints and transparency in the billing system. Citizens across Maharashtra have expressed grief over exorbitant bills issued by utility firms in June 2020. MNS also submitted a letter demanding a 50% discount on bills as well as direction to not disconnect power supply in case of non-payment. The party also asked the minister to undertake a common meeting with all utility firms to address the issues.Rahul Daga, resident and chairman of Dosti Lily in Wadala who attended the meeting in Mahavitaran office at Fort, said, “Almost every other household has got bills ranging between ₹25,000 to ₹35,000. Yesterday, a household complained of getting a ₹64,000 bill. We need more transparency and quick redressal on these complaints.”Nandakumar Chile from MNS said the minister was positive on the demands. “There are cases in the city where people whose houses have been vacant since two months receiving exorbitant bills. The minister accepted that there have been some errors and said it would be inspected soon.”Following thousands of complaints from citizens, the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) on Monday has issued directives to utility firms to allow consumers to pay their bills in three easy monthly instalments and not disconnect power until disputes have been resolved. Despite several attempts, Raut was not available for a comment.Meanwhile, a Mumbai-based NGO, Watchdog Foundation, on Thursday also asked citizens to switch off their electrical appliances as a mark of protest against the bills. The foundation asked citizens to switch off the appliances between 8pm and 8.30pm on Thursday night. Taapsee Pannu meets Adani officials Actor Taapsee Pannu, who took to Twitter to complain about the high bill, said she had an hour-long meeting with representatives from the Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited (AEML) on Thursday to understand the issue. Pannu tweeted, “So after an hour long meeting, crazy amount of numbers n calculations floating around, realised the ‘approximate’ reading wasn’t really THAT approximate. In fact far from it (sic).” She also said, “Glad @Adani_Elec_Mum had the patience to clarify every detail and hoping in the future we all will be better prepared and given a better ‘approximate’ jerk to deal with the reality later.”Energy minister seeks ₹10,000 crore for Maha discom State energy minister Nitin Raut on Thursday wrote a letter to the Central government seeking immediate assistance of ₹10,000 crore for the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL). Raut said the discom is facing a financial crisis owing to the lockdown as most industries and businesses were shut. Around 60% of MSEDCL’s revenue is earned via industrial and commercial sectors. “The adverse effects of lockdown are expected to continue for the next few months. The low revenue will make it difficult to carry out day-to-day operations of MSEDCL,” a statement released by Raut stated. The minister further said the state’s distribution arm has a total debt of ₹38,282 crore as of March 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/citizens-mns-demand-discount-on-power-bills/story-hVcLWCRXnPq6c15zfgOkOI.html
03-07-2020||City||76-year-old woman becomes Panchkula’s first Covid-19 fatality||The district registered its first Covid-19 fatality with the death of a 76-year-old woman from Sector 12, Panchkula.Besides, six new cases were confirmed, taking the district tally to 119.The elderly woman, who had tested positive on June 26, was a chronic kidney disease patient, suffered from diabetes and had even undergone a coronary artery bypass surgery in the past.She was undergoing treatment at Alchemist Hospital, Sector 21, for the past 14 days and was tested positive by a private lab. Finding lapses at the hospital in Covid-19 management, the administration has issued it a show-cause notice.Health authorities have also sealed an ICU at the hospital for the next 72 hours for fumigation. Besides, planned surgeries have been put on hold.“The notice has been issued after finding a few shortcomings. Action will be taken on the basis of the hospital’s response,” said Mukesh Kumar Ahuja, deputy commissioner, Panchkula.Civil surgeon Jasjeet Kaur said shutting down the Covid care facility at the hospital was not feasible, but they been asked to take measures to check spread of infection.DOCTOR TESTS POSITIVEA 41-year-old doctor at the hospital tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday. Apart from this doctor, who lives in Dhakoli, Mohali, two other doctors, a staff nurse and three patients, who were taking treatment for chronic kidney failure in the hospital, have been found infected previously. These include the 76-year-old woman.Hospital authorities have isolated five consultants and five staff members, besides testing 60 staff members.“One of the doctors, who tested positive on June 27, had been attending to patients. Others found positive are all members of his team. They have been isolated,” a senior official of the hospital said.FLU CORNER SET UP INSIDE, CROWDING WENT UNCHECKED During a recent inspection, the district health authorities had flagged improper crowd management at the hospital, despite high footfall. “We had asked them to ensure no crowding took place,” said Rajiv Narwal, nodal officer for Covid-19, Panchkula.“The flu corner is located inside the hospital, while it should be outside the building. There are no separate entry points. We had asked for action-taken report within 48 hours, but so far, the hospital has neither complied with our instructions nor filed the report,” he added.TAKING ALL PRECAUTIONS: HOSPITAL Hospital’s medical superintendent Dr Parmjit Singh Mann said, “In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, hospital management is taking all necessary precautions. Elective surgeries have already been minimised. All high-risk patients are being tested for Covid-19.”“To minimise rush, alternate days/timings of a few OPDs and appointment-based OPD consultation are already in place. All OPD areas are being cleaned after every two hours with disinfectant solution, and at night, all OPD rooms are fumigated, besides placing alcohol-based hand rub at all strategic locations,” he said.“Many positive patients have been successfully treated and discharged by the hospital,” Mann added.SIX NEW CASES The district tally rose to 119 with six new cases on Thursday. Of these, 91 have been discharged. There are now 28 active cases. Among the latest cases is a 20-year-old woman from Marranwala village in Kalka. She had recently travelled to Uttar Pradesh. A 29-year-old man, living in the Housing Board Complex, Kalka, was also confirmed infected. He is a contact of an already positive patient. A 63-year-man from Pinjore, and a 22-year-old man from Indira Colony, with a travel history of Delhi, were also found positive.The remaining two patients are two men, aged 59 and 25, both residents of Sector 17, Panchkula, and contacts of positive patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/76-year-old-woman-becomes-panchkula-s-first-covid-19-fatality/story-VmToXV3KZ8kTnMwCNlvUkN.html
03-07-2020||Mumbai||Hit by cyclone, Raigad district crawls back to normalcy||A month after severe cyclone Nisarga left a trail of destruction along the coastal and inland tehsils of Raigad district, the overall situation has steadily improved, the district collector said.The restoration, however, has been challenging following intense monsoon rains.During June, Raigad recorded 545.5 mm rain, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Though it was 22% deficient for the month, it had the third-highest rainfall among all districts in Maharashtra. The district has recorded 791 confirmed cases of Covid-19, 298 recoveries, and 17 deaths so far.According to the district administration, electricity had been restored across 1,700 of 1,976 villages in Raigad. “Non-electrified villages are mostly across Shrivardhan, Tala, Mhasla and Mangaon tehsils, which were worst-affected due to the cyclone,” said Nidhi Choudhari, district collector and magistrate, Raigad. “The administration has been working on a war-footing for relief and restoration activities but intense monsoon rain combined with inaccessibility to electricity poles in marshy areas or mangroves has made it even more challenging for us. Also, we are keeping a close watch to ensure residents follow social distancing and safety measures during the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Chaudhari.Overall, 87% electricity restored by the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd. (MSEDCL) across other 11 talukas apart from the four most affected ones. A total of 5.5 lakh of 6.35 lakh consumer’s power supply is currently in place, said Choudhari. “Teams from other districts arrived during the third week of June for restoration efforts. However, due to different topography and climate they have faced difficulties,” she said.Choudhari said 88,000 people had been paid relief for their damaged houses in the district while 1418 of 2136 water supply schemes had been activated through electricity restoration. “Remaining areas are using generators for water supply. Hence, people aren’t facing inconvenience,” said Choudhari.“Residents of nearby villages have either been given generators or they have managed to purchase one among three to four households. However, there is very little availability of kerosene to power them. This is still leading to a shortage of drinking water but the situation is better than before,” said Rajendra Kudekar, resident of Tala town in Mangaon.Dattatreya Karanje, resident of Aravi village, Shrivardhan said, “It is now 28 days since there is no electricity in our village. We have been provided with a few generators that are mostly used for pumping water from bore wells. The local administration said it will take one more week to restore power. We are used to the dark and the dim candle lights.”Alibag resident Kunal Salunkhe said, “More than relief from the state, quick intervention by residents, non-government bodies, and assistance from relatives from cities like Mumbai and Pune during the Covid-19 pandemic have helped normalise the situation. People have built more studier rooftops but unfortunately, they are still made using tin.” The administration said they had restored network connectivity with 435 of 548 mobile towers in Raigad. “Telecom operators have powered their towers with the help of generators,” said Choudhari.Sandeep Mendharkar from Mhasala said, “Network availability is still low. There are certain spots near villages and towns where there is a network, and this can be identified by a small crowd located there through the day across villages in Mhasla.” The collector said relief amount had been paid for all deceased, injured citizens, livestock, and the compensation process for crop losses is underway. “In all, 12,000 hectares of crop or horticultural losses were recorded in the district. Crop compensation takes more time as land records have many names and all have to either share their account details or give consent for the transfer of relief amount to one of the occupants,” said Choudhari.Kudekar said this was the reason why long queues were spotted at banks located in small towns. “The only functioning bank is Bank of India, and villagers from surrounding areas are queuing up to claim compensation. Some have come and returned almost five to six times until they receive their money,” he said.Meanwhile, for the 1.6 lakh tree fall cases during the cyclone, Choudhari said all roads had been cleared. “Wood of trees cut in the wadis (farmlands or hamlets) belongs to people. Directions were given to use the wood of trees fallen by local panchayats for shamshan ghats (burial sites). For major highways and roads, the tree barks are yet to be cut as in cut into logs. Those cutting branches and taking away are using it for fuel in rural areas,” said Choudhari.CYCLONE NISARGA: WHAT HAD HAPPENED?Nisarga, classified as a severe cyclonic storm, made landfall at Diveagar, located between Shrivardhan and Murud between 12.15pm and 12.30pm on June 3 as it passed over Raigad district following the onset of the southwest monsoon. The wind speed during and after landfall had touched a maximum of 120 kmph leading to rooftops of several structures blown away, tree fall and power line damages, and a communication blackout across 80% of Raigad. While 1.4 lakh houses were damaged, 5.2 lakh structures were partially damaged. In addition, 1.6 lakh tree fall incidents and 16,000 electricity infrastructure damages was recorded. The district administration had calculated ₹200 crore in property destruction, including ₹40 crore losses due to power infrastructure damages. It also led to issues such as the drinking water crisis as without electricity, people were unable to pump water from bore wells.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hit-by-cyclone-raigad-district-crawls-back-to-normalcy/story-NnMkyMMKJw3sPAFmoRdNQO.html

Students including those who have already applied for various entrance tests at PU are required to submit an online admission form for all undergraduate and postgraduate courses by August 8, 2020, a tentative date given by the university. Students can submit the admission form irrespective of the declaration of result of qualifying exam or entrance test.For detailed information on courses, eligibility criteria and number of seats, PU will release a handbook in the first week of July.Dean university instructions (DUI) RK Singla said, “We have initiated the admission process for the upcoming session. For examinations we are waiting for the directions of the University Grants Commission (UGC).”As compared to previous years, the admission process was delayed this year due to the outbreak of coronavirus. In 2019, the classwork for the new session had already started in July.How will the students react to the new development remains a question. Professor Rajat Sandhir of the biochemistry department said, “I think the university has taken the right step by initiating the admission process without any further delay. But I think the response [from the students] will not be good as many examinations are still pending.”Professor Navdeep Goyal, chairperson of the physics department, said, “In the best interest of the students and the university, at least the schedule for admission of ongoing classes with online teaching should be given out immediately.”PU’s Common Entrance Test (CET, PG) is scheduled for July 27 and 28, and CET (UG) is scheduled for August 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-clarity-on-pending-exams-yet-pu-initiates-admission-process-for-2020-21/story-ryaA2dfkzDf7emVVDEsMaL.html

03-07-2020||Pune||State will have to borrow money to pay salaries next month: Minister||In view of the fund crunch caused by the Covid-19 crisis, salaries of Maharashtra government employees are likely to be delayed further next month as the state plans to borrow money, according to Vijay Wadettiwar, Maharashtra minister for relief and rehabilitation “The situation is such that we will have to borrow money to pay salaries of state government employees next month. While we will not delay or deduct salaries of those fighting on the frontlines in the crisis, other employees may have to face a delay in getting payment,” said Wadettiwar, during a press conference on Thursday.The minister said state has not received any funds from the Centre, which according to him, has aggravated the situation. “We have not received any funds from the Centre. If someone is saying otherwise, he is betraying the state,” said the minister, an apparent reference to former chief minister and Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis, who had earlier said the Central government is helping Maharashtra in all possible ways.Earlier on Monday, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar also hinted that the state may have to raise funds in the form of loans to pay salaries of state employees as Maharashtra’s revenue has badly been impacted owing to a drastic fall in economic activities caused by the lockdown.Meanwhile, Wadettiwar said enough funds have been given to Pune-based training institute SARTHI (Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research Training and Human Development Institute (SARTHI), a non-profit government body for research, policy advocacy and training for socio-economic and education development of Maratha and Kunbi-Maratha communities.Maratha outfits have recently alleged that state government is apathetic towards SARTHI and wants to close it down. Responding to allegations, the minister said a section wants to bring in politics, although he would not name it and comment further. “Although the state government’s revenue has been hit due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown, we have given required funds to SARTHI and the institute will continue to function in the future. Some social organisations had claimed that the institute did not have enough funds to function and these claims were baseless and there is no question of closing it down,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/state-will-have-to-borrow-money-to-pay-salaries-next-month-minister/story-wetDyDAHgmDw3xhVS9I2iP.html
03-07-2020||Mumbai||FIR against Nanavati Hospital for overcharging||A first information report (FIR), based on a complaint from the civic body, has been filed against Nanavati hospital, one of the major hospitals dedicated to Covid-19 treatment in the city, for allegedly overcharging a patient. The 62-year-old patient, who was in hospital for 47 days, was charged ₹17 lakh, according to the complaint.The chairman, top management executives of hospital and other trustees have been booked by the police and summoned for recording their statements. Hindustan Times has a copy of the FIR, in which the names of the individuals have not been mentioned. The hospital management, in a statement, said, “We have learnt from media reports that an FIR has been filed owing to some alleged discrepancy in a bill. We are awaiting the copy of the complaint to scrutinise the bill and will fully cooperate with the authorities concerned to redress the issue.” “We have registered an offence against chairman and trustees of Nanavati hospital for overcharging a Covid patient, after receiving a complaint from [Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation] BMC officials. Investigation is on,” said Abhishek Trimukhe, deputy commissioner of police, zone 9.“We have received a complaint from BMC official on June 30 and on the basis of it, an FIR under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code has been registered against the executives of the Nanavati hospital,” said Suhas Raikar, assistant commissioner of police.According to the complaint, the victim is a woman from Santacruz. Her son said she was kept in a quarantine facility for two-three days in Lokhandwala. She was in a serious condition when she was taken to the institutional quarantine facility and then on May 9, she was admitted to Nanavati hospital.“She was in the hospital till June 24. She was kept in a non-ICU Covid ward for two days and later, was shifted to a Covid ICU ward. She was on a ventilator for at least 25 days,” the son said.At the time of the admission, her son deposited ₹90,000. After some days , he was asked to pay an additional amount. After 10-12 days, the family was told that the bill was ₹9 lakh and after deducting ₹5 lakh insurance cover and the ₹90,000 deposit, the family was to pay ₹3 lakh.The family approached Shiv Sena leader Nitin Nangaonkar, who spoke to the hospital’s management.As the time of discharge, the family was told that the total bill was ₹17 lakh and that the family has to pay ₹11 lakh after deducting insurance cover and depositThe family said that they were unable to pay the amount and the patient’s son said that no break-up of the bill was given. The son with the help of Sena leader approached BMC and civic officials began an inquiry.During the inquiry, civic officials found that the hospital did not follow the government’s order with respect to billing and charged the patient exorbitantly, the police said.Ramchandra Khobrekar, junior auditor of BMC’s K/W ward, then filed the police complaint on behalf of BMC. The patient was made witness in the complaint. Khobrekar was unable for comment.In May, Maharashtra imposed a price cap on private hospitals treating Covid-19 patients after allegations that many of these healthcare facilities were charging exorbitant fees in a bid to compensate for a 90% dip in the admission of non-Covid-19 patients. Restrictions had also been imposed on the billing of medicines in private hospitals.Private hospitals are allowed to charge up to ₹4,000 daily for the treatment of Covid-19 patients on a general bed, Rs7,000 for intensive care unit (ICU) and ₹9,000 for a ventilator, according to the new guidelines issued by the state health department.All private hospitals come under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, and are liable to follow the rules of the state government amid the pandemic.The state government offers three kinds of facilities to treat Covid-19 patients.Government-run hospitals are offering treatment for free, while 1,000 hospitals are covered under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana, which provides insurance coverage of ₹1.5 lakh. Private hospitals have to provide treatment as per the concessional rate decided by the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fir-against-nanavati-hospital-for-overcharging/story-0i4OL0Txeix1FUncVwAfGI.html
03-07-2020||Chandigarh||HC restrains Haryana from giving info about Hisar private schools under RTI||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday restrained Haryana government from disbursing information about some private schools sought by some private persons under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.The high court order came on the plea of Sarva Haryana Private School Trust, a Hisar-based trust with 153 member schools in the district, which had approached the court seeking direction to different Haryana government departments to not supply any information about the member schools. The high court bench of justice Deepak Sibal has asked the schools to provide information to the government departments but the latter have been restrained from disbursing the same to private parties without court’s permission.The trust alleged that private persons could utilise the information for fishing expedition to fulfil their ulterior motives as the information as it could undermine the safety and security of the staff and students of schools. The trust had also sought quashing of instructions from different departments to provide information which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of schools. The response has been sought by July 1||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-restrains-haryana-from-giving-info-about-hisar-private-schools-under-rti/story-ZZQhdirFfevuDy4H8KEZOI.html
03-07-2020||Mumbai||Maha sees its highest 1-day jump of 6,330 Covid cases||Maharashtra on Thursday recorded its highest single-day spike of 6,330 Covid-19 cases, first in excess of 6,000, as the tally rose to 1,86,626. Of them, 77,260 are active cases, according to data released by the state health department.In a relief, the number of recovered patients crossed the 1 lakh mark. In the past 24 hours, 8,018 patients had recovered or got discharged from hospitals, after which the tally of recovered patients reached 1,01,172. This also pushed the recovery rate of the state to 54.21%.Besides, the state has also conducted over 10 lakh Covid-19 tests. On Thursday, the health department said the number of tests conducted at various public and private laboratories stood at 10,20,368. Of them, 8,33,742 people tested negative. It means 18.29% of the total samples tested positive, said an official. Maharashtra has conducted 11.26% of the total tests in the country, as of July 1, with 90,56,173 samples tested across the country.As there was a projection that the peak is likely to come this month, the number of fresh cases is likely to further rise and the situation may become more challenging in the coming days. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had on Sunday confirmed that there will be a spike in infections in the next few weeks as they have opened up activities and are giving further relaxations from lockdown to ensure revival of the economy. But following the surge in infections, the state has put on hold its plans to provide more relaxations.Meanwhile, state health minister Rajesh Tope clarified that there is no community transmission in the state. “The number of fresh cases is increasing, but it cannot be termed as community transmission as most cases are coming either from containment zones or institutional quarantine facilities. There is no community spread in the state yet,” Tope said.The state on Thursday recorded 125 deaths, taking the toll to 8,178. Of them, 110 deaths were from past 48 hours, while the rest were from past few days, the health officials said.Mumbai crossed the 80,000 mark after recording 1,554 cases in the past 24 hours. The city’s case count stands at 80,699, of which, 25,311 are active cases. Mumbai’s toll stands at 4,689 after 58 deaths were reported.Following the spike in cases, many cities and districts have re-imposed lockdown, although for a brief period, to break the chain of the virus’s spread.Cities in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) such as Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli, Mira-Bhayandar, Ulhasnagar have imposed lockdown in their jurisdiction for ten days, while in Navi Mumbai and Panvel, it will be enforced from Friday for the next ten days. In Mira Bhayander, it was imposed from July 1. In MMR, cases have increased to 1,24,597 from 55,086 on June 3, when the state decided to provide relaxations in red zones, including MMR.In Mumbai, police has restricted the travel up to 2-km for residents, except for office-goers and essential services.The health minister said that they have found people stepping out of their homes unnecessarily and if that is resulting in rise in cases then curbs will have to be brought back. “The state has empowered all municipal commissioners and district collectors to impose necessary restrictions in their jurisdiction to contain spread of the pandemic, whenever required,” Tope said.Lockdown will also be imposed for 12 days in Panvel, which comes under Raigad district, due to spike in cases, from July 3. Aditi Tatkare, guardian minister of the district, said the Raigad is facing different situation as it was also affected by Cyclone Nisarga. “There was movement in the district because of different priorities as it was also affected due to cyclone. People from Mumbai have also come in the district as they have their home here too. More importantly, 85-90% of the daily cases are found among people related to essential services or their close contacts,” Tatkare said. Panvel has 2,652 cases at present.In a meeting chaired by the chief minister to review the pandemic crisis in MMR last week, more stress was given on building jumbo hospitals in the satellite cities, because they don’t have enough health infrastructure to cope with the crisis in case of a peak. The CM instructed local authorities to focus on augmenting health infrastructure as we have to be prepared in advance,” said an official, privy to the development. In other cities such as Aurangabad, lockdown will be imposed in Walunj industrial area between July 4-12. In Nashik city, night curfew has been imposed from 7pm to 5am to curb the pandemic’s spread.Aurangabad and Nashik have 4,688 and 2,491 cases respectively. Districts such as Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Beed too have imposed lockdown in their jurisdiction following surge in cases. In Ratnagiri, it was enforced from July 1 for eight days, Sindhudurg and Beed imposed it for seven days from July 2.Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Beed have 630, 221 and 121 cases respectively. Along with surge in cases, the state is also facing a rise in the number of deaths. To control the situation, the state on Thursday declared to start a task force of expert doctors in all districts. State medical education minister Amit Deshmukh said that the task force will work on the lines of the one made in Mumbai. “The task force will decide treatment for all types of Covid-19 patients. They will also coordinate among all local authorities in a district. This will help in reducing mortalities as well as control the spread,” Deshmukh said. With 8,053 deaths on Wednesday, the case fatality rate (CFR) of the state was recorded on 4.47%. It is the second-highest in the country after Gujarat, where CFR is 5.62% with 1,867 deaths (33,232 cases) till Wednesday, according to the statistics shared by the state medical education department.Maharashtra still has highest number of deaths across states in the country.By the end of May, the state had successfully brought down the CFR to 3.26% (on May 26) from 7.41% (with 148 deaths) on April 13.So far, 41,741 people have been kept in institutional quarantine in the state and over 5,72,032 people have been put under home quarantine.The health minister said they will be starting use of plasma therapy in all the districts as it is found as an effective way of treatment. “Nine of ten patients are responding well to the therapy,” he said.Tope also said that they will be allowing relatives of the patients to enter Covid hospitals. They will also be directing the hospitals to install CCTV cameras in intensive care units (ICU) so that relatives can see patients from outside.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-sees-its-highest-1-day-jump-of-6-330-covid-cases/story-wGdpImVzfnGJfTsZFrxMAI.html

The samples will help researchers understand the early predictors of disease severity and how it develops given the immune response and other factors.“The biorepository will be critical to steer research towards innovating the development of new diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines,” said IMTECH director Dr Sanjeev Khosla. CSIR-IMTECH has also been authorised to share the samples with academia, industry, and commercial entities after scrutinising the purpose of the request and ensuring benefit to the country.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has asked all states to provide access to Covid samples to the designated biorepositories across the country.The MTCC at CSIR-IMTECH, where the samples will be stored, is a national facility established in 1986 and recognised as an International Depositary Authority (IDA).Various research institutes, academic organisations, pharmaceutical, biotech, and food industries involved in microbiological and biotechnological research regularly approach MTCC for microbial cultures and other microbiology-related services.“The biorepository at CSIR-IMTECH will collect the samples, transport, aliquot, store and share them as per standard operating procedure,” said Dr Khosla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/csir-imtech-to-have-biorepository-of-covid-19-samples/story-Rx0WonOouEXlbgPSPAvB9I.html
03-07-2020||Chandigarh||Sukhbir urges PM to probe embezzlement in ration distribution||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Thursday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to order a probe into the embezzlement of central rations by Congressmen and favouritism in distribution of foodgrain and pulses to their supporters in Punjab.In a letter to the Prime Minister, the SAD chief requested that ration being sent under the extended Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) be monitored stringently through central observers to ensure ration received under the scheme is not pilfered and sold in the open market or distributed among Congress supporters again. Necessary measures are needed to ensure there is no discrimination in distribution of central foodgrain in the state, he added.Stating that it was of utmost importance that the central relief be distributed impartially on merit without any politicisation whatsoever, Sukhbir said even though the centre sent 70,725 metric tonnes of grain besides 10,000 metric tonnes of pulses to Punjab, the same was not distributed among the people. “While only 1% of the entire food grain stock was distributed during the month of April when curfew was imposed in Punjab and people needed the ration the most, the Punjab government later abrogated its responsibility towards the people and handed over the ration to Congressmen for distribution,” he said.He alleged that a major part of the central ration was embezzled by Congressmen even as they distributed part it to their supporters only. He said this worsened the plight of the poor and weaker sections of society who had to rely on social and religious organisations, including the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), for basic food items.The SAD chief urged the Prime Minister to constitute a special team to probe the entire scam. “As per our reports thousands of tonnes of food stock were never distributed to the poor. The stock of wheat and pulses was shifted to residences of Congressmen and later sold in the open market,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sukhbir-urges-pm-to-probe-embezzlement-in-ration-distribution/story-h18xRKOnOCKjQYedbLiKAO.html

An official of Punjab Police intelligence wing said the Centre has issued directions to the security agencies to keep a close eye on the Golden Temple premises in the wake of the call given by the SFJ headed by lawyer Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, who is among the nine people declared terrorist by the Union government under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act on Wednesday.Devotees visiting the Golden Temple are being watched closely by the personnel of different wings of the Punjab Police. However, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Jagmohan Singh said, “They (SFJ) are giving calls from foreign countries and they don’t have followers here. So, we are doing routine duty around the shrine complex and no extra arrangements have been made. There are no inputs to put the force on extra alert.”Even as cops are always there at the shrine complex in civil dress, the DCP said it was the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC)’s duty to keep a vigil and ensure order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/as-sfj-begins-referendum-registration-today-vigil-up-at-golden-temple/story-qT70oMd65dwGXB06AxIsBO.html
03-07-2020||Chandigarh||Community spread spirals in Amritsar, but contact tracing remains poor||Even as the cases of Covid-19 community transmission are on the rise in the Amritsar district, the health department’s tracing of contacts of positive patients continues to be far from satisfactory. So far, the district, which was categorised as a ‘red zone’, has repoted 971 coronavirus cases, including 45 deaths.In the past one week, the district witnessed a total of 75 cases of which 67 (nearly 90%) are of community spread and eight deaths. The remaining 10% patients were close contacts of those infected earlier. For the 957 positive cases reported in the district till June 30, the health department traced only 2,323 of their contacts for testing.“The officials and the medical staff were given instructions by the state government to trace the close contacts of the suspected patients and and those found positive. Even in the community transmission stage, the medical teams were only focusing on taking samples of the family members of the positive patients. They showed less interest tracing the source of infection. The poor contact tracing is another reason behind the hike in cases in the district. Now, it is being difficult to break the infection chain,” said a health department official.Civil surgeon Dr Navdeep Singh issued the notices to the district epidemiologist and the Covid-19 nodal officer besides senior medical officers to ramp up testing of close contacts of those found positive.“To contain the community spread we must trace the contacts of all the positive patients within 24 hours of the arrival of their reports. Testing of 2,323 contacts of 957 positive patients is grossly inadequate and the work is unsatisfactory. The medical teams must trace at least 10 contacts of each Covid-19 patient. The negligence in contact tracing will not be tolerated,” the civil surgeon’s order reads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/community-spread-spirals-in-amritsar-but-contact-tracing-remains-poor/story-RPpNEIGPgpXRyBMmedclPL.html

IGP Sharma said investigations suggest it was not a parcel bomb. “It was some kind of locally-made low-intensity explosive device. We were not able to identify the explosive material and the device and sought assistance from the NSG. So far, there is no lead but we are investigating all angles. The role of the injured is also under investigation,” he said.Baghapurana DSP Jasbinder Singh said it was a kind of ‘desi-bomb’. “We are investigating to find out who was behind this,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/nsg-team-visits-blast-site-in-moga-collects-samples/story-uptAE68Vi3oRzYWKJWJl6O.html

The windscreen was also partly broken. “Mohit called me at 8pm on Wednesday informing that he was going to Dinanagar to collect money from some customers and will be back by 10pm. When he didn’t return, I called him only to find his mobile phone switched off. We started searching for him in the morning, but to no avail. After some time, some policemen informed us about the incident,” said Ramesh Kumar, the victim’s brother. “My brother had sold two laptops and he should have been carrying around ₹1.5 lakh. But the cash was missing,” he added.Superintendent of police (investigation) Prabhjot Singh Virk, who reached the spot to investigate the case, said their preliminary probe suggested that the victim was on his way back home when the incident took place. “We have registered a case under Section 302 (murder) against unidentified persons. The body was sent for post-mortem.

The first FIR had alleged that Yes Bank had invested ₹3,700 crore in short-term debentures of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) between April and June 2018, in return for which Kapoor was allegedly paid ‘kickbacks’ amounting to ₹600 crore by DHFL promoter Kapil Wadhawan.DHFL sanctioned a loan to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RAB Enterprises in which Kapoor’s wife Bindu is a director and 100% shareholder, alleged CBI. Kapoor’s daughters, Rakhee Kapoor Tandon, Roshni Kapoor, and Radha Kapoor, are also 100% shareholders in DoIT Urban Ventures.Based on the case registered by CBI, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) began its probe into allegations of money laundering by the accused. Kapoor is presently in judicial custody in connection with the ED caseIn the second case, CBI alleged that Kapoor and his wife bought a bungalow from Avantha Group promoter Gautam Thapar at a much lower price than its valuation. In the past, Thapar had mortgaged the bungalow for a corporate loan of ₹600 crore, but he sold it for ₹380 crore to Bliss Abode Pvt Ltd, in which Kapoor’s wife was a director at the time.The investigative agency had on March 20 obtained a production warrant to arrest Kapoor after he was remanded in judicial custody by the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court. The agency, however, had not executed the warrant.Fearing arrest by CBI, Kapoor had approached the special CBI court for pre-arrest bail last month, following which the court had directed the agency to file a reply on Kapoor’s plea. On Thursday, when the plea came up for hearing, Kapoor’s lawyers Abad Ponda and Subhash Jadhav sought interim protection from arrest.The central agency had not submitted its reply on the plea due to which the special court granted protection from arrest to Kapoor till July 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yes-bank-fraud-rana-kapoor-gets-interim-protection-from-arrest-till-july-11/story-VMw347voDi73oHXparVAEL.html

He says that the people of Haryana will then have the option of either siding with Punjab as an independent country or of leaving the State and moving to other parts of India. He extorts the Sikhs from Haryana to take part in the voter registration for a so-called referendum to be held online on July 4, 2020,” reads the FIR.The FIR also mentions that SFJ is a “pro-Khalistan organisation” based in the United States of America that has been declared to be an ‘Unlawful Association’ under the provisions of sections 3 (1) (3) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 1967 by the union ministry of home affairs(MHA).The complaint says, “SFJ has been found to be indulging in activities that are prejudicial to the public order and the internal security of India and that have the potential of disrupting peace, unity, and integrity of the country. SFJ is in close touch with militant organisations that support the violent form of extremism and militancy in Punjab and elsewhere and has a declared objective of carving out a sovereign Khalistan out of the territory of India.”Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police, crime, said, “An FIR has been registered at Bhondsi police station.

03-07-2020||Chandigarh||FINANCIAL MESS: Higher education dept asks Punjabi varsity officials to pull up their socks||Taking a serious note of the financial mess at Punjab University, Patiala, the Punjab higher education department has directed its authorities to pull up their socks in order to bring the 58-year-old institution back on track.A high-level meeting chaired by secretary, higher education, Rahul Bhandari was held in Chandigarh on Thursday to discuss issues, especially the financial crisis in the university, at length. The varsity is toiling hard to meet its monthly committed expenditure, including payment of salaries to its employees.Vice-chancellor Prof BS Ghuman, along with a team of senior functionaries of university, higher education department and three retired professors of government colleges attended the meeting.“A meeting was held not only to take stock of the present situation, but to have a freewheeling discussion to resolve key issues, such as financial mess and pending inquiry reports, at the earliest. The basic purpose of the meeting was to come up with immediate steps to improve the overall condition of the university,” Bhandari said.On the financial front, Bhandari said the department told the university authorities that the government can only provide annual grant as allocated, while it has to generate its income from its own resources.“Though vice-chancellor is empowered to take all key decisions, the department has asked the university to reduce its expenses and adopt some austerity measures to stabilise its financial condition. Moreover, the university has been suggested to rationalise courses and discontinue that do not attract admissions,” said Bhandari.As per budgetary proposals for this fiscal, the university expects an income of ₹380 crore, while the expenditure is pegged at ₹676 crore, leaving a massive ₹296-crore deficit. The university also has an overdraft of ₹140 crore, which is expected to touch ₹150 crore by the end of the year.The failure of varsity in making timely payments of salaries has forced teaching, non-teaching employees and pensions to sit on protest for the past one month.Going through the univeristy exchequer, Bhandari said the university management has been asked to carry out rationalisation of teaching and non-teaching staff to check overstaffing.ON PENDING INQUIRY REPORTSThe officials also held discussion on pending action on inquiry reports related to allegations of corruption, nepotism and misuse of funds during 2007-2017.Following the resignation of former vice-chancellor Dr Jaspal Singh in March 2017, the then secretary, higher education, Anurag Verma, who was appointed as the officiating V-C, ordered 14 internal inquiries in April 2017.A two-member committee, comprising of former IAS officer Jagjit Puri and former IPS officer VK Kapoor, was setup. The panel submitted its sealed findings to the university in July 2018, but no action has been taken so far.“I have asked the vice-chancellor to hold a syndicate meeting at the earliest so as to decide future of these reports,” Bhandari said.V-C Prof BS Ghuman and registrar Prof Manjit Singh Nijjar could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/financial-mess-higher-education-dept-asks-punjabi-varsity-officials-to-pull-up-their-socks/story-H4YrHT6UzV6SIVklTXpJcM.html
03-07-2020||City||Anxiety, anticipation in rapid test centres across ‘red zones’||New Delhi: It is largely quiet at the local community hall in Sarita Vihar’s Block A, one of Delhi’s 445 containment zones, as people queue up for a 30-minute test that will determine whether they picked up the Sars-Cov-2 virus. Outside, all businesses are shut and access to the neighbourhood of around 750 families is extremely restricted – as is the exit. In a sudden flutter of activity, officials in bodysuits gather around and ask people to spread out as a woman, in her mid-thirties, finds out she is positive, almost immediately breaking down. The scene reflects the tense wait common to the hundreds of antigen testing centre around the capital, which have now become equally important as the web of dozens of diagnostic labs that together carry out tests for Covid-19. The antigen tests, rolled out on June 18 in community halls, schools and banquet halls across the city, offer a result in less than 30-minute, removing a significant bottleneck in what is the first of the three crucial steps to contain the epidemic: test, trace and isolate. “We are encouraging people to get tested, and the response has been positive so far. We conduct around 100 Covid-19 tests every day, of which only three or four test positive,” a health department official, who asked not to be named, said outside the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) community hall in the area.Pocket A houses around 750 families, all of whom are holed up in their DDA-built flats. The colony’s gates are blocked by Delhi Police barricades, cops stand guard outside while health workers keep a close watch on the streets inside the block. Essential service work and deliveries, such as groceries, are allowed only after application for passes are checked by the district magistrate. There were at least eight positives cases on the day the government issued the sealing order. Officials at the spot, who did not wish to be named, said there could be around 20 cases, many with mild or no symptoms. “It smells like a hospital here,” said Rakesh, a civil defence volunteer deployed in the area to monitor the containment area. The community hall, which earlier hosted bustling crowds for weddings and birthday parties, is now swarming with health officers in personal protective equipment (PPE) suits and sanitation workers who disinfect every inch of the main hall.“They have asked me to wait for half an hour. It reminds me of our schools days when we waited for the results after the exams. Only this time, it is more serious and the consequences could be fatal,” said Arjun K, a local resident. The collection of the sample – a health worker uses a cotton-tipped bud to swab the insides of the nose and the throat – takes a quick minute, but it takes another 20 for the stick-like kit to show whether the sample has the virus. “I know I do not have the virus but I still came to take the test because ours is a containment zone. One may admit or may not admit it, but everyone here is scared,” said Gopal Singh, 35, while for his turn in what was quickly turning into a warm, humid hall as the sun rose higher in the hot afternoon.The facility is centrally air-conditioned but officials have kept all doors and windows open in order to minimise the risk of indoor spread of the virus, which has been established to spread the air-conditioning flow.According to government records, until June 26, of 99,274 people across Delhi surveyed using the rapid antigen method, 7,414 have tested positive, suggesting a positivity rate of 7.46% among them. “The ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research] has said the sensitivity of the antigen test is 50-80%. Suppose there are 100 positive cases, and if you apply gold standard tests then all 100 will test positive. But if you apply a test that has 80% sensitivity, that means it will be able to detect 80 such cases. There may be some false-negative cases. But on the positive side, you get results quickly,” said Dr Puneet Mishra, professor of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, welcoming the antigen testing campaign and urging as many people as possible to get tested. “To some extent, this will help contain the virus. There is no harm in getting tested. The government is also doing it for free. But again, until there is a cure, people must maintain social distancing and wear masks,” he added.Pawan Rohail, a civil defence volunteer says, says he has to take the test once a week. “We work in containment zones for almost 12 hours a day. I can understand what residents must be feeling because we take tests every week and go through the same nervousness. This nervousness has become routine now.”People like him were previously involved in other civil assistance work. A fellow civil defence volunteer, Pankaj Kumar, was a marshal on DTC buses to ensure women’s safety. “In the morning we were helping officials ensure social distancing. Now I am back to showing the sanitation worker every inch of space that people had used in the morning. The virus could be anywhere. Our job is to kill it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/anxiety-anticipation-in-rapid-test-centres-across-red-zones/story-hBybkXEN0iIpOxXMgUIIQN.html
03-07-2020||Chandigarh||Amritsar GMC PPE scam probe stuck as testing report on kits awaited from DRDE||The investigation into the alleged scam involving purchase of personal protection equipment (PPE) at Government Medical College (GMC), Amritsar, has got delayed as the authorities are yet to receive the testing and certification reports of kits from the Defence Research and Development Establishment (DRDE). The DRDE, an agency of the defence ministry, has been authorised to conduct laboratory testing of Covid-19 kits. The alleged purchase scam surfaced in April when doctors, nurses and other medical staff at the hospital refused to use the 2,000 kits saying they were substandard and did not have N-95 masks. They had also accused the authorities of paying around ₹41 lakh for the kits, which according to them should not have cost more than ₹7 lakh. Guru Nanak Dev Hospital (GMC’s hospital) medical superintendent Dr Raman Sharma had placed the order to buy the kits. On April 24, Amritsar deputy commissioner Shiv Dular Singh Dhillon marked an inquiry into the matter to Pallavi Chaudhary, chief administrator, Amritsar Development Authority. But no report has been submitted yet. After the Centre wrote to the Punjab government to complete the inquiry in a time-bound manner on June 23, on the request of Amritsar MP Gurjit Singh Aujla, the probe picked up pace and statements of 20 doctors were recorded.Even after the enquiry into the alleged scam was marked on April 24, it took around 44 days for the hospital authorities to send the samples of PPE kits to the DRDE for testing. “The samples of PPE kits were sent on June 7. The reports from DRDE were supposed to be received within a month. We recently sent a reminder to DRDE asking for the reports,” said Dr Raman Sharma. Dr Sujata Sharma, who was shunted out as GMC principal on Wednesday, said, “The probe cannot be completed till the DRDE sends reports as we cannot ascertain if the kits were substandard or not.”Besides the probe entrusted by the DC, Dr Sujata Sharma had also formed an inquiry panel of college officials to look into the matter.On Thursday, GMC committee in-charge Dr JP Atri submitted a confidential report to Pallavi Chaudhary who was not available for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amritsar-gmc-ppe-scam-probe-stuck-as-testing-report-on-kits-awaited-from-drde/story-b6Wuy8yuf0hcxVNSY3LJkL.html
03-07-2020||City||Badlapur residents warn homebuyers about lack of water supply||Irked with water woes in Badlapur city, residents of Shirgaon, Badlapur have put up signboards across the locality asking home buyers to be wise while booking flats in this area stating that residents have been facing water shortage since the past five years.The signboards read, “This is to inform those who are planning to buy flats at Shirgaon in Badlapur that the area has severe water shortage, water supply is at very low pressure. Do not fall prey into the traps of the builders and be alert while booking a flat here.”Arun Surval, a 51-year-old resident of Shirgaon, said, “We hardly get water for half an hour and sometimes at low pressure. There are so many new constructions in these areas, but there is no effort to provide adequate water supply to the residents. People pay lakhs for flats and then face water shortage. We don’t want others to fall prey like us.”“We had complained about this to officials but no solution has been given yet. With the kind of construction works happening in these areas, the authorities should sort out our water supply woes,” he added.Shirgaon and nearby areas in Badlapur Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) region comprises of a population of around 50,000 people which is increasing with more constructions coming up in the area.“Sometimes when the water supply is inadequate we have to depend on tankers. The tankers are not easy to get and the water is unhealthy and stinks. We don’t know from where it is lifted. When we bought a flat here around four years ago, the water supply was adequate. However, it’s not the same now,” said Uday Patil, 40, another resident.The Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (MJP) supplies a total of 30 MLD water to these areas. “Recently there have been issues with pumping water, and we are working on regularising it. Meanwhile, we have also got the approval for the increase in quota of water supply for the area, though the quantity is not yet finalised. We are preparing a plan to set up a system and distribution network for the additional supply. The work is in progress,” said an official from MJP, who did not wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/badlapur-residents-warn-homebuyers-about-lack-of-water-supply/story-TCaXRFMLaZYa32yDHAIy8J.html

After paying more than ₹12,000 crore towards 19 lakh beneficiaries, the scheme was put on hold owing to the cash crunch due to the lockdown. Patil said that after the two phases of loan waiver, the process of verification of accounts and authentication of Aadhaar numbers was stalled due to the lockdown. “It has now been resumed, and we have released ₹2,000 crore for its next phase. Farmers in the list of beneficiaries are requested to complete their authentication at the earliest,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/will-disburse-8-200-crore-for-farm-loan-waiver-by-month-end/story-d9llwXzebG1HRDqzJezndP.html
03-07-2020||Chandigarh||2015 FIRING: SIT adds charges of fabricating evidence to Behbal Kalan case||The special investigations team (SIT) probing the 2015 police firing on the Bargari sacrilege protesters on Thursday added charges of fabricating evidence in the Behbal Kalan case, earlier registered under sections of murder and attempt to murder. The move comes days after the SIT arrested Faridkot lawyer Sohail Singh Brar and Pankaj Bansal, a Moga-based car dealer, for their alleged role in fabricating evidence in the Behbal Kalan firing episode. The SIT had arrested Brar and Bansal for allegedly helping the accused policemen in constructing ‘fake self-defence theory’ by fabricating bullet marks on the escort vehicle of the then Moga senior superintendent of police (SSP) Charanjit Singh Sharma. Brar was arrested on June 16, while Bansal was taken in custody on June 20. Sections 194 (giving or fabricating false evidence with intent to procure conviction of capital offence) and 195 (giving or fabricating false evidence with intent to procure conviction of offence punishable with imprisonment for life or imprisonment) of Indian Penal Code were added to the FIR filed in 2018.Last month, the SIT also added Section 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment) to the FIR.PRODUCTION WARRANT OF EX-SHO ALLOWEDJudicial magistrate (first class) Ekta Uppal on Thursday allowed production warrant of then Kotkapura station house officer (SHO) Gurdeep Singh Pandher on the plea of the SIT. Pandher was arrested on June 25 for his alleged role in tampering with evidence in the Kotkapura firing case. He was sent to judicial custody the next day. District attorney Rajnish Goyal, who appeared for SIT, said, “The Bathinda jail superintendent has been asked to produce Pandher in the court on Friday. We will demand his police custody for further investigation.”HEARING ON BAIL PLEA ADJOURNED Acting district and sessions judge Harbans Singh Lekhi adjourned the hearing in the bail applications of Pandher, Brar and Bansal, who were arrested in the 2015 Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura police firing cases, to Saturday. They all are in judicial custody.

03-07-2020||Noida||Amputated hand re-joined in rare surgery at Noida hospital||Doctors at a Noida-based hospital have performed a rare surgery and rejoined the amputated the hand of 25-year-old Greater Noida-based man. The patient’s family members have termed it a “miracle”. On June 29, a family dispute over property in Greater Noida’s Niyana village under Kasna police area led to altercation, leading to the left hand of Devender Bhati getting amputated via an axe-like object. “Devender is a contractual worker with the Greater Noida Authority. His father Rajinder, too, suffered injuries and multiple fractures. Bijendra Singh, a relative, was shot dead by the opposing party,” said Dinesh Kumar Kapasiya, Devender’s cousin.He said when Devender was injured when he went to the aid of Bijendra, when Nishant, another accused, allegedly attacked him with a sharp edged, axe-like tool, which dismembered his hand from his arm. “Police have arrested four of the accused while one accused is yet to be arrested,” he added.Devender’s relatives immediately picked up his dismembered hand, tied a cloth around the profusely bleeding stump and took him to a local hospital. “As the local hospital did not have the facility for a replantation surgery, I called up the Jaypee Hospital,” Dinesh said.He initially took the victim to Yatharth Hospital, from there he was taken to the Jaypee Hospital in an ambulance.“It is a miracle for us. The hand has been joined by Dr Ashish Rai. It’s nothing short of a miracle for us,” he added.Dr Ashish Rai, additional director, plastic, aesthetic and reconstructive surgery, Jaypee Hospital, Noida, said Wednesday, “I asked them not to waste time and rush him to the hospital. The patient took another hour to reach the hospital. Already three-and-a-half hours had passed since the incident and I was worried about the success of the surgery. “We took the patient straight to the Operation Theatre without waiting for the Covid-19 test as another hour’s delay would have done irreversible damage. After a seven-hour long surgery, we were able to successfully join the hand to the forearm,” he said.“The patient is doing well and his hand is holding very well. He is on antibiotics and blood thinner and will be discharged in one week. This is a rare surgery requiring micro vascular and hand surgery expertise,” said Dr Rai, adding that his Covid test reports have come out negative.“It was a race against time as if we are not able to restore the blood supply within six hours of amputation, the chances of failure is high,” said Rai.Indian Medical Association Noida president Dr NK Sharma said, “Noida has been emerging as a medical hub for rare surgeries. The doctor has done commendable surgery. In the city, Sharda Hospital, Kailash Hospital, Fortis Hospital and Metro Hospital & Heart Institute have been performing rare surgeries. Medanta hospital has also bought land in Noida for setting up of a hospital.”Noida district CMO Dr Deepak Ohri could not be contacted despite repeated attempts. “The FIR has been lodged at Kasna Police station. Police have arrested four accused so far: Jasmal, Raj Kumar, Nishant and Monty. Another accused is yet to be arrested,” added Dinesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/amputated-hand-re-joined-in-rare-surgery-at-noida-hospital/story-rsMWEW2soTrTvgX2z2x3BP.html
03-07-2020||Mumbai||No work, salary: House helps’ struggle continues||Shahida Shaikh, resident of the slum area in Goregaon’s Bhagat Singh Nagar, is unemployed from more than three months, after the lockdown was imposed. Four of the five homes where she used to work as a domestic help asked her not to come to work until the outbreak is over.Currently, she has resumed work only at one home, for which she will be paid a monthly salary of ₹1,200. Her 20-year old son used to work at a garage, but owing to the lockdown, it is currently shut. The mother and son are struggling to even manage meals twice a day. With bills piled up from the past three months, Shaikh has been received warnings stating that her water and power supply will be disconnected if she does not pay the amount at the immediately. Moreover, she also suffers from a liver ailment and is finding it difficult to arrange for medicines. She also has been postponing the sonography which her doctor has advised her to undergo.“Not only Shaikh, but thousands of domestic helps in the city are struggling for their survival. Only 4-5% of them have been paid for April, while none of them have been paid after that. Many lost their jobs. Some of them are now selling vada-paav, vegetables or eggs, but not without disruptions from the authorities,” said Babli Rawat, general secretary, National Federation of Domestic Workers.While the state cooperation department said that housing societies cannot prevent the entry of domestic helps, most societies are not keen to rehire them owing to the fear of the spread of the virus.Apathy at the government level has made the situation even more challenging as the welfare board for domestic helps constituted a decade ago is defunct and the welfare schemes remain only on papers. Activists now demand for the resumption of the schemes and urge the state to tweak the Domestic Workers Welfare Board Act to ensure minimum wages, weekly-offs, sick leaves, Diwali bonus and other welfare benefits to house helps.Vilas Borade, general secretary of Vidarbha Molkarin Sanghatana, a state-based organisation for house helps, said, “Most of the welfare schemes are defunct on papers from the past six years as the government did not make adequate provisions or revived the welfare board. Since there are no schemes in operation, the members are not willing to pay their annual fees to keep their membership valid. The state should allot ₹10 crore every year to keep the welfare schemes going. In the two-day session of various organisations working for the domestic helps in December, we passed a resolution urging the state to bring changes in the Act.”According to a senior official from the office of the development commissioner of labour (unorganised labour), the number of members registered with the Maharashtra Domestic Welfare Board dropped to 1 lakh. According to rough estimates, more than 25 lakh people, mostly women, work as domestic helps in the state.“There were 4.5 lakh registrations of domestic helps previously, which dropped to 1 lakh now. From one-time cash benefits such as Sanman Dhan of ₹10,000 to domestic helps in the 55-60 age group, to scholarships, maternity benefits and funeral assistance, we extend the benefits as and when they are applied for,” the official said.Labour department’s website stated that 1,902 members were paid ₹10,000 each as Sanman Dhan, though the official claimed that more than 12,000 members were paid the amount. Most other insurance schemes covering accidental deaths and disability benefits were linked to Life Insurance Corporation’s (LIC’s) Janashree Yojana, but the state government has not paid its premium as it wants to link the scheme to centrally-sponsored schemes. Activists, however, said the money has not disbursed in the past six years. “The Prithviraj Chavan government made the budgetary allocation, but the next government dissolved our board in 2014, comprising the representatives of helps, organisations and employers. It has been now a one-member board headed by the development commissioner and with no budgetary allocation,” said Rupa Kulkarni, one of the former members of the board.Development commissioner (unorganised labour) Pankaj Kumar said, “We proposed to extend Prime Minister Jeevan Jyoti and Prime Minister Suraksha Bima Yojana insurance schemes after the Janashree scheme was discontinued. We are awaiting the government’s nod now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-work-salary-house-helps-struggle-continues/story-h3hliKCaAZq0zm9Lftp0fL.html
03-07-2020||Mumbai||Hot spot Govandi shows signs of improvement says BMC||After Dharavi, Mumbai’s second largest slum belt Govandi-Mankhurd is showing show signs of improvement in the fight against Covid-19. M-East ward, which includes slum pockets of Deonar, Govandi, Baiganwadi, Shivaji Nagar and Cheetah Camp and Deonar dumping ground, is spread across an area of 32.50sqkm. The total population of the ward is 8,06,433, of which 6,85,468 lives in slums. As of Thursday, the doubling rate of Covid-19 cases in these areas reached 68 days, compared to the city’s 41 days. The doubling rate is the amount of time required for the cases to double. The average daily infected cases reported in M-East ward have come down from 80-90 cases in May-end to 15-20 cases in the past one week, according to data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). However, experts remain sceptical, claiming BMC has not released crucial data to determine if the situation on ground has improved.In the second week of May, M-East had the highest number of Covid cases, Govandi being a hot spot. Almost 70% of the cases reported in M-East were from Govandi, mainly from Baiganwadi, Shivaji Nagar, Limouni Baug and Natvar Parek compound. The ward has now come down to the 13th position among the city’s 24 administrative wards. The total Covid cases in M-East stand at 3,154, of which 1,732 patients have been discharged.The growth rate of cases in Govandi and Mankhurd has also come down to 1%, while the city’s average growth rate is 1.72%. Officials from the ward confirmed the number of daily cases started to decrease from the first week of June.Sudhanshu Dwivedi, assistant municipal commissioner of M-East ward, said, “Earlier, if there were 70 cases in the ward, 50 were found in Govandi alone. Now, if there are 30 cases, less than five cases are from Govandi. Over 7, 000 households are screened everyday at the 15 health posts. At least 50-55 people are tested daily in the ward.”Dwivedi explained that they formed 46 local leaders in all containment zones, calling them ‘containment observers’. “These observers tell us if anyone in their area needs immediate medical help, toilets are not sanitised or social distancing is not followed. This helped us tackle the situation. We also focused on quarantining more people from slums who use community toilets,” he said. The ward has 46 containment zones and over 70 sealed buildings.Arun Kumar, CEO of NGO Apnalaya which works with communities in Shivajinagar slum clusters of Govandi, said, “There are a couple of things we need to determine if the situation has improved. Firstly, have we increased the number of testings in wards like M-East whose more than 50% population lives in slums? Is there a behavioural change among residents towards social distancing norms? BMC needs to release data based on these points in order to back their claims of improvement.” Kumar, however, agreed that the number of beds, ventilators and ICU beds have increased as per BMC’s data. The other hot spots of Dharavi and Worli, too, have shown improvement. The doubling rate in G-North (Dharavi) and G-South (Worli) is 57 days. The growth rate of cases in these two wards is 1.2%.

MNS leader Akhil Chitre said, “When I called up the Covid facility, I was told that the ICU facility is not ready yet and there is shortage of staff. Why is the state lying to the common public?” Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of Health, said, “The phase 1 hospital at BKC has 40% beds vacant. We have 174 ICU beds vacant across Mumbai. The scaling up of beds has been planned. The facilities are ready, but what will we do by starting phase 2, when phase 1 of the Covid facility is still vacant?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hot-spot-govandi-shows-signs-of-improvement-says-bmc/story-LV5Kd7tpiIoT3ErneTrb6O.html
03-07-2020||Mumbai||50% shops stay shut as restrictions make business tough||The state government started easing the lockdown restrictions in June, yet, less than 50% of shops in Mumbai have opened their shutters for business. The main reason for this, traders say, is a massive shortage of staff, lack of transport facilities, and restrictive business timings.Also, the 2-km radius restriction rule has deterred shop-owners from resuming work.According to the Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industries and Trade (CAMIT), more than half the city’s shopkeepers have not opened their establishments. “Both traders and their staff do not have travel facilities as they are not allowed on trains and buses. In addition, the timing of 9am to 5pm is not very conducive to carry out trade. Even if our traders try to come early in private vehicles, they are caught in massive traffic jams. Hence, it makes no sense for them to open their shops,” said Mohan Gurnani, chairman, CAMIT. “Most of the staff have migrated back to their hometowns; many traders are unable to open due to shortage of labour,” he added.Mitesh Modi, convenor, Lamington Road Traders Association Action Committee (LRTAAC), said the 2-km radius rule has only aggravated the situation.“Everything is not available within the 2-km radius, but this rule has dissuaded many of our customers for fear of police action,” said Modi. LRTAAC represents traders dealing in electronic goods, two-wheeler spare parts, and plywood.Many traders who have not opened their shops say they are studying the situation. “This rule of opening shops on alternate days makes our whole business unviable. Besides, once we start, we have to pay rent as well as salaries to the staff,” said Datta Khedekar, who runs four beauty parlours in central Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/50-shops-stay-shut-as-restrictions-make-business-tough/story-x269gLU4T8GtfHeG2MjJ8L.html

If you’re in Chandigarh, it could now be an expensive proposition as you will have to pay a fine of ₹5,000 if you do not register your pet dog, according to the Chandigarh Registration of Pet Dogs (Amendment) Bylaws 2020, notified by the UT administration on Thursday.The MC general house had, last year, approved the proposal for the tenfold increase in penalty from ₹500 earlier.Even applying for registration will cost owners ₹500 instead of ₹200.And forget taking your dog to your favourite exercise haunt as they are barred from the Sukhna Lake, Rose Garden, Shanti Kunj, Rock Garden, Leisure Valley, Mini Rose Garden, Fragrance Garden, Terrace Garden, Shivalik Garden and other public places/gardens in the city.Those who delay registrations will have to pay an additional fine of about ₹200 for a maximum of seven days. Earlier, the fine was ₹20.Maintenance charges of ₹100 for dogs seized or detained under the bye-laws have been increased to ₹1,000 to claim the pet.The bye-laws state it is mandatory for dog owners to register each pet at the municipal corporation office once the canine is four months old.

03-07-2020||Chandigarh||Charges dropped against Balbir Sidhu in 2015 train obstruction case||Charges against cabinet minister cum local MLA Balbir Singh Sidhu Mohali of obstructing trains were dropped by chief judicial magistrate Deepika Singh on Thursday on the grounds of railways failing to file a complaint on time. On May 2, 2015, Sidhu with 200 supporters was accused of stopping trains at Lalru during a state wide agitation in May for over two hours causing losses to railways. However, the railways filed a complaint on May 24, 2019, four years later.  Sidhu had sought dismissal of the complaint filed by the railways under section 174 in The Railways Act, 1989,which calls for prosecution and three-year jail term if guilty for anyone obstructing trains. The court said in view of the bar under Section 468 CrPC it was not competent to take cognizance of the offence for which a complaint was filed four years later, after the lapse of the three-year period of limitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/charges-dropped-against-sidhu-of-obstructing-trains-in-2015/story-4OXP9Oz0r7nuIFM4etfOgL.html
03-07-2020||Delhi||Diesel, supply disruption push up vegetable prices: Traders||The retail and wholesale prices of vegetables such as tomato, capsicum, okra, ridge gourd and cauliflower, have witnessed an “unusually sharp increase” in the national capital over the last week.Traders and wholesale market committees attributed the increase to the annual disruption in supply during the monsoon, but also to the increased margins by middlemen who have suffered losses in the lockdown months, and the increase in diesel prices that has a direct correlation with transportation cost.On Thursday, most retail markers in Delhi sold tomatoes for ₹70-80 per kg, capsicum at around ₹100-120 per kg, okra for ₹90-100 per kg, ridge gourd for ₹100-110 per kg and cauliflower for around ₹60 per kg. The rates were up between 50% and 100% in the last one week, the traders said.“There has been no stability. Vegetables usually get costlier in this season because of the rain. The loss is relatively higher for green vegetables, which are more perishable in nature. But this year many factors played to increase the prices too much in too short a time. This is unusual,” said Nilesh Kumar, a trader based at the retail vegetable market in south Delhi’s Mehrauli.Records of Azadpur agriculture wholesale market, which accounts for more than 80% of the total supply of vegetables across Delhi, showed significant increase in prices. On June 25, the wholesale prices for tomato was₹14.75 per kg (on Thursday, this was ₹32), capsicum ₹10.25 per kg (₹32.5), okra ₹10.50 per kg (₹16.50), ridge gourd ₹9.50 per kg (₹12) and cauliflower ₹10.75 per kg (₹14).While eastern and northeastern India continue to receive heavy rain, the monsoon is likely to intensify in the coming days in central and western India, the India meteorological department had reported .“Prices go up in the monsoon because the losses go up and add to the cost of vegetables. But this year, the increase in diesel prices have contributed to a two-fold blow,” said Adil Khan, chairperson of the agriculture produce market committee in Azadpur.The Azadpur market gets its largest share of green vegetables from states such as Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. But, tomatoes mainly come from Maharashtra, Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh.The increase in retail prices in Delhi is disproportionate even if compared to the wholesale price increase, Haji Yamin, a wholesale vegetable trader based in the Okhla market, pointed out.Yamin, said: “The increase in diesel price has a direct effect on transportation cost. That is likely to affect prices. But, other than that, traders and middlemen have also contributed to the disproportionate jacking up of prices in different levels to make up for the losses incurred during the lockdown months through increased margins, taking advantage of the monsoon price hike and diesel rates.”Fuel prices have been soaring in the country since daily price revisions were resumed from June 7. The price of diesel rose by ₹11.14 per litre in about three weeks; on Thursday price of diesel per litre in Delhi was ₹80.53, Gurugram ₹72.81, Mumbai ₹78.95, Chennai ₹77.78 and Bengaluru ₹76.59.Naveen Gupta, secretary-general of the All India Motor Transport Congress, said that the change in diesel rates usually takes some time to affect transport costs. “Recently, the diesel rates have increased too rapidly in too short a time, and it is difficult to ascertain how that has contributed to increased costs of products in the agriculture sector. However, diesel comprises of around 65% of transport cost and an increase in diesel rate will definitely have a direct effect. But every market sector needs its own time to ascertain the effect of such complicated inter-related factors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/diesel-supply-disruption-push-up-vegetable-prices-traders/story-tLKecr34lKAsEqgOU5BDHO.html

As of Thursday till 7:30pm, there are a total of 3,544 Covid-19 cases in Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC). At least, 2,154 have been cured while 1,364 are still undergoing treatment. A total of 47 people have died due to Covid.“The number of positive patients are increasing as we are conducting 500-600 tests daily. The number is expected to rise as we will be starting rapid antigen detection tests,” said Dr Pavan Salve, additional health and medical officer, PCMC.One lakh rapid antigen detection kit will be available with the PCMC health department from Friday.“The kit will play a big role in putting brakes on the spread of Covid-19 as we will get results in 30 minutes which will speed up our testing process,” said Usha Dhore, mayor, PCMC.In Pune, rapid antigen detection tests were conducted on Wednesday at Naidu Hospital. On the first day, the tests were conducted on 25 people out of which four tested positive.With rising cases, civic authorities have appealed to people to follow guidelines to minimise the risk of Covid-19 infection.

03-07-2020||Chandigarh||Former Punjab minister Mittal defends agri ordinances, accuses Congress, AAP of misleading farmers||Ludhiana The Punjab unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday hit out at the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for criticising the Central government’s ordinances on agricultural reforms, saying they were misleading the farmers.All the ordinances were formulated in cognizance of the Swaminathan committee report, said former Punjab Cabinet minister and BJP leader Madan Mohan Mittal.Terming the recent statements of Congress state president Sunil Jhakhar and AAP’s Bhagwant Mann as totally “fabricated and malicious,” Mittal said the Central government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi was committed to uplifting the economic status of the agriculture sector.Mittal was visiting the BJP office near the Clock Tower to address a conference on the ordinance. “We want to remind the Congress party that it was in power for 10 long years and Manmohan Singh did not bother to implement the Swaminathan report on agriculture,” he said.The BJP had taken into consideration the long forgotten report and tried to come up with plans to address the plight of the agrarian sector. It was the protectionist ordinance of the Modi-led BJP government which would ensure that a farmer did not lose his “ rights of ownership” even if he had leased his land for long periods.The National Commission on Farmers (NCF) was set up on November 18, 2004 under the chairmanship of Professor MS Swaminathan to address the nationwide calamity of farmer suicides in India. It has submitted a number of reports with suggestions to achieve the goal of “faster and more inclusive growth.” The government had given the farmers the right to sell their produce to the highest bidder in the market after 73 years of India’s independence. The Union agriculture minister had repeatedly gone on record to say that MSP would not be discontinued and the farmers would not have to worry that their crops would not get buyers, he said.“Unfortunately the Congress and APP have nothing to demonstrate what they have done for the agriculture sector. They have found themselves in a desperate situation and are misleading the farmers,” Mittal added.Giving the assurance that marketing committees would also function as before, he said: “We promise to the farmers of Punjab that BJP will stand committed to protect the agriculture of this state which has made the country food surplus.” The state BJP would be launching an awareness drive and go to each village in the state and inform the farmers about the newly introduced farmers’ ordinance, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ex-minister-mittal-defends-agri-ordinances-accuses-cong-aap-of-misleading-farmers/story-Me0YR5mVdve1IFzhkI1cYN.html
03-07-2020||Pune||Pune to have 450 ventilator beds to deal with rising cases: Civic chief Shekhar Gaikwad||Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad on Wednesday said that the civic administration will increase its ventilator beds capacity to deal with critical patients. “A total of 450 ventilator beds would be available within the next two-three weeks. Private hospitals have enough ventilator beds which have not been acquired as of yet, however, the civic body will acquire them in a phased manner,” said Gaikwad.Pune Smart City Development Corporation Limited and Pune Municipal Corporation published their report for Covid-19 data between June 19 and June 30 and projected a shortage of ventilators and ICU beds by the end of July. As per the report, Pune will face a shortage of 202 ventilator beds and 400 ICU beds.The report also projected the Covid-19 cases for July and the civic infrastructure readiness to handle the situation. Pune is projected to have 47,796 Covid-19 positive cases by the end of July, of which 19,596 will be active cases. Currently, Pune has a total bed capacity of 18,556, which includes private bed acquired or reserved by PMC. Hence, there will be an acute shortage of beds. The number of ventilators is also a concern for the civic body as currently there are only 288 and by the end of July, the number would be in the negative zone.Considering the report, mayor Murlidhar Mohol held a meeting with the civic chief, IAS officer Saurabh Rao and additional commissioners on Wednesday evening. “The situation will become critical for us by July-end, however, we have time to boost our infrastructure,” said Mohol.“I have instructed the civic administration to acquire maximum beds from private hospitals and the commissioner will soon issue an order for it,” he added.The civic chief said, “We got 21 ventilators from the PM Cares fund. As the PMC did not have enough medical staff, we handed over these 21 ventilators to the Sassoon General Hospital. I am planning to increase ventilators at Sassoon to 50 by this week. I will issue the order to acquire more private hospitals bed soon.”Commissioner said that the civic body was preparing for a critical situation and plan to increase the infrastructure as per requirement.The doubling rate of total positive cases in the city is 17.98 and PMC has already crossed the 18,000 positive numbers. “The cases were expected to rise with the unlocking process. For symptomatic patients, we have enough infrastructure. We need to care mainly for critical patients and mainly, the patients who require ventilator support,” added Gaikwad.Advocate Vijaysinh Thomare said, “My personal experience is that patients are not allotted beds easily in private hospitals. One of our colleagues tested Covid-19 positive and she had to go through two-three hospitals in order to finally get admitted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-to-have-450-ventilators-beds-to-deal-with-rising-cases-civic-chief-shekhar-gaikwad/story-4OVcA8DAOP3NjO6GzZY2iI.html
03-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh traffic police push accelerator on challaning speedsters||In just the past two months, the traffic police have issued 13,477 e-challans for speeding, over 1.5 times more than the 8,813 challans issued in the entire last year.The challaning drive started on May 5, when the traffic police introduced three automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems. Mounted on tripods, these are equipped with cameras and sensors to measure the speed of vehicles and click a picture of those crossing the speed limit. The device can also be used at night and can be shifted within a few minutes. As this requires only one personnel to man it, the previous practice of setting up barricades with traffic cops and marshalls has been done away with. The challans are sent to the violator through a text message on their registered mobile number. Violators are fined Rs 1,000 for the first offence and Rs 2,000 for subsequent offences. The driving licence is also cancelled for three months. “We have started installing the system on two-lane roads as well where the speed limit is 50km/h. Contrary to common notion, the speed limit is not 60km/h on all roads,” said Kewal Krishan, deputy superintendent of police (DSP, traffic administration).Special vigil around Sukhna LakeFollowing a litany of complaints from the residents regarding speeding at Sukhna Lake, traffic police are maintaining a special vigil on the roads around it. Taking to Twitter, deputy inspector general of police (DIG, traffic) Shashank Anand said a team of traffic police had been posted at the lake, and over 120 challans for speeding had been issued over the last weekend.Pay fines online from FridayUT administrator VP Singh Badnore will inaugurate online payment of e-challans on Friday. The traffic police have been using e-challaning machines since 2018. It will now be possible to pay the challan on the spot or even through the internet by using a credit or debit card.DSP Krishan said except for drunken driving and dangerous driving, which includes using a mobile phone while driving, jumping a red light and driving on the cycle track, all challans can be paid online. “A seizure slip will be given for offences like speeding, riding without helmet, triple riding and using a pressure horn, among others, if the motorist pays on the spot. The licence will be seized and sent to the relevant transport authority for further action,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/slow-down-chandigarh-traffic-police-get-cracking-against-speedsters/story-5wDCp8WZFV1k5DMxGBNURP.html
03-07-2020||Pune||‘If shortage of medical staff arises, doctors working at flu clinics will be diverted to Covid care centres’||Mayor Murlidhar Mohol on Wednesday conducted a review meeting of the Covid-19 situation in the city with top civic officials and instructed them to act speedily to keep the pandemic under control. HT spoke to the mayor regarding the administration’s Covid-19 preparedness.Do you think that Pune will soon face a shortage of beds considering the 500-600 Covid-19 positive cases emerging daily in the city?We have enough infrastructure to deal with the rise and we can also increase the facilities. Our main concern is the medical professionals. I conducted a meeting with the municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad; sugar commissioner Saurabh Rao and all the additional municipal commissioners and instructed them to speed up the process to get more medical staff. I even instructed the administration that the doctors working at flu centres can be diverted to Covid care centres, if the need arises.Pune Smart City and the Pune Municipal Corporation data point to a shortage of ventilators and oxygen beds by the end of July. How will you handle the situation?It is true that by the end of July, the situation would become critical for us. We can create the oxygen support beds, but will need to increase the ventilator beds. I have instructed the municipal commissioner to take charge of beds from all the hospitals in the city. We recently gave temporary appointments to doctors and nurses, but most of them did not join duty despite being given appointments.Is the PMC seeking support from the state and central government to handle the situation?The Pune Municipal Corporation has spent at least Rs150 crore till date to handle Covid-19 pandemic. Now, the private hospitals have sent the civic body Rs25 crore bills for treatments under the urban poor scheme. The state government needs to support us and I have spoken to the guardian minister Ajit Pawar. PMC received 21 ventilators under the PM Cares scheme recently.If the city faces a shortage of medical staff, how will you handle it?I have asked the municipal commissioner to approach nursing colleges and try to recruit nurses from there. Pune has started almost 70 flu clinics. There are very few patients coming to some of these centres. Staff from these flu clinics can be shifted to Covid care centres. We have empowered the municipal administration to start recruitments. The need of the hour is to differentiate between symptomatic patients and critical positive cases. PMC needs to focus on critical cases as symptomatic patients will not need so much medical care.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/if-shortage-of-medical-staff-arises-doctors-working-at-flu-clinics-will-be-diverted-to-covid-care-centres/story-SfnsuDw01Ht4tq4UmU5tmM.html
03-07-2020||Pune||10 ventilators in an ICU facility worth Rs 1cr lying unused since two months due to lack of intensivist and trained PMC staff||The Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) plan to upgrade its health infrastructure to combat Covid-19 has hit a roadblock at Dalvi hospital due to absence of an intensivist and trained faculty for running the advanced ICU facility. The lack of trained personnel has forced the ICU facility, estimated to be worth Rs 1 crore, to remain shut for the past two months since its inauguration.The ICU at Dalvi Maternity hospital was formally started on April 28 when Credai (Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India) donated 10 ventilators to the PMC. According to additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal, the delay in strating the ICU unit at Dalvi hospital has been because of the installation work and non-availability of intensivist.“It takes time for installation of the ventilators. We had requested Credai for the ICU ventilators. It’s not that we don’t want to use them, we had even issued an advertisement to hire an intensivist. However, nobody came forward. We published an advertisement again and this week we will complete the recruitment process and start the facility. We have requested Sassoon General Hospital to conduct training for 15 days for our doctors and other medical professionals regarding the Covid-19 situation. The advertisement was issued in March and this is a permanent post, but still nobody came forward,” said Agarwal, who heads the health department.It was after an appeal by PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad for assistance from the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds that Credai Pune chapter helped build an ICU facility within eight days for which it allocated Rs 1 crore at PMC-run Dalvi Hospital in Shivajinagar.The PMC has dedicated the hospital as a Covid-19 centre and all maternity operations have been stopped post the declaration.The advanced ICU includes 40 state-of-the-art equipment such as beds, ventilators, defibrillators, suction machines, ECG machines among other equipment. Vivek Velankar, an RTI activist who has been vocal about the civic body’s poor expenditure on health infrastructure, said, “The PMC should have honoured its commitment. When things are done for free, it is natural that things are taken for granted. In this case, at least the ICU should have been operational during this time of acute crisis. Its operations have been inordinately delayed.”Suhas Merchant, president, Credai- Pune Metro said, “Considering the current situation, the municipal commissioner had appealed to Credai Pune Metro to set up an advanced ICU at Dalvi Hospital. At that time, we promised to set up a unit at the hospital in the next 15 days. But nonetheless, our office-bearers worked tirelessly to set up the ICU in a record time of just eight days.”PMC has projected that if the Covid-19 cases continue to surge, the city will face shortage of ICU beds by July end. As on July 1, Pune’s Covid-19 tally had reached 18,105.“We responded fast to address the needs of the local administration in its fight against Covid-19,” said Merchant.Nasal Cannula Oxygen Therapy devicesAs per the instruction of Dr Sanjay Oak, chairman Covid-19 task force and Dr Shashank Joshi, dean, Indian Medical College, the PMC under the directions of additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal installed 20 nasal cannula oxygen therapy devices at Naidu Hospital, each worth Rs 4 lakh. “These machines are very important as it helps in the fast recovery of patients. We have installed them at Naidu Hospital,” said Agarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/10-ventilators-in-an-icu-facility-worth-rs-1cr-lying-unused-since-two-months-due-to-lack-of-intensivist-and-trained-pmc-staff/story-yf38SAi8yLLBnn8KtKkdRM.html
03-07-2020||Education||Jharkhand unveils SOPs for schools’ reopening preparedness amid pandemic||Hand wash, sanitization, masks and social distancing will be on the strict check-list for students, teachers and mid-day meal cooks in a bid to fight the Covid-19 pandemic after schools reopen in Jharkhand, according to the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for schools which was unveiled during a webinar on ‘Covid-19-Awareness and Preparedness in Schools’ here on Wednesday.Assembly prayers, sports or any other gatherings in schools will be postponed. Besides, schools will have to ensure a certain distance between two students in a classroom and there should be an appropriate gap between two benches, officials said while reading out the SOP.Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC), with technical support of UNICEF, has developed e-modules of SOPs for school reopening. These SOPs are expected to help schools in implementing, communicating and monitoring the new way of practicing social and personal hygiene, and protocols for sanitizing school premises.Secretary of school education and literacy department Rahul Sharma said, “Under Unlock-2.0, schools and colleges will be shut till July 31. However, the Centre gives relaxations at regular intervals. The Centre might allow some states, where Covid-19 cases are comparatively low, to open schools. So, we should be prepared in advance. These SOPs will help spread awareness among teachers, students and parents much before opening of the schools.”Schools have been closed in Jharkhand since March 17, almost for 100 days now, which has resulted in huge education loss to students, he said.Jharkhand has around 45,000 schools, including 35,000 government schools where more than 50 lakh students study taught by 1.10 lakh teachers.Providing a normal and secure atmosphere to students and teachers after reopening of the schools will prove to be a mammoth task for the government, experts said. Over 3,500 schools are being used as quarantine centres and would need intense sanitization.In a bid to set up hand wash units, maintain hygiene and cleanliness, the state government will have to spend on safety measures for over 35,000 government schools.“We need masks, thermal guns, hand washing units and sanitizers on a large scale. We will request corporate units, banks and civil societies if they can help schools in their catchment areas,” Sharma said.JEPC state project director, Uma Shankar Singh, said, ‘’While continuing to provide education, what matters is our ability to broaden our planning at a technical level to handle the pandemic when schools reopen.

Public health officials have warned infections could go as high as 100,000 a day and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has forecast 148,000 deaths by July 25.The global count of cases, meanwhile, inched closer to 11 million and deaths climbed to 521,874.The United States is witnessing a second flare-up, mostly affecting southern states — with the exception of California in the west — that had either lifted their restrictions early or were reluctant to enforce them fully, such as Texas, whose governor Gregg Abbott, a Republican, had prevented his mayors and other city officials from making the use of masks mandatory.Abbott has since recanted, and brought back restrictions, fully. On Thursday, he issued an order making masks mandatory in public place, starting Friday “We have the ability to keep businesses open and move our economy forward so that Texans can continue to earn a paycheck, but it requires each of us to do our part to protect one another — and that means wearing a face covering in public spaces,” Abbott said.At least eight states reported record single-day highs on Thursday, according to New York Times, which is keeping its own separate score: Alaska, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Montana, South Carolina and Tennessee. Other states in the grip of this flare-up include Arizona.Around a dozen states in the north and the northeast have managed thus far to either flat-line their infections or push them down, but public officials have once again warned they may not be able to withstand the souther surge if the latter was not flattened soon, and the window for that is narrowing.“What we’ve seen over the last several days is a spike in cases that is way beyond the worst spikes that we’ve seen. That is not good news,” Anthony Fauci, a top US epidemiologist and member of the White House task force on Covid-19, told BBC Thursday. “We’ve got to get that under control, or we risk an even greater outbreak to the United States”President Donald Trump, meanwhile, is scheduled to leave Friday for Mount Rushmore in South Dakota for July 4 Independence Day celebrations with fireworks.Talking about the firework celebrations, Trump said, “We’re going to have a tremendous evening. It’s going to be a fireworks display like few people have seen. It’s going to be very exciting. It’s going to be beautiful.”Public health experts worry social distancing norms will not be enforced there, as it has happened at recent public gatherings Trump has attended and addressed. Many members of his campaign staff and the Secret Service were infected at the rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma; and then again at his rally in Phoenix, Arizona. Among those from the second lot of infections was Herman Cain, a former Republican presidential candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sees-over-50k-cases-in-a-day-donald-trump-heads-to-celebrate-july-4/story-cOYE73ZfiBcUdk0sDIy8qO.html

03-07-2020||World||Life term for UK convert who plotted Sri Lanka-type blasts||A Briton who converted to Islam and later plotted to bomb three busy places in London of the kind carried out in a Sri Lanka church in 2019, was on Friday sentenced to life imprisonment, Scotland Yard said following a judgement in the widely-followed case.Safiyya Shaikh (born Michelle Ramsden), 37, will serve a minimum of 14 years before she is considered for parole for the plot to carry out terror attacks at a London train station, a hotel and the St Paul’s Cathedral, besides disseminating terrorist material online. She had pleaded guilty in February.Commander Richard Smith of the Counter Terrorism Command said: “This case is a stark reminder that the threat from terrorism remains as real as ever. As the lockdown restrictions ease and our public spaces start to open up again, it is vital that the public remains vigilant and reports anything suspicious to police - we need your help.”Shaikh was arrested on October 10, 2019 following a joint Scotland Yard and and MI5 investigation. She believed one of the officers, with whom she spoke online, would be able to help her obtain explosives.She gave another undercover officer two bags, which she hoped would be converted into bombs. She told an undercover officer how she planned to leave one of these bombs inside St Paul’s Cathedral and another in a nearby hotel. She talked about setting off the third – in the form of a suicide vest – at a train station.“Shaikh told the undercover officer she wanted to carry out an attack like that in Sri Lanka in 2019, in which suicide bombers killed hundreds of people in hotels and at a church on Easter Sunday. Following her arrest, she admitted this plan in a police interview”, the Yard said.The court was told that Shaikh converted to Islam in 2007 after being impressed by the kindness of a Muslim family, but later sought out people online who had extremist views. In one message to an undercover officer, Shaikh declared that she “loved” to watch graphic terrorist videos.Commander Smith added: “Shaikh was dedicated to her extremist beliefs. In addition to wanting to carry out her own sickening attack on UK soil, she hoped to inspire others to implement attack plans even after she had died. Thanks to the hard work of officers from both the Met Police and MI5, she is instead in jail”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/life-term-for-uk-convert-who-plotted-sri-lanka-type-blasts/story-kI5xI5GY9MTCTDO9svMw0I.html
03-07-2020||World||Khashoggi lured to his death through ‘a great betrayal and deception’, says fiancee||The fiancee of Jamal Khashoggi told a Turkish court Friday that the Washington Post columnist was lured to his death at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul through “a great betrayal and deception,” and she asked that all persons responsible for his killing be brought to justice.Hatice Cengiz spoke at the opening of the trial in absentia of two former aides of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and 18 other Saudi nationals who were charged in Turkey for Khashoggi’s grisly slaying. The journalist’s 2018 killing at the consulate sparked international condemnation and cast a cloud of suspicion over the prince.The 20 Saudi defendants all left Turkey, and Saudi Arabia rejected Turkish demands for their extradition. Some of the men were put on trial in Riyadh behind closed doors. The proceedings were widely criticized as a whitewash. Khashoggi’s family members later announced they had forgiven his killers.The trial in Turkey is being closely watched for possible new information or evidence from the killing, including the whereabouts of Khashoggi’s remains.Khashoggi, who was a United States resident, had walked into his country’s consulate on Oct. 2, 2018, for an appointment to pick up documents that would allow him to marry his Turkish fiancee. He never walked out.“He was called to that consulate with great betrayal and deception,” the private DHA news agency quoted Cengiz as telling the court during her testimony.“I am making a complaint about everyone at the consulate. Everyone from the driver to the tea-maker,” said Cengiz, who waited for Khashoggi outside the Istanbul consulate when he went there to obtain the documents and alerted authorities when he failed to come out.The trial was adjourned until Nov. 24, DHA reported. Turkish prosecutors have demanded that the defendants be sentenced to life terms in prison, if convicted.The Turkish prosecutors have charged the prince’s former advisers, Saud al-Qahtani and Ahmed al-Asiri, with “instigating a premeditated murder with the intent of (causing) torment through fiendish instinct.”Prosecutors are also seeking life prison sentences for 18 other Saudi nationals charged with carrying out “a premeditated murder with the intent of (causing) torment through fiendish instincts.”A team of 15 Saudi agents had flown to Turkey to meet Khashoggi inside the consulate. They included a forensic doctor, intelligence and security officers and individuals who worked for the crown prince’s office.Turkish officials allege Khashoggi was killed and then dismembered with a bone saw. Turkey, a rival of Saudi Arabia, apparently had the Saudi Consulate bugged and has shared audio of the killing with the CIA, among others.Prior to his killing, Khashoggi had written critically of Saudi Arabia’s crown prince in columns for the Washington Post.Saudi Arabia had initially offered shifting accounts about Khashoggi’s disappearance. As international pressure mounted because of the Turkish leaks, the kingdom eventually settled on the explanation that he was killed by rogue officials in a brawl.Turkish prosecutors say the suspects “acted in consensus from the beginning in line with the decision of taking the victim back to Saudi Arabia and of killing him if he did not agree.”Riyadh had insisted that the kingdom’s courts are the correct place for the suspects to be tried and put 11 people on trial over the killing. In December, five people were sentenced to death while three others were found guilty of covering up the crime and were sentenced to a combined 24 years in prison.During the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in May, Khashoggi’s son announced that the family pardoned the killers, giving legal reprieve to the five government agents who were sentenced to death.___Fraser reported from Ankara, Turkey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/khashoggi-lured-to-his-death-through-a-great-betrayal-and-deception-says-fiancee/story-c0NvMFlHkj7kpB0RRYS9wO.html
03-07-2020||World||Covid-19: New, more infectious strain is pervasive, says study||A new, more infectious variant of the original strain of Covid-19 is now dominating current cases across the globe, according to a study by an international team of researchers, including from the University of Sheffield, published on Wednesday.The analysis of the virus’s genome sequence found that a mutation called ‘D614G’ made the virus more infectious than the original strain, but did not cause more severe disease. The variation improved its ability to infect human cells and helped become the dominant strain circulating around the world today.The study, published in the journal ‘Cell’, shows the variation is more infectious in cell cultures under laboratory conditions. The variant makes a small but effective change in the ‘spike’ glycoprotein that protrudes from the surface of the virus, which it uses to enter and infect human cells.The D614G variant of Covid-19 quickly took over as the dominant strain soon after it first appeared, with geographic samples showing a significant shift in viral population from the original, to the new strain of the virus, a release from Sheffield said.Researchers from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and Duke University in North Carolina, partnered with the University of Sheffield’s Covid-19 Genomics UK research group to analyse genome samples published on GISAID, an international resource for sharing genome sequences among researchers worldwide.Thushan de Silva, who led analysis of the data from Sheffield, said: “We have been sequencing SARS-CoV-2 strains in Sheffield since early in the pandemic and this allowed us to partner with our collaborators to show this mutation had become dominant in circulating strains”.“Data provided by our team in Sheffield suggested that the new strain was associated with higher viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of patients with Covid-19, meaning the virus’s ability to infect people could be increased. Fortunately at this stage, it does not seem that viruses with D614G cause more severe disease.”Bette Korber from the Los Alamos National Laboratory added: “It is possible to track SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) evolution globally because researchers worldwide are rapidly making their viral sequence data available through the GISAID viral sequence database”.“Currently tens of thousands of sequences are available through this project, and this enabled us to identify the emergence of a variant that has rapidly become the globally dominant form.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-new-more-infectious-strain-is-pervasive-says-study/story-iRK3OKWz45Wc7yxkuOemCN.html

The bus carrying the pilgrims was hit at an unmanned railway crossing by the Karachi bound Shah Hussain Express. The pilgrims were travelling from Peshawar. Police have said there were 25-27 persons in the van at the time of the accident. Pakistan railways official said railway and district rescue teams arrived at the spot to rescue the victims. The injured were rushed to Sheikhupura Hospital and some are reported to be in critical condition.The crossing gate where the accident took place was closed but the coach driver may have tried to take a shortcut instead of waiting at the crossing, which resulted in the crash, a local police official said. According to the secretary-general of Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee Sardar Amir Singh, the deceased belong to three or four families.The pilgrims were on their way back to Peshawar after a visit to Nankana Sahib — where they had gone to visit relatives. The convoy of pilgrims comprised two more coaches but both took another route and have been reported to be safe. Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan said that the sikh pilgrim were returning from Nankana Sahib. He also said that the injured will be provided with proper medical care. “Deeply saddened at the accident this afternoon at a railway crossing near Sheikhupura which resulted in the death of atleast 20 people, mainly Sikh pilgrims returning from Nankana Sahib. Have directed that proper medical care be provided to the injured,” Khan tweeted. Officials said the Sikh pilgrims were from the northwestern city of Peshawar, reported news agency Associated Press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sikh-pilgrims-among-19-feared-killed-in-bus-train-accident-in-pakistan-s-sheikupura/story-f5Cq6RBrV0NuGL7Nn7cO8M.html
03-07-2020||World||Surge in domestic child abuse during Covid-19 pandemic: Study||There has been a surge in domestic child abuse during the coronavirus pandemic, suggests the experience of one specialist UK children’s hospital.The study was published in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood.In just one month, the number of new cases rose by 1493% compared with the same period in the previous three years, pointing to a “silent pandemic” in 2020, suggest the authors.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThey compared the numbers of new cases of head injury caused by physical abuse among very young children seen between 23 March and 23 April this year and the same period in 2017, 2018, and 2019.March 23 marked the start of lockdown and a period of national self-isolation in the UK in a bid to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19 infection.Ten children (six boys and four girls) with suspected abusive head trauma presented for treatment during March-April. Their ages ranged from 17 days to 13 months old.This figure compares with an average of 0.67 cases a month for the same period in 2017, 2018, and 2019, representing an increase of 1493% in 2020, say the authors.The symptoms prompting a hospital visit included colic (persistent crying for no obvious reason) in 5 of the infants; breathing issues (apnoea) and loss of consciousness in 4; seizures in 2; extensive bruising in 5; swollen scalp in 5; and marks caused by repeated picking at the skin (excoriation) in 1 child.The infants were comprehensively assessed. This included head, spine, and skeletal scans, as well as detailed eye and whole body checks.The results revealed blood pooling in the brain (subdural haemorrhage) in 6 infants; brain swelling in 4; bruising of the brain tissue (parenchymal contusion) in 4; skull fractures in 4; a bleed on the brain (subarachnoid haemorrhage) in 3; and bone fractures elsewhere in 3 of the infants.The infants’ families all lived in areas of significant social and economic deprivation. And there’s a complex interplay between abuse, mental health, substance misuse and socioeconomic factors, the authors point out.Two of the parents had a history of criminal activity; 3 had mental health issues; and 4 had financial worries, factors likely to heighten the risk of abusive behaviour, say the authors.“Our cohort is aligned to the literature in its portrayal of socioeconomic deprivation and parental vulnerability as significant risk factors for abuse, both of which may be exacerbated as a result of the stresses imposed by quarantine measures,” they write.And the fact that children are spending more time with their parents as a result and that there will have been less interaction with reporting bodies will have only added to these risks, they suggest.This case series represents the experience at just one specialist children’s hospital in England, but it echoes the reports coming out of countries enforcing similar measures to the UK during this pandemic, note the authors.And the figures are likely to be an underestimate of the scale of the problem, they warn.“This sobering figure is likely under-represented due to public avoidance of hospitals at this time,” they write. “Notably two parents in our cohort cited fears of contracting SARS-CoV-2 as a reason for delayed presentation.”And they conclude: “Hence, in the background of the intensely public SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a more silent pandemic is occurring, of which the medical community must remain astutely aware.”Dr Alison Steele, Officer for Child Protection at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, which co-owns Archives of Disease in Childhood with BMJ, commented: “This is an extremely concerning report. It is important to find out if the huge rise in suspected non-accidental head injury reported at this specialist hospital is being seen by other hospitals across the country.”She added: “Many of these children will have been brought into hospital because there were obvious signs that the child was very unwell, but we are also extremely worried about children who are not being seen because their physical injuries or other forms of abuse or neglect are more easily hidden.”And she warned: “There is a very real danger that, under lockdown, children are falling through the safety net because of reduced access to support services and fewer opportunities for people outside the family to sound the alarm.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/surge-in-domestic-child-abuse-during-covid-19-pandemic-study/story-XS5XpyXjCNbJ6gwNjV0LcL.html
03-07-2020||World||Botswana reports mysterious deaths of hundreds of elephants||Hundreds of elephants have died mysteriously in Botswana’s famed Okavango Delta, the wildlife department said Thursday, ruling out poaching as the tusks were found intact.The landlocked southern African country has the world’s largest elephant population, estimated to be around 130,000.“We have had a report of 356 dead elephants in the area north of the Okavango Delta and we have confirmed 275 so far,” Cyril Taolo, the acting director of the department of Wildlife and National Parks, told AFP in a text message. He said the cause of the deaths was yet to be established with anthrax having been ruled out.“We do not suspect poaching since (the) animals were found with tusks,” he said.Samples have been collected and sent to specialised laboratories in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Canada for testing.Similar deaths were first reported in May when authorities found 12 carcasses in just a week in two villages in the northwest of the country. “It seems they were dying very suddenly in some cases,” conservation biologist, Keith Lindsay told AFP, adding that the deaths were sudden. “The carcases were animals that had fallen down while walking... right on their sternum which is very unusual,” said Lindsay.“Up to now there doesn’t seem to be any clear sign of the reason for it. When something like this happens it is alarming.”- “All ages and sex” -The latest discoveries were flagged by a wildlife conservation charity, Elephants Without Borders (EWB), whose confidential report referring to the 356 dead elephants, was leaked to the media on Wednesday.EWB suspects the elephants have been dying in the area for about three months.According to the report dated June 19, 2020, “70 percent of elephant carcasses were considered recent, having died about a month ago, and 30 percent of the carcasses appeared fresh, ranging from one day to two weeks old”. “There was good evidence to show elephants of all ages and sex appear to be dying,” said the report penned by EWB director Mike Chase.Several live elephants appeared to have been weak, lethargic and emaciated, with some showing signs of disorientation, difficulty in walking or limping, EWB said.“One elephant was observed walking in circles, unable to change direction although being encouraged by other herd members,” said the report.For conservationist Neil Fritt the strange phenomenon is “tragic” but appears to be “more like a natural occurrence as opposed to direct human cause,” he told AFP.Botswana has an overpopulation of elephants which President Mokgweetsi Masisi has flagged as the source for much of the human-animal conflict in the country.In February the southern African country held its first major auction for trophy elephant hunting quotas since controversially scrapping a hunting ban last year. But the hunting season was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/botswana-reports-mysterious-deaths-of-hundreds-of-elephants/story-JW8LzwvKJtThPCiH2qqsIK.html

Shops were destroyed in the fire leaving owners, staff and the community devastated, the police said. No motive for starting the fire was disclosed.While people were inside premises affected at the time of the fire being started, no one was injured in the incident. Soon after the police and fire officials were called to the site, it was clear that fire had been started deliberately, the police added.CCTV showed a man with a bag sat on some crates in the area prior to the fire. He was then seen to crouch over before standing up and walking off, noticing a flame coming from where he had been as he left. The fire was then seen to ignite on the CCTV and the man left the area.The image of the suspect was issued in a public appeal and through leaflets which were handed out in the area asking for information. The inquiries led to Singh being identified and he was arrested in October last year.Detective constable Gemma Allen said: “This was a devastating incident for residents, business owners and workers in the community. Businesses were completely destroyed and it is extremely fortunate that there were no injuries in the fire.

03-07-2020||World||Hong Kong police charge first person under new security law||Hong Kong police on Friday brought their first charges under a sweeping new national security law that Beijing imposed on the city earlier this week. “A 24-year-old local man has been charged with one count of inciting others for secession and one count of terrorist activity,” the police said in a brief statement. A police source said the charges were brought against a man who drove his motorbike into a group of police officers on Wednesday during protests against the security law.The source asked for anonymity on order to be able to speak freely.Video footage captured by local television showed a man on an orange motorbike with a flag that declared “Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our Times” on the back.He turned down a side street and drove into a group of riot police. Bystander footage shot on a mobile phone captured a scene moments later, where the man was swiftly detained after he fell to the ground. Police at the time said three officers were wounded.Beijing’s new security law was enacted on Tuesday and kept secret until it became law, sending shockwaves through the city both for how it was imposed and the strangling of free speech provisions it contains. It outlaws various acts viewed as subversion, secession, terrorism and colluding with foreign forces. But legal experts warn it proscribes even peaceful political views.Hong Kong’s government, for example, have announced that using the phrase “Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our times” is illegal under the secession and subversion provisions. The terrorism offences are broad and include attacks on vehicles or transport networks and “using dangerous methods to seriously endanger public health or safety”.The most serious security law offences carry punishments of life imprisonment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-police-charge-first-person-under-new-security-law/story-FZVncwD7jvFaWEdNy1eOUM.html

03-07-2020||World||South Africa’s hospitals bracing for surge of virus patients||The nurse started crying when describing her work at a Johannesburg hospital: The ward for coronavirus patients is full, so new arrivals are sent to the general ward, where they wait days for test results. Already 20 of her colleagues have tested positive.“A lot, a lot, a lot of people are coming in every day. With Covid-19,” said the nurse, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she is not authorized to speak to the media. “Each day, it becomes more difficult to cope.”South Africa’s reported coronavirus cases more than quadrupled in June — though some of that is due to efforts to clear a testing backlog, the rate of increase of new cases is picking up. Its hospitals are now bracing for an onslaught of patients, setting up temporary wards and hoping advances in treatment will help the country’s health facilities from becoming overwhelmed.The surge comes as the country has allowed businesses to reopen in recent weeks to stave off economic disaster after a strict two-month stay-at-home order worsened already high unemployment — it reached 30% in June — and drastically increased hunger. In Johannesburg, the largest city, health officials said they are considering reimposing some restrictions to try to slow the quickening spread of the virus.“We’re seeing a spike in infections in Johannesburg. The number of people that we are diagnosing on a daily basis now is absolutely frightening,” said Shabir Madhi, professor of vaccinology at Johannesburg’s University of the Witwatersrand, who is leading a vaccine trial in South Africa in cooperation with Britain’s University of Oxford. “Who we are finding positive now is an indication of who will be in hospital three weeks from now.”The vaccine trial began last week, and Madhi said he’s surprised by the high number of prospective participants who have been disqualified because they are positive for the virus.“It is hard to see how our hospitals will be able to cope,” he said. “Our facilities are reaching a tipping point.”Covid-19 has highlighted South Africa’s inequalities, he said. “Everyone is at risk from the virus,” he said. “But the poor, living in higher density areas, without good access to running water, access to health care, the poorest will suffer the most.”South Africa, with 58 million people and nearly 40% of all the cases on the entire continent, has seen the number of confirmed infections rise from 34,000 at the start of June to more than 168,000 on Friday.Overnight it reported its largest daily number of new confirmed cases — 8,728.As of Friday, 2,844 people had died, according to official statistics. But forecasts by health experts have warned that South Africa could see from 40,000 to more than 70,000 deaths from Covid-19 before the end of 2020.Other African countries are watching warily as the country with the continent’s best-equipped and best-staffed health system hurtles toward a peak that may overwhelm it.South Africa’s health minister, Dr. Zwelini Mkhize, issued a sobering warning recently about an expected flood of cases, especially in urban centers as many return to work.“It is anticipated that, while every province will unfortunately witness an increase in their numbers, areas where there is high economic activity will experience an exponential rise,” Mkhize said this week.Concerns about the virus spreading in the minibus taxis that millions of South Africans use to commute grew this week when the taxi association said the minivans would run at full capacity of up to 15 passengers, despite government orders to carry just 70% capacity.For weeks Cape Town has been the country’s epicenter of the disease, but Johannesburg is rapidly catching up.Mkhize said Gauteng province, which also includes the nation’s capital of Pretoria, will quickly surpass Cape Town and will need more hospital beds.Gauteng hospitals already have 3,000 Covid-19 patients, the province’s premier David Makhura told reporters Thursday. He denied reports that patients have been turned away and said bed capacity would be significantly increased by the end of July. He said the reopening of schools set for next week may be postponed and warned that restrictions may be reimposed to combat the surge.To increase its hospital capacity, South Africa has converted convention centers in Cape Town and Johannesburg, built wards in huge tents, and turned a closed Volkswagen car manufacturing plant into a 3,300-bed treatment center. Still, finding staff to tend to those beds is a challenge: The factory remains empty for lack of health workers.In Khayelitsha township, one of Cape Town’s poorest areas with some 400, 000 residents, the district hospital has 300 beds. Anticipating increased demand on the overstretched facility, an external wing was created across the street. Built in a month, the new ward opened at the start of June with 60 beds. By this week only two beds were empty.“It’s overwhelming,” said Dr. Hermann Reuter of his work in the external ward, run by Khayelitsha District Hospital with assistance from Doctors Without Borders.Reuter said advances in treatment — including giving patients oxygen masks and nasal inhalers earlier and turning them often in order to keep them off ventilators — has yielded encouraging results, even though many are severely ill when they arrive. Crucially, many can be discharged in two weeks — freeing up much-needed bed space, said Reuter, who normally runs community substance abuse clinics but volunteered to work in the field hospital.As South Africa heads into its coldest time of year, the media have warned of a “dark winter” over fears cases will peak in July and August in the Southern Hemisphere country. President Cyril Ramaphosa recently counseled the nation to prepare for tough times ahead, saying that many may find themselves “despondent and fearful” in the weeks and months to come.“It may be that things have gotten worse, but we are certain that they will get better,” he said.For the nurse at the Johannesburg hospital, those dark days already appear to have arrived.“Nursing is a calling, and we are working to help people in this corona crisis,” she said. “But we are becoming overwhelmed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-s-hospitals-bracing-for-surge-of-virus-patients/story-T05mnpElgqhM8dQH0SuaNK.html
03-07-2020||World||First coronavirus then Trump order split Indian families||The March day that his father died, Karan Murgai boarded a plane to India.The coronavirus was spreading, so Murgai’s wife and their two young children stayed home in Dallas.Their separation — due to last three weeks — became indefinite after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that suspends applications for H-1B and other high-skilled work visas from abroad.Trump said the June 22 order would protect jobs amid high US unemployment because of the pandemic.But Murgai and at least 1,000 others like him, whose American visas are tied to their jobs in the US, are now stranded in India — the order’s “collateral damage,” he said.He contacted the offices of Texas Sen. John Cornyn and Texas Rep. Van Taylor, Indian government officials and the US Consulate in New Delhi. No one could help.An IT management consultant for a multinational, Murgai handles his father’s affairs in New Delhi during the day and his US job overnight, worrying about his 4-year-old daughter who has lost her appetite and started throwing fits.India, with the world’s fourth worst-highest virus caseload, is tallying nearly 20,000 new infections each day, but restrictions on travel have begun to ease, with international commercial flights set to resume in July.“Every day she has this one question to ask me: when am I coming back? I get heartbroken at that point. First, it was July. Now I don’t know. We’re getting hit from all sides,” Murgai said.The H-1B visa program allows US employers to hire high-skilled foreign workers, mainly for tech jobs. Employers first have to determine there are no American candidates, and then undertake a lengthy sponsorship process that costs as much as $15,000, making the program highly competitive.Indians account for 75% of the applications for the H-1B program, US government data show. Nearly 85,000 H-1B visas are awarded each year.Nasscom, a trade association in the Indian information technology industry, called Trump’s order “misguided and harmful to the US economy.”Indian companies provide technology staff and services to US hospitals, drugmakers and biotechnology companies, Nasscom pointed out. As a result, Indian companies may redirect Indian talent to Canada or Mexico.India’s foreign ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said the order would “likely affect movement of Indian skilled professionals,” and that the government was assessing the impact on Indian nationals and industry.The H1-B program has created a pathway for a generation of skilled Indian and other foreign workers to build lives in the US, but the Trump order places years of investment in education, property and communities at risk, said Murgai. He arrived in Dallas with an H-1B visa in 2010 and now owns a house and land there.“When you’re in a place for a decade, you think you’ve settled down,” he said.“If new H-1Bs are being stopped, I get it. But then for people who already have jobs, who have already established themselves in their fields and have given the government a reason to keep them in the country, why upend lives like this?”In surburban Dallas, Sandeep Vudayagiri, a big data analytics engineer, has been home alone since February, when his wife and daughter went to visit family in Hyderabad, India.Vudayagiri’s wife, Arpana Takkalapally, holds an H-4 visa, given to immediate family of H-1B visa holders. Even though Takkalapally isn’t allowed to work on her visa, without a renewal stamp from a US consulate, she can’t go back.“It is indirectly punishing the people who are working here,” he said. “How is my 2-year-old an employment threat in the US? Which country does this?” Vudayagiri said.Takkalapally spends her days in Hyderabad feeding and playing with her daughter, and cooking and cleaning for her parents, bookended by morning and evening calls with her husband.This is the longest the couple have been separated since they met as graduate students at San Jose State University in 2010.Takkalapally watched as Indian friends and neighbors flocked to Houston last year for a rally with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump. The leaders extolled the closeness of India-US ties in a stadium filled with 50,000 people.A similar rally was staged in February in Modi’s home state of Gujarat.“Now it seems like some backstabbing,” Takkalapally said.Immigration attorneys in the US said they have been inundated with emails and phone calls seeking help.“The stress level that this causes on the number of people in the US in legal working status is massive,” said Nell Barker, an attorney in Chicago. “It is causing mental health issues. It is causing productivity issues in a situation where businesses are already struggling to get through these shutdowns and economic downturn.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-coronavirus-then-trump-order-split-indian-families/story-bgdu5sp0TUwLkGwNgagAqN.html
03-07-2020||World||‘Happy hypoxia’ condition in Covid-19 patients decoded||Scientists have found a possible explanation for why some Covid-19 patients experience extremely low, otherwise life-threatening levels of oxygen, known as happy hypoxia, but no signs of difficulty in breathing. The new understanding of the condition, also known as silent hypoxemia, could prevent unnecessary intubation and ventilation in patients during the current and expected second wave of coronavirus, according to the study published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. Intubation is the process of inserting a tube, called an endotracheal tube (ET), through the mouth and then into the airway. It is done so that a patient can be placed on a ventilator to assist with breathing. Happy hypoxia “is especially bewildering to physicians as it defies basic biology,” said Martin J. Tobin, a professor at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine in the US. “In some instances, the patient is comfortable and using a phone at a point when the physician is about to insert a breathing (endotracheal) tube and connect the patient to a mechanical ventilator which while potentially lifesaving carries its own set of risks,” said Tobin. The study included 16 Covid-19 patients with very low levels of oxygen -- as low as 50 per cent compared to normal blood oxygen saturation between 95 and 100 per cent -- without shortness of breath or dyspnea. The researchers found that “several pathophysiological mechanisms account for most, if not all, cases of silent hypoxemia.” This includes the initial assessment of a patient’s oxygen level with a pulse oximeter, they said. “While a pulse oximeter is remarkably accurate when oxygen readings are high, it markedly exaggerates the severity of low levels of oxygen when readings are low,” said Tobin. He noted that another factor is how the brain responds to low levels of oxygen. “As oxygen levels drop in patients with Covid-19, the brain does not respond until oxygen falls to very low levels -- at which point a patient typically becomes short of breath,” said Tobin. In addition, more than half of the patients had low levels of carbon dioxide, which may diminish the impact of an extremely low oxygen level, the researchers said. “It is also possible that the coronavirus is exerting a peculiar action on how the body senses low levels of oxygen,” said Tobin, which could be linked to the lack of smell, experienced by two-thirds of Covid-19 patients. While acknowledging that further research is needed, the study concludes that “features about Covid-19 that physicians find baffling become less strange when viewed in the light of long-established principles of respiratory physiology.” “This new information may help to avoid unnecessary endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, which presents risks, when the ongoing and much anticipated second wave of Covid-19 emerges,” said Tobin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/happy-hypoxia-condition-in-covid-19-patients-decoded/story-7JJD512E1ZY4FQgxchdgyM.html
03-07-2020||World||US job growth roars back, but Covid-19 resurgence threatens recovery||The US economy created jobs at a record clip in June as more restaurants and bars reopened, but 31.5 million Americans were collecting unemployment checks in the middle of the month, and a resurgence in Covid-19 cases suggested the labor market could suffer a setback in July.Record spikes in new coronavirus infections in large parts of the country, including Arizona and the highly-populated states of California, Florida and Texas, have forced several jurisdictions to scale back or pause reopenings, and send some workers back home.The flare-up in the respiratory illness, which started in late June and hit bars and restaurants hard, was not captured in the Labor Department’s closely watched monthly employment report published on Thursday because the government surveyed businesses in the middle of the month.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“June may be the calm before the storm,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. “We cannot be sure the labor market recovery will continue at a speed that is sufficient to put the millions and millions of Americans made jobless in this recession back to work.” Nonfarm payrolls surged by 4.8 million jobs in June, the most since the government started keeping records in 1939. Payrolls rebounded 2.699 million in May after a historic plunge of 20.787 million in April. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would increase by 3 million jobs in June. Still, employment is 14.7 million jobs below its pre-pandemic level. The jobs recouped are for workers who were temporarily unemployed. President Donald Trump, whose opinion poll numbers have tanked as he struggles to manage the pandemic, economic crisis and protests over racial injustice four months before the Nov. 3 election, hailed the job gains as proof “our economy is roaring back.”Though the second straight month of strong hiring added to a stream of data, including consumer spending, in suggesting that the recession which started in February was likely over, that is all history as the coronavirus rages. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell this week said the economic outlook “is extraordinarily uncertain” and would depend on “our success in containing the virus.”Hiring last month was boosted by the typically low-paying leisure and hospitality industry, which brought back 2.1 million jobs, accounting for about two-fifths of the rise in payrolls.The return of these workers pushed down average wages 1.2%. Companies are cutting wages and hours. The average workweek dropped to 34.5 hours from 34.7 hours in May.The measurement of the unemployment rate continued to be biased downward by people misclassifying themselves as being “employed but absent from work” last month. The jobless rate fell to 11.1% from 13.3% in May. Without the misclassification, it would have been 12.3%. The unemployment rate is 7.6 percentage points above its February level. Unemployment dropped for all gender and demographic groups, though joblessness stayed disproportionately high among Blacks and Hispanics. The number of people who have permanently lost their job increased 588,000 to 2.9 million.“These workers will likely struggle to regain employment in an economy facing suppressed demand,” said Beth Akers, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. Stocks on Wall Street rallied, with the Nasdaq hitting an all-time high. The dollar edged up against a basket of currencies. US Treasury prices were trading higher.Broad gainsJobs also returned in the retail, education and health, manufacturing, construction, professional and business services sectors, transportation and warehousing, wholesale trade and financial activities sectors. Local governments hired teachers and support staff. But state governments, confronting reduced revenues and stressed budgets caused by the pandemic, laid off more workers. There were further job losses in mining. Hiring has been boosted by the government’s Paycheck Protection Program, which gives businesses loans that can be partially forgiven if used for wages. Those funds are drying up and many companies, including some not initially impacted by lockdown measures, are struggling with weak demand, forcing them to lay off workers. That has triggered a second wave of layoffs, keeping weekly new applications for unemployment benefits extraordinarily high.In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 55,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.427 million for the week ended June 27.The claims report is the most timely data on the economy’s health. Including a program funded by the government, 2.3 million people filed claims last week.The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 59,000 to 19.290 million in the week ending June 20. There were 31.5 million people receiving unemployment checks in mid-June, up 916,722 from the first week of the month. With roughly a fifth of the workforce on jobless rolls, economists say the government should extend the extra $600 it pays per week in unemployment compensation when that benefit expires on July 31.“Failure to take action would severely dent the chances of a rapid recovery,” said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-job-growth-roars-back-but-covid-19-resurgence-threatens-recovery/story-v8ecgVQlE8UPv8ZMvwk4DO.html

New daily cases in the capital have exceeded 50 over the last week, with Tokyo reporting more than 120 on Friday, up from 107 the day before, the Nikkei newspaper reported, as the virus spreads among nightlife workers.The state of emergency was lifted on May 25.The pandemic is dominating Sunday’s gubernatorial election campaign, with the incumbent, Yuriko Koike, looking set to win easily.The state of emergency gave governors of Japan’s 47 prefectures stronger legal authority to urge people to stay home and businesses to close, but there were no fines or arrests for non-compliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-will-not-revive-state-of-emergency-as-tokyo-covid-19-cases-rise/story-NTeSacG4jTgyRxcMpTAFtN.html

Kim told a ruling party meeting that the country has “thoroughly prevented the inroad of the malignant virus and maintained stable anti-epidemic situation despite the worldwide health crisis.”  The North’s claim of being Covid-19 free has been questioned by outside experts, who say a major outbreak in the country could possibly have dire consequences because of its chronic lack of medical supplies and poor health care infrastructure.Describing its anti-virus efforts as a “matter of national existence,” the country has shut down nearly all cross-border traffic, banned tourists, intensified screening at entry points and mobilized tens of thousands of health workers to monitor residents and isolate those with symptoms.  Experts say the country’s self-imposed lockdown is also hurting an economy already battered by stringent US-led sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-urges-maximum-alert-on-covid-19/story-1L2fh5Gm6O4cG0PWJpdh8O.html

The search was ongoing, he said.Half of the victims are yet to be identified, he said, adding that many were migrants who were living in a small tent beside the mine.A ceremony to give financial aid for the families of the victims would be held on Friday, he said. About US$80,000 had been donated by the regional government, industry body Myanmar Gems and Jewelry Entrepreneurs Association, and one mining company.The miners were collecting stones in the jade-rich Hpakant area of Kachin state - the centre of Myanmar’s secretive jade industry - when the “muddy wave” crashed onto them after heavy rain, the fire service department said in a Facebook post.Deadly landslides and other accidents are common in the poorly regulated mines of Hpakant, which draw impoverished workers from across Myanmar in search of gems mostly for export to China. But Thursday’s accident was the worst in over five years.About 100 people were killed in a 2015 collapse which strengthened calls to regulate the industry.

The wave of new cases has several governors halting or back-pedaling on plans to reopen their states after months of strict lockdowns, closing beaches and canceling fireworks displays over the upcoming Independence Day weekend.

A new study on cough droplets finds out||A mathematical model has revealed that respiratory droplets travel between eight to 13 feet before evaporating or escaping, in a new study on the coronavirus disease.The researchers include scientists from Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru. The research has been published in the journal Physics of Fluids.Since the beginning of the pandemic, it has been a well-established fact that respiratory droplets are responsible for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 pathogen which causes Covid-19. These droplets eject when people cough, sneeze or talk.The mathematical model designed by the researchers focusses on the aerodynamics of the droplets to understand how it infects a healthy person. They compared the droplet cloud ejected by an infected person to the one by a healthy person.“The size of the droplet cloud, the distance it travels, and the droplet lifetimes are, therefore, all important factors that we calculated using conservation of mass, momentum, energy and species,” said one of the authors Swetaprovo Chaudhuri, from the University of Toronto in Canada. The experiments were conducted in contact-less environment.She further explained that the model estimates approximately how long droplets can survive, how far they can travel, and which size of droplet survives for how long.The researchers, however, noted that the actual situation could be complicated by wind, turbulence, air-recirculation or other things.“Without wind and depending on the ambient condition, we found droplets travel between 8 to 13 feet before they evaporate or escape,” said Abhishek Saha, a co-author, from the University of California, San Diego in the US.This finding implies that social distancing at perhaps greater than six feet is essential, according to the researchers. The initial size of the longest surviving droplets is in the range of 18-50 microns, meaning masks can indeed help, they said.These findings, the researchers said, could help inform reopening measures for schools and offices looking at student or employee density.While noting that the model doesn’t claim to predict the exact spread of Covid-19, researchers noted that it could emerge as a powerful tool in clarifying the role of environment on infection spread through respiratory droplets.The droplet evaporation or desiccation time is highly sensitive to the ambient temperature and relative humidity, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-social-distance-and-wearing-mask-is-important-a-new-study-on-cough-droplets-finds-out/story-pPbfHSL2c9kU7yzIjebaFK.html
03-07-2020||World||US envoy to visit South Korea to discuss stalled North Korea nuclear talks||The U.S. point man for North Korea is due to visit South Korea next week as it pushes for a resumption of talks with the North ahead of the U.S. election and despite few signs of any progress.U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun, who led working-level negotiations with the North Koreans, will be among several State Department officials holding talks with South Korean counterparts on Tuesday, a government official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity as the trip has not been announced.South Korean President Moon Jae-in has said U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un should meet again before the U.S. election in November, and on Thursday, South Korea’s foreign minister said Seoul is pushing for a resumption of U.S.-North Korea talks.Biegun has said there is time for both sides to re-engage and “make substantial progress”, but the coronavirus pandemic would make an in-person summit difficult before the November election.Last month, North Korea abruptly raised tension with South Korea and blew up an inter-Korean liaison office, just on its side of the border, before just as suddenly announcing it would suspend plans for unspecified military actions against the South.North Korea has repeatedly said it will not return to talks until the United States drops its “hostile policies”, including strict sanctions, and vowed not to provide Trump with another photo opportunity before the election without significant concessions.“It’s hard to imagine a scenario where the North Koreans would be compelled to come back to the table unless the U.S. ‘offer’ was drastically different than it’s been in the past,” said Jenny Town, of 38 North, a think-tank focusing on North Korea.“And even then, how credible would that be that it would survive a potential change in administration in the U.S.?Trump and Kim met for the first time in 2018 in Singapore, raising hopes of an agreement to get North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons programme.But their second summit, in early 2019 in Vietnam, fell apart.Trump and Kim met again at the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas in June 2019 and agreed to restart negotiations but working-level talks between the two sides in Sweden in October were broken off.Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, told reporters in New York on Thursday that the president might seek another summit with Kim as an “October Surprise” ahead of the election.

Brenton Tarrant pleaded guilty earlier this year to 51 charges of murder, 40 charges of attempted murder and one charge of committing a terrorist act. Justice Cameron Mander said the hearing is estimated to last three days, but it will take as long as is necessary.Tarrant has been in police custody since March 15, 2019, when he was arrested and accused of using semi-automatic weapons to target Muslims attending Friday prayers at two mosques in the South Island city of Christchurch. The attack was streamed live on Facebook and cited as providing inspiration for several other attacks targeting religious groups around the world.Tarrant had planned to fight the charges but changed his plea to guilty in March this year.Justice Mander said arrangements will be made to allow victims and family members currently based overseas, and unable to travel to New Zealand, to view the sentencing remotely.New Zealand borders remain shut for foreigners, and New Zealanders returning will have to stay in quarantine for 14 days, as the government looks to limit the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Tarrant’s remand was extended to find a suitable date after all Covid-19 restrictions were lifted.However, waiting for changes to border controls will likely result in a very extended period of delay, Justice Mander said.“Finality and closure is considered by some as the best means of bringing relief to the Muslim community,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-mosque-shooter-sentencing-begins-on-august-24/story-BxcqHQLyYg0Bx3EeehS7uJ.html

Those who required oxygen without mechanical or high-flow oxygenation were considered severely ill. More than three dozen U.S. states were seeing a rise in Covid-19 cases, according to a Reuters analysis on Thursday, the latest grim sign that the coronavirus pandemic, once thought to be waning, was again spreading rapidly.Worldwide, the virus has infected 10.76 million people, resulting in 516,600 deaths.Shares of Regeneron were down $17.20 at $605.25 after hours.

A full list of countries covered by the relaxation would be announced on Friday, the country’s transport ministry said.Under the existing rules, travellers must self-isolate for 14 days on entering the country, something airlines and the travel industry have said will cost thousands of jobs and inflict further damage on the economy. The government said it expected countries included on the quarantine-free list for England would reciprocate by relaxing their own travel restrictions.Britain’s foreign ministry would set out exemptions from its global advisory against “all but essential” international travel from July 4. “Today marks the next step in carefully reopening our great nation,” Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said. The devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own powers over public health issues.Britain said it would require all travellers, except those from the exempted countries, to provide their contact information including their travel history on arrival. People who have been in or transited through non-exempt countries will still have to self isolate for 14 days.The Telegraph newspaper reported on Thursday the government would end coronavirus quarantine rules for those arriving from 75 countries so that people can go on holiday.The UK would also lift a ban on non-essential travel to nearly all EU destinations, the British territories including Bermuda and Gibraltar, and Turkey, Thailand, Australia and New Zealand, the Telegraph added.Britain is moving to reopen its pubs, restaurants and other businesses this weekend, signalling a gradual reopening of its economy.But Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned people to maintain social distancing rules and is expected to repeat that caution at a news conference on Friday.“Anyone who flouts social distancing and Covid-Secure rules is not only putting us all at risk but letting down those businesses and workers who have done so much to prepare for this new normal,” he will say.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-relax-england-s-quarantine-rules-for-summer-travellers/story-thzrTVwOs4FJc5nbBYj54N.html
03-07-2020||World||Kim Jong-Un hails North Korea’s ‘shining success’ against Covid-19: Report||North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un has praised what he described as his country’s “shining success” in holding off the new coronavirus, according to state-run KCNA news agency Friday.The head of the hermetic totalitarian state spoke at a Worker’s Party politburo meeting on Thursday discussing the impact of the virus, six months after North Korea closed borders and put thousands in to isolation.KCNA reported that after reviewing efforts, Kim “said we have thoroughly prevented the inroad of the malignant virus” and “maintained stable anti-epidemic situation despite the worldwide health crisis”.The reclusive leader praised the “shining success achieved by the far-sighted leadership of the Party Central Committee and a high sense of voluntary spirit displayed by all people who move as one on orders of the Party Central Committee,” KCNA continued.But he also stressed the need to “maintain maximum alert” especially in light of new outbreaks in “neighbouring countries”.“He repeatedly warned that hasty relief of anti-epidemic measures will result in unimaginable and irretrievable crisis,” KCNA said. Pyongyang has not confirmed a single case of the deadly disease that swept the world after first emerging in neighbouring China, but has imposed strict rules, including closing its borders and schools, and putting thousands of its people into isolation.Analysts say the North is unlikely to have avoided infections from the virus, and that its ramshackle health system could struggle to cope with a major outbreak.Last month a United Nations rights expert warned food insecurity is deepening and some people are “starving” as a result of North Korea’s attempts to ward off any outbreak, particularly closing borders.Before the coronavirus crisis, more than 40 percent of people in North Korea were already considered food insecure, with many suffering malnutrition.Touching almost every country on earth, Covid-19 has infected at least 10.7 million people and claimed some 516,000 lives as it upends ordinary and economic life in unprecedented ways. It continues to accelerated around the world, including in the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-hails-north-korea-s-shining-success-against-covid-19-report/story-Jl4meJHibNNeVrL7pWdErK.html
03-07-2020||World||UK to end quarantine for travellers from ‘low-risk’ countries||The British government said Friday it is scrapping a 14-day quarantine rule for arrivals from a number of countries deemed “lower risk” for the coronavirus, including France, Spain, Germany and Italy.The change takes effect July 10, just over a month after the UK began requiring international arrivals to self-isolate for two weeks. The full list of exempted countries will be announced later Friday, the government said. It is considered unlikely the United States, which has the highest number of coronavirus cases and deaths in the world, will be among them.On Saturday, the government will also exempt several countries from its advice against overseas travel, meaning UK tourists can once again head abroad on vacation.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the changes are “good news for British people and great news for British businesses.” But he stressed that the government could re-impose quarantine restrictions “in countries we are reconnecting with.”The changes announced apply only to England, a sign of friction between Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s central government and semi-autonomous administrations in the rest of the UK — Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been particularly critical of Johnson’s approach to easing coronavirus lockdown measures and has taken a more cautious approach.The British government also made the announcement without securing reciprocal agreements that British travelers will not face quarantines. The Department for Transport said its “expectation is that a number of the exempted countries will also not require arrivals from the UK to self-isolate.”Britain has the highest Covid-19 toll in Europe, with almost 44,000 confirmed deaths. The country is gradually emerging from a nationwide lockdown imposed in March, with bars, restaurants and hairdressers allowed to reopen in England on Saturday.The European Union re-opened its borders this week to people from 14 countries including Canada, Japan, South Korea and Morocco — but not the USBritain left the EU on Jan. 31 but continues to be bound by its rules during a transition period that lasts until the end of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-end-quarantine-for-travellers-from-low-risk-countries/story-5R49o5cL8l4T6qBfG9jRSP.html

He has been identified as a reservist with the country’s armed forces.Investigators have yet to attribute a motive for the incursion or name the person who is believed to a Canadian Ranger, which is tasked with patrolling the country’s vast Arctic north. While he is believed to be carrying multiple weapons, the outlet Global News citing anonymous sources in the police reported he told law enforcement he never intended to hurt anyone but wanted to express “frustration” to Trudeau over losing his job due to the Covid-19 pandemic and complain about the government’s benefit scheme.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police or RCMP stated that neither Trudeau nor Payette were present at the site at the time of the incident. The RCMP said the intrusion occurred early on Thursday morning as the man’s vehicle breached the main pedestrian entrance to 1 Sussex Drive, where it was “disabled on impact”. He then proceeded on foot to a greenhouse in the Rideau Hall area where he was “rapidly contained” by patrolling RCMP officers. He was apprehended without any incident and brought into police custody for questioning. As the episode was unfolding, the RCMP’s National Division Emergency Response Team was also called in.“We can confirm that the individual arrested by the RCMP is a member of the Canadian Armed Forces. The RCMP is collaborating closely with the Canadian Armed Forces,” the RCMP statement said. The outlet CBC News reported that the suspect was carrying a note, though its contents have not been made public yet. He is believed to have driven in from the province of Manitoba to the Canadian capital.Rideau Hall is the official residence of the Governor General, while the greenhouse where the suspect was arrested is close to Rideau Cottage, where Trudeau and his family reside.Payette tweeted her thanks to the RCMP for “quickly resolving the situation” adding that all staff on site were safe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/intruder-carrying-multiple-weapons-arrested-near-canadian-pm-justin-trudeau-s-ottawa-home/story-jK2beyynxHMIpNRj7eZpfN.html
03-07-2020||World||Confirmed coronavirus cases are rising in 40 of 50 states||Four US states — Arizona, California, Florida and Texas — reported a combined 25,000 new confirmed coronavirus cases Thursday as the infection curve rose in 40 of the 50 states heading into the July Fourth holiday weekend.With the number of daily confirmed coronavirus cases nationwide climbing past 50,000, an alarming 36 states saw an increase in the percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“What we’ve seen is a very disturbing week,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious-disease expert, said in a livestream with the American Medical Association.In a major retreat that illustrated how dire things have become in Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the wearing of masks across most of the state after refusing until recently to let even local governments impose such rules.The surge has been blamed in part on Americans not covering their faces or following other social distancing rules as states lifted their lockdowns over the past few weeks. Fauci warned that if people don’t start complying, “we’re going to be in some serious difficulty.”The US recorded 51,200 new confirmed cases Wednesday, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. That represents a doubling of the daily total over the past month and is higher even than what the country witnessed during the most lethal phase of the crisis in April and May, when the New York metropolitan area was easily the worst hot spot in the USAll but 10 states are showing an upswing in newly reported cases over the past 14 days, according to data compiled by the volunteer Covid Tracking Project. The outbreaks are most severe in Arizona, Texas and Florida, which together with California have reclosed or otherwise clamped back down on bars, restaurants and movie theaters over the past week or so.Nebraska and South Dakota were the only states outside the Northeast with a downward trend in cases.While some of the increases may be explained by expanded testing, other indicators are grim, too, including hospitalizations and positive test rates. Over the past two weeks, the percentage of positive tests has doubled in Georgia, Kansas, Montana, Michigan, Missouri, Tennessee, Mississippi, South Carolina and Ohio. In Nevada, it has tripled. In Idaho, it is five times higher.In Texas, where new cases in the past two weeks have swelled from about 2,400 a day to almost 8,000 on Wednesday, the positive rate ballooned from 8% to 14.5%. In Arizona, it has gone from 5.7% to 10.3%.Abbott, who in May began one of the most aggressive reopening schedules of any governor, ordered the wearing of masks in all counties with at least 20 Covid-19 cases.Abbott said in a video posted on Twitter that the state’s lower infection rate and case counts after his stay-home order in April might have led some to think the “coast was clear.”But the number of people hospitalized in Texas because of Covid-19 has quadrupled since late May, after businesses began reopening.“We are now at a point where the virus is spreading so fast, there is little margin for error,” Abbott said. “I know that wearing a face covering is not the convenient thing to do, but I also know that wearing a face covering will help us to keep Texas open for business. And it will help Texans earn the paycheck they need.”The surge comes as Americans head into a Fourth of July holiday that health officials warn could add fuel to the outbreak by drawing big crowds. Many municipalities have canceled fireworks displays. Beaches up and down California and Florida have been closed.Florida reported more than 10,000 new confirmed cases for the first time Thursday. That is six times higher than the daily count of less than a month ago. The state also reported 67 deaths for the second time in a week and 325 new hospitalizations, one of the biggest 24-hour jumps in Florida yet. Georgia likewise saw its biggest single-day increase yet, nearly 3,500 cases.“I’m discouraged because we didn’t act fast enough to shut things down, and we could have done a much better job getting a handle on the virus,” said Megan Archer, a 39-year-old woman from West Palm Beach, Florida, who lost her job with a county parks department during the outbreak.Meanwhile, the government reported that US unemployment fell to 11.1% in June as the economy added a solid 4.8 million jobs. But that figure may be outdated: The data was collected during the second week of June, before many states began to backtrack on restarting their economies.Several Northeastern states have seen new infections slow down significantly, including New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island and New Jersey, which allowed its Atlantic City casinos to reopen Thursday, though with no smoking, drinking or eating.Pennsylvania, an outlier among Northeastern states, reported its highest one-day total of new cases since May, with more than 830, more than one-quarter of them in Pittsburgh’s Allegheny County, which will impose a one-week shutdown of bars and restaurants and all gatherings of more than 25 people starting Friday.Other states, like Colorado, a major summer destination where increases in infections have been less dramatic, are keeping a close eye on their neighbors.“I’ve been watching that map. ... We’re well aware of what’s going on around us and we’re very anxious,” said Dr. Michelle Barron, medical director of infection prevention and control at UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital. “The next couple of weeks are critical.”President Donald Trump on Wednesday seemed confident the virus would soon subside, telling Fox Business: “I think that, at some point, that’s going to sort of just disappear, I hope.”The US has reported at least 2.7 million cases and more than 128,000 dead, the highest toll in the world. Globally there have been 10.7 million confirmed cases and over 517,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins’ count. The true toll is believed to be significantly higher, in part because of limited testing and mild cases that have been missed.Other countries are also reporting an upswing in cases.“We have now entered a new and treacherous phase in the life cycle of this pandemic,” South African President Cyril Ramaphosa warned in a broadcast to the nation, which recorded more than 8,100 new infections, a one-day record, and has the biggest caseload on the continent.India, the world’s second-most populous country with more than 1.3 billion people, has reported nearly 100,000 new cases in the past four days alone.___Associated Press’ Adriana Gomez Licon in Miami; Kelli Kennedy in Fort Lauderdale; Cara Anna in Johannesburg; and David Rising in Berlin contributed to this report.

03-07-2020||World||Canada’s GDP fell by nearly 12% in April due to Covid-19 lockdown||Canada’s real gross domestic product or GDP witnessed a historic contraction in April, dropping by nearly 12 per cent, due to restrictions imposed to counter the Covid-19 pandemic. But, there are already signs of revival as phased reopening has a positive effect on the economy.Statistics Canada or StatCan stated that real GDP dropped 11.6 per cent in April after a decline of 7.5 per cent in March. April was the first full month during which restrictive measures were in place and the data reflects its impact on the economy. As StatCan noted, “All 20 industrial sectors of the Canadian economy were down, producing the largest monthly decline since the series started in 1961.”Overall, the economy was 18.2 per cent below where it was in February this year, prior to the coronavirus crisis.Earlier, StatCan had estimated a decline of about 11 per cent for April and this final figure is in line with its forecast. At that time, it had also noted that “March and April decreases are likely to be the largest consecutive monthly declines on record.”While the economic low at the peak of the crisis was predictable, the number did fall short of the approximately 13 per cent others had indicated. However, a turnaround may be in the offing as StatCan said that preliminary information indicated a rise of about 3 per cent for May. “Output across several industrial sectors—including manufacturing, retail and wholesale as well as the public sector (health, education and public administration)—increased in May, as activities gradually resumed in phases depending on the type of activity and the geographic area,” it said. The data for June could be even better since several provinces accelerated phased reopening during that month.Among the sectors hardest hit in April was manufacturing which fell by 22.5 per cent.StatCan has been providing an “advanced aggregate indicator of the state of the Canadian economy” due to the unprecedented situation precipitated by the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-gdp-fell-by-nearly-12-in-april-due-to-covid-19-lockdown/story-LimQdYQGnAxDics55alOfM.html

It has now reported more than 40,000 cases for seven straight days and broken records for new cases three days in a row, according to the tally.New infections rose in 37 out of 50 US states in the past 14 days compared with the two weeks prior in early June, according to a Reuters analysis.Florida reported the biggest increase of any state so far on Thursday, recording over 10,000 new cases in a single day. With 21 million residents, the state has reported more new daily coronavirus cases than any European country had at the height of their outbreaks.Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned earlier this week the daily increase in new US cases could reach 100,000 without nationwide measures to slow the rate.While testing rates have increased, so has the percentage of positive results. Hospitalizations have also skyrocketed.Nationally, 7% of coronavirus diagnostic tests came back positive last week, up from 5% the prior week, according to a Reuters analysis. Arizona’s positivity test rate was 24% last week, Florida’s was 16%. Nevada, South Carolina and Texas were all at 15%, the analysis found.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/update-1-u-s-coronavirus-cases-hit-new-global-record-rising-almost-55-000-in-single-day/story-FjIUNvRYEFkS6BCu7wSHoJ.html
03-07-2020||World||‘Fair & Lovely’ cream rebranded‘Glow & Lovely’||Unilever removed the word “fair” from the name of a skin-whitening cream it has sold in India for decades, following criticism that the brand perpetuated harmful racial stereotyping.The face cream previously called Fair & Lovely will be called Glow & Lovely, the company said in an emailed statement. A men’s version will be renamed Glow & Handsome.The change is meant to make the brand, which accounts for $500 million in annual revenue, more “inclusive,” Unilever said. Still, it falls short of demands from activists to stop selling skin-whitening creams entirely because they imply darker skin is undesirable. Those calls have gained attention recently as the Black Lives Matter protests sweeping the U.S. have raised awareness of racial stereotyping elsewhere.From PepsiCo Inc.’s Aunt Jemima maple syrup to Mars Inc.’s Uncle Ben’s rice, companies have been changing brands critics have long called problematic. Last month Johnson & Johnson said it would retreat from its own skin-whitening business, which includes the Clean & Clear Fairness brand in India.The marketing pitch for Fair & Lovely has been rooted in deeply entrenched concepts of beauty in India -- the company’s second-largest market after the U.S. -- where darker skin is viewed as undesirable and often associated with people at the bottom of Hinduisim’s caste system. Matrimonial advertisements in India’s largest newspapers routinely specify the need for a “fair” bride.As India’s leading whitening cream, Fair & Lovely has been a regular target for social media activists over the years. Television cooking-show host Padma Lakshmi last month tweeted that the makers of the product needed to “pack their fake cosmetics and GO!!” A previous campaign saw dark-skinned women post pictures of themselves under the hashtag #unfairandlovely in 2016.The rebranded products will be on store shelves in the coming months. The terms “fair,” “whitening,” and “lightening,” will also be removed from packaging and marketing materials, the company has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fair-lovely-cream-rebranded-glow-lovely/story-enetD67c8mNeOFHMlcgMTP.html
03-07-2020||World||Scientists use weather forecasting technique to predict Covid-19 spread||Scientists have employed methods normally used to forecast weather to predict how rapidly Covid-19 could spread in different countries as lockdown is eased, as well as assess the effectiveness of measures put in place. An international team, including meteorologists from the University of Reading in the UK, applied data assimilation, a technique that combines multiple sources of information to estimate how a situation will develop over time, to the pandemic. The study, submitted to the journal Foundations of Data Science, suggests it is possible to make reasonably accurate predictions of how easing measures might affect the spread of the virus up to two weeks in advance.This technique is usually used to pair computer simulations with real weather observations to forecast future weather, the researchers said. “A key result from this work is that we can estimate accurately how the reproductive (R) number varies in time in response to implementing or loosing up various mitigation measures,” said Professor Geir Evensen, from the NORCE: Norwegian Research Centre, who led the study. R number is the number of people a person with Covid-19 is likely to infect. Previous computer model forecasts can be tested against the subsequent weather data to help make future short-term predictions more accurate, the researchers said. When applied to the novel coronavirus, observations including hospital admissions, the number of patients in intensive care, and the number of daily deaths can be combined with models calculating risk of vulnerability, exposure, infection and death, according to the researchers. “Most data is uncertain to some degree, but combining as much of it as possible from different sources can iron out some of this uncertainty when predicting future events,” said Javier Amezcua, one of three Reading scientists that worked on the study. “Meteorologists use this method all the time to understand and forecast natural processes like weather, but its uses extend beyond that,” Amezcua said. The study allows estimations to be made of how situations will develop in different scenarios, and can be used to create longer-term forecasts, the researchers said. This means it could be useful to predict the impact changes of lockdown policies, such as reopening schools and shops or increasing permitted socialising, might have on the spread of infections, they said. The team applied the technique to estimate coronavirus spread in eight different countries around the world -- England, France, the Netherlands, Norway, the US, Canada, Brazil and Argentina -- which have all seen the virus spread in different ways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-use-weather-forecasting-technique-to-predict-covid-19-spread/story-A215vAJqZ2CUn1f8xHyqeP.html
03-07-2020||World||Astronauts perform spacewalk to swap station batteries||Astronauts performed their second spacewalk in under a week Wednesday to replace old batteries outside the International Space Station.Commander Chris Cassidy and Bob Behnken quickly tackled the big, boxy batteries. For every two outdated batteries coming out, a new and improved one goes in to supply power to the station on the night side of Earth.Within a couple hours, the astronauts had installed another new battery, the third one in this latest series of spacewalks. NASA plans to send the pair out twice more in July to complete the battery swap-outs that began in 2017. The new lithium-ion batteries should last the rest of the space station’s life, according to officials.With their main chore completed, Cassidy and Behnken jumped ahead to loosen the bolts on the remaining outdated batteries. Some of the bolts required extra muscle.“Boy, it put up a good fight,” Cassidy radioed. “These batteries, they like their home.”Before floating out, Cassidy attached a spare mirror to his sleeve to replace one that came off and floated away during Friday’s spacewalk. Astronauts use the wrist mirrors to see the displays on their chest control panel.NASA wants the battery work completed before Behnken returns to Earth in August aboard a SpaceX capsule. He’s one of two test pilots who launched on SpaceX’s first astronaut flight in May.Cassidy and Behnken now have eight spacewalks apiece on their resumes.A space tourist might get a chance to join the prestigious spacewalking ranks — for the right price.Virginia-based Space Adventures Inc. is seeking a paying customer to not only fly to the space station, but do a spacewalk with an experienced Russian cosmonaut. Before launching from Kazakhstan, the space tourist would need to undergo extra training in Star City, Russia.Space Adventures is not divulging the cost of the two-week mission. The flight would take up two tourists in 2023, one of whom would step outside. The Russian rocket company Energia has teamed up with Space Adventures for the expedition.Plenty of specialized training would be needed before someone ventures out on a spacewalk, Behnken told The Associated Press earlier this week.NASA considers spacewalks one of the riskiest parts of any mission, and astronauts spend hours practicing underwater — the closest simulation to spacewalking on Earth.“I think it could be really challenging for a tourist to go on a spacewalk,” Behnken said. Any tourist would want multiple practice sessions in order to be “prepared for the space environment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astronauts-perform-spacewalk-to-swap-station-batteries/story-0wX8KXUFMILusv2fNi7rUO.html

In order to protect the government revenue, six immoveable properties and 14 bank accounts have been provisionally attached. In one month period, the officials of Central GST Intelligence have conducted more than 50 searches under this operation,” said the release issued by additional director general, DGGI in Bhopal, PK Singh.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesAs per the official information, Rs 5.7 crore was seized in cash, besides 28 machines during the raids conducted at various places in Indore.“Search by officials of Central GST Intelligence was conducted at the premises of the supplier of filters used in cigarettes on June 25, 2020. Investigations revealed that this unit had declared invoices to have provided cigarette filters to three dummy firms, but actually the filters were supplied to the firm that was raided,” said the release. It added that one proprietor of the dummy firm was found to be an employee of a newspaper publications private limited.“In the searches conducted during the second fortnight of June, as many as 8 machines and huge quantities of raw materials used for cigarette/ cigarette filter manufacturing and cigarette packing have been detected and seized, since they were kept in undeclared premises for clandestine manufacture,” said the release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-agencies-detect-rs-512-crore-gst-evasion-in-one-year-after-raids-in-indore/story-L3iWDIg7ZTaWdvGE0CdWYI.html

Seventy-six Covid-19 patients were also discharged from different hospitals in the state on Friday with a maximum of 14 each from Dehradun and Pauri districts.According to the health bulletin released by the state health department on Friday evening, the 64 fresh cases included a maximum of 21 from Dehradun district, followed by Nainital (13), US Nagar (12), Almora (8), Bageshwar (3), Chamoli (2), Champawat (2), Haridwar (2) and Pithoragarh (1).The state had reported its first positive Covid-19 case on March 15. The cases started increasing after May 23, when people started returning to the state in huge numbers.A total of 42 Covid-19 positive patients have died in Uttarakhand till now with four patients dying due to the contagion, according to health officials. The rest of the positive patients died due to co-morbidities and other causes, health officials said.The rate of doubling of cases based on the last seven days now stands at 53.9.56 days, while the infection rate is 4.6%. The state has so far tested 73,000 samples of which results of over 5,700 are awaited. Uttarakhand currently has 91 containment zones in five districts including a maximum 68 such in Haridwar, followed by 10 in Dehradun, 5 in Tehri Garhwal, 4 each in Uttarkashi and US Nagar.Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Friday said the state government has approved Rs 11.25 crore for increasing testing facilities and infrastructure for Covid-19 in the state. Of this Rs 11.26 crore, Rs 3.75 crore each will be provided to government medical colleges at Dehradun, Haldwani and Srinagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-cases-cross-3000-mark-in-uttarakhand-cm-allocates-rs-11-25-crore-for-more-tests/story-LyusRxfmmHI7zjFaQf5StO.html

The ship was intercepted by naval ships after the incident and brought back to Kochi waters. Though the marines were arrested, they were later granted conditional bail by the Supreme Court and allowed to return to Italy in 2014 and 2016.The case led to a new low in relations between India and Italy on the issue of jurisdiction.The tribunal began hearing the case after Italy contended in December 2015 that India violated the rights and immunity of the marines – Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone – by detaining them. Italy also argued that India violated its exclusive right to institute penal proceedings against the marines under UNCLOS.On Thursday, the tribunal ruled that India is entitled to compensation in the case but, at the same time, the five-member arbitral tribunal under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) decided by three votes to two that the marines are entitled to immunity in relation to their acts during the incident and that “India is precluded from exercising its jurisdiction” over them.Following the ruling, the Centre on Friday filed an application requesting the Supreme Court to dispose of the proceedings pending before the top court in relation to the incident.However, CM Vijayan said that Kerala will inform the Centre about its opposition to the withdrawal of the case.“We are not in favour of withdrawing the case from the Supreme Court.

03-07-2020||India||Covid-19: UK opens quarantine-free travel corridors for 60 nations; excludes India from list||The UK on Friday allowed quarantine-free international travel to nearly 60 “lower risk countries”, excluding India and the US, as it released a list of exempt nations posing “a reduced risk” from the deadly coronavirus. The UK Foreign Office Travel Advisory related to India remains unchanged as part of its wider advice for British nationals to avoid “all non-essential international travel”. India and the US are among the countries excluded from the list of nearly 60 low-risk countries. The list containing countries posing “a reduced risk” from the deadly coronavirus includes European destinations of Germany, France, Spain and Italy as well as Australia and New Zealand. Some of the Asian countries considered low risk include Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, with popular holiday destinations in the Caribbean as well as Mauritius and the Seychelles also making the UK’s travel corridor cut. “Today marks the next step in carefully reopening our great nation. Whether you are a holidaymaker ready to travel abroad or a business eager to open your doors again, this is good news for British people and great news for British businesses,” said UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. “The entire nation has worked tirelessly to get to this stage, therefore safety must remain our watch word and we will not hesitate to move quickly to protect ourselves if infection rates rise in countries we are reconnecting with,” the minister said. Under COVID-19 lockdown related rules brought in last month, most travellers from any part of the world coming into the UK currently have to self-isolate, or quarantine, for two weeks. The new measures, which will come into force from July 10, mean that people arriving from selected green or amber zone destinations will be able to enter England without needing to self-isolate, unless they have been in or transited through non-exempt countries in the preceding 14 days. The devolved administrations will set out their own approach to exemptions, and so passengers returning to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland could be subject to slightly different quarantine rules until they confirm their travel strategies to control the spread of coronavirus. The UK government said its expectation is that a number of the exempted countries will also not require arrivals from the UK to self-isolate. This will mean that holidaymakers or business travellers travelling to and from certain destinations will not need to self-isolate on either leg of their journey. The exempted countries and territories will be kept under constant review, so that if the health risks increase self-isolation measures can be re-introduced to help stop the spread of the disease into England, the Department for Transport said. The UK Foreign Office is also set to change its blanket advice against all non-essential foreign travel from Saturday and make it more region-specific in line with the traffic light system. The transport ministry said the graded travel system follows a risk assessment has been conducted by the Joint Biosecurity Centre, in close consultation with Public Health England and the Chief Medical Officer. The assessment draws on a range of factors including the prevalence of coronavirus, the numbers of new cases and potential trajectory of the disease in that destination. According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the contagion has infected over 10 million people and killed more than 521,000 across the world. The US is the worst affected country with over 2.7 million cases and more than 1,28,000 deaths. The UK has over 285,000 cases with more than 44,000 fatalities. The COVID-19, which originated in China’s Wuhan city in December last year, has also battered the world economy with the International Monetary Fund saying that the global economy is bound to suffer a “severe recession”. Scientists are racing against time to find a vaccine or medicine for its treatment.

The government till now has made purchases worth more than Rs 3,000 crore and it looks like nearly Rs 2,200 crore might be involved in misappropriation,” he said.Siddaramaiah demanded that the government release a whitepaper on all expenditure incurred. He also cited various prices which he claimed the government had overpaid for, including ventilators which cost Rs 4 lakh and had been purchased at Rs 12 lakh, a PPE kit which costs Rs 995 but had been brought at triple the price, surgical gloves costing Rs 200 at Rs 400 per piece. He said that there has been massive corruption in the purchase of Covid-19 related equipment.He also claimed that lack of coordination between various ministers has led to the government’s mismanagement of the Covid-19 situation leading to a spike in the number of cases in the state. However, Medical Education minister Dr K Sudhakar refuted Siddaramaiah’s charges. “There is perfect coordination amongst all of us in the government and we are working under the leadership of CM Yediyurappa to combat the tough situation.

03-07-2020||India||Congress says MP CM Shivraj Chouhan violated constitutional norms in cabinet expansion, will move court||A day after Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan expanded his cabinet, the Congress accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government of violating the constitutional norm of capping the number of ministers under 15% of the state assembly strength and threatened to move the court.The Opposition party has also questioned Chouhan’s decision to induct Jagdish Devda as a minister in his cabinet even though it was not clear if he had resigned from the position of pro-tem speaker in the state assembly.In the second and major expansion of Chouhan’s cabinet that took place on Thursday, more than three months after he assumed office and two months after the first expansion, as many as 28 new ministers were sworn in to fill all the ministerial berths in the cabinet except one.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesIn the 230-member state assembly, the number of ministers should not exceed 35. However, since the assembly strength has been reduced to 206 due to 24 vacant seats, the Congress claims the ministers’ number should be based on the existing strength and not the total number of assembly seats. Thus, they claim that the number of ministers shouldn’t exceed 31.Senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member, Vivek Tankha said, “Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has violated the law once again. He ran the government without any minister for a month. When I complained to the President of India, he inducted five ministers whereas this number should have been 12. Now, he has inducted 28 ministers and the total number of ministers exceeds 15% of 206 lawmakers in the state assembly. Congress will move the court against this illegal cabinet.”MP Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta said, “Pro tem speaker of the state assembly is a constitutional post. A man can’t hold two constitutional posts simultaneously. There is no notification from the governor about his resignation, if it was tendered from the pro tem speaker’s post.”The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Reacting to the charges, home and health minister Narottam Mishra said, “There is no illegality in the cabinet expansion. It’s completely legal and I am saying this based on a study. However, if someone wants to challenge the same in the court, he is free to do it.”Meanwhile, according to some BJP leaders, several followers of a few BJP lawmakers, who couldn’t get ministerial berths, protested in their respective districts and a section of them even reached the state BJP office on Friday to lodge a protest. The reports of protests came from at least 7 districts including Indore, Mandsaur, Dewas, Sagar, Jabalpur etc. Supporters of BJP MLA from Sagar, Shailendra Jain, observed a ‘Jal Satyagrah in Sagar by standing in knee-deep water.

He had earlier indicated that additional relaxations will be given keeping in mind the need to give push to economic activities.Due to the rising trend of daily cases, seen in the last couple of weeks, some of the municipal corporations in the Mumbai metropolitan region, like Thane and Mira Bhayandar, have announced lockdowns in their respective areas.State health minister Rajesh Tope had taken stock of the situation in Thane on Thursday and stated that the state government has been making all efforts to break the chain of coronavirus transmission.In a related development, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar directed the Pune district and city administrations to appoint an IAS officer to oversee coronavirus testing in one of the worst affected cities in the state. The Covid case count in Pune is nearing 25,000.Pawar also asked the officials to implement strict measures to prevent the spread of the virus in containment zones and take action against those who are not wearing masks in public places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-latest-maharashtra-s-record-run-continues-with-6-330-new-cases-198-fatalities/story-3Dz7S1CWk2uRNJTPsM4f7L.html

In an address to troops, Modi paid tributes to those 20 Indian soldiers killed in the Galwan Valley clashes, and said tales of the bravery and valour of the armed forces are echoing in every part of the country. An unspecified number of Chinese soldiers also died in the clash.“Bharat Mata’s enemies have seen your fire and fury,” Modi said in an apparent reference to the military clashes between the Indian and Chinese troops. He stressed that bravery is a prerequisite for peace and that the weak can never accomplish it.The PM’s visit to Ladakh is seen as a strong message against China’s aggressive posturing along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the region.“We are the same people who pray to the flute-playing Lord Krishna, but we are also those who idolise and pray to the same Lord Krishna who carries the ‘Sudarshana Chakra’,” he said amid chants of ‘Vande Mataram’.Without naming China, the PM said history is proof that “expansionists” have either lost or perished.“The era of expansionism has ended. This is the age of development. If someone becomes stubborn for expansionism, then it creates danger for world peace. History is witness that such forces have either been eliminated or forced to turn back.The entire world has made up its mind against expansionism,” he said.The PM arrived in Ladakh accompanied by Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat and Army Chief Gen MM Naravane in the morning. Later, he interacted with personnel from the Army, Indian Air Force and the ITBP in Nimu. Located at 11,000 feet, Nimu is among the toughest terrains, on the banks of river Indus and surrounded by the Zanskar range. In the afternoon, Modi visited a military hospital in Leh where he interacted with soldiers, who were injured in the Galwan Valley clashes and are undergoing treatment.“Whether during the world wars or peace, the world has seen the victory of our brave soldiers and their efforts towards peace,” Modi said in his address.Several steps have been taken for the wellbeing of India’s armed forces and to further strengthen India’s security preparedness, said the PM. From ensuring availability of modern weaponry, increased border infrastructure, border area development and expanding the roads network, several steps have been taken for the well-being of India’s armed forces and to further strengthen India’s security preparedness, said the PM. Modi also underscored how virtues of peace, friendship and courage have been a part of India’s culture since time immemorial. He recalled that India has always given a befitting reply to anyone who has tried to disturb the prevailing atmosphere of peace and progress.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expansionism-era-over-your-fire-and-fury-seen-pm-to-soldiers-in-ladakh/story-vORV6ty5OoX05v7mldrksN.html

Karak was on duty at Gate No 6 which is meant for visitors. He was sitting on a bench near the gate and was close to the pavement outside the building. Policemen who were on duty at the spot said it was not clear whether he tried to commit suicide or got shot accidentally. He was taken to the Medical College and Hospital in a very critical condition. The bullet exited though the left side of his head. Sudheer Kumar Neelakantam, deputy commissioner (central division) of Kolkata Police said it appeared from circumstantial evidence that Karak may have tried to kill himself. “He is under treatment,” the DCP told reporters.A probe was initiated and security camera footage was being examined. Karak was attached to the fifth battalion of the Kolkata Armed Police. Although the chief minister’s office and other important departments have shifted to Nabanna, the new secretariat building in Howrah district, some departments still operate from Writers’ Building. The heritage structure, which is undergoing renovation, was built by the British government. It was the seat of power of the Congress and the Left Front governments. The complex is located very close to Lalbazar, the headquarters of the city police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cop-shot-by-service-rifle-in-bengal-govt-s-old-secretariat-building/story-pTNJ0YjtapiXZqQHlrOfzK.html

What is the purpose of talking about an unnamed ‘enemy’ to the people of India and the jawans in Ladakh?” Chidambaram asked in a series of tweets.Chidambaram also raised questions about PM’s continued silence on where exactly the clashes between Indian and Chinese troops took place and whether China intruded into India’s territory. “PM has still not answered our questions about where the violent clashes took place on June 15-16 between Chinese and Indian troops and if the Chinese have intruded into Indian territory at several points,” he said in a tweet. “Nor has the government answered our questions on the satellite images showing Chinese troops occupying key positions in places hitherto considered as undisputed Indian territory,” Chidambaram said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-is-pm-modi-talking-about-unnamed-enemy-to-indians-jawans-in-ladakh-asks-chidambaram/story-II6YlFYXhFgO0nSWJMUYgN.html
03-07-2020||India||10 important things to know about recent earthquakes in Delhi and NCR||An earthquake measuring 4.7 on the Richter scale, centred 63km southwest of the millennium city of Gurugram in Haryana, shook the national capital region (NCR) on Friday even as the residents had begun to put behind a series of tremors experienced till June 8 last month. The latest tremor is likely to trigger fresh curiosity over earthquakes in the region and raise questions over safety of residents from seismic activities. There is no proven technology in the world to predict earthquakes with certainty in terms of location, time and magnitude, therefore information and awareness are considered key tools for better understanding of the phenomenon.Here are 10 important points that will help in understanding the recent earthquakes. 1. A series of 16 earthquakes or so were recorded in the NCR from April this year till June 8 with the last one in the series being a mild one centred near Delhi with an intensity of 2.1 magnitude. The epicenter of the tremor was recorded south east of Rohtak in Haryana at latitude 28.85 and longitude 76.76. Most of the earthquakes registered in the series were mild barring a couple above 3.5 magnitude including a 4.5 magnitude earthquake that had hi Rohtak on May 30.2. The National Centre of Seismology has said that the tremors were being monitored and studied by a team at the national centre. It had also termed the occurrence of mild tremors in this region as a normal phenomenon. J L Gautam, head of operations at the NCS had said that it was not abnormal to record several earthquakes within a couple of months in the NCR.3. Delhi and NCR is also vulnerable to quakes because of its proximity to Himalayas. There are many faults, ridges and lineaments transverse to the Himalayan arc. A major earthquake in the Himalayan seismic belt may be a threat to Delhi-NCR. However, the experts also described these events as “non-linear” to suggest they shouldn’t be seen as events connected on a timeline. NCS said the several mild earthquakes in a very short period could be attributed to “minor adjustments” of the tectonic plates.4. Delhi-NCR is in the second highest seismic hazard zone which comes under Zone IV. The tremors in the NCR could be a result of shifting in any of the several fault lines in the region incuding the Mathura fault; Moradabad fault; Delhi Haridwar ridge; Delhi Sargoda fault; Mahendergarh and Dehradun fault. The vulnerability of a region can be understood from past seismicity, calculation of strain and mapping of active faults.5. The NCS has also said that the occurrence of a series of small earthquakes can neither be extrapolated to predict a big earthquake in the region nor can it be used to rule it out. In other words, the agency has made it clear that earthquakes cannot be forecast. The Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology also made a similar point and said that small magnitude tremors in Delhi-NCR do not necessarily indicate that a bigger one was around the corner.6. According to experts, sometimes a vulnerable zone remains quiet or experiences small magnitude earthquakes that do not indicate any bigger earthquake, or can receive a sudden jolt by a big earthquake without any warning. All the quakes recorded in Delhi-NCR are due to the release of energy, which have accumulated as a result of northward movement of the Indian plate and its collision with the Eurasian plate, through the fault or weak zones.7. The experts at NCS have maintained that while there is no need to panic, it was important to be prepared and take precautionary measures to mitigate the risks associated with a big earthquake.8. A petition was moved in Delhi High Court last month seeking directions to Delhi government and the civic authority to prepare an action plan to safeguard structures in the national capital against a big earthquake. The court had asked the AAP government, Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and the three municipal corporations (MCD) to respond to questions on preparedness to deal with a major tremor. The court also directed the authorities to make the public aware about the action plan in place.9. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) had requested the state government in the region to take steps to ensure compliance of building bye laws for the safety of upcoming constructions. They bylaws specify requirements to make buildings earthquake resilient.10. The NDMA had also suggested that the states identify the vulnerable structures including lifeline buildings and retrofit them to reduce their vulnerability to moderate to severe earthquakes. It also called for the retrofitting of private buildings in a phased manner. It also suggested that regular mock exercises were conducted and governments released SoPs for immediate response after an earthquake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-important-things-to-know-about-recent-earthquakes-in-delhi-and-ncr/story-n1aKl6NFRcvPA8KKMUGyQP.html
03-07-2020||India||Nagaland bans import, trade and sale of dog meat||Nagaland government on Friday banned the import, trading, and sale of dog meat in the north-eastern state. Earlier, the Mizoram government had taken a similar decision in March.“The state government has decided to ban the commercial import and trading of dogs and dog markets and also the sale of canine meat, both cooked and uncooked,” Nagaland chief secretary Temjen Toy tweeted after the decision was taken at a cabinet meeting.“This is a progressive move. In this day and age, positive social media activism and advocacy has an enormous impact on policymakers. Congrats and thanks to all,” Abu Metha, advisor to Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio, tweeted.While there was not much clarity on what prompted the decision, there has been a recent online campaign against the sale of dogs and canine meat in Nagaland by several organisations, including the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and the Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisation (FIAPO).“We are again hit by shock and horror at recent images that have emerged from the ‘animal bazaar’ in Dimapur, where dogs are seen in terrifying conditions, tied up in sacks, waiting at a wet market, for their illegal slaughter, trade, and consumption as meat,” FAIPO had said in an appeal to Nagaland government on Thursday, urging it to enforce an immediate ban.In a statement issued on Friday, Humane Society International (HSI) and People For Animals (PFA), which had earlier demanded an end to canine meat sale in Nagaland, welcomed the state government’s move and dubbed it as a “major turning point” to end cruelty against dogs.“The decision by the Nagaland cabinet will end the import, trade, and sale of dogs and canine meat. We welcome this decision as a major turning point in ending the cruelty of the country’s illicit dog meat trade,” the statement read.Canine meat is consumed by some sections of the Nagaland population. Stray dogs caught from neighbouring states and even West Bengal, are routinely smuggled to Nagaland for sale as canine meat in Dimapur, the commercial hub of the state, and other districts and towns as well.Since the trade is unregulated, no data is available on the volume of dog meat consumed annually in the state, government officials said.However, according to HSI and PFA’s estimates, around 30,000 dogs are smuggled annually to Nagaland, where they are sold in markets and “beaten to death with wooden clubs”.However, the government didn’t share details about how it would plan to enforce the ban, as the trade is informal and unregulated.The government decision has met with some opposition by civil society groups and eminent persons, who termed the move as an infringement on food habits of the local Naga population.“The government may have some reasons why they decided to impose the ban. But, it will have an impact on food habits as dog meat is consumed by a section of the local population. I have no idea how the government will restrict food habits and implement the ban,” said Theja Therieh, secretary, Naga Tribes Council.“I am a dog lover and don’t consume dog meat. But consumption of dog meat has been part of our culture, so instead of taking a hurried decision based on a campaign, mostly from outside the state, the government could have talked to the stakeholders first,” said Alobo Naga, a popular local musician.In March, the Mizoram assembly had passed the Animal Slaughter (Amendment) Bill, 2020, removing dogs from the list of animals suitable for slaughter, effectively imposing a ban on sale and purchase of canine meat in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-bans-import-trade-and-sale-of-dog-meat/story-VqPnIBleACAeqimnD9fYYM.html
03-07-2020||India||WHO endorses tests by ICMR, 2 others for TB diagnosis, drug resistance detection||The World Health Organisation (WHO) has endorsed tests by three research bodies, including ICMR, for initial diagnosis of tuberculosis and detection of resistance to a drug most commonly used to treat the disease.The three research bodies said their tests -- “rapid molecular Truenat assays -- have been endorsed by the global health body for initial diagnosis of tuberculosis and subsequent detection of rifampicin resistance in adults and children.Rifampicin is a standardized drug and the most commonly used first-line treatment of tuberculosis.The three research bodies -- the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), Molbio Diagnostics and the Indian Council of Medical Research said drug-resistant tuberculosis poses a particular challenge, with growing resistance to rifampicin and other drugs that treat the disease. Truenat is a novel molecular test that rapidly detects tuberculosis and rifampicin-resistance. All the three tests are run on the portable, battery-operated Truenat device and provide results in less than an hour, the bodies said in a joint statement. “Both Truenat MTB and Truenat MTB Plus (tests) detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria for TB diagnosis, while Truenat MTB-RIF Dx (test) identifies resistance to rifampicin, they said in the statement.Truenat MTB, Truenat MTB Plus  and Truenat MTB-RIF  are names of the tests endorsed by WHO.  Noting that tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide, with around 10 million cases and 1.5 million deaths in 2018, they said drug-resistant tuberculosis poses a particular challenge, with growing resistance to rifampicin and other drugs that treat the disease.“In 2018, around half-a-million new cases of rifampicin resistant TB were diagnosed. Urgent action is needed to close the gap in tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment, particularly in low-resource settings, to reach the WHO target of ending tuberculosis by 2030,” the statement said.To that end, bringing sensitive TB diagnosis and drug susceptibility testing closer to patients is a key priority for global TB control, but requires robust point-of-care diagnostic tests that are easily implementable at lower levels of the healthcare system, it said.“This is a matter of pride for ICMR, Department of Health Research (DHR), New Delhi. It was a long journey to advance indigenous diagnostic technologies for diagnosis of tuberculosis and MDR/XDR-TB. Truenat is already accepted for use under the NTEP (National TB Elimination Program) in India.“Endorsement of Truenat by WHO will enable other low-and middle-income countries to procure Truenat for diagnosis of tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance, thus supporting tuberculosis elimination in developing countries,” the statement quoting Balram Bhargava, Secretary DHR and Director General - ICMR said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-endorses-tests-by-icmr-2-others-for-tb-diagnosis-drug-resistance-detection/story-ZOqAaD45vtRRlmKTv53V4J.html
03-07-2020||India||Odisha logs 561 Covid-19 cases in 24 hours, biggest single-day spike||Odisha reported its biggest single-day surge of 561 Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours taking the total number of cases past the 8,000-mark as the state government enforced weekend shutdowns in 18 of the 30 districts from July 4.Of the 561 new cases, 425 were from quarantine centres while 136 were local cases. Ganjam, the Covid-19 hotspot district reported 283 cases, followed by 81 in Cuttack and 76 in Rayagada. Two more Covid-19 positive persons with co-morbidity conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, also died of the disease taking the death toll to 29 in the state.Health and Family Welfare department sources said of the 561 cases, 77 cases were detected from three premier hospitals - 55 from Acharya Harihar Post Graduate Institute of Cancer in Cuttack and 11 each from SCB Medical College and Hospital at Cuttack and AIIMS-Bhubaneswar. In Acharya Harihar Post Graduate Institute of Cancer, 18 patients tested coronavirus positive.In the southern district of Rayagada, 74 cases were detected from a village in Gunupur sub-division area. District collector Pramod Behera said the 74 in Bijaypur village who tested positive were infected by a 3-member family of superspreaders who had returned from Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu last month. The family then infected 13 others taking the total infection in the village to 90.As cases continued to surge in the districts despite weekend shutdowns in 11 of the districts, including Ganjam and Khurda, in June, the state government has now decided to enforce it in 18 districts that now account for 84 per cent of the total cases. The districts where weekend shutdown will be enforced in July are Ganjam, Gajapati, Cuttack, Khordha, Jharsuguda, Keonjhar, Mayurbhanj, Jajpur, Jagatsinghpur, Balasore, Rayagada, Nayagarh, Kandhamal, Bolangir, Koraput, Kendrapara, Bargarh and Dhenkanal.Any person violating the weekend shutdowns will be liable to be proceeded against as per the provisions of Section 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, besides legal action under Section 188 of the IPC and other legal provisions as applicable.In addition to the weekend shutdowns, some districts announced additional restrictions. In Dhenkanal district, known for its Shiva shrines, the collector banned entry of the devotees/Kaudias in various Shiv temples during the month of Shravan, The Koraput district allowed opening of shops and business establishments between 7 am and 2 pm. Ganjam has banned non-essential vehicular movement till July 31 as a precautionary measure to stem the rise in cases. The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation prohibited labourers belonging to hotspot states or districts from working in the industrial, construction, hotels/hospitality sector till July 31.For Odisha, the surge of cases has been a major worry as they are peaking despite lockdown and shutdowns. In Odisha, the first 1000 cases were recorded in 65 days, while the last 1000 cases were reported in just four days.The weekend shutdowns have not led to any dramatic change in the Covid-19 cases count as the month of June saw cases double in the 11 districts where shutdown was in place. In the 11 districts, the cases doubled from 2142 to 4887 during the shutdown period. On Friday, the Ganjam district administration tweeted a photo of people congregating in a place without wearing masks following which Covid spokesperson Subroto Bagchi said if any citizen neglects his/her life or other’s life, the government will be forced to take tough and bold steps.“When the night curfew started at 7 PM people used to crowd at the shops at 5 PM as if it was ‘Bali Jatra’, now even after the government relaxed the timing people are still crowding the shops in a similar manner at 7 PM.“You and I, we all have a responsibility not to put life in peril. If we continue with our irresponsible behaviour, the government will be forced to take more stringent steps than earlier, there should be no doubt in that,” said Bagchi.The Covid spokesperson said anyone with Covid-19 symptoms will be sent to Covid care centres where they will be tested, and if found positive, the persons would be shifted to Covid hospital. To find out the spread of the disease, the government has started a 45-day door-to-door surveillance programme with the help of ASHA workers.“In case the person is found negative, but has symptoms, he or she will remain in home quarantine. Trace, test and treat is the principle of this survey. Be responsible citizens and cooperate with the government,” he said on the day Odisha conducted 6851 tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-logs-561-covid-19-cases-in-24-hours-biggest-single-day-spike/story-Xq5Rt8bBZHhgD3uOnsruKO.html
03-07-2020||India||Ordinance on industries won’t hurt land rights of indigenous people, asserts Assam govt||Assam government, which has been battling perception regarding an ordinance that has allowed micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to set up industries by only submitting a self-declaration, on Friday clarified the move wouldn’t hurt the land rights of the north-east’s most-populous state’s diverse indigenous population.States industries minister Chandra Mohan Patowary stated that contrary to popular apprehensions, it wouldn’t allow setting up of industries in all categories of lands and the conversion of agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes would be off-limits.On Monday, in a bid to fast track industrialisation amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic that has roiled the state economy like in other parts of the country, Assam cabinet had allowed setting up of MSME units by submitting a self-declaration without taking any permission or clearance for a period of three years.The ordinance also allowed land for setting up industries would be “deemed converted”.The move had led to apprehensions that industrialists from outside the state would make a beeline for Assam and purchase agricultural land, which would later be converted for industrial purposes without any checks and balances, hurting the land rights of the local indigenous population.Opposition parties and several organisations had sought repeal of the ordinance at the earliest.However, the ordinance is yet to be approved by Assam Governor, Jagdish Mukhi.“This ordinance won’t affect the land rights of the state’s indigenous population, as safeguarded under the Assam Agricultural Land (Regulations of Reclassifications and Transfer for Non-Agricultural Purpose) Act, 2015,” Patowary said while addressing a press conference on Friday.“The ordinance doesn’t affect the restrictions on sale or transfer of agricultural land for non-agricultural purpose because it is protected under the Act. It won’t allow any person to buy or sell any agricultural land for the non-agricultural purpose,” he added.Patowary said the ordinance wouldn’t allow setting up of industries in restricted land like grazing reserves, wetlands, eco-sensitive zones, heritage, historical and archaeological sites, those meant for religious institutions and those falling under tribal belts and blocks.“An enterprise can’t set up industry related to hazardous products without obtaining prior permission, as mandatory under the central government laws,” Patowary said.While the ordinance allows setting up of industries without any permission, except for fire services and electricity, but on expiry of the three-year period, enterprises will be required to obtain all clearances within six months.No one would be able to sale or purchase agricultural land to set up industries, as “genuine owner” of agricultural land are allowed to set up MSME units in their own plots, the minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ordinance-on-industries-won-t-hurt-land-rights-of-indigenous-people-asserts-assam-govt/story-FcotmydXrhJvAanwmjpoxM.html
03-07-2020||India||‘Opposed Emergency even when in Congress’: Jyotiraditya Scindia||Jyotiraditya Scindia, Senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha member, on Friday said that Emergency was imposed in the country for the sake of sticking to power whereas the incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre was working for welfare of people.The BJP leader made the comments while addressing the party workers through a virtual rally across the state to mark 100 days of Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in Madhya Pradesh.Besides Scindia, union minister for agriculture Narendra Singh Tomar, chief minister Chouhan and state BJP president VD Sharma addressed the rally.“When many countries shuddered to think how to control coronavirus, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a firm decision on lockdown. On one side, there is a party which had imposed Emergency on the country to stick to power and on the other another party’s leader made an appeal to people with folded hands to comply with lockdown and 130 crore people of the country responded to his request with a positive mindset,” Scindia said comparing Congress with the NDA government at the Centre. “Many people will say that Scindiaji since you have changed the party you are talking of Emergency, but I wish to tell them I always opposed Emergency and even when I was in the Congress. What is true is true and what is wrong is wrong. At the end of the day a human being has to live with himself. If you see yourself in the mirror and find yourself a liar you will not be able to sleep comfortably,” said Scindia.The leader underscored how PM Modi’s early decision to go into lockdown proved right for the country, comparing it to other countries that witnessed heavy casualties due to coronavirus. “ He (Modi) saved thousands and lakhs of lives with the timely lockdown decision,” said Scindia. Taking a dig at his former colleague, Kamal Nath, Scindia asked if the then Congress chief minister took any steps to help check the coronavirus situation in the state. Scindia then praised Shivraj Singh Chouhan for his “single-handed” fight against the epidemic. “I wish to ask the then chief minister Kamal Nath if his government held any meeting on how to control the disease and did he visit any hospital or any poor’s house? Instead, what happened in the last 14 days of the then Congress government were appointments on various posts and he held a meeting on IIFA award function instead of Corona. He had no funds for fighting Covid-19 but had Rs 700 crore for the IIFA award function,” Scindia alleged.Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar praised Scindia for backing Centre’s decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status even while he was in the Congress. “Scindia ji appreciated the central government’s decision on Article 370 even when he was in Opposition. He raised several issues concerning people in Madhya Pradesh but the then Congress government was arrogant enough not to address his concern. In 2018, BJP could have formed its government by causing a defection but our principles didn’t allow us to do so,” said Tomar.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan again targeted Kamal Nath for not taking any steps to control coronavirus in the state.“The government has come to know that moneylenders fleeced people during Covid situation. A law would be enacted so that people from weaker sections of society and tribals don’t have to repay loans taken from such moneylenders who don’t have a licence for the business and are authorised to take back their valuables they have pledged with moneylenders,” said Chouhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposed-emergency-even-when-in-congress-jyotiraditya-scindia/story-1TsMt8P8Bx6MuFaWc3Sa4J.html
03-07-2020||India||4.7 magnitude earthquake jolts Delhi-NCR, epicentre near Gurugram||Delhi-NCR experienced an earthquake of the magnitude of 4.7 on the Richter Scale on Friday evening at 7 pm. The epicentre of the quake was 60 km south southwest of Gurugram in Haryana, according to the National Centre of Seisomology.The tremors were felt for a few seconds. There has been no report of any damage to life or property so far.It was the seventeenth quake to occur in the region in the last two months.Delhi witnessed the last earthquake on June 8, measuring about 2.1 on the Richter scale.The series of earthquakes or tremors have sparked concerns that a bigger quake could strike the national capital region. Seismologists say the increased frequency does not necessarily imply that a major one may be in the offing but emphasize that monitoring the tremors is the key to being prepared. Unlike many other natural disasters, earthquakes cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tremors-felt-across-delhi-ncr/story-n7bbG4iGPSJ5mmWlg2U9HO.html

03-07-2020||India||At $500 billion, India has world’s fifth-largest foreign exchange reserves||India has accumulated the world’s fifth-largest foreign exchange reserves at more than $500 billion, making it a bright spot in an otherwise dismal economy.The reserves were bolstered by a rare current-account surplus in the first quarter, a return of inflows into the local stock market and foreign direct investment, including into a unit of Reliance Industries Ltd., India’s largest company by revenue. That allowed the central bank to mop up close to $25 billion in foreign exchange to add to its reserves in the quarter through June, according to analysts such as Anubhuti Sahay, chief India economist at Standard Chartered Plc in Mumbai.A strong reserve buffer is a cushion against market volatility, and gives foreign investors and credit rating companies added comfort that the government can meet its debt obligations despite a deteriorating fiscal outlook and the economy’s first likely contraction in more than four decades.Here is a deeper look at India’s external finances:Bigger PileThe level of reserves is enough to cover 13 months of imports and is equivalent to nearly a fifth of the country’s gross domestic product. It’s also the fifth-largest in the world after China, Japan, Switzerland and Russia, according to the International Monetary Fund. Data from the central bank on Friday showed reserves were at $506.8 billion as of June 26.“FX reserves are more than sufficient on the adequacy metrics,” said Samiran Chakraborty, chief India economist at Citigroup Inc. in Mumbai, noting that the last five-year average was 11-months cover. “Short-term debt would be around 20% of FX reserves, and even volatile capital flows have likely dropped to below 80% of reserves,” he said.Falling ImportsIndia’s trade gap narrowed to a 13-year low in May, as imports declined faster than exports. While the contraction reduces the need for dollars to fund purchases for now, it does highlight a worrying trend -- that demand in the economy has been hit hard amid one of the world’s strictest pandemic lockdowns. As a growing and emerging market economy, India needs to import capital goods and machinery to keep its industrial sector humming. Cheaper oil also helped lower the import bill.On BalanceIndia’s current account, the broadest measure of trade in goods and services, is likely to remain in surplus in the April-June period, but a recovery in imports might tilt the balance for the full year.“Improvement in economic activity over next few quarters is likely to push the current account back into deficit,” said Standard Chartered’s Sahay. “Lower commodity prices and weak global demand are likely to negatively affect remittances inflows and services exports, weighing further on the current account balance.”Capital FlowsAfter outflows in March amid a global market sell-off, foreign investment into Indian stocks have picked up in the past two months as risk appetite returned. In addition, inflows have increased with the sale of stakes in blue-chip companies like Reliance, which divested from its Jio digital platform, and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. Net FDI flows made up 51.7% of total capital flows in the year ended March 31, according to Deutsche Bank AG.“We expect similar trend in FY21 as well, with net FDI flows likely to account for nearly 65% of total capital inflows,” said Kaushik Das, chief India economist at Deutsche Bank in Mumbai.External DebtData from the central bank show India’s external debt rose to $558.5 billion as of March 2020 from $474.4 billion five years ago. While the level has gone up, the ratio of foreign exchange reserves to overall debt has also risen to 85.5% from 72% in 2015.The level of debt that foreigners are likely to hold, including sovereign bonds, is likely to go up as India works to open its debt market to non-residents. The country is aiming for a 7% weighting in indexes tracked by global investors, with an inclusion likely to attract billions of dollars at a time when public finances are deteriorating.“The government intends to open up more to foreign capital in the next few years as a source of deficit financing, but foreign investors’ tolerance for government debt at current levels, with a significantly larger portion of external debt, remains to be tested,” Fitch Ratings Ltd. wrote in a recent report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-500-billion-india-has-world-s-fifth-largest-foreign-exchange-reserves/story-b1hQZrxpAVYidGzhLrIK8I.html
03-07-2020||India||‘Do judges want to run govt?’: Andhra Pradesh speaker kicks up a row||Andhra Pradesh state assembly speaker Tammineni Sitaram has triggered a controversy by accusing the judiciary of interfering in the policy decisions of the popularly elected state government.“If the court can decide as to what the state government should do, what is the purpose of elections, why should people elect MLAs and MPs, why should the chief minister be there to rule, why is there an assembly and a speaker? Do the judges want to directly run the government and rule the state from court halls?” the assembly speaker told reporters after having darshan of Lord Venkateswara in Tiurupati.Sitaram’s comments come in the wake of a series of judgments by the state high court in the recent past that went against the Jagan Mohan Reddy-led YSR Congress Party government.The judgments range from ordering a CBI probe into the assault on a Dalit doctor, reinstatement of retired IAS officer Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar as state election commissioner, removal of YSRCP colours on the government buildings and striking down the suspension of former state intelligence chief AB Venkateshwar Rao.“We have seen some judgments from the courts in the recent past. The Constitution of India has enunciated certain duties, responsibilities and powers to legislature, executive and judiciary and indicated that they should not interfere into each other’s functioning. Yet, the courts are directly trespassing the powers of the popularly elected government,” Sitaram said.The state speaker questioned how the courts could direct the state government to take or not to take decisions. “The authors of the Constitution would not have expected that such a situation would arise in future. Otherwise, they would have suggested some way out,” he said, adding that the intellectuals should debate on the recent court decisions dictating terms to the government.If the governments did something wrong, the speaker continued, the people who voted a party to the power would defeat it in the next elections. “We have to respect the people’s mandate. The governments will run in tune with the people’s aspirations,” he said.Senior TDP leader and Rajya Sabha member Kanakamedala Ravindra Kumar on Friday said it was not correct on the part of the assembly speaker to attack the courts just because they delivered judgments against the government.“If power goes to one’s head, one would only find fault with the judiciary and Constitution. Sitaram should make it clear whether he had made the comments in the capacity of the assembly speaker of the YSR Congress Party member,” he said.Kumar said the Supreme Court had made it clear several times in the past that the governments, irrespective of the majority they have in the legislature, should function within the limits of the Constitution.“The courts will definitely interfere, if the governments take decisions in violation of the Constitution. The judiciary has the powers to review the government’s decisions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/do-judges-want-to-run-govt-andhra-pradesh-speaker-kicks-up-a-row/story-rG2t6mL5MXm1D6jpbDPwLM.html

It attributed the development to the technology advisor to the DRDO chairman.Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is India’s largest hospital erected temporarily on the south Delhi premises of a religious organization with the capacity to house and treat 10,000 coronavirus patients at the same time.The makeshift facility, operationalised recently, is set up in a 1755 sqft by 703 sqft area and is roughly the size of 20 football fields combined. The hospital is being managed by medical experts from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) following a request by the union home ministry. While ITBP is the nodal agency to operate the Chhattarpur facility, the Delhi government is pitching in with administrative support. Volunteers from the religious sect of Radha Soami Beas have also been roped in to run the treatment centre.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe development comes on a day when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on a day long visit to Leh in Ladakh, where 20 army soldiers were martyred in clashes with Chinese forces that were seeking to alter the status quo on the Line Of Actual control (LAC).

03-07-2020||India||Sonia writes to PM on denial of reservation to OBCs in state medical colleges||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, expressing concern over the denial of the reservation to candidates from the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) under the All India Quota in state-run medical colleges.The quota is filled through the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) in medical education institutions in states and union territories (UTs).Under the All India Quota, 15%, 7.5%, and 10% seats are reserved for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and economically weaker section (EWS) candidates, respectively, in both central and state-run medical colleges.However, at present, the reservation for OBC candidates under the quota is restricted only to central institutions.On May 11, a controversy erupted, when the All India Federation of Other Backward Classes Employees’ Welfare Association wrote to the National Commission of Backward Classes (NCBC), claiming that OBC candidates have been denied reservations under the All India Quota both in undergraduate and postgraduate courses since 2017.Gandhi quoted the data compiled by the federation to claim that OBC candidates lost over 11,000 seats, in All India Quota, due to non-implementation of OBC reservations in medical colleges in states and UTs.“Denial of reservations to OBCs in state medical institutions in All India Quota, being administered by the central government, violates the very objective of the 93rd Constitutional Amendment and is a barrier to access medical education for deserving OBC candidates,” the Congress chief wrote in the letter.The 93rd Constitutional Amendment has special provisions for the admission of socially and educationally backward classes, or for the SCs, or the STs in educational institutions, including private ones, whether aided or unaided by the state, other than the minority institutions.“In the interest of equity and social justice, I strongly urge the Union government to extend the reservation for OBC candidates in All India Quota of medical and dental seats, even in medical education institutions in states and UTs,” Gandhi said.The issue took a political turn when the Congress; the Communist Party of India (Marxist), CPI (M), the Communist Party of India (CPI); the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) moved the Supreme Court (SC) in June, challenging the Centre’s decision not to grant 50% reservation to OBCs as per Tamil Nadu law in medical seats surrendered by the state in the All India Quota for undergraduate, postgraduate and dental courses for the academic session 2020-21.The SC had refused to entertain their pleas and instead asked them to approach the Madras high court in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-writes-to-pm-on-denial-of-reservation-to-obcs-in-state-medical-colleges/story-zbcfBh97r9Ap2nvgRV4ZdJ.html

Akhilesh Yadav, national president, SP, described the incident as unfortunate, as he paid tributes to the police personnel, who were killed in the line of duty.“This is the most shameful incident in UP, where duty-bound police personnel paid the price with their lives for the nexus between criminals and people in power. The criminals should be caught alive and the state government must be exposed,” Yadav tweeted in Hindi.The SP leader also demanded Rs 1 crore compensation for the next of kin of each of the slain police personnel. Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra, Congress’s general secretary and in-charge of UP, tweeted, urging stern action against the criminals.“My condolences to the families of the martyred policemen. Law and order situation in UP has worsened, criminals have become fearless, while the public and the police are feeling unsafe. The chief minister himself holds the charge of the home department. He should take stern action after such a horrific incident,” Priyanka Gandhi tweeted.Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi tweeted in Hindi and asked the UP government: “Here is another evidence of ‘Gunda Raj’ in UP. When police are unsafe, how can the public feel safe?”BSP chief Mayawati, in her tweet, called the incident “sad, shameful, and unfortunate”. “It is clear that the UP government needs to be more alert and prepared, especially in the matter of law and order,” Mayawati tweeted in Hindi.“The government must not spare the criminals, at any cost, in such a sensational incident even if it requires a special operation. The BSP demands that the state government must pay appropriate ex-gratia to the families of the policemen as well as a government job to a member of the family of slain cops,” she tweeted.Deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Devendra Mishra, sub-inspectors Mahesh Yadav, who was the station officer of Shivrajpur police station, Anup Kumar, Babulal and constables Sultan Singh, Rahul, Jitendra, and Babloo died in the firing during a raid to nab gangster Dubey late at night on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kanpur-encounter-opposition-parties-slam-yogi-adityanath-govt-over-law-and-order-situation/story-vRy4p69YuyA9uE0jpobpHP.html

03-07-2020||India||UP Congress leaders want Priyanka Gandhi to shift base to Lucknow||Congress leaders from Uttar Pradesh (UP) on Friday urged party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra to shift base from the national capital to Lucknow in a bid to strengthen the organisation ahead of the assembly polls, due in another two years.The plea was made two days after the Centre asked Priyanka Gandhi to vacate her government accommodation in Delhi within a month.Pradeep Mathur, former Congress legislative party (CLP) leader in UP, said her presence in the state would not only help strengthen the party, but would also unnerve the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“Our rivals are already afraid of her. She has rattled them. You can see that from the reactions of BJP leaders, including Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and also Mayawatiji. They are all suffering from Priyanka Gandhi phobia,” Mathur added.UP, the key battleground state that sends the maximum number of lawmakers to Lok Sabha at 80, is also caught between an ongoing political slugfest between Priyanka Gandhi and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati.Last week, Priyanka Gandhi called Mayawati an “undeclared BJP spokesperson”. Earlier, the BSP had hit back at her over her offer to ferry stranded migrant workers by buses to their native places across UP as nothing but a“political ploy”.“If Priyankaji comes to live in Lucknow, it’ll boost our party workers’morale and strengthen our organisation base,” said Gaurav Kapoor, a party leader from UP. “She has been working tirelessly for the uplift of marginalized sections in UP: whether her visit to Umbha village to arranging buses to ferry stranded migrant workers back to their native places. Personally, for young leaders like me, this will come as a big shot in the arm, as we get emboldened to challenge the ruling BJP in the run-up to the 2022 assembly elections,” he added.Congress leaders, who are perceived to be close to Priyanka Gandhi, said she stays at close relative and former Union minister Sheila Kaul’s residence in Lucknow, whenever she visits UP.The house at Gokhale Marg in Lucknow was “refurbished” last October to enable her to stay there for a longer duration, said a leader familiar with the development.“She doesn’t need to look for a house in Lucknow. However, she needs to take a call whether she wants to shift her base to Lucknow permanently,” he added.UP Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu also remained non-committal about her Lucknow plans.“It would be too soon to say if she would stay in Lucknow permanently,” he told media persons.UP Congress leaders have been urging Priyanka Gandhi to spend more time in the state for better management of organisational matters after she took charge as the party general secretary in January 2019.They have been pressing her, citing her easy accessibility helped in galvanising the party workers.Her aides, however, categorically said that she would stay on in Delhi because her family is based here. “She is looking after eastern UP from Lucknow, and the state’s western part can be managed from Delhi,” an aide said.Besides, she still has around a month to look for a house in Delhi since the eviction notice was served on her on Wednesday, the aide added.Congress functionaries also said they were expecting such a move from the government after the withdrawal of the Special Protection Group (SPG) cover to her and other members of the Gandhi family last year.“This didn’t come as a surprise to us,” said a central leader.Earlier in March and ahead of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak in the country, Congress leaders from Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh had proposed to send Priyanka Gandhi to the Rajya Sabha from their respective states, but she had declined the offer. Then, she had insisted on strengthening the party organisation in UP, added the central leader quoted above.The Congress is struggling to make headway in UP after its decimation in 2017 assembly polls and followed by a rout in the parliamentary elections last year.The Congress had always dominated UP politics till the BJP emerged as a potent force over the twin issues of Mandal Commission and Ram Mandir in Ayodhya in the late 1980s. The party has been relegated to the margins over the past three decades. It even lost its traditional bastion Amethi in last parliamentary elections, as contender BJP’s Smriti Irani vanquished former party president Rahul Gandhi.Priyanka Gandhi, considered as a party’s trump card in UP, has her work cut out, as she seeks to galvanise the party workers and also win back the support of the communities that have shifted their loyalties to other parties amid the Congress’s dwindling fortunes through the years.Lok Sabha member Karti Chidambaram has demanded that Priyanka Gandhi be declared the party’s CM candidate for UP for the 2022 polls and suggested that she should be primarily based in Lucknow to lead from the front.“The path for a national revival of the Congress is via UP. The clearest statement of intent will be to declare Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra as the CM candidate of the Congress in UP. PGV must be primarily based in Lucknow and lead the charge,” he has tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-congress-leaders-want-priyanka-gandhi-to-shift-base-to-lucknow/story-xMdpyuBCFaTJ3FGh1Vz8wJ.html

There is blood on the streets every day and there is loss of innocent lives. Despite demonetisation, there is no respite from terror activities and circulation of fake currency notes, which was touted as a big challenge for the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA),” said an editorial in Sena’s mouthpiece Saamana, a Marathi daily. The editorial said civilians are being targeted by terrorists with impunity.Referring to an incident in Sopore, north Kashmir, on Wednesday where a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawan and a civilian were killed by terrorists, the Sena said that the picture of a three-year-old infant sitting near the body of his slain grandfather is reminiscent of conflict-hit Syria and Afghanistan.It blamed the government for the spiralling violence in Kashmir Valley while claiming that the tragic picture has hurt the country’s image on the global stage.“The little boy was trying to wake up his slain grandfather... Some Central ministers tweeted this picture. These ministers should understand that the picture underscores the Central government’s failure. The onus is on the government regarding improving the security situation in the Kashmir Valley. Such pictures are similar to conflict-hit nations like Syria, Egypt, Somalia, and Afghanistan and are doing no good to the country’s image on a global stage,” it said.The Sena slammed the government and Amit Shah, in particular, for his inability to rein in the violence in the Kashmir Valley, which the party claimed has spiked since he took charge of the MHA.“Infiltration has increased in the last six months. Though our jawans have killed many terrorists in the past few months, the number of our jawans getting martyred is no less. It is said that there are about 170 active terrorists in the Valley,” it added.The Sena reminded the government that despite repealing of Article 370, the ghar wapasi, or homecoming, of Kashmiri Pandits, remained a distant dream.It also cited the killing of a Kashmiri sarpanch, Ajay Pandita, in south Kashmir’s Anantnag district in June, as a case in point.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-change-in-jammu-and-kashmir-situation-despite-demonetisation-article-370-move-shiv-sena/story-HXPyAhXMfO7m7AANLIqYnL.html

No party should engage in any action that may complicate the situation at this point,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, said at the regular ministry briefing on Friday.Modi, during his Ladakh visit, was accompanied by chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat and Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane.Watch: China responds to PM Narendra Modi’s Ladakh visit The PM toured one of the forward locations in Nimu where he interacted with personnel of the Army, Air Force and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP).Modi’s visit to the border is being closely monitored in China as New Delhi begins a calibrated response – including economic steps - after 20 Indian army soldiers were killed in eastern Ladakh in a violent clash with People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops on June 15. An unspecified number of Chinese soldiers also died in the clash.Asked about India planning to ban Chinese companies from building roads in the country, Zhao said New Delhi should focus on “common interests in bilateral relations”.“Certain politicians in India have been issuing remarks that are detrimental to our bilateral relations. Our bilateral relations need to be held with the concerted efforts, Indian side should work with us towards the same goal, to uphold the general picture of our common interests in bilateral relations,” Zhao added.“Setting artificial blocks to our concrete and practical cooperation will also harm India’s interest. We will take necessary measures to uphold legitimate rights of Chinese businesses in India,” Zhao said. Zhao sidestepped a question about New Delhi’s security-related concerns that prompted it to ban 59 Chinese mobile apps on Monday.“…we should also be aware that India and China are major developing countries, accelerating the renewal and development are historical missions for both of us. To this end we have to respect and support each other. This is also in the long-term interest of both sides,” he said.“If we show misgiving and engage in conflicts, this is not the right way and also go against the shared aspiration of our people. So, we have to follow the consensus reached between the leaders of our two countries, and proceed from the overall picture of our bilateral relations.”“The Indian side should not have strategic miscalculation on China. We hope it will work with China to uphold the overall picture of our bilateral relations,” Zhao added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-party-should-escalate-border-tension-china-after-pm-s-ladakh-visit/story-paQWsjGSrsrEuPL5V5zpsK.html
03-07-2020||India||Top 10 quotes from PM Modi’s address to soldiers of Indian Army in Ladakh||Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the soldiers of the Indian Army deployed in the eastern Ladakh sector along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China on Friday and paid glowing tribute to their valour while delivering a strong message to China by recounting India’s history of repulsing attacks by ‘invaders’. Here are the top 10 quotes by PM Modi1. “Your bravery and your dedication to safeguard mother India’s honour is not comparable. Your endurance is not inferior to anyone in the world. No one in the world can compete with the tough situations and the heights you embrace while serving mother India. Your courage is taller than the heights you are deployed in. Your resolve is stronger than the valleys you walk every day and your arms are as strong as the rocks that surround you. The strength of your will is indomitable like the mountains around you. I can feel it and see it today, as I am amongst you.”2. “The knowledge that the country’s security is in your hands and is protected by your strong resolve offers reassurance not just to me but to the entire country, which has unflinching faith in you. The fact that you are guarding the borders, serves as an inspiration for the fellow countrymen to work day and night for the motherland. The resolve of ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ becomes stronger because of you, your sacrifices and bravery.”3. “The bravery that you and your compatriots have shown recently, has sent a message to the world about India’s strength. I am looking at women soldiers in front of me. In the battlefield, at the border, this view is inspiring.”4. “I use my voice today, as was once said by national poet Ramdhari Singh Dinkar, to speak of your bravery and to salute you. I again offer my tribute to soldiers who were martyred in the Galwan Valley. The bravado and the lion-like roar of these braves has made even the earth speak of their valour. Every countrymen’s head bows with respect before your bravery. Every Indian citizen’s chest swells with pride because of your bravery. This earth is full of tales of your gallantry. The bravery of 14 Corps is being talked about everywhere. The world has seen your courage and the tales of your bravery and fortitude are echoing in every house in the country.”5. “Bharat Mata’s enemies have seen your fire and fury. Friends, this part of Ladakh is India’s symbolic head and it represents the prestige and pride of 130 crore Indians. This land belongs to the braves that worship mother India and are ever ready to sacrifice their all for her. “‘The enemy has seen your fire and fury as well’: PM Modi in address to soldiers in Ladakh6. “This earth belongs to the brave. I can see your ability and your resolve in your eyes and on your face. You are the brave soldiers of the same land that has repulsed attacks by several invaders and tyrants for thousands of years. We are the same people who pray to the flute playing Lord Krishna but we are also the same people who idolise and follow the ‘Sudarshana Chakra’ carrying lord Krishna.”7. “India has emerged stronger after every such attack. The world recognises that peace and friendship are very important for the growth of any country or of humanity, but we also know that those who are weak can never initiate peace. Bravery is a prerequisite for peace.”8. “India is increasing its strength in all three realms of water, air and land guided by the principle of the wellbeing of the entire mankind. When India is developing modern weaponry and bringing the latest technology for its armed forces, then the message behind is driven by the well being of humanity.”‘Leading from the front’: Top ministers hail PM Modi’s surprise Ladakh visit9. “Whether World Wars or peace, whenever the need arises, the world has seen the victory of our braves and their efforts towards peace. We have worked for the betterment of humanity. All of you are leaders establishing this tradition of the country.”10. Age of expansionism is over, now, is the age of development. The policy of development is the foundation of mankind and is the only policy relevant today. History has witnessed that the expansionist policy has hurt humanity the most. Expansionist policy has always threatened world peace. History has witnessed that such forces have either lost or were forced to turn back. This is what the world has experienced so far and it has once again made up its mind against the policy of expansion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-10-quotes-from-pm-modi-s-address-to-soldiers-of-indian-army-in-ladakh/story-rxh3RmtJAG7jpDD2CSnaKO.html

As relations worsened following the Indian government’s decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status last August, troops along the LoC have repeatedly exchanged fire.New Delhi recently asked Islamabad to reduce the strength of its mission in the Indian capital by 50% on the ground that its officials were allegedly engaging in espionage and backing terror activities. India also carried out a similar reduction of its staff at the high commission in Pakistan. Diplomats and their family members returned home via the Wagah-Attari land border on June 30.Bilateral ties hit another low when Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan alleged on Tuesday that New Delhi was behind a terror attack on the Karachi stock exchange building this week that left four security personnel dead. All four attackers were also killed.India hit back on Thursday, dismissing Khan’s accusation as “absurd” and saying Pakistan can’t shift the blame for its domestic problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-lodges-protest-with-pakistan-for-more-than-2-400-ceasefire-violations-on-loc/story-bw1ezLhfsXqNuOan0nvFHJ.html

The earlier order said the ban would be in place till July 15.The decision comes even as capacity on domestic routes has been increased to 45% from the earlier 33%.On Thursday, chairman of Airports Authority of India (AAI) had said India is in talks with the US and Canada and the countries in European and Gulf regions on establishing individual bilateral bubbles which will allow airlines of each country in the pact to operate international flights.“I am sure there would be a positive outcome of the talks with the US, Canada and with the Gulf countries and the negotiations are going on,” Arvind Singh had said yesterday.Scheduled international passenger flights have remained suspended in India since March 23 due to the coronavirus pandemic.Aviation minister Hardeep Puri had on June 20 said the government will start thinking on the resumption of international passenger flights in mid-July, when it expects the domestic air traffic to reach 50-55% of the levels before the coronavirus. The minister had also said that resumption of international flights will also depend on demand and other countries being open to receiving flights amid the Covid-19 pandemic.International flight movement in countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, China, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates now varies between 3% and 18% of their earlier flight capacity, the minister had said.Giving details the minister said, entry is conditional in the US, UK, France, China, UAE and Singapore. “You cannot have normal civil aviation operations under such conditions,” he had said.Puri added that in the absence of a decision on resumption of international flights, India is left with no option but to continue “evacuation and repatriation” flights under the Vande Bharat Mission.

03-07-2020||India||Monsoon session of Goa Assembly likely to be curtailed to single sitting due to Covid-19||Goa Speaker Rajesh Patnekar has decided to curtail the upcoming monsoon session of the Goa Legislative Assembly to a single-day affair for a vote-on-account ordinance, which gives a government the permission to spend money to meet its expenditures, and a longer lawmaking proceeding could be planned later when the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak subsides.An all-party informal meeting was held on Friday to take a call in this regard.“The Speaker had called a meeting seeking all the parties” suggestions. It was decided that the monsoon session will be reduced to a one-day affair because of the Covid-19 outbreak. Business Advisory Committee (BAC) will decide on the day’s business in the House,” said Chief Minister Pramod Sawant after the meeting. Digambar Kamat, Leader of Opposition and former CM, said his party (the Congress) has also concurred with Speaker Patnekar that the assembly session should be curtailed because of the spike in Covid-19 positive cases in the state.“Friday’s meeting was an informal meeting called by the Speaker. There were discussions on various aspects. It has been decided to curtail the monsoon session to a day after reviewing the prevailing situation regarding the Covid-19 outbreak in the state,” Kamat said.Earlier, Goa Governor Satya Pal Malik on the advice of Speaker Patnekar had convened a two-week-long monsoon session of the assembly, starting July 27.However, there has been a growing consensus among political parties to reduce the monsoon session – usually the longest – after Goa reported around 1,500 Covid-19 positive cases within five weeks and also four deaths related to the viral infection.The deployment of police personnel, the involvement of government officials and several other department employees go into the holding an assembly session, where strict adherence to social distancing norms is not always possible.However, the opposition is wary that a curtailed monsoon session will come to the government’s rescue, as it could escape from being grilled for the alleged mishandling of the Covid-19 outbreak.“We have recommended a virtual monsoon session of the assembly. But we don’t even have an infrastructure to hold an e-assembly,” said Vijai Sardesai, a leader of the Goa Forward Party, a local opposition outfit.He alleged that the Goa government was slow on its uptake to recognise the health hazards posed by Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-session-of-goa-assembly-likely-to-be-curtailed-to-single-sitting/story-flU2ZLsGImDieqXv3rLkfK.html

PM says: Nobody took our land. Obviously, someone is lying,” tweeted the Congress leader, tagging a short video clip of people from the region alleging that China has come into Indian territory. Ladakhis say:China took our land. PM says:Nobody took our land. Obviously, someone is lying. pic.twitter.com/kWNQQhjlY7Titled ‘Ladakh Speaks’, the video had people across the divide alleging China has ingressed into Ladakh. The clip ends asking “Why is the PM silent?”.In one of his earlier tweets, Rahul Gandhi played upon the word surrender to take a swipe at the PM, calling him “Surender Modi”, and alleging that China has been building its presence along the LAC. In an address to soldiers in Ladakh, designed to send a message to China, PM Modi underscored that India had always pursued the path of peace in the world and said the weak can never initiate peace. Bravery and courage is a prerequisite for peace, he added.“The enemy has seen your fire and fury as well,’ PM Modi told the soldiers. The PM also referred to the violent clash between soldiers of India and China at Galwan on June 15 and paid his tributes to 20 soldiers who laid down their lives for the country. “You have given a befitting reply to people who attempted to conquer,” he said.Without naming China, that has been trying to encroach into Indian territory in Galwan valley and Pangong Tso and create new boundary disputes, PM Modi said the era of expansionism was over.

Addressing soldiers deployed in Ladakh, PM Modi said tales about their valour were being spoken in every house across the country.‘The enemy has seen your fire and fury as well,’ PM Modi told the soldiers in an address telecast live from Ladakh to the country. PM Modi also referred to the violent clash between soldiers of India and China at Galwan on 15 June and paid his tributes to soldiers who laid down their lives.“From Leh, Ladakh to Siachen and Kargil...and Galwan’s icy waters...every mountain, every peak is witness to the valour of Indian soldiers,” PM Modi said. “You have given a befitting reply to people who attempted to conquer,” he told them before going on to deliver his direct message to China.

The expansionist policies of some countries had affected world peace, he said, a clear reference to China that has disputes with 21 of its neighbours.But history records that expansionist forces have either lost or were forced to turn back, PM Modi said, delivering his final shot before wrapping up his surprise visit. PM Modi’s office had finalised the day-trip to Ladakh late last evening but kept it a closely-guarded secret till the last moment.News of the visit got out sometime after he landed at Leh’s airport, a height of over 11,000 feet with rarefied atmosphere, dry air and ultra-violet rays from the sun in the cold desert.PM Modi, 69, headed straight for his briefing by top military commanders at the XIV Corps headquarters at Nimu outside Leh. He had had similar briefings back in Delhi also.This time, PM Modi could see the Zanskar and the mighty Karakorams that he had been spotting on the maps during the briefings. He also interacted with the soldiers to give them pep talks and hear their perspectives before he came around to delivering his speech.His arrival in Leh had already delivered the first set of messages to Beijing. It also contrasts India’s approach to the standoffs along the Line of Actual Control to Chinese leadership’s efforts to signal a hands-off approach.Also Read: India sends high-powered boats to match heavier Chinese vessels to patrol Ladakh lakeThe PM’s visit is also a very strong message to President Xi Jinping that either he gets his aggressive Western Theatre Commander Zhao Zongqi to restore status quo ante or accept the inevitable consequences of PLA escalation. The Indian Army and Chinese PLA are locked up at four points on the LAC in East Ladakh with the latter consolidating on ground while mouthing peace overtures.The location at Nimu where PM Modi addressed soldiers from the army, air force, ITBP and border road organisation resembled an active forward base. “There were artillery guns and other heavy equipment all under camouflage with soldiers wearing helmets and sitting in trenches and other kinds of dug out positions with a rare glint of courage on their faces,” a top military commander said.Referring to some veterans who taunted that Nimu is a picnic spot, the commander said it was “a picnic spot for those who have treated their tenures as picnics instead of doing serious soldiering. For them even Kargil and Pangong Tso are picnic spots. If only they had treated these locations as future combat zones, they would not dare to comment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-the-era-for-expansionism-pm-modi-s-harsh-message-to-china-from-ladakh/story-7z2PBdUNrUtFvK0CXa8LxI.html

03-07-2020||India||Japan opposes any ‘unilateral attempt to change status quo’ on LAC||Japan on Friday backed India in its border standoff with China, saying it opposes any “unilateral attempt to change the status quo” on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), even as New Delhi stepped up diplomatic efforts to gain support from its partners in the world community.Japanese ambassador Satoshi Suzuki tweeted about his country’s support following a conversation with India’s foreign secretary Harsh Shringla. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Shringla had also briefed either the envoys or his counterparts from the US, Russia, France and Germany earlier.Suzuki’s remarks came after several meetings at the diplomatic and military levels between India and China failed to break the impasse along the LAC and even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi toured the Ladakh sector to meet troops and to assess the situation.The Japanese envoy also backed the Indian government’s efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution of the standoff that became public in May.“Had a good talk with FS Shringla. Appreciated his briefing on the situation along LAC, including GOI’s policy to pursue peaceful resolution. Japan also hopes for peaceful resolution through dialogues. Japan opposes any unilateral attempts to change the status quo,” Suzuki tweeted.In recent weeks, Shringla has held virtual consultations with his Germany counterpart Miguel Berger on June 26 and with his French counterpart François Delattre on June 29. The situation along the LAC and the build-up of Chinese troops had figured in these discussions that focused on the regional and global situations, the people cited above said.Shringla has also briefed the US and Russia on the border standoff. Russia was among the first of India’s strategic partners to be taken into confidence when Shringla met Russian ambassador Nikolay Kudashev on June 2. Following the violent face-off with Chinese troops in Ladakh sector on June 15 that left 20 Indian soldiers dead, US ambassador Kenneth Juster conveyed his condolences to “the families of the soldiers who were lost at Galwan” and said their “bravery and courage will not be forgotten”. On June 19, the Japanese ambassador too had conveyed his country’s condolences to the Indian people and the families of the 20 Indian soldiers who “lost their lives in the line of duty at Galwan Valley”.Amid the border tensions, training vessels of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force conducted a minor exercise with two Indian warships in the Indian Ocean on June 27. The deputy chief of the Japanese mission in New Delhi, Toshihide Ando, said this was the 15th exercise between the two sides in three years.“This is a goodwill training to promote mutual understanding and trust with the Indian Navy,” he said. “The content of this exercise is tactical and communications training with no specific scenario.”At the height of the 2017 India-China standoff at Doklam, Suzuki’s predecessor Kenji Hiramatsu had also strongly backed New Delhi’s position on the matter and said no country should use force to alter the status of Doklam, located at the tri-junction of India, Bhutan and Tibet.At the time, Japan was the first country to back India’s position on the standoff, which ended after 73 days.Japan too has been having its own problems with China over the disputed Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. On Friday, Japan strongly protested to China about the intrusion by two China Coast Guard ships into its territorial waters near the islands.The two Chinese vessels entered Japanese waters on Thursday evening and remained in the area, which is administered by Japan but claimed by China. Chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said, “We will continue to deal with the matter calmly and resolutely.”This was the first time since June 22 that a Chinese ship had entered Japanese territorial waters around the Islands. China sent its ships to waters around the islands for 80 days in a row, the longest streak since Japan put them under state control in September 2012.Experts said India’s diplomatic outreach to its partners in the world community was intended to send out a message to China that its behaviour wasn’t acceptable.Nitin Pai, director of The Takshashila Institution, said: “These conversations have followed the outcome of the military level talks with China. It was important to take the dialogue with the Chinese to this point and then bring in the international community, otherwise these diplomatic conversations would have been out of sync.“These conversations convey a sense of solidarity and that India’s partners also accept that China is out of place.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/japan-opposes-any-unilateral-attempt-to-change-status-quo-on-lac/story-9MsaeUySCW9dIQ4d9dMhIL.html

03-07-2020||India||PM Modi on Ladakh front with strong message to protect border from China’s PLA||For an average healthy human, it takes at least two days to acclimatize to Leh’s height of over 11,000 feet with rarefied atmosphere, dry air and ultra-violet rays from a blazing sun in cold desert Ladakh. But 69-year old Prime Minister Narendra Modi today defied physical odds when he landed up at Kushok Bakula Rimpochee airport at Leh to be briefed about operational preparedness of the Indian military against the aggressive Chinese People’s Liberation Army.Accompanied by Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat and Army Chief Manoj Mukund Naravane, Prime Minister went straight to XIV Corps headquarters at Nimu outside Leh to understand the Chinese belligerence in Ladakh with Corps Commander Lt Gen Harinder Singh briefing Narendra Modi in presence of Northern Army Commander Lt Gen Y K Joshi.Also Read: PM Modi wraps up Ladakh visit with a swipe at China, says times have changedThe decision of PM Modi to go to Leh was kept under wraps till he landed at the airport with the entire coordination done by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Rawat and Naravane. Doval, who came out of self-imposed isolation after two weeks, chose to remain back in Delhi.The presence of PM Modi in the Ladakh region has not only sent a huge signal to China that India means business and will not surrender even an inch of its territory but also to the local population with the head of government coming down to reassure them.Also Read: PM Modi, President Putin vow to strengthen Indo-Russia ties, discuss Covid-19 crisisThe PM’s visit is also a very strong message to President Xi Jinping that either he gets his aggressive Western Theatre Commander Zhao Zongqi to restore status quo ante or accept the inevitable consequences of PLA escalation. The Indian Army and Chinese PLA are locked up at four points on the LAC in East Ladakh with the latter consolidating on ground while mouthing peace overtures.Flanked by Gen Rawat and Gen Naravane, the PM has also assured the country that India is quite capable of handling China, which has created both health and security problems for the globe with corona virus from Wuhan and pre-meditated confrontation with India, ASEAN and Australia.It is understood that PM Modi will give a clear message to the Ladakh commanders that they should not initiate any escalation from their side but also retaliate to any aggression. The same message was also given out during the 2017 Doklam crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-on-ladakh-front-with-strong-message-to-protect-border-from-chinese-pla/story-nd4Pdko69D5M6gQh46GWMI.html

The state government is worried about the fresh cases of viral outbreak, especially among the frontline healthcare workers battling the pandemic.State government officials said of the 77 new Covid-19 positive cases, 55 were reported from Acharya Harihar Regional Cancer Centre in Cuttack; 11 each from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bhubaneswar; and SCB Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack. In Rourkela’s Ispat General Hospital, a patient, who was undergoing treatment, tested Covid-19 positive after he passed away.Acharya Harihar Regional Cancer Centre’s 36 healthcare attendants have tested Covid-19 positive along with 18 patients undergoing chemotherapy.A staff nurse at the hospital also found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19.Earlier, 16 people, including five patients at the cancer hospital, had tested Covid-19 positive after a patient from Ganjam district, who was admitted to the emergency ward of the hospital on June 15, found to be infected nine days later.On Thursday, the panic-stricken hospital authorities shut down the outpatient department (OPD) facility, much to the distress of hundreds of patients in dire need of chemotherapy sessions.Similarly, 11 people, including a mother and her 10-month-old son, tested Covid-19 positive at SCB Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack. A lady doctor, working as an intern at SCB Dental College, also found to be suffering from the viral infection on Tuesday.At AIIMS, Bhubaneswar, 11 patients in the pulmonary department have tested Covid-19 positive. Doctors at the hospital expressed concern over contracting the infection, as the authorities are yet to issue a standard operating procedure (SOP) for treating OPD patients.In June alone, 40 frontline doctors and nurses have tested Covid-19 positive amid a lack of SOP guidelines in the government-run healthcare facilities.However, the state government has issued an SOP for private hospitals following the detection of 40-odd Covid-19 positive cases from a Bhubaneswar-based private hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-reports-77-fresh-covid-19-positive-cases-including-18-cancer-patients/story-JIl5SgY42vrRkn1sfWV26H.html

The PM visited Nimu village, which is one of the forward bases in Ladakh. The Army base is located at an altitude of 1,100 feet and is surrounded by the breathtaking Zanskar mountain range and the fast-flowing Indus river.The senior Army commanders briefed the PM about the current situation on the red-hot Line of Actual Control (LAC) amid the backdrop of hand-to-hand combat between Indian Army and China’s PLA troops on June 15 in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley that led to the death of 20 Indian soldiers.PM Modi’s visit to the border area is high on symbolism and a morale booster for the troops that are leading the stand-off in Galwan valley and around Pangong lake.Officials said that the PM would interact with Indian soldiers and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) jawans during his visit to the forward posts.The vigil along the LAC has intensified since the stand-off with PLA troops, which have been trying to make incursions at several places.Though senior Indian and PLA commanders have held several meetings in a bid to initiate a de-escalation and dis-engagement process, the talks have been inconclusive amid hopes of fresh rounds of parleys. PM Modi had last visited Ladakh in February, 2019, before it was carved out a separate UT on October 31, 2019Earlier, defence minister Rajnath Singh was slated to visit Ladakh, but his trip was cancelled at the last moment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-reaches-leh-to-review-security-situation-interact-with-soldiers-amid-stand-off-with-china/story-tSx9SledZ9AjRy420ica5N.html

Human clinical trials are scheduled to start across India in July,” Bharat Biotech said in a statement.Bharat Biotech completed comprehensive pre-clinical studies within two months after receiving all necessary regulatory approvals from the ICMR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-bharat-biotech-to-expedite-clinical-trials-of-covid-19-vaccine-plan-launch-by-august-15/story-PL1FMIp3cbmm0SDod7k9II.html

Ashraf had been on the run for the past two-and-a-half years.Carrying a cash reward of Rs 1 lakh on his head, Ashraf has around 30 cases of heinous crimes including extortion, land grabbing, threatening witnesses and possessing illegal arms registered against him in various police stations.He was wanted in around nine different cases lodged against him, including double murder in Mariadih village of Prayagraj a few years back.Though the district police are yet to formally confirm his arrest, two police officials requesting anonymity confirmed that he had been nabbed.“He has been arrested by the crime branch team from near Kaushambi border. He has been brought to Cantonment police station of Prayagraj this morning where he is being questioned,” said a police official.Police had attached property of Ashraf five times in the past and carried out multiple raids over the years but had failed to arrest him.Even the Special Task Force (STF) of UP Police was on a lookout for him.A raid was carried out on June 8 at Shivala market in Kaushambi after a tip-off that Ashraf is present in the area. Ashraf was not found but his four brother-in-laws - Abdul Rehman, Abdul Wahid, Abdul Wasit, Abdul Samad aka Saddam - and four aides Mohd Saquib, Noor Mohammad, Mohd Rizwan and Mohammad Imran were arrested. They were charged with sheltering Ashraf and helping him escape.It is worth mentioning that Ashraf’s brother former MP Atiq Ahmad is lodged at Ahmedabad Jail on the instructions of Supreme Court while Atiq’s son Umar is also on the run in connection with the abduction and assault on a Lucknow-based realtor which is being investigated by CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/atiq-ahmed-s-brother-wanted-ex-mla-ashraf-arrested-by-up-police/story-nax1Syt7lCSWyTJudp4rbK.html
03-07-2020||India||PM Modi flies to Leh in signal to China, gets briefing at 11,000 feet on standoffs||In a closely guarded move, Prime Minister Narendra Modi accompanied by Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat and Army Chief Gen M N Naravane landed at Leh on Friday morning to review the tri-services preparedness against the aggressive People’s Liberation Army (PLA) as well as understand the proposed de-escalation and disengagement process at the four stand-off points. PM Modi will address Indian troops at Thiksey near Leh. He will also meet injured soldiers at the hospital in Nimu near Leh.The decision for PM Modi to visit Ladakh sector was taken last evening with National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval handling the last minute detailing with Gen Rawat. PM Modi, Doval and Rawat stood together to face the Chinese aggression in Doklam plateau in 2017.PM Modi was briefed by the Northern Army Commander Lt Gen Y K Joshi and XIV Corps Commander Lt Gen Harinder Singh at Nimu Army headquarters.The visit of PM Modi and Army brass will be a huge morale booster for Indian troops deployed in East Ladakh. With NSA Ajit Doval coming out of self imposed isolation, the Leh visit is a huge signal to China as it conveys how seriously does India view the stand-off with PLA. Although the Ministry of External Affairs spokesman on Thursday called for expeditious dis-engagement from the border, the de-escalation process will take time with the PLA not in the mood to walk the talk between the two governments on ground. Despite talking about peace and dis-engagement, the PLA troop withdrawal from Galwan, Gogra, Hot Springs and Pangong Tso will take a lot of time and serious persuasion.According to military commanders, the PLA continues to earmark its territory at all the stand-off points by physical deployment while undertaking superficial thinning in the rear by withdrawing a few vehicles and few men. The PLA stands amassed at Galwan River Valley and consolidated at Pangong Tso with massive infrastructure upgrade.Faced with a recalcitrant adversary, the Indian Army and Air Force are fully deployed to prevent any further aggression from the PLA. The morale of the forces appears to be very high particularly after the June 15 flare-up at Galwan. “ We have no intentions of initiating any skirmish but any aggression from the other side will be fully repelled,” said a senior military commander.With temperatures in East Ladakh and Tibet well over 20 degree Celsius and high velocity winds sweeping the region, air operations in the area are a challenge with weight limits being imposed during take-offs particularly in Russian origin platforms. While IAF will use the air bases in the plains in the worst case scenario, the PLA Air Force will have serious difficulty in operating from Tibetan Plateau. The coming days will also be a test of unproven Chinese air platforms, missiles and land systems as their battle worthiness has never been challenged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-surprise-visit-to-leh-pm-modi-briefed-on-lac-standoff-by-military-commanders/story-9b8f1XwiktzE2zAMcmN1jJ.html

03-07-2020||India||PM Modi phones Russia’s Putin, congratulates him for constitutional reform vote||Prime Minister Narendra Modi has congratulated Russian President Vladimir Putin on the successful completion of a vote on constitutional amendments even as the Russian side reiterated its commitment to strengthening the bilateral special strategic partnership.Modi was the first world leader to speak to Putin after Russian voters approved changes to the constitution that will allow Putin to hold power until 2036. The telephonic conversation on Thursday came against the backdrop of the Indian government approving a move to acquire 33 new combat jets from Russia, including 12 Su-30MKIs and 21 MiG-29s.The PM congratulated Putin on the success of celebrations marking the 75th anniversary of the victory in World War-II and the successful completion of the vote on constitutional amendments. Modi pointed to an Indian tri-services contingent’s participation in the Victory Day military parade in Moscow on June 24 as a symbol of the abiding friendship between the people of India and Russia.Putin thanked Modi for the phone call and “reiterated his commitment to further strengthen the special and privileged strategic partnership between the two countries in all spheres”, according to Indian readout of the conversation. The leaders took note of effective measures put in place by the two sides to address the consequences of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and agreed on the importance of closer bilateral ties for jointly addressing the challenges of the post-Covid-19 world.They agreed to maintain the momentum of bilateral contacts and consultations, leading up to the annual bilateral summit to be held in India this year, and Modi conveyed his keenness to welcome Putin for the meeting.Russia has played a key behind-the-scenes role in efforts to reduce tensions between India and China following the standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Its leadership has said the reduction of tensions is necessary for regional security and stability.Defence minister Rajnath Singh, who also participated in the Victory Day parade in Moscow last week, said after meetings with top Russian leaders that he had been assured that all ongoing contracts for military supplies would proceed as scheduled and be completed expeditiously, despite the impact of the Covid-19 crisis.People familiar with developments said this includes the $5.4-billion contract for five S-400 missile defence systems, which are expected to be delivered from the middle of next year. Russia accounts for more than 60% of the military hardware used by the Indian armed forces.On Thursday, the defence ministry approved a proposal to acquire 33 new combat jets, including 12 Su-30MKIs and 21 MiG-29s, and the upgrade of 59 MiG-29s at a total cost of Rs 18,148 crore.“Addressing the long-felt need of the Indian Air Force to increase its fighter squadrons, the DAC [Defence Acquisition Council] also approved the proposal for procurement of 21 MiG-29 along with an upgrade of existing 59 MiG-29 aircraft and procurement of 12 Su-30 MKI aircraft,” the defence ministry said in a statement.The constitutional changes in Russia will allow Putin to run two more times as president. Putin has been in power for more than two decades, longer than any other Kremlin leader since Josef Stalin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-speaks-to-russian-president-vladimir-putin-congratulates-him-for-successful-constitutional-reform-vote/story-FWBNZhmGZnjhXy5YX2FfDL.html

According to the health ministry’s dashboard at 8am, 379 people succumbed to the viral disease between Thursday and Friday morning taking the death toll to 18,213.The number of people who have been cured of the coronavirus disease now stands at 379,891 after 20,032 patients were sent home in the past one day. This takes India’s recovery rate to 60.72%.The health ministry dashboard showed there are 227,439 active cases on Friday morning.The country’s caseload mostly comes from the states of Maharastra, which has 186,626 Covid-19 cases, Tamil Nadu with 98,392 infections, Delhi at 92,175 and Gujarat’s tally of 33,913.Union home minister Amit Shah has advised the chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi, which are home to close to 30 million people, to ramp up efforts to contain the coronavirus epidemic in the National Capital Region (NCR).Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi should coordinate their response to the Covid-19 outbreak by focussing on timely hospital access and using available tools for contact tracing.Delhi, Gurugram, Noida and Ghaziabad together account for over 100,000 infections till now, with the Capital alone recording close to 90% of it, according to government data.Delhi, however, also has close to 67% of the NCR population and the highest per capita testing in the country, which means it is likely to detect more of the outbreak.Meanwhile, the home isolation guidelines for Covid-19 has been revised by the Union health ministry by adding asymptomatic patients as well as very mild and pre-symptomatic cases to the list of people eligible for home isolation.However, immune-compromised positive cases, such as those on HIV/AIDS or cancer medication or who are transplant recipients, will not be allowed home isolation.According to the revised guidelines, a person should be clinically assigned as a very mild, pre-symptomatic, or asymptomatic case by the treating medical officer, and such cases should have the requisite facility at their residence for self-isolation and also for quarantining the family contacts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-20-900-new-covid-19-cases-in-biggest-one-day-surge-infection-tally-surges-past-6-25-lakh/story-VbyRdYGYBGHXf5X5cFYOiI.html
03-07-2020||India||India races to release first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine by August 15||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has partnered with Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL) for clinical trials of indigenous vaccine for the coronavirus disease.BBIL is using the virus strain isolated at ICMR’s National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune to develop the vaccine. The clinical trials will be held in 12 institutes across the country. The ICMR has asked these institutes to fast-track clinical trials of the vaccine as it is being considered as one of the “top priority projects” which are being “monitored at the topmost level of the government”.In a letter to these institutes, the ICMR said that it is envisaged to launch the vaccine for public health use latest by August 15, after completion of all clinical trials.“BBIL is working expeditiously to meet the target, however, the final outcome will depend on the cooperation of all clinical trial sites involved in this project,” it further said in the letter.It has also asked the institutes to ensure that the subject enrolment is initiated during the first week of July.Apart from IMS and SUM Hospital here, the other institutes selected for the clinical trial are located in Visakhapatnam, Rohtak, New Delhi, Patna, Belgaum (Karnataka), Nagpur, Gorakhpur, Kattankulathur (Tamil Nadu), Hyderabad, Arya Nagar, Kanpur (Uttar Pradesh) and Goa.Meanwhile, the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) on Thursday granted permission to pharma giant Zydus Cadila to conduct phase I and phase II human clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccine.The potential vaccine showed a “strong immune response” in animal studies, and the antibodies produced were able to completely neutralise the wild type virus, Zydus, part of Cadila Healthcare Ltd, said in a statement to Indian stock exchanges.Zydus will begin human trials this month in over 1,000 subjects in multiple sites in India, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-partners-bharat-biotech-for-covid-19-vaccine-selects-12-institutes-for-clinical-trials/story-NVBXssMPyhBrjLnK0TSPeN.html

The company also plans to ramp up its production capacity for the vaccine contender to serve Indian and global demand, it added.There were no safety concerns for the vaccine candidate in repeat dose toxicology studies, Zydus said. In rabbits, up to three times the intended human dose was found to be safe, well tolerated and immunogenic.No vaccine has yet been approved for commercial use against Covid-19, but more than a dozen from over 100 candidates globally are currently being tested in humans, and some have shown potential in early-stage trials.The number of coronavirus infections in India surpassed 600,000 on Thursday, resulting in 17,834 deaths as authorities battled to contain the pandemic while easing lockdown rules.Only the United States, Brazil and Russia have reported more cases than India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-approves-human-trials-for-second-covid-19-vaccine-candidate/story-dLW8RBkGlfvdtQjmA7sZKM.html

03-07-2020||India||PM Modi lands in Leh, accompanied by CDS Bipin Rawat and Army chief||Accompanied by the Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat and Army Chief Gen MM Naravane, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday landed in Leh on Friday morning on a closely-guarded visit to the union territory that has been at the center of the standoff with China’s People’s Liberation Army troops since early May.Top government officials had earlier only let it be known that CDS Rawat would visit Ladakh for a review of the tri-services preparedness and a first-hand understanding of the proposed de-escalation and disengagement process at the four stand-off points. It was only after PM Modi emerged from the plane that news of PM Modi’s surprise visit got out.PM Modi’s visit to the border area is high on symbolism, and a morale booster for the troops that are leading the stand-off in Ladakh’s Galwan valley and around Pangong lake.Also Read: PM Modi flies to Leh in signal to China, gets briefing at 11,000 feet on standoffsHe was briefed by the Northern Army Commander Lt Gen Y K Joshi and XIV Corps Commander Lt Gen Harinder Singh at Nimu Army headquarters near Leh.Located at 11,000 feet, this is among the tough terrains, surrounded by Zanskar range and on the banks of the Indus.PM Modi will also address soldiers at Thiksey near Leh and visit the soldiers injured in the June 15 violent scrap with China’s People’s Liberation Army. Although the Ministry of External Affairs spokesman on Thursday called for expeditious dis-engagement from the border, the de-escalation process will take time with the PLA not in the mood to walk the talk between the two governments on ground. Despite talking about peace and dis-engagement, the PLA troop withdrawal from Galwan, Gogra, Hot Springs and Pangong Tso will take a lot of time and serious persuasion.According to military commanders, the PLA continues to earmark its territory at all the stand-off points by physical deployment while undertaking superficial thinning in the rear by withdrawing a few vehicles and few men. The PLA stands amassed at Galwan River Valley and consolidated at Pangong Tso with massive infrastructure upgrade.Faced with a recalcitrant adversary, the Indian Army and Air Force are fully deployed to prevent any further aggression from the PLA. The morale of the forces appears to be very high particularly after the June 15 flare-up at Galwan. “ We have no intentions of initiating any skirmish but any aggression from the other side will be fully repelled,” said a senior military commander.With temperatures in East Ladakh and Tibet well over 20 degree Celsius and high velocity winds sweeping the region, air operations in the area are a challenge with weight limits being imposed during take-offs particularly in Russian origin platforms. While IAF will use the air bases in the plains in the worst case scenario, the PLA Air Force will have serious difficulty in operating from Tibetan Plateau. The coming days will also be a test of unproven Chinese air platforms, missiles and land systems as their battle worthiness has never been challenged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-stand-off-with-china-cds-bipin-rawat-expected-to-be-in-ladakh-today/story-hTV2bJhGvamJS95B0W1RSP.html

03-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||We are getting better at saving the lives of those infected with the coronavirus disease. It’s either that, or the disease itself is becoming less virulent. That’s something that’s been known to happen to flu viruses particularly, although the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, has ended up proving everyone wrong about almost everything. Sure, it’s a flu virus, but it turns out that it affects the heart, kidney, liver, even the brain. It also emerges that at least some of those who recovered after being ill enough to be hospitalised will bear the physical and psychological scars of their ordeal for months, perhaps years (and in some cases, forever).Still, I digress.The main point, and it’s a cheerful one to begin July with, is that the pandemic seems to be killing fewer people even as it continues to rage through the world. According to the World Health Organization, every day in the week to July 1, saw at least 160,000 new cases of Covid-19 around the world. And 40% of all coronavirus cases until now were recorded in June. July may be no different. The first day of the month saw in excess of 215,000 new cases.But the trend is different when it comes to deaths. Only 26% of all deaths from Covid-19 we have seen so far were recorded in June. That’s a statistic which is remarkable enough to be repeated another way — just around one in four people who succumbed to the coronavirus disease so far, around the world, died in June. Or, in still another way, around 380,000 of the 510,000 Covid-19 casualties so far were recorded before the beginning of June.That’s entirely understandable: we now know more about the coronavirus disease, how it infects people, and how it affects, even kills them. And research has also pointed us in the direction of medicines that work. For instance, remdesivir appears to work on people with mild or moderate infections if given early on; dexamethasone on people with severe infections who are on oxygen support if given late; plasma therapy seems to work in some cases (and it should; the science is a proven one and very old) although more data on its efficacy is needed.And so, even as the number of cases has increased, the number of deaths has dipped. The trend line of daily cases (global) and daily deaths (again, global) clearly indicates that. But there are riders. Countries may not be recording deaths accurately — either as a deliberate act or because their systems are shot. Many of the new cases in June, for instance, were in Latin America, and there have been reports that some of the countries in that region (notably Peru and Brazil) may be underreporting the number of deaths. The trend may still hold — after all, investigations by the New York Times and the Financial Times found that many western nations were also undercounting the number of dead, and many of those deaths date back to March, April and May — but it is always good to understand the caveats.What about India?Unfortunately, India continues to see no decline in the number of daily deaths, which has inched up steadily. The five-day average at the end of May 31 was 221, and the five-day average on June 30 was 421. In absolute terms, India recorded 65% of its cases and 68% of its deaths in June, although the second proportion is skewed by the 2,004 deaths the country recorded on June 16 when both Delhi and Maharashtra decided to reconcile their backlog of deaths. P.S: As always, much of this column has been possible because of the data collected, maintained, and analysed by HT’s Jamie Mullick. I’m 96 not out because he has been happy to run many singles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-DkZm6lBEfmkxDRfeU3OmqK.html
03-07-2020||India||Pandemic teaches a tragic lesson in migration||In February, B Ajurm Patro travelled 1,000km from her village in Odisha’s Ganjam district to Chennai in search of a job. In May, unemployed, starving and with the fear of the coronavirus stalking her, she took a bus back. Now, despite cases surging in Tamil Nadu and her daughter just three, she is ready to make the journey again.Her heart is telling her to stay put in Manapalli, a village of 1,500 people that acts as a reservoir of migrant labour for the industrial powerhouse southern states, but her mind is made up. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“What work is there for us in Manapalli? We can’t have two square meals a day even if we toil hard,” she said, looking around her modest two-room mud house where supplies have dwindled since they got back on May 27. “Our house has to be made concrete. Can we always live in a tin-roofed house?” she asked.Manapalli is one of hundreds of villages in Khallikote block, a former zamindari estate in Ganjam district. Though electricity has reached the village, piped water is still a pipe dream. Most households have drumstick trees in their courtyard, and fried leaves of the tree form the staple diet. The village houses have pucca walls, but with tin roofs . A lack of irrigation cripples farming activity except in the monsoon, and almost all families have taken to goat rearing to get by the rest of the year. Chakrapani Rout, chief of the gram panchayat, said if people need to earn a living, they have to migrate. “Unless people migrate, they have little to survive. There is no irrigation system and farmers are dependent upon monsoon,” said Rout.Every evening, Ajurm, 40, meets other women who rue the loss of their jobs in Chennai. Once the Ganjam administration relaxes its curbs -- Ajurm hopes this will happen by the end of June -- all the women have decided to go back to Tamil Nadu. “We are left with nothing now,” she said.It took 70 days for Ajurm, her husband B Ghana Patro and daughter Smrutilekha to get back home. But they couldn’t amass enough money to bring back her 20-year-old son Kailash, who worked as a construction labourer in Chennai and who is still stuck in the city. Ajurm thinks of her son every day, and it steels her determination to get back. “Kailash, too, would have come back with us, but he ran out of money after he arranged for our return journey. I felt bad leaving him back there,” she said. Ajurm’s story is shared by millions of workers who are now taking buses, trains and hitching rides on trucks to go back to their factories, construction sites, auto shops and gyms, merely two months after their harrowing journey back home spotlighted the predicament of communities caught in a web of migration. The pandemic and overnight shuttering of the economy exposed their economic precarity. Some perished on the way and the others vowed to never go back to cities that did little to support them in crisis -- only to change their mind in the face of economic ruin back home. “What choice do we have? We have to go back and we will,” said Ajurm.Long journeyAjurm’s journey followed a typical pattern. They were a marginal family with no land holdings so Ghana migrated in 2015 to work at a construction site in Ahmedabad, then in Mumbai and finally in Chennai. When Kailash passed his Class 12 examinations in 2019, he too went to Chennai to join his father. Finally, in February, with Smritilekha old enough to travel, Ajurm realised the money she made as an agricultural labour was a fraction of what she could make in the city.So she used a contractor her husband and son knew, and, with 30 other women from Manapalli, arrived in Chennai in the first week of February. She soon got a job lifting bricks and carrying a mixture of cement and sand, making Rs 350-400 a day. Her mason husband earned Rs 700 and son another Rs 400, giving her hope that she would soon be able to cast the roof of her house with cement and bricks. When the lockdown was clamped on March 25, all three of them lost their jobs. The contractor asked the to wait for three weeks, but when the lockdown was extended in April, he told them to leave Chennai.By then, many other workers around their neighbourhood had started walking or cycling back home but it wasn’t an option for Ajurm. “How could I take the risk of cycling with a 3-year-old or walking all the way,” she said.The contractor arranged food for a couple of more weeks, but soon supplies ran out, even as the infection swept through their neighbourhood. “I was worried for my daughter more than anything,” said Ajurm.On May 4, when the first relaxations were announced, their finances were already depleted; but some facilities opened in the relatively less-affected districts outside Chennai, so the couple travelled 80km to another construction site. They paid Rs 700 to an auto-rickshaw driver and worked there for a week, earning Rs 5,000.But Ajurm fell sick and they had to come back to Chennai. By then, the city was reporting upwards of 500 cases every day, and she was worried about her daughter. There was, however, one problem: Two seats on a bus cost Rs 9,000 while the couple had just Rs 5,000 with them.Kailash solved the problem. He borrowed Rs 5,000 from another contractor, though this meant he would be in debt and stuck in the city. “He wanted to come back, but we did not have enough money to get another seat,” said Ghana.Familiar patternMigration is an old phenomenon in India, but exploded as growth soared with liberalisation in 1991, birthing a paradox: Booming cities needed cheap labour but the high cost of living was far beyond what migrant workers could afford. Nevertheless, for millions of people trying to break out of poverty, the cities offered the opportunity of jobs that did not exist in their home districts.“As workers sought to tap into opportunities offered by inhospitable cities, they worked out a variety of complex, and often personally devastating, arrangements,” said Narender Pani, a professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bengaluru.At the centre of this phenomenon, Pani elaborated, was a post-liberalisation development strategy that didn’t factor in issues such as location of industries. “As a result districts towards the north and the east of the country have seen a major movement out of agriculture without a commensurate growth in industry. Workers are thus forced to seek work towards the south and the west of the country,” he added.Khallikote is a prime example of this.The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) , which allots 100 days of paid work to its beneficiaries, is of some assistance but the job card of many of the villagers is with the local Gram Rozgar Sevak, a government appointee who oversees the distribution of job cards and allocation of work to applicants, and who often pockets a fixed percentage of the money meant for villagers. “Last time, a Gram Rozgar Sevak asked me to sign on a column in the card that said I have received Rs 6,600, but gave me Rs 2,000,” alleged Ajurm.A rapid assessment of people coming back to Odisha by the non-governmental organisation Gram Vikas and Kerala’s Centre for Migration and Inclusive Development found migrant workers need a monthly income of Rs 5,001 to Rs 10,000 to continue smoothly with their lives.In Ganjam alone, more than 200,000 people have returned since May. The district administration pushed to expand the NREGS schemes but many workers say it involves hard labour and little skill, for very little pay. Ganjam district collector Vijay Amrit Kulange said few migrant labourers enrolled for NREGS works. Ganjam is one of the 116 districts in India under the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan , which aims to provide rural infrastructure and modern facilities such as internet in villages.None of the benefits have reached Manapalli yet. Since she reached home, Ajurm is yet to get a good meal; the rice she gets under the national food security act is the family’s only source of sustenance. She wants to stay home for her daughter, but is worried about the lack of income. “In Chennai, I used to get Rs 350-400. Will I be able to get that sort of money in my village?” she asked.Lessons learntMost workers typically do not have the capital for the whole family to move at once. Using familial or communal networks, the man usually moves into the house of a relative, or sometimes even a friend, in the big city. As he looks for and finds work, it becomes the duty of the woman in the friend’s household to cook for all of them – in addition to her daily-wage job. The migrant then brings his wife to help share the household work and, over time, the wife also begins a job. “At this stage, the migrants have the capital to find some place to rent and set up a household of their own,” said Pani.“They look for jobs in factories in the formal sector. Women who have completed middle school usually look for work in industries that are women-dominated, such as the garment export industry. Once both husband and wife have found some modicum of stability in the city, they can bring their children to live with them,” Pani added.A few days after the lockdown was clamped on March 25, migrant workers started appearing on highways, bags slung on their backs, a bundle on their heads and children cradled in one arm. From May 1, the government announced shramik special trains, which soon sparked complaints of poor scheduling, and long hours without food or water. Nevertheless, 3,800 trains ran full over almost a month.“What the crisis did, irreversibly, is that it brought up migration as an issue like never before. Anytime migration is talked about after this, people will remember these images,” said Chinmay Tumbe, a professor at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.There were some big takeaways from the crisis.One, it laid bare what Sai Balakrishnan, a professor at Harvard University, calls the spatial rift of India’s unequal development. Balakrishnan connected the migration to the Green Revolution that enabled some dominant agrarian castes to accumulate capital in the west and south even as the absence of state intervention deprived the east.Two, it showed how dependent the big cities were on migrant labour. Within weeks of their leaving, labour shortages were reported from major projects in Delhi and Mumbai. “In our metros, they make up 15-20% of the workforce, and their absence may hurt businesses quite badly,” said Tumbe.Three, it shone a light on the continued precarity of workers who do not consider cities they live in for decades as their home – because of uncertainties around food, health care, care-giving and housing. “This is a very sobering reality of the exclusionary nature of our cities and urbanisation,” said Balakrishnan.Policy measures such as one-nation-one-ration card, which allows holders to draw benefits from any fair-price shop in the country regardless of home state, may alleviate some of this. “It needs to get off the ground real quick. We need to be more clear on its architecture and need more discussion on that. Who will pay for it is a challenge,” said Tumbe.Four, it underlined the growing chasm between the economic reality of migration and the political rhetoric on nativism. In the past two years, a number of states have moved to reserve large chunks of jobs for local populations amid rising tension over the figure of the “outsider” taking up jobs. How this will square with migration remains to be seen.Tumbe predicted some tension in the next six months as the economy struggles to regain steam after the pandemic. “Once the employment reality kicks in, there will be pressure to give more jobs to locals. The one-nation-one-ration-card policy incentivises inter-state migration, but most state governments incentivise locals. How will this play out at a time of low employment?”To this end, he suggested the constitution of an inter-state migrant council on the lines of the GST council. Some states such as Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have already set up migrant commissions.Five, it showed the absence of any hard data on migrants.According to the 2011 census, there were 45 million migrants in India who had migrated for economic reasons. Over a quarter (13.4 million) were interstate migrants and a third (15.4 million) were interdistrict migrants. Just four states – Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, and Karnataka – housed half (52%) of all migrants. And just three states -- Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan -- were the source of half (53%) the migrant labourers.To be sure, it is possible that these numbers are a gross underestimate because the census did not adequately capture the number of migrants who move from one place to another for a short duration. The Economic Survey of 2016-17 estimated the number of interstate and interdistrict migrants to be 60 million and 80 million respectively. A conservative estimate by Tumbe put the number at 30 million while other estimates range anywhere between 80 and 120 million. “We don’t know how many people move. In many states, the number of people was more than double of what we thought earlier. The big learning was that states have no clue how many people worked there,” said Tumbe.Worst affectedSome of the worst-affected people by the crisis were Dalit and Adivasi workers, who make up a large pool of migrant workers and who have faced discrimination back in their villages. Many of them moved to cities to escape the deeply entrenched social inequalities in rural areas but found their hopes of a better life dashed when the virus struck India.“That internal distress migration in India is disproportionately made up of Dalits and Adivasis is well documented in migration research. What I want to underscore here is that it is not only caste-based forms of inequality, but also the regional inequality that is exposed by the ongoing migrant crisis. The Dalits and Adivasis from eastern U.P, Bihar, Odisha, have to trek almost across the breadth of the country to find work,” said Balakrishnan.Sanjib Mondal is one of them. A resident of the North 24 Parganas district in West Bengal, Mondal came back in May, only to see Cyclone Amphan pummel his village and destroy his home. Now, despite his fears of contracting Covid-19, he knows he has to go back and find work in Gujarat. “We have a home neither here nor there, but the money is better there. So what’s the harm in going back?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pandemic-teaches-a-tragic-lesson-in-migration/story-69EIk6MB70zNDX1VsRTx0J.html
03-07-2020||India||Delhiwale: A glimpse of Kutch, made at home||Her Instagram handle (@spicespori), that she launched at the beginning of the coronavirus-triggered lockdown, is nothing but emotional atyachaar (torture). It is filled with pictures of yummy dishes that seem particularly unattainable in these times of the pandemic, when eating out is a dream. If only it were possible to feed our poor stomach on Nafisa Adiraju’s Insta feed! It is a dizzying exhibit of regional delicacies from across the country—Kothimbir Vadi, Koki, Amritsari Chhole, Kutchi Biryani, Vada Sambhar... Bharta with Ghee Roti.“I’m completely cosmo,” declares Ms Adiraju, 36. The lady’s a practising Muslim married to a practising Hindu. She’s from Gujarat, he’s from Andhra Pradesh. They both live in Gurugram, in a lovely sunlit third-floor apartment on Sohna Road, with their two young daughters.“My life’s a mix of many cultures, traditions and yes, cuisines,” states Ms Adiraju. Speaking on WhatsApp video, she has sportingly agreed to cook a dish from her native Kutch region. “You won’t find Kutchi Dabeli in Delhi-Gurgaon,” she informs.This sandwich-like dish is one of Ms Adiraju’s few links to her ancestral land. She no longer has close relatives in Kutch, and hasn’t visited her village, Mandavi in Bhuj, for the past six years.Her true homeland actually is her birthplace, Mumbai. There she spent the first 25 years of her life. A dweller in the Delhi region for three years, Ms Adiraju has by now gained enough experience of both the cities to conclude that “Bombay is far more cosmopolitan than Delhi.” Looking back at her childhood spent with parents and siblings, she recalls the “cosmo” character of her Navi Mumbai neighbourhood. One friend was from Bhav Nagar in Gujarat, one was from Kasaragod in Kerala, and one was from Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh. Neighbours included a Sindhi as well as a Punjabi family. “My Muslim parents are very liberal and we would celebrate both Muslim and Hindu festivals.”Indeed, some of the go-to places Ms Adiraju visits every time she is in Mumbai include the trio of Haji Ali Sufi shrine in Worli, Siddhivinayak Mandir in Prabha Devi, and Mahalakshmi Temple on Bhulabai Desai Road.Sadly, Ms Adiraju’s dining table has strayed far from her origins. The Kutchi cuisine has a negligible presence in her present. One of the reasons is that “Kutch is an arid region, and its cuisine consists of a great variety of grains and less of vegetables”. In Gurugram, Ms Adiraju can get all the veggies, but she rarely gets access to the diversity of grains. In fact, she was originally planning to cook Khichda—a kind of Kutchi Khichdi made with six kinds of grains—but couldn’t get hold of Ghau Na Fada (broken wheat).Following her marriage to a Telugu man in 2008, whom she first met in her then office in Mumbai (“I was in logistics and he was in products”), she swiftly expanded her cooking cosmopolitanism, and learnt vegetarian Andhra cuisine from mother-in-law, Nagaratnam, in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh. In fact, the lunch she rustles out every day at her home is essentially an assortment of spicy Andhra Pachadis and Kuras. Just last week one of her typical meals consisted of Palak Pappu (arhar dal cooked with spinach), Potlakaya (fried snakegourd) and Annam (white rice)—you can see it on her Insta.Though this food instagrammar has never posted anything (yet) on the Kutch dish she is cooking today, it is very close to her heart. During her childhood, Ms Adiraju’s mother, Saira Mukadam, would make Kutchi Dabeli as an evening snack on Saturday evenings. “The family would sit around the dining table, and Mummy would give each of us three kids a bowl of Doodhchai with a plate of Dabeli.”This afternoon, however, Ms Adiraju is serving this snack as part of lunch to husband, Venkat, and girls, Anitra and Aahana. The photos were taken through the phone screen that connected her to this reporter. Here is the recipe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-a-glimpse-of-kutch-made-at-home/story-Msjol8Invuj49IZijtnmWK.html
03-07-2020||India||Timely hospitalisation, more tests in NCR plan||Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi should coordinate their response to the Covid-19 outbreak by focussing on timely hospital access and using available tools for contact tracing, Union home minister Amit Shah advised its chief ministers on Thursday, stepping up efforts to contain the epidemic in the National Capital Region (NCR).The matter was discussed at a meeting called by Shah to form a unified strategy in region that is home to close to 30 million people and has some of the country’s biggest industrial clusters, but is splintered into several cities and towns with distinct administrative structures. Together, the four key cities – Delhi, Gurugram, Noida and Ghaziabad -- account for over 100,000 infections till now, with the Capital alone recording close to 90% of it. Delhi, however, also has close to 67% of the NCR population and the highest per capita testing in the country, which means it is likely to detect more of the outbreak.The states must focus on saving lives by ensuring Covid-19 infected people who need to get to a hospital are able to do so on time, and that the administrations use platforms such as Aarogya Setu and ITIHAAS, the home minister told the three CMs: Delhi’s Arvind Kejriwal, Haryana’s Manohar Lal Khattar and Uttar Pradesh’s Yogi Adityanath.Separately, the Union minister suggested that UP and Haryana ramp up tests using rapid antigen kits “to help reduce infection transmission rate”, a statement by a spokesperson quoted Shah as telling these leaders. These kits can be provided by the Union government to UP and Haryana, the minister added, according to tweets by a home ministry spokesperson.Aarogya Setu logs close contacts and location histories of people using smartphones, ITIHAAS is a location tracking system based on mobile network data – this can identify people who have basic phones as well.Antigen tests – they take 30 minutes for a result while lab tests can take at least a day – have helped Delhi double the number of daily tests in the span of a month, helping bolster the tracing and treatment process. The turnaround came in mid-June after a slew of meetings between central and state government officials who gathered after cases in the Capital recorded a sharp, sustained spike.Officials in the Delhi government did not respond to requests for a comment on the meeting.The challenges of the divided administrative nature of NCR – where millions of people move between these cities for work and study – came to fore when Delhi decided to reserve its hospital beds for people who live in the city, a move that was later overturned; Haryana virtually sealed its border with Delhi on several occasions, blaming infections contracted in Delhi for fuelling their outbreak; and Noida and Ghaziabad have not opened the border for all commuters yet.According to a home ministry spokesperson, the meeting lasted over an hour and included health minister Harsh Vardhan, Niti Aayog member VK Paul and several other senior officials through video-conferencing. A Haryana government official, asking not to be named, said the Union government nudged the state government to “increase testing and bring down the positivity rate” – the proportion of positive cases per sample – in order to better detect the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/timely-hospitalisation-more-tests-in-ncr-plan/story-VQweWS0aRIhowrA7r3BldK.html
03-07-2020||India||Trump slams China’s pattern of aggression||United States president Donald Trump has blamed Chinese “aggression” for the stand-off at the India-China border and suggested this fits in with a broader “pattern” of Chinese aggression in other parts of the world, unequivocally spelling out Washington’s position on the tensions in the region.Quoting Trump from her notes at briefing, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany late on Wednesday said: “China’s aggressive stance along the India-China border fits with a larger a pattern of Chinese aggression in other parts of the world and these actions only confirm the true nature of the Chinese Communist Party.” The remarks went much further than the studied neutral tone the White House had maintained thus far on the dispute, according to close observers of India-US relations, who added that they reflected a growing strategic convergence between the countries.Trump’s remarks come in the backdrop of both an escalation in US-China tensions, as well as Chinese actions both internally as well as across the Asian geopolitical theatre in the past few months. The US in general, and Trump in particular, was engaged in a trade war with China before the coronavirus pandemic. Since the pandemic, even as trade tensions have deepened, the US president has categorically blamed the “Chinese virus” and omissions by China’s regime for its spread. For its part, in the past two months, China has passed what is widely considered a repressive national security legislation regarding Hong Kong, eroding its autonomy; it has stepped up its offensive in the South China Sea against countries such as Vietnam, while projecting power against islands in the East China Sea which Japan considers its own. And China has attempted to change the status quo at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India, which resulted in a brutal clash on June 15 in the Galwan Valley, leaving 20 Indian soldiers and an unconfirmed number of Chinese troops dead. On Wednesday, the Trump White House said the President is “closely monitoring” the situation and expressed hopes of a peaceful resolution. “Both India and China have expressed a desire to de-escalate, and we support a peaceful resolution of the current situation,” McEnany said before rolling out the new and more aggressive White House line.The White House statement reflected a shaper position that had been evolving in the administration, especially by secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Earlier on Wednesday, Pompeo offered full-throated support for the Indian ban on Chinese apps, which, he said, “can serve as appendages of the CCP’s (Chinese Communist Party) surveillance state”. He added, “India’s Clean App approach will boost India’s sovereignty.”There is also bipartisan purchase in the US Congress of China’s responsibility in triggering the border clashes. Tom Cotton, a Republican senator and close ally of the president, has said that “China has essentially invaded India, an ally of ours”. Marco Rubio, another Republican senator, has called Chinese actions at the border “unwarranted and lawless armed aggression”. Brad Sherman, a senior Democratic member of the House of Representatives, has slammed “Chinese aggression” for the June 15 clashes. Sherman is also the co-chair of House India caucus.Commenting on the White House statement, Arun Singh, former Indian ambassador to the US, said that the Trump administration, more than any administration since 1990, has been far more upfront in being critical of practices of the CCP “for both its own domestic political purposes and to meet the economic, technological and military challenge from China”. “Of late, administration officials — including national security adviser Robert O’Brien and Pompeo — have repeatedly criticised China’s strategies in the East China Sea, South China Sea, and now, its action across the LAC. The US strategy certainly coincides with India’s position,” he added.Singh said that the US had been careful in showing support to the extent that India found helpful and was comfortable with, except for Trump’s offer of mediation (which was rejected by India). But offering a note of caution, he said, “One must keep in mind that the US will determine its China policy based on its own interests. One can’t rule out the possibility that Trump may still try to strike a trade deal with China before the November elections because it may help him domestically.” The underlying tensions in the relationship, however, he said, will continue, giving India “enhanced space”. Vipin Narang, associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that one of the Trump administration’s foreign policy “bright spots” have been its relationship with India, and his personal bonhomie with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “That does not mean that the relationship is all roses, but there is a lot of sympathy and friendship toward India, across both parties and especially the Trump administration which has remained silent on domestic issues that some members of the Democratic Party have expressed concern about. Paired with a lot of anger toward China, particularly for its handling of the pandemic and on trade, it is unsurprising to hear secretary Pompeo and the White House express sympathy toward India for what is perceived as China’s aggression — not just West, but also East in Hong Kong and the South China Seas.”On how this will get reflected in tangible ways, Narang said, “Beyond expressions of sympathy, it is possible that the US is providing India with intelligence and imagery on the border, though that is publicly unknown. Beyond that, however, in an election year and with the pandemic, I would not expect much more overt from the US — there may be a lot going on behind the scenes, but publicly Washington is happy to let Delhi set the pace of the relationship.” But Narang added that if Delhi wanted something, it will, in all likelihood, have a “willing administration” in Washington right now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trump-slams-china-s-pattern-of-aggression/story-JntwKtOG0XzyrTHgSLYQOO.html
03-07-2020||India||Ban on apps discriminatory under WTO rules: Beijing||China said on Thursday it hopes India would correct its “discriminatory” actions against Chinese companies, three days after the latter banned 59 mobile applications, mostly Chinese, amid border tensions between the two countries. At an online briefing, Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson Gao Feng said India’s actions violated World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, according to agency reports. Gao underlined China has not adopted any restrictive or discriminatory measures against Indian products and services.India banned the mobile applications on Monday, saying they were “prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, the security of the state and public order”. HT has reported the ban was under discussion since early last month and the June 15 face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley hastened it. A Chinese economist with a leading Beijing-based think-tank also said that India’s decision violates WTO rules. “Hi-tech FDI from China legally flew into India, and was welcomed by the Indian government. But now, without going through any legal process or necessary warning, the Chinese FDI has been blocked overnight.”Asked if the ban on Chinese apps will impact foreign investments to India, the foreign ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said, software and internet application firms in India “have to abide by rules and regulations issued by the relevant ministries and departments, including those pertaining to data security and privacy of individual data.” India welcomes foreign investments and has one of the most open FDI regimes, “but this will have to be in accordance with the rules and regulatory framework established by the government,” he added.But Biswajit Dhar, a professor of economics at Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University, said there is no obvious ground for the Chinese to sue India in WTO over banning of these apps. “The apps are not likely to be protected by any forms of IPRs. Chinese firms could have claimed the apps as their assets, but we don’t have an investment treaty with China & investments are not under the WTO’s purview. Had we joined RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership), which includes an investment agreement, things would have been different,” he added.Gao’s remarks came two days after the Chinese government said it was “strongly concerned” about the ban and added the move was against “India’s interests”. “China is strongly concerned about the relevant notice issued by the Indian side. We are checking on and verifying the situation,” foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at the regular ministry briefing on Tuesday.Zhao reminded New Delhi of its responsibilities towards foreign companies. “The Indian government has the responsibility to uphold the legitimate and legal rights of the international investors, including the Chinese ones,” he said. He added China has always asked Chinese companies to obey international rules and local laws.The ban is expected to pose “a big stumbling block” for Chinese internet powerhouses, which bank on sheer user numbers and online traffic to gain a market position overseas, Raymond Wang, a global partner at consultancy Roland Berger, told state-controlled newspaper China Daily.“India, the market with the second-largest population worldwide, is definitely lucrative for sectors that compete for market scale and share,” Wang said. “That advantage could be wiped out in the foreseeable period of time.”A China Daily report said India accounted for roughly 30% of TikTok’s 611 million downloads, citing analytics firm Sensor Tower in April.Counterpoint, another technology research house, said Chinese smartphone makers, currently claim more than half of India’s smartphone market.(with inputs from HTC in New Delhi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ban-on-apps-discriminatory-under-wto-rules-beijing/story-RnfGArJ9QVe7tM6e1OltpK.html
03-07-2020||India||India slams China over its trade practices||New Delhi: China’s assertion that India’s ban on Chinese mobile applications is “selective and discriminatory” is completely misplaced and New Delhi has a long list of Beijing’s discriminations with countries, including India, related to trade and investments, officials aware of the matter said.India also has a long list of Beijing’s restrictive trade and investment practices such as the imposition of internet censorship through ‘Great firewall’, restrictions on long-term visa and non-tariff barriers on investments, two officials working in separate ministries, who did not want to be named, said.News agency Press Trust of India on Thursday reported the Indian Newspaper Society has slammed China for restricting access to Indian newspapers and media websites and urged the government to expeditiously take steps to ban access to Chinese media in the country.Chinese state-controlled Global Times on Thursday tweeted quoting China’s commerce ministry spokesperson Gao Feng as saying: “To date, China has not adopted any restrictive or discriminatory measures targeting #India’s products and services.”The officials brushed aside Beijing’s contentions and its veiled threat to drag India to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) over the decision on Monday to ban 59, mostly Chinese, mobile applications such as Tik-Tok, citing concerns that these are “prejudicial to sovereignty of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.”One of the officials cited above, who is also the government’s legal expert on the strategic matters, said, “Beijing has no basis to challenge New Delhi’s June 29 decision [to ban the applications]. Is there any agreement on this matter with China? No. Not to my knowledge. India can defend [it] easily under the clause of national security interest and sovereignty of the country.”“Therefore, the official Chinese reaction on June 30 was subdued and did not mention any bilateral or multilateral [WTO] agreement,” he added.Tensions between India and China escalated after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a clash with Chinese troops in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Tuesday said the Indian government has the responsibility to protect legitimate rights and interests of international investors in India, including Chinese businesses, in accordance with market principles. “Practical cooperation between China and India is mutually beneficial. Deliberate interference in such cooperation will not serve the interests of the Indian side.”TS Vishwanath, the principal advisor at law firm APJ-SLG Law offices, said, “This decision [on banning the applications has been] taken based on national security concerns. “ He said India can take any action to protect its national security interest as per the WTO agreement.The second official cited above, who works in an economic ministry, said China is indulging in illegal and unfair practices such as routing its goods through third countries with which India has preferential trade arrangements (PTAs) to avoid paying higher duty. China is dumping cheaper products in India to harm Indian industries, the official added.“The government is aware and agencies have been told to take action against such violations,” the official said. HT reported it on July 1.Data suggests a significant indirect inflow of Chinese goods and investments through countries with which India has free trade agreements (FTAs), PTAs, or other bilateral commercial arrangements. It shows that total foreign direct investment (FDI) from China is minuscule, but many Indian firms have received Chinese investments. Similarly, imports from China have registered a minor decline recently, but at the same time imports from Hong Kong and Singapore have surged, officials said.The latest official data shows FDI from China between April 2000 and March 2020 was $2.378.71 billion, which is 0.51% of the total such inflow into the country over the two decades.According to the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, while India’s trade deficit with China narrowed by $6.05 billion to $51.25 billion in 2019, the gap with Hong Kong widened sharply by $5.8 billion in 2019, nullifying almost all the gains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-slams-china-over-its-trade-practices/story-1vsbi5xXLddTQ0EUrH3t8N.html
03-07-2020||India||We expect China to ensure restoration of peace: MEA||India on Thursday called for an expeditious and phased de-escalation of the standoff with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), saying it expects the Chinese side to “sincerely” ensure the restoration of peace and tranquillity along the disputed frontier.Amid indications that the Chinese side has not done enough to ease the months-old standoff along the LAC, especially in the Ladakh sector, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly media briefing that speedy de-escalation will be in keeping with an agreement between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi that the overall situation “would be handled in a responsible manner”.Srivastava noted that the two sides have been holding discussions through established diplomatic and military channels to address the situation along LAC. This includes three meetings between corps commanders of the two sides on June 2, 22, and 30 and a meeting of the working mechanism for consultation and coordination on India-China border affairs (WMCC) on June 24.The corps commanders meeting at Chushul on June 30 was the third engagement between senior military commanders to discuss issues related to disengagement at face-off sites along LAC and de-escalation in border areas, he said.“Both sides have emphasised the need for an expeditious, phased, and stepwise de-escalation as a priority. This is in keeping with the agreement between external affairs minister and his Chinese counterpart, during their conversation on June 17, that the overall situation would be handled in a responsible manner, and that both sides would implement the disengagement understanding of June 6 sincerely,” Srivastava said.He added that discussions during the latest meeting of the corps commanders “reflected the commitment of both sides to reduce the tensions along LAC”.The two sides will continue meetings at the military and diplomatic levels, including within the framework of WMCC, to resolve “issues to mutual satisfaction”, Srivastava said.“We expect the Chinese side to sincerely follow up and ensure the expeditious restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas as per bilateral agreements and protocols,” he added.In response to a question on India’s June 29 decision to ban 59, mostly Chinese, mobile phone applications and China’s description of the move as discriminatory, Srivastava pointed out that India has one of the world’s most open regimes for attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) and that the government has put in place a host of measures over the past few years for creating a more investor-friendly regime. “Similarly in the area of digital technology and the internet, India has adopted a very open regime. India is today one of the world’s largest markets for digital and internet technologies with more than 680 million subscribers. The world’s largest software and internet applications companies are present in India,” he said.Such companies have to abide by India’s rules and regulations, including those pertaining to data security and privacy of individual data, while operating in the country, he said. “While we will continue to welcome foreign investments in India, including in the area of internet technologies, this will have to be in accordance with the rules and regulatory framework established by the government,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-expect-china-to-ensure-restoration-of-peace-mea/story-1FVoXGoOcfK6BTjhJo4bnM.html

The purchases will include 33 new fighter jets for the Indian Air Force (IAF) that is grappling with a shortage of warplanes.The proposals green-lighted by the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) include buying of 21 MiG-29s from Russia, 12 new Sukhoi-30 fighters from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), homegrown Astra BVR air-to-air missiles, locally-developed land-attack cruise missile (LACM) systems with a range of 1,000 km, indigenous rocket systems, and the upgrade of 59 MiG-29 jets, the defence ministry said in a statement.The cost of military hardware cleared for purchase from the domestic industry is pegged at Rs 31,130 crore and the orders are expected to give a push to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ (Self-Reliant India Movement), the spokesperson said.In a reference to the ongoing border dispute that has soured the military relationship with China, the statement said the weapon purchases were approved by the DAC --- headed by defence minister Rajnath Singh --- “in the current situation and [because of] the need to strengthen the armed forces for the defence of our borders.”The council also accorded its acceptance of necessity (AoN) for additional Pinaka artillery rocket systems, upgrade of infantry combat vehicles (ICVs) and advanced radio communication systems. Under India’s defence procurement rules, AoN by the council is the first step towards buying military hardware.The AoNs granted by the council will take a few years to fructify but the approval sends out a strong message about the government’s seriousness to go indigenous, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.“AoN for additional fighter aircraft is gratifying as it will help stabilise the IAF’s holdings. Particularly encouraging is the confidence placed in the Astra BVR and LACM. But these AoNs have to be backed up with the release of funds, else they amount to just an administrative acceptance of a need and not a procurement,” Bahadur said.“One supposes that in the current security environment, money would be forthcoming,” he added.The 12 Sukhoi-30s to be bought from HAL will cost Rs 10,730 crore, while the 21 new MiG-29s that will be imported from Russia and the 59 existing MiG-29 jets to be upgraded in that country will cost Rs 7,418 crore. These steps will address the “long-felt need of the IAF to increase its fighter squadrons”, the ministry said.Acquisition of new/additional missile systems would add to the military’s firepower, the statement said.“While the acquisition of Pinaka missile systems will enable raising additional regiments, the long-range LACM systems will bolster the attack capabilities of the navy and the IAF. Induction of Astra missiles will serve as a force multiplier and immensely add to the strike capability of the navy and the IAF,” the statement added.The domestic purchases worth Rs 31,130 crore factor in the cost (Rs 10,730 crore) of the Sukhoi-30s to be purchased from HALThe remaining Rs 24,400 crore will be spent on Pinaka ammunition, ICV armament upgrade, LACM systems, Astra missiles and software-defined radios, the defence ministry said, adding that the indigenous content in some of these projects would be up to 80% of the project cost.From raising foreign direct investment in defence manufacturing to creating a separate budget for buying locally-made military hardware and notifying a list of weapons/equipment that cannot be imported, the government in May announced a raft of measures to boost self-reliance in the defence sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/39k-crore-military-deal-okayed-for-jets-missiles/story-XkMm07Ul1UG2siPvOX4LZN.html
03-07-2020||India||Only two given accommodation for life||Against the backdrop of Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra being asked to vacate her government accommodation, HT learns that there are only two people who have been given government accommodation for life despite not holding a government post: former deputy prime minister LK Advani and former Youth Congress president MS Bitta. In Advani’s case, this is a function of the significant positions he has held in government as well as an assessment of the security threats he faces, a senior government official said on condition of anonymity. In Bitta’s case, added this person who is involved in the decision-making process, it is just the threat factor. LK Advani stays at an allotted bungalow on Prithviraj Road while Bitta, who has been targeted by terrorists in the past, stays on Talkatora Road.”As per extant policy, private persons other than SPG (Special Protection Group) protectees are not entitled to be allotted government accommodation on security ground. However, CCA (Cabinet Committee on Accommodation) makes certain exceptions based on threat perceptions to individuals,’’ said an internal government note which has been reviewed by HT. In Priyanka Gandhi’s case, the indications are that the threat perception wasn’t significant enough. In November, the government decided that the SPG would only protect the current Prime Minister and his family and the former PM and their family for five years . The change meant that Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi would be protected by the Central Reserve Police Force. And under government policy, only those individuals not holding a government post who are under SPG cover are entitled to government accommodation. Responding to the charges of “revenge politics” driving the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs notice to Priyanka Gandhi on Wednesday, the official also clarified that former Union minister Murli Manohar Joshi has his government accommodation for two more years, till 2022. Joshi continues to stay in the Raisina Road house he used to occupy as a senior minister and a member of Parliament. Priyanka Gandhi has never been a MP, nor held any government post. ”These decisions are taken by the CCA with inputs given by the ministry of home affairs. In Advaniji’s case, his threat perception continues due to the ongoing Babri Masjid demolition case. He was also the deputy prime minister, and so the decision was taken last year that he would be given the accommodation for his life,’’ said the official . “In Joshi’s case, it was again his involvement in the Babri Masjid case but that cannot be endless and that’s why it was decided to grant him accommodation till June 2022.’’The official pointed out that Bitta’s security threat was assessed as high because of the continuing threat from Khalistani forces to his life. He was severely injured and 13 others were killed in an attack in Amritsar in 1992.”I don’t know the details of Priyanka Gandhi’s case but my case is not political,’’ said Bitta.”I neither request for security, nor is there any lobbying. They automatically clear my case because of security threats.’’The opposition on Thursday kept up its attack on the government. Deputy chief minsiter of Rajasthan Sachin Pilot tweeted: “Many leaders are provided govt accommodation on security grounds despite not holding any office.Targeting Priyanka Gandhi is clearly political.Removing SPG &serving eviction notice esp during an endemic,can’t be the priority when so many burning issues are confronting the country.’’HT has learnt that Wednesday’s order for Priyanka Gandhi’s eviction from 35, Lodhi Estate, came after a flurry of exchanges between the Urban development ministry and the home ministry over the past seven months. It started when the government removed SPG cover from the Gandhis in November last year, giving them Z-plus CRPF cover instead. The final MHA letter this week clarified that such protectees do not get government accommodation if they don’t hold public office.While the Congress has accused the government of pettiness , the official cited in the first instance said that they expected Priyanka Gandhi to have moved out of her own. “When Vajpayeeji died in 2018, Hardeep Puri (minister of housing) met his daughter and son-in-law Namita and Ranjan Bhattacharya and offered them alternative accommodation as they were SPG protectees but they refused,’’ said the official.Namita Bhattacharya declined comment on the matter.”This is just like the time when Indira Gandhi was evicted from her house after she lost the election in 1977,’’ said Aradhna Mishra, the Congress legislative party leader in Uttar Pradesh. ”Priyanka has been raising issues that matter to people and they want to suppress her voice.’’BJP leader Gopal Agarwal tweeted, “Who is @priyankagandhi Priyanka Vadra? Is she holding a constitutional seat? Why does your party promote a culture where the hard earned public money is thrown away for the comforts of ‘One Family’?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-two-given-accommodation-for-life/story-7ywhgZfhESnDPQ16yZ0v8N.html
03-07-2020||India||Private train services by April ’23: Rly board chief||New Delhi: Private train services on 109 routes will begin by April 2023 and the operators will decide their fares based on competitive pricing, railway board chairman VK Yadav said on Thursday, a day after the process for opening up one of the government’s most prominent enterprises began for the first time. “Fares will be based on competition with other modes of transport in the same segment including airfares and fares of air-condition buses,” said Yadav. “I do not think that the fares fixed by private train operators will be too high ultimately if they want to keep financial viability.” Yadav said the fares of the 95% trains that the national carrier will operate will not be increased. “The poor will get a huge advantage with this. At the same price, they will get better facilities as technology and safety will improve.”The railway ministry on Wednesday issued a request for qualification (RFQ) for running 151 trains on the 109 routes. It laid down specific conditions needed to be met to “introduce modern technologies and world-class services” for one of India’s most popular modes of transport that has been outpaced by the demands of a rapidly growing economy in recent decades.Yadav said the railways is incurring losses in the passenger segment and it aims to meet its expenditure through a minimum guaranteed cost that the private train operator will have to pay to the national carrier.“Bids have been designed in such a way that railway will be able to recover the cost that is the minimum guaranteed cost that the private train operator will have to pay to us….basically we cross-subsidise with the freight segment. In this particular project what we have devised is that railways is not going to lose anything and ultimately the minimum cost which the private operator is going to pay will be able to meet the expenditure of the railways and whatever revenue we get over and above will be profit for the railways,” he said.Yadav referred to the bidding process and added they have initiated the timeline in such a way that they should be able to open the tender sometime in February-March and finalise it in April. Yadav said private operators have to buy and maintain the train sets and they will be procured under the Make in India policy. “…We have had few meetings with the stakeholders and will hold a pre-bid conference also after 15-20 days,” he said.The railway ministry on Wednesday said the planned investment will come to around ₹30,000 crore and the trains shall be designed for a maximum speed of 160 kmph to reduce journey time.Yadav said they will follow the Make in India policy guidelines when asked whether Chinese firms will be allowed to bid amid growing tensions between the two countries.HT reported in September that the national carrier is considering the idea of handing over operations of more trains to private players on several important routes with improved services and amenities.Yadav said the Covid-19 pandemic and restrictive measures in place will impact the railway privatisation plan. “There is an issue. It is a global pandemic and that is the reason we delayed our RFQ for some time but now we realised that economic activities are gradually opening up and that is why we decided we should go for the bids.” He added since they expected the first trains to run in April 2023, they have enough time.Congress leader Rahul criticised the privatisation plan and said the government has snatched lifeline of the poor. “Rail is the only lifeline of the poor and the government is taking it away from them,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/private-train-services-by-april-23-rly-board-chief/story-VLmZkzJDHhaeI3JxR58LOM.html
03-07-2020||India||Centre seeks CAPF inputs on recruitment of trans persons||New Delhi: The Union home ministry has sought views of central paramilitary forces (CAPF) for recruiting transgenders as assistant commandants, according to a letter written to in this regard on Wednesday, months after Parliament in December passed a law for protecting the community’s rights.In the letter, the ministry asked for Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Indo-Tibet Border Police (ITBP), Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), Border Security Force (BSF) and Central Industrial Security Force (CISF)’s comments for adding transgender as the third gender category to recruitment rules ahead of the annual examination for recruiting assistant commandants in December. HT has seen a copy of the letter.The comments will be shared with the Union Public Service Commission, which conducts the exams, for incorporating the third gender category in the relevant application forms, if the ministry gets a positive response, officials aware of the matter said. The government first wants to recruitment officers under the third gender category before hiring transgender troopers and sub-inspectors, they added.The officials said there is currently no provision for hiring transgenders for the central paramilitary forces.The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, which Parliament passed in December, says no establishment shall discriminate against transgender persons in matters relating to employment, recruitment, promotion, and other related issues. In view of the law, the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) in April asked all central government departments to include transgender as a separate category for recruitment for all posts, including civil services. A DoPT order said the matter was under the government’s consideration for some time.The Civil Services Examination Rules, 2020, notified in February included transgender as a separate category. K Durga Prasad, a former CRPF chief, welcomed the home ministry’s move. “This is the time to give equal opportunities. The only thing we have to take care of is setting different parameters like training, job profile, etc,” he added.Chayanika Shah, an activist, said, “By doing this, we are creating a category and you remain in a certain category forever. But the question is that once people come in, how do you deal with it? Why recruit only assistant commandants and not other categories?”The one-million strong central paramilitary forces are deployed for securing India’s borders with Pakistan, China, Bangladesh, and Nepal as well as for counter-insurgency operations in Jammu & Kashmir and Maoist insurgency-hit areas.According to home ministry data, these forces have 7,859 assistant commandants in their ranks. CRPF has the maximum assistant commandants (3,054), followed by BSF (1,888), ITBP (716), CISF (725), and SSB (542).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-seeks-capf-inputs-on-recruitment-of-trans-persons/story-d9lHNzyQzOhg6vznxP9gwJ.html
03-07-2020||India||Jaish man arrestedfor aiding Pulwama attack perpetrator||New Delhi: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday arrested a member of Jaish-e-Mohammad’s (JeM) “transportation module” _ that ferries infiltrating terrorists from border to Kashmir _ for allegedly facilitating the movement of one of the terrorists who helped making the bomb in February 2019 Pulwama attack, officials said.The accused has been identified as Budgam resident Mohammad Iqbal Rather (25).NIA spokesperson Sonia Narang said in a statement that Rather had facilitated the movement of Muhammad Umar Farooq, JeM terrorist and a key conspirator in this case, after he infiltrated into the Indian territory in Jammu region in April, 2018, from the national highway near international border.“Farooq, along with others, had assembled the bomb used in the February 14, 2019 attack (in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed). Rather had been in judicial custody since September, 2018 in another JeM- related case investigated by NIA,” Narang said.“ As such, he was produced by the jail authorities before the NIA special court, Jammu, on Thursday and was taken into seven days’ custody for interrogation. Initial examination has revealed that Rather was in constant touch with Pakistan-based leadership of JeM over secure messaging applications. He was part of the JeM’s ‘transportation module’,” Narang added.Before Rather, NIA arrested five persons in Pulwama attack – including Shakir Bashir Magrey, Mohammad Abbas Rather, Waiz-ul-Islam, a girl, Insha Jan, and her father Tariq Ahmad Shah. They were nabbed in the last week of February and first week of March this year, over a year after the terror strike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaish-man-arrestedfor-aiding-pulwama-attack-perpetrator/story-UwlrSmODwbsVbbeAby08ZK.html

03-07-2020||India||Covid patients, seniors to be allowed to use postal ballots||New Delhi: The ministry of law and justice amended the rules to allow those over the age of 65 and Covid positive patients, under home quarantine or hospitalized, to use the postal ballot to exercise their right to vote. The move comes ahead of Bihar elections, which are slated to take place in October this year. In the Rajya Sabha polls held last month, the election commission had allowed a Covid-19 positive legislator in Madhya Pradesh to vote at the polling booth. All the officials, and the legislator, were clad in PPE suits to reduce any chance of transmission of the virus. Earlier, casting votes through postal ballots was available only to armed forces and officials assigned poll duties. Those over the age of 65 years and people infected with coronavirus or suspected of having contracted the infection will be allowed to vote by postal ballot after the government amended the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961. Those who have mild symptoms and are not in any medical facility but in home quarantine can also vote through postal ballotIn several health advisories, people over the age of 65 have been asked not to venture out as they are particularly vulnerable to catching the highly contagious virus.In February, Delhi became the first state to experiment with postal ballots, extending the facilities to those with severe disabilities or above the age of 80 years.The elections to fill 19 vacancies in the Rajya Sabha in nine states were originally to take place in March but were deferred after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. They were then held in June and arrangements were made to allow members who are unwell to vote through postal ballot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-patients-seniors-to-be-allowed-to-use-postal-ballots/story-vtWXdVeTjoZ8bOwRtVSsTL.html

All four attackers were also killed.The premier didn’t give any evidence to back up his claim, and his remarks were a reiteration of allegations made earlier by foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi. The attack was claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army.Asked about Khan’s allegations during a weekly media briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “India rejects these absurd comments on the terrorist attack in Karachi and Pakistan cannot shift the blame on India for its domestic problems.Referring to Khan’s recent description of former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden as a “martyr”, Srivastava added: “We would ask Pakistan that they may wish to reflect on this and on their own government’s position, including their prime minister’s description of a global terrorist as a martyr.”Bin Laden was killed in the northwestern Pakistani garrison town of Abbottabad during a raid by US commandoes in 2011.In response to another question on the Indian government’s decision to ask Pakistan to reduce the strength of its high commission in New Delhi by 50% because of the alleged involvement of Pakistani officials in espionage and terror activities, Srivastava said personnel from the Indian mission in Islamabad and the Pakistani mission in New Delhi had returned home on June 30.A total of 38 Indian officials and family members had returned via the Wagah-Attari land border crossing while 143 Pakistani officials and family members had also crossed over, he said.Srivastava also said a total of 627 Indians stranded in Pakistan because of Covid-19-related travel restrictions had returned via the Wagah-Attari crossing. A total of 204 Indians returned on June 25, 215 on June 26 and 208 on June 27.Another 100 Indians were still in Pakistan and authorities are awaiting clearances to facilitate their return, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-claims-on-karachi-attack-are-absurd-india-hits-back/story-h1GY0V9OGwniqgzPY50aUM.html

They added that Patel’s statement was being recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The Sandesaras are being probed by multiple agencies including the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Income Tax department. The money laundering case is connected to an alleged Rs 14,500 crore bank loan fraud perpetrated by the Vadodara-based pharma firm and its main promoters.The Congress contended the probe into Patel was an attempt to “browbeat” the Opposition.“Frustration and political vendetta is writ large. It is traceable direct link from the Prime Minister and the home minister and the Gujarat connection to the Congress and Mr Ahmed Patel. It is clear that a slap in the face of illegal, reprehensible, manipulative activities in Gujarat elections has not yet been digested by BJP national and Gujarat leadership,” party spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-quizzes-cong-leader-patel-for-3rd-time-in-pmla-case/story-v0YFbIstWJsfNPFqJgWPyO.html
03-07-2020||India||Interministerial group set up to tackle locust invasion across states||The Centre has set up an inter-ministerial empowered group led by the agriculture ministry to intensify measures to deal with crop-devastating locusts in six most “at-risk” states, including through the use of helicopters and more advanced drones, Union agriculture minister Narendra Tomar has said. On recommendations of the group, the civil aviation ministry has relaxed conditions for the operation of civilian drones for locust operations, Tomar said. It has allowed the use of engine-powered drones of up to 50kg and use of drones at night for the locust control. The empowered group, set up on Tuesday, which has representatives from helicopter operator Pawan Hans, Directorate General of Civil aviation and Air India, will serve as a command-and-control centre for decisions to control the pest that has now become endemic in Rajasthan. Rajasthan, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh are the most threatened states as the country heads into its summer-sown kharif crop season.Swarms of locusts on Sunday moved further from Uttar Pradesh’s Bulandshahr to Kasganj, Oraiyya, Farrukhabad, and Hathras after the operation to control them a day earlier when they flew over parts of the National Capital Region were ineffectiveThe agriculture ministry has hired five technology firms to provide advanced drones. Each firm will provide five large drones. So far, 12 drones have been deployed in Rajasthan’s Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jodhpur, Bikaner and Nagaur. Drones are effective for covering tall trees and inaccessible areas. One drone can douse crops with pesticides in 16-17 hectare area in one hour. One hectare equals 2.5 acres.According to the UN, locusts pose a “serious threat” to the country’s agriculture this year. Desert locusts can fly hundreds of kilometres a day and one square-km swarm can eat as much crop food as 35,000 people in terms of weight in a single day, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)’s Desert Locust Information Service manual. If unchecked, locust infestations can cause a considerable drop in food output. In its latest update on June 28, FAO said breeding in Pakistan’s Sindh near the Indian border, the Indus Valley and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region poses a fresh threat of locust invasions into India.On Tuesday, the agriculture minister gave the go-ahead for a Bell helicopter with spray equipment from a helipad in Greater Noida. The helicopter will be based at the air force station at Uttarlai from where it will be deployed for locust control in Barmer, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Jodhpur and Nagaur.“The government is in full preparedness. The Centre is working in full coordination with states on locust control operations,” Tomar said.The Horn of Africa has been witnessing large breading by locusts since 2019 due to frequent cyclones possibly linked to climate change and swarms have invaded several regions from there, according to FAO.Currently, 60 specialised teams with spray equipment-mounted vehicles and more than 200 federal personnel are engaged in locust control operations in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/interministerial-group-set-up-to-tackle-locust-invasion-across-states/story-xbWsSmF2FkGiqKiaTjNlSN.html
03-07-2020||India||Joe Biden promises to end suspension of H-1B visas||Washington: Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has said the US and India are “natural partners” and if elected, the relationship will be a “high priority” for his administration. He promised to end the temporary suspension of H-1B visas that President Donald Trump ordered last week ostensibly to ensure American have the first crack at jobs as the US reopens after Covid-19 lockdown. The visa programme, of which Indians are the largest beneficiaries, has been in the crosshairs of the Trump administration’s immigration hawks.“That partnership [with India], a strategic partnership, is necessary and important in our security,” said Biden at a virtual fund-raiser on Wednesday. He gave an account of his role in promoting the relationship and securing the US-India civil nuclear deal.“I was proud to play a role more than a decade ago in securing congressional approval for the US-India Civil Nuclear Agreement,” he said. He added it was a big deal.The deal set a high bar for everything that has followed in the relationship.“Helping open the door to great progress in our relationship and strengthening our strategic partnership with India was a high priority in the Obama-Biden administration and will be a high priority if I am elected president,” Biden, a former vice-president, said. “India needs to be a partner in the region for our safety sake and quite frankly for theirs.”Late former Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee first used the phrase “natural allies” to describe the US-India relationship. Former US president George W Bush switched in “partners” for “allies”.At a virtual town-hall with Asian American and Pacific Islanders, Biden opposed Trump’s suspension of H-1B visas. “He [Trump] just ended H-1B visas for the rest of this year. That will not be in my administration,” he said in response to a question. People on this visa “have built this country”, said Biden, who visited India as vice-president in July 2013 with his wife, Jill Biden.The US issues 85,000 of temporary non-immigrant H-1B visas for high-skill jobs annually. Over 70% of them go to Indians. The programme critics argue H-1B visas are used to bring cheaper labour from abroad to displace Americans. The Trump administration stepped up scrutiny of the programme after taking office in January 2017. It issued an executive order titled ‘Buy American, Hire American’.The administration announced a reform of the programme along with the suspension last week and it would include doing away with the electronic lottery system to pick successful H-1B applications from among the thousands that are filed. The selection will be based on those getting the highest salary. Other changes are also in the offing, but there is no timeline for it yet.Biden also spoke about other immigration issues like the plight of undocumented immigrants brought as children, called Dreamers, to the US. Many of them are of Indian origin. “On day one [of his presidency], I am going to send a legislative immigration reform bill to the Congress to provide a road map to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants who contribute so much to this country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/joe-biden-promises-to-end-suspension-of-h-1b-visas/story-bsPyIMXsMxrXZuGirrAiGI.html
03-07-2020||India||India entitled to relief in marines case: UN court||A UN court ruled on Thursday that India is entitled to compensation in connection with the 2012 killing of two crew members of a fishing boat off the coast of Kerala by Italian marines guarding an oil tanker, an incident that had taken bilateral ties to an all-time low.But, at the same time, the five-member arbitral tribunal under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) decided by three votes to two that the marines are entitled to immunity in relation to their acts during the incident and that “India is precluded from exercising its jurisdiction” over them.“India has taken note of the [tribunal’s] award and will be in touch with relevant entities on the matter,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly media briefing.The tribunal began hearing the case after Italy contended in December 2015 that India violated the rights and immunity of the marines – Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone – by detaining them. Italy also argued that India violated its exclusive right to institute penal proceedings against the marines under UNCLOS.The two marines, accused of killing fishermen Ajesh Binki and Valentine Jalastine, crew members of the fishing boat St Anthony, were granted conditional bail by India’s Supreme Court and allowed to return to Italy in 2014 and 2016.The tribunal upheld the conduct of Indian authorities during the incident under the provisions of UNCLOS and held that the actions of the Italian marines breached India’s freedom of navigation under the convention.The tribunal unanimously ruled that India is “entitled to payment of compensation in connection with loss of life, physical harm, material damage to property...and moral harm suffered by the captain and other crew members of the ‘St. Antony’, which by its nature cannot be made good through restitution”.It said the two sides should hold consultations to reach an agreement on the amount of compensation. It added the tribunal would retain jurisdiction if either side or both sides wished to apply for a ruling from the court regarding the quantum of compensation. However, if no application is received within a year after the date of the ruling, the proceedings will be closed.The tribunal set aside Italy’s contention that India breached provisions of UNCLOS, but decided by three votes to two that the Italian marines were “entitled to immunity in relation to the acts that they committed during the incident of 15 February 2012, and that India is precluded from exercising its jurisdiction” over them.It also decided by three votes to two that India must take “necessary steps to cease to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over the Marines” in view of Italy’s commitment to “resume its criminal investigation into the events of 15 February 2012”.“Originally, the legal challenge before the Permanent Court of Arbitration was over India’s jurisdiction to try the marines and to that extent the tribunal has held in favour of Italy,” Supreme Court advocate Ishaan George, who was part of India’s legal team in the initial stages of the case, told HT. “But the tribunal has held that India’s action of confiscating their vessel, arresting the marines and other actions are not in violation of UNCLOS...a limited success...,” he said.Italy’s foreign ministry contended in a statement the tribunal had agreed on its position that the marines, being members of the Italian armed forces engaged in the official exercise of their duties, “cannot be tried by Indian courts”. It also said Rome’s public prosecutor had already opened an investigation into the incident.“The ministry wishes to emphasise that the award of the tribunal does not make any determination of criminal responsibility in connection with the incident, which it will now be for the Italian judicial authorities alone to ascertain,” it added.The tribunal rejected Italy’s claim for compensation for the detention of the marines, who were part of an anti-piracy deployment on board the Italian tanker.At his online briefing, Srivastava said the tribunal observed that India and Italy had “concurrent jurisdiction over the incident” and a valid legal basis to institute criminal proceedings against the marines.“The tribunal rejected Italy’s claim of compensation for the detention of the marines. However, it found that the immunities enjoyed by the marines as state officials operate as an exception to the jurisdiction of the Indian courts and, hence, preclude them to judge the marines,” he added. The row over the killing of the fishermen had disrupted bilateral ties for several years, though people familiar with developments said the two sides have now decided to move on from the incident in view of their growing convergence on both bilateral and multilateral issues. The judgment largely brings down the curtain on the February 2012 incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-entitled-to-relief-in-marines-case-un-court/story-fSVoIns6lEftkAeEik8pCO.html
03-07-2020||India||Pharma major Mylan gets nod to produce, market remdesivir||New Delhi: Pharmaceutical major Mylan was on Thursday given permission by India’s drug regulator to manufacture and market anti-viral drug remdesivir for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) under “emergency use authorization”. With this, three companies in India currently have the license to manufacture and sell the experimental drug. The other two companies are Hetero and Cipla. “Mylan has received the approval today [Thursday],” confirmed a Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation official, who did not wish to be identified.“The approval, however, has been given under emergency use authorisation which means it is an experimental drug and all protocols for this category of drugs must be strictly adhered to before giving the drug to a patient.”The protocol includes duly informing patients about the pros and cons of the drug. It requires the written consent of each patient after every minute detail has been explained and documented before the drug is given.Those giving the drug have to maintain a comprehensive database on reactions in patients who were given it. It is part of active post-marketing surveillance that requires documentation and submission of details about serious adverse events to the drug controller’s office.On June 21, Hetero and Cipla were given permission to manufacture and market the drug under the same emergency use authorisation.The Union health ministry has in its Clinical Management Protocols recommended the use of the drug to treat Covid-19 patients with moderate stages of the illness.The drug has been included as an “investigational therapy” only for restricted emergency use purposes considering the Covid-19 pandemic, and the need for medicines that work in saving lives.On May 1, the US Food and Drugs Administration gave Gilead Sciences, which holds the patent for the drug, authorisation for its emergency use on Covid-19 patients.The US Pharma major has announced it was in discussions with some of the world’s leading chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing companies, including in India, to produce the drug that had shown anti-viral properties again Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.Gilead applied for import and marketing of remdesivir to the Indian drug regulatory authority on May 29, and the permission was given on June 1.The medicine is not recommended for those with severe renal impairment and high level of liver enzymes, pregnant and lactating women, and those below 12.The 200 mg drug has to be administered in the form of injection on day one followed by 100 mg daily for five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pharma-major-mylan-gets-nod-to-produce-market-remdesivir/story-JfdsbbdcECpUpdpxeGFJ6M.html
03-07-2020||India||Monuments to open, Setu app must||The Union culture ministry gave its approval on Thursday for the opening of monuments, places of worship, museums and heritage sites controlled by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) from July 6, while introducing a series of safety measures, including the mandatory use of the contact-tracing Aarogya Setu mobile application by visitors and separate entry and exit points.“It has been decided that all the monuments can be opened with full security from 6th of July,” Union culture minister Prahlad Patel tweeted.Officials from the culture ministry said the decision to open these sites outside containment zones was taken in consultation with ASI. “We will follow all the guidelines laid down by the health and home ministries,” an official said. “People will have to compulsorily wear masks and use santinizers regularly. There will be separate paths for entry and exit,” he added.The official said there will be thermal scanners at the entry points, and visitors’ status on Aarogya Setu will be checked before they are allowed entry. ASI will also collect visitors’ phone numbers in case contact-tracing needs to be done.“There will be staggered entry and a cap on the number of people who can be present in the monument at a given time will be imposed,” the official said. E-ticketing facilities will also be ramped to ensure smooth and easy access. “We have to consider that the economy has to be opened up, slowly but surely.” The government also capped the number of visitors inside Taj Mahal to 2,500, while Qutub Minar has been allowed 1,500 visitors per slot. There will be two slots per day. Visitors will also be asked to stick to a time limit in order to ensure social distancing. On June 8, the culture ministry allowed 820 monuments to open, including the Taj Mahal. But the Agra administration decided against opening the monument in view of the rising number of cases in the city. Similarly, the Nizamuddin Dargah too got approval back then, but Dargah administration decided not to open the site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monuments-to-open-setu-app-must/story-FPQ9N3LJoSRETpHUB4gjCM.html
03-07-2020||India||Ministry seeks expert panel view on competitive exams||New DelhiThe human resource development (HRD) ministry has sought a report from a panel of experts headed by National Testing Agency (NTA) chief Vineet Joshi on whether the situation is conducive for holding the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to medical and dental colleges and the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) for admission to engineering courses in the second half of July.There has been a lot of concern among the parents of aspirants to these courses on whether the tests can be conducted safely amid the Covid-19 outbreak, which prompted the ministry to explore whether there is a need to postpone them.“Looking at the prevailing circumstances and requests received from students and parents appearing for JEE and NEET examinations, a committee comprising the DG {director general} NTA and other experts has been advised to review the situation and submit its recommendations to the HRD ministry latest by tomorrow.” HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank said on Thursday.Significantly, the decision comes at a time when the UGC is also planning to have a relook at the University exams and the academic calendar. The UGC is expected to take a call on a report by a panel led by Central university of Haryana VC R C Kuhad soon. There have been protests against the mode of exams in several varsities including DU. CBSE‘s decision to not hold the Class 10 and 12 board exams and the HRD ministry asking the University Grants Commission (UGC) to have a relook at the academic calendar has focused everyone’s attention on the two major competitive examinations that are scheduled next month – NEET and JEE.Both tests are scheduled in the latter half of July and are conducted by the NTA ; hundreds of thousands of students take them annually.JEE will be held from July 18-23, while the medical entrance test NEET will be conducted on July 26, the minister had earlier announced. The two crucial exams, and also the Class 10 and Class 12 exams were postponed because of the lockdown imposed to combat the spread of Covid-19.Last month, Nishank also announced that the Central Teachers Eligibility Test was being postponed because of Covid-19. The pandemic has played havoc with the current academic session. The Indian Institute of Technology (IITs)-Bombay on Thursday said it would conduct only online classes this year with no face-to -face teaching. Other IITs are also expected to follow suit. Samriddhi Sinha who is to appear for JEE exam said the students have been studying hard and face immense pressure to perform. “However, on the other hand there are reports of the spread of this infection during the conduct of exams. I feel there is a high chance the exam could be postponed, which considering a pandemic is on, is also a relief”.Eminent educationist Dr Inder Mohan Kapahy said holding the JEE or NEET exams is challenging task at any given time but more so when a pandemic is raging. “The HRD ministry will have to take a decision keeping all aspects in mind and forming an expert group seems to be the right approach,” said Kapahy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ministry-seeks-expert-panel-view-on-competitive-exams/story-PQMicDTIGslwLtm3NyhTfP.html
03-07-2020||India||Rural housing targets unmet due to Covid-19 curbs: Official data||As many as 348,000 houses have been built under the Centre’s flagship rural housing scheme in the first quarter of the financial year against the annual target for 6.15 million units, official data shows, indicating the impact of sweeping Covid-19 lockdown imposed in late March and lack of preparedness of states.The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna (Rural), or PMAY, is key to the government’s efforts to ensure housing for all.It is among the schemes that were expected to provide employment to millions of workers, who have returned to their homes in rural areas after losing their jobs because of the lockdown.The officials said the housing scheme was hit when the pandemic halted economic activities and just one-fifth of the quarterly target of 1.5 million houses for the summer could be completed.West Bengal alone has reported completion of 110,000 houses, or about one-third of the total houses built, from April-June, followed by Bihar (62,393) and Rajasthan (32,381). Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand have built 4,000 units each; Maharashtra 28,000 and Odisha 28,405.The annual targets for these states are much higher. West Bengal has to build 923,000 units and Bihar 800,000.The officials said the construction work is likely to get slower because of the ongoing Monsoon season.They are hopeful of a faster pace later and that the annual target can be met.The officials pointed out that very little work could be done in April due to the strict lockdown, which has since been eased. They added there was also a lot of confusion at the state or district levels about commencing work and setting targets during the pandemic.The officials said this resulted in a tepid beginning of one of the key welfare programmes this financial year.PMAY is a target-based housing programme for the poor and a key component of the government’s aim to have a vast number of individual beneficiaries. The government has focused on creating more individual beneficiaries through various welfare schemes.PMAY is an improved version of the Congress-era Indira Awas Yojna. As many as 17.2 million houses have been built under it since 2014 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi first came to power.The scheme also helps create jobs under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) as 90-day work under it is allowed to build houses.The Centre has focused on PMAY to bolster MGNREGS, under which 100-day assured employment annually is provided to at least one member of every poor rural household, as the construction of small rural house requires three to four workers.There have been restrictions on large-scale public works involving hundreds of workers because of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.The Centre plans to utilise skills of migrants forced to return to their homes to primarily build houses under PMAY and roads.PMAY has been among the government’s most popular welfare schemes that are widely believed to have helped Prime Minister Modi to return to power in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rural-housing-targets-unmet-due-to-covid-curbs-officials/story-JXnhqDrAzsiAKgjdximtUO.html
03-07-2020||India||Allegations of mishandling of Covid patients’ bodies fly thick and fast||After videos of dead bodies being dumped in mass graves at Ballari, Davangere and Yadgir districts of Karnataka created an uproar leading to suspension of eight health department workers and an apology by chief minister B S Yediyurappa, similar incidents have been reported in Ballari district.This time video clips of a Covid 19 suspect’s body lying in the rain and another of a Covid patient’s body being transported on a tri-cycle before being pushed into a grave, have surfaced.Late on Wednesday, a Covid suspect died at the Taluk government hospital in Hospet. His body, while being transported for burial by health officials, was apparently left in the rain for some time before it was buried.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesHowever, deputy commissioner of Ballari district S S Nakul claimed that complete SOPs were followed and the incident was being blown out of proportion.“Since the hospital was not a Covid designated hospital, the staff handling the body took some time to wear PPEs to ensure protocols were followed, during when the body was left outside for about 15 minutes.” But locals claim that the dead body was left outside in heavy rain as those responsible for burial scurried for cover and left it in the open for nearly two hours.In another incident, the body of a man, who died due to Covid, was ferried on a tri-cycle for burial at the graveyard close to the bus stop in Hospet. While officials were not available for comment, a district hospital official who did not want to be identified said, “There was opposition to the burial of the Covid patient’s body at the graveyard as there are houses nearby. So, to circumvent the opposition, we had to take the body inside on a tri-cycle after it was brought in a hearse to a nearby spot. This was only for the last leg of the journey.”The actions of the health officials, though, has attracted considerable criticism about the manner in which dead bodies are being disposed of.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allegations-of-mishandling-of-covid-patients-bodies-continue-to-fly-thick-and-fast/story-cyyyuEWi3hZEG21XoNxJMO.html
03-07-2020||India||Tamil Nadu custodial deaths: Three more policemen arrested||Chennai: Tamil Nadu Investigators arrested three police personnel on Thursday in connection with the alleged custodial torture and death of a father and son as the Madurai bench of the Madras high court (HC) ordered protection for the key eyewitness in the case that has sparked outrage across India. The Crime Investigation Department (CB-CID) arrested inspector Sridhar, sub-inspector Balakrishnan and constable Murugan. So far, five policemen have been charged under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in connection with the alleged custodial deaths of P Jayaraj, 59 and J Bennicks, 31, based on the key eyewitness’s statement and preliminary post-mortem reports.The CB-CID is on the lookout for another constable, Maharajan, against whom a contempt case is being heard in court for his conduct towards the judicial magistrate of Kovilpatti, MS Barathidasan, who conducted a probe into the incident. Sub-inspector Raghu Ganesh, who was under suspension, was arrested on Wednesday.Inspector General of Police, CB-CID, K Shankar said that murder charges were pressed against five policemen and four of them were arrested. “We are on the lookout for one more constable (Maharajan),” he said. Bennicks and Jayaraj died on June 22 and June 23 after undergoing hours of alleged torture at the Sathankulam police station in Thoothukudi district on June 19. They were arrested on June 19 and lodged in Kovilpatti sub-jail for keeping their mobile phone shop in the Sathankulam main bazaar area open during the lockdown.On Thursday, the HC ordered the police to send a woman officer, a head constable of Sathankulam police station, on a month’s paid leave from July 1 and deputed four police constables outside her house for protection.She testified on record that the father and son were beaten through the night on June 19. However, she sought anonymity as she was concerned about the repercussions she may face due to her testimony.After speaking to the head constable over phone with speaker, the court stated that, “she feels safe in her native village with her relatives around her.” If she faced threats she could complain to either the magistrate Kovilpatti or the chief judicial magistrate of Thoothukudi, S Hema, to bring it to the court’s notice.“The court has assured me with all possible help,” the lady head constable told HT. “Police have been stationed in front of my house. My family and I are safe for now,” she added.It is not yet clear whether her parent’s home will receive any police protection. “The court hasn’t given any specific direction [on Thursday regarding the security arrangements] and they seem to be satisfied with the arrangements,” district collector Sandeep Nanduri said.The court also looked into the R10-crore ‘Police Wellbeing Programme’ launched by Tamil Nadu by signing an MoU with NIMHANS Bengaluru in 2018 for a period of three years. “Only through such Wellbeing Programmes can violent propensities in individuals be stymied...we cannot afford to lose any more Bennicks and Jayarajs to violence,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-custodial-deaths-three-more-policemen-arrested/story-GfWKOrPtXyi61jej6wn53N.html
03-07-2020||India||Vande Bharat returnees still face a harrowing time||Madhubala Rai, who travelled alone from San Francisco to Delhi last week, said it took her at least seven hours to reach her hotel. Her flight landed at 3.30 pm on June 26, but it took her several hours to clear the APHO screening, immigration and customs.“I guess there were multiple flights at the same time because of which there were too many passengers. After reaching the triage area, it took us another one-and-half hours. We could only board the bus by close to 10 pm and were sent to our designated quarantine hotel,” Rai said.Nearly two months after the Central government launched the Vande Bharat mission to bring back Indians stranded in other countries, passengers arriving in Delhi continue to face a harrowing time with most of them spending six to seven hours to go through the complete process of security checks, screening, selecting a hotel for quarantine, and finally arriving at the facility.Another passenger, who arrived at the Delhi airport on June 25 from Washington D.C. said he spent six-seven hours at the airport. The passenger, who asked not to be named, said the process felt like a major hassle because the triage area, where the Delhi government officials attend the passengers, is relatively small. “Inside the airport, we do not have all our luggage and it is all air-conditioned but the triage area is not air-conditioned and because it’s a small area, if there are multiple flights at the same time, social distancing also goes for a toss,” he said.The crowding is intensified by the fact that passengers are also carrying all their luggage by the time they come to this area. At the designated triage area, all passengers are screened for Covid-19 symptoms at screening counters manned by medical officers and paramedics deputed by the Delhi Government. The passengers in the triage area are also guided about the protocol to be followed in quarantine centres. “The director-general of health services (DGHS) has deputed as many as 20 health teams, comprising doctors and paramedics for this purpose. We have been trying our best to complete the screening quickly, but most of the passengers who arrive seem to be very anxious and confused about the system. So, it takes time to explain the system and procedures to each one,” said a senior government official deployed at the airport who asked not to be named. Many commuters also complained of not being allowed to take cabs or private vehicles to reach their chosen paid hotel quarantine facilities. “They put us all in buses . The administration should also keep an option of hotel taxis so that those who want to go in a car can reach their quarantine facility quickly,” said another passenger who arrived from Australia and is currently in quarantine in a five-star hotel. A second government official who is part of the team engaged in the transportation of the passengers from the airport to the designated hotel quarantine centres said air-conditioned Delhi Transport Buses (DTC) buses have been requisitioned for the purpose. “We cannot engage taxis and increase the number of vehicles as surveillance would then become a big problem”, this person added on condition of anonymity. Even the Maharashtra government and the BMC follow the same approach in Mumbai. P Velarasu, Additional Municipal Commissioner in Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), in charge of Vande Bharat in Mumbai, said, “We have to account for every person who lands in Mumbai. So we have to take them in government organised transport, either to a hospital, or quarantine facility, as is required. If and when the passengers are discharged from the quarantine, organising transport is their own responsibility.”“Despite being so strict, last week we had a case where an octogenarian escaped from the triage area. The police later found him at his daughter’s home in Uttar Pradesh’s Ghaziabad. Now, if we allow cabs as well, keeping a tab on passengers will be all the more difficult,” said the second Delhi government official.the rules in Delhi and Mumbai are similar. A passenger arriving on a Vande Bharat flight has to be in institutional quarantine in a hotel for seven days followed by another seven days in home isolation.Explaining the process, an airport official said that passengers take almost 45 minutes to exit the plane and enter the terminal. “Here, they undergo thermal screening by the officials of Airport Health Organization (APHO) which takes about half an hour. These passengers are then divided into groups of 20-25 depending upon their final destinations and are briefed about the procedure they will undergo. The CISF personnel then escort these groups to the immigration area where there are 35 officers working at a time and one passenger takes roughly about 4-5 minutes in immigration clearance. Once cleared, the passengers are then taken to the baggage area where after collecting their bags many of them enter the duty-free shops,” the official said, asking not to be named.. “One problem which often leads to delays is that some people in the groups spend time in the duty-free area to shop, while others from their groups have to wait. CISF personnel cannot interfere as they have been asked to only escort them,” the officer added.A senior CISF officer in Delhi airport said on condition of anonymity that the process of escorting passengers through the terminal is smooth unless there are multiple flights coming at the same time. “Earlier there were issues as most of the flights landed around the same time causing a backlog at different counters. But the agencies concerned have now ensured that there’s ample time gap between two incoming flights. ““Once done shopping, the passengers together pass through the customs area where unless they are stopped by the law enforcement agency over suspicion of smuggling they take not more than 20-30 minutes,” the officer said. A senior officer from Delhi customs said on condition of anonymity that as is its practice the department profiles passengers and stops only a few whose luggage needs scanning. “Otherwise, a passenger takes barely 10-15 minutes to pass through customs area.” Passengers then exit the terminal and reach the triage area, where they’re attended to by officials of Delhi government’s health department. A Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) spokesperson said there are three kinds of services to ferry passengers to their quarantine facility in the city. “Those who need to quarantine within Mumbai are taken in BEST buses. Outstation passengers (those travelling out of Mumbai but within the state) have the option of selecting either ordinary or luxury MSRTC (Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation) buses and for those who can afford there are cabs, which are organised and routed through BMC,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vande-bharat-returnees-still-face-a-harrowing-time/story-vqjJf9zXPiMbinsyG916ZP.html
03-07-2020||India||Penalties for ex-RS MPs overstaying in bungalows||Former Rajya Sabha lawmakers overstaying in official accommodation in plush Lutyens’ Delhi will shell out up to Rs 10.78 lakh per month as damages, the upper house of Parliament has decided, to dissuade MPs from illegally occupying valuable accommodation in the heart of Delhi and creating a housing shortage for newcomers.The decision, taken on June 25, will see various slabs of penalties. The lowest slab would be at least 50% higher than the base rate or license fee of the accommodation given free to MPs during their tenure, an internal circular, a copy of which was seen by HT , said. These penalties will be applicable from August 1.The move comes a year after Parliament cleared a legislation—Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Amendment Bill, 2019-- for speedy eviction of unauthorised occupants of government accommodation.The lowest compensation—termed damage for overstaying—would be Rs 63,500 in the first month for the type V flat, the smallest government accommodation in Lutyens’ Delhi. For each subsequent month, the charges will grow and can reach Rs 3.17 lakhs for the eighth month, the circular said.Overstaying in a type VIII bungalow, the biggest and the best, will attract a penalty of Rs 2.15 lakhs in the first month or 55% of the license fee, according to the same circular. If a former MP continues to stay in a bungalow for eight months without permission, he or she will have to pay Rs. 10.78 lakh for the eighth month—a rate that would possibly eclipse the rent of posh private properties in Central Delhi.During the debate on the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Amendment Bill, housing minister Hardeep Singh Puri had pointed out, “Many of our colleagues, both in Parliament as well as in government service, somehow do not vacate the accommodation allotted to them. This naturally creates a strain on government accommodation.”“There is a demand in general pool residential accommodation in Delhi of 80,437 units. The availability is only 61,011 units. In other words, we have a shortage of 19,426 units,” Puri said.The Narendra Modi government has had to forcibly remove illegal occupants from government flats a few times. Overstaying in government accommodation by former lawmakers leads to considerable delays in new MPs finding houses to live in —a concern often raised by them.In a meeting of the house committee of the Rajya Sabha a few weeks ago, it was also decided that some members may be allowed to retain flats for a longer period if there are exigencies. Sometimes, members retain their accommodation when they are certain to return for a new term.It was decided that a member has to pay a higher rent for such interim periods. While type V bungalows will attract a rent of Rs 31,750 per month, one has to pay Rs 98,000 for type VIII bungalows.“All types of accommodations including those under eviction/litigation” will attract such penalties, the circular said. And MPs have also been informed by Rajya Sabha secretary general Desh Deepak Verma that these charges will be “automatically revised as and when the Licence fee/Damage rate are revised by department of estates.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/penalties-for-ex-rs-mps-overstaying-in-bungalows/story-KBUNwPQOgVp5JZc1trnzxI.html
03-07-2020||India||‘The tiger is alive’: Scindia warns on personal attacks||Bhopal: Rajya Sabha member and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Jyotiraditya Scindia on Thursday criticised Congress leaders for their repeated attacks on him and alleged widespread corruption in the previous Kamal Nath-led administration in Madhya Pradesh. Scindia was addressing BJP workers in a party membership programme at the state BJP office in Bhopal after chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s cabinet expansion. “Congress leaders have been levelling charges against me for 90 days but I didn’t say anything. Today, I wish to tell people that when Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his ministerial colleagues, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, state BJP president VD Sharma and lakhs of BJP workers were in service of people, the Congress leaders were only hurling accusations while confined in air-conditioned rooms. These leaders are not concerned about Madhya Pradesh and its 7.5 crore people but their own business,” he said.“I wish to tell both of them. Kamal Nath ji and Digvijaya Singh ji. Please listen both of you - Tiger ab zinda hai [the tiger is alive],” he added, referring to a line from a popular Bollywood movie.“Congress government was running like this -- someone was installed (to run the government) but the key was held by someone else. There was rampant corruption. Our 22 MLAs sacrificed their position to check corruption in the government.” Scindia and 22 MLAs allied with him quit the Congress in mid-March. By the end of the month the Congress government fell, and was replaced by a BJP one. “Service to people can be rendered with the feeling of service only. It can’t be done merely through speeches. But the Congress government lacked this feeling. The Congress was hurling accusations for a long time but now we will give a befitting reply to it. Ninety days have passed. Now, it’s the time of war,” Scindia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-tiger-is-alive-scindia-warns-on-personal-attacks/story-bdNiCqPyB4512hKJqy3waO.html
03-07-2020||India||‘Anyone who has ever been pregnant can’t donate plasma’: ILBS director||Dr SK Sarin, director of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS), spoke to Anonna Dutt about plasma therapy and the creation of the new plasma bank in the Capital. Edited excerpts:Why did Delhi decide to set up a plasma bank? The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) still classifies it as an experimental treatment.Earlier the therapy could be administered only under clinical trial that very few institutes were conducting. The Union health ministry has now allowed the off-label use of convalescent plasma therapy, meaning many more hospitals can start administering it to patients who fit the criteria (those with moderate disease whose oxygen requirement keeps increasing despite being given oxygen and steroids). Patients were finding it difficult to get donors as it is and with more and more people looking for donors it may lead to unethical practices of demanding money. With the government setting up the plasma bank, people will know where to get it from.Who is eligible to donate?The most important thing is to not harm the donors in any way. To ensure that, there are very strict guidelines in place. A person can donate plasma after 14 days of recovery only if they are not older than 60-65 years of age, do not have uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension, do not have chronic kidney, heart, lung, or liver disease. The donors should also be well nourished and above 50kg weight. Their haemoglobin levels also have to be over 8. Women who have ever been pregnant are also excluded as donors. And, their antibody levels must be good.The good thing about plasma donation is that one component of the blood is taken and a person can donate it again in 15 days.Why can’t women who have been pregnant donate plasma? Yes, anyone who has ever become pregnant is excluded from plasma donation for Covid-19. A baby contains genetic material from both the mother and the father. So, when a woman gets pregnant, she develops antibodies against the father’s genetic material [human leucocyte antigen]. This HLA antibody can lead to a transfusion related complication called Transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI). Covid-19 patients already have compromised lungs, plasma with HLA antibody might increase their chances of lung damage.Do you also screen donors based on the Covid-19 antibody levels?Yes, at ILBS we look for two things – one is the level of the antibody IgG and the other is neutralising antibody. As per the protocols, we look for an IgG titre of 1:640 meaning high levels of this antibody. Now, some of these antibodies – not all -- work by neutralising the Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19. We check for these neutralising antibodies. Will you be accepting plasma from other centres?No. This is a plasma bank and other hospitals can ask for plasma as per their need. If they do get donors, the plasma can be utilised at the centre itself. Currently, there is a scarcity of donors, so nobody really has surplus. We will only be accepting donations at this centre and storing it.Who pays the processing cost of the plasma?Once we receive a donation, we need to check the plasma for transfusion transmitted infections such as HIV, Hepatitis B and C. Then the antibody levels are also checked. The filter for the apheresis to separate the blood components costs about Rs 6,000 to 7,000. Then, there is the cost of plasma bags, storage.

Today, I wish to tell people that when Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his ministerial colleagues, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, state BJP president VD Sharma and lakhs of BJP workers were in service of people, the Congress leaders were only hurling accusations while confined in air conditioned rooms. These leaders are not concerned about Madhya Pradesh and its 7.5 crore people but their own business.”“I wish to tell both of them. Kamal Nath ji and Digvijay Singh ji! Please listen, both of you- Tiger abhi zinda hai,” he said, lashing out at the Congress, the party he was associated with for many years before quitting it in March this year. मध्य प्रदेश के विकास, प्रगति, उन्नति और मेरे प्रदेशवासियों की रक्षा के लिए टाइगर अभी ज़िंदा है। pic.twitter.com/PEIi2vH7mjContinuing his attack against the previous Congress government, Scindia added, “Service to people can be rendered with the feeling of service only. It can’t be done merely through speeches. But the Congress government lacked this feeling. Congress has been hurling accusations for a long time but now we will give a befitting reply to it. Ninety days have passed. Now, it’s time of war.”He said, “I will work for the party workers as a shield and a sword both.The Scindia family has always stood by the truth. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not working as a Prime Minister but a ‘pradhan sevak’. Our ministers too are a team of ‘sevak’ for people. This is not a time of celebration but to work to ensure justice to people after the injustice meted out to them in the Congress’ 15 months rule.”Reacting to Scindia’s remarks, state Congress spokesperson JP Dhanopia said, “The same remark- Tiger abhi zinda hai - had earlier come from chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. It’s just to motivate the party workers as both of them know that BJP is going to lose all the 24 assembly seats in the bypolls and Congress will form its government again.”-Ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tiger-abhi-zinda-hai-bjp-s-jyotiraditya-scindia-hits-out-at-mp-congress/story-KJKqQaSoO5GahzYfHdaEnN.html

She testified on record that the father and son were beaten through the night on June 19. However, she sought anonymity as she was concerned about the repercussions she may face due to her testimony.“The court has assured me with all possible help,” the lady head constable told HT. “Police have been stationed in front of my house. My family and I are safe for now,” she added.Tamil Nadu’s Crime Branch, Crime Investigation Department (CB-CID), which is in-charge of the investigation, arrested inspector Sridhar, sub-inspector Balakrishnan and constable Murugan on Thursday in connection with the alleged custodial deaths of the father and son. So far, five policemen have been charged under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in connection with the alleged custodial deaths based on the key eyewitness’s statement and preliminary post-mortem reports.Sub-inspector Raghu Ganesh, who was under suspension, was arrested on Wednesday.On June 30, the court had observed that “there will be an attempt to intimidate her and make her resile her version” and directed the Thoothukudi district collector (DC) to immediately ensure safety for her and her family members. The CB CID is on the lookout for the fifth policeman, a constable.DC Sandeep Nanduri had told HT that the eyewitness would go on a paid leave for a month, starting July 1. The district authorities would deploy four police constables -- two men and two women – in front of her house, he had said.It is not yet clear whether her parent’s home will receive any police protection.“The court hasn’t given any specific direction [on Thursday regarding the security arrangements] and they seem to be satisfied with the arrangements,” Nanduri said.On June 28, the lady head constable had given her testimony to judicial magistrate of Kovilpatti, MS Barathidasan. She had recounted that Jayaraj and Bennicks were beaten from the night of their arrest on June 19 into the morning. Lathis and a table that were stained with blood should be seized, she had told the magistrate.In its June 30 order, the court asked Barathidasan to hand over the lady head constable’s original statement to the investigating officer (IO) Anil Kumar, deputy superintendent of police, CB-CID, Tirunelveli, who will probe the case until the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) takes over.Earlier, Jayaraj and his son J Bennicks were arrested by Sathankulam police station authorities on June 19 and lodged in Kovilpatti sub-jail for keeping their mobile phone shop in the Sathankulam main bazaar area open during a curfew imposed because of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) lockdown.Initially, they were admitted to the Kovilpatti government hospital on June 22. While the son died on the same night, the father passed away the following morning.The court also looked into the 10-crore three-year Police Wellbeing Programme which the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (Nimhans) Bengaluru was assigned to conduct for the Tamil Nadu state police starting 2018. The court on Thursday held a video conference with Dr Sekar, Nimhans registrar, Dr C Ramasubramaniam, nodal officer and Thamarai Kannan, ADGP- Welfare to study the progress of the programme. “Only through such wellbeing programmes can violent propensities in individuals be stymied,” the court said, urging the government to continue with it. “On the one hand, those responsible for the death of Bennicks and Jayaraj should not go scot-free and on the other hand, we cannot afford to lose any more Bennicks and Jayarajs to violence.”The court further spoke to experts that Covid-19 pandemic is likely to increase mental illness amongst the society at large.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tuticorin-custodial-death-madras-hc-directs-police-to-provide-protection-to-eyewitness/story-4ISGHDKpZLuA83OaX1fH2J.html
03-07-2020||India||The lockdown showed our system works: Finance Secretary||Finance secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey, the top bureaucrat on revenue matters, spoke to Rajeev Jayaswal about the Goods and Service Tax (GST) journey so far, and the road ahead. Edited excerpts: This is the third anniversary of the launch of biggest indirect tax reform. How do you reflect on the past three years of GST regime, and what’s next? If you look back, prior to the GST era, there were 17 different [indirect] taxes, 9-10 different types of cess. Various other taxes were imposed by multiple tiers of government -- say Octroi, entertainment tax. All these have been merged in one under GST – ‘One Nation, One Tax, One Network’. Every month more than 1 crore tax returns are filed and approximately Rs 1 lakh crore is collected. The entire thing is completely objective, transparent and faceless. This is a major, major tax reform, unprecedented in the world in terms of magnitude.Now the question is, can we do something more? The answer is definitely yes. We should continue to improve taxpayers’ convenience and also make their life very, very simple. Problems of multiple [returns] filing have been already resolved, but more can be done. There had been some technical problems. In such a large system, such problems will arise, but our job is to ensure that such problems are attended to at the earliest and these problems should not reoccur. Some critics point out that GST is yet to stablise because rates are not yet completely rationalised, and the Council is still working to fix the inverted duty structure. Has GST not fully evolved?We can’t say that GST has not yet fully evolved. When GST was introduced, a through exercise was conducted. On various commodities, what were the pre-GST [tax] rates? It was found that in most of the items the rate was more than 31%. Then studies were conducted, what would be the GST neutral rate? It was something around 16-17%. In GST, large numbers of items were exempted from tax to provide relief to the poor and lower middle-class. Lots of items were put on 5%; then other slabs were 12%, 18% and 28%. Over a period of time, based on some suggestions, tax rates on some finished goods were brought down, which resulted in an inverted duty structure. The GST Council is deliberating on it and it will take appropriate decision in appropriate time. GST collections, which slipped by about 72% in April and 38% in May due to the nationwide lockdown, saw some recovery in June. Does this indicate that the economy is coming back on track?Some tax of previous months would have also been paid this month also because some taxpayers could not pay during the lockdown period -- but there is an increasing trend in GST revenue collection. Economic activities are now picking up. Even as Covid is there, people are learning to live with Covid and carry out their economic activities. It also shows that during this period, our GST system was working, which allowed people to file returns, because it is completely an online system.Do you expect a better collection in July?Hopefully it will be on the rising trend, because economic activities have increased compared to April and May. We should be getting more taxes than what we got in the last three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-lockdown-showed-our-system-works-finance-secy/story-mr2HM9ZuNs253qZ7QKNChO.html
03-07-2020||Editorials||PM Modi has made his choice | HT Editorial||On Friday morning, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi shaped India’s future foreign policy and security doctrine for years to come. First, by making an unscheduled, surprise visit to Ladakh at a time when the border stand-off with China, because of Chinese aggression, continues, he sent out a symbolic and political message, both within and outside the country, that India will stand up to defend its territorial integrity, in all circumstances.But, more importantly, while speaking to soldiers in the frontlines, PM Modi sent out a clear and unambiguous substantive message to China that India, and the rest of the world, will challenge its “expansionism”. By suggesting that either expansionists lose or are forced to mend their ways, the PM was telling China that the era of patience with its predatory tactics is over. By mentioning that India seeks peace — but peace comes from strength and India has done and will do what it takes to build its strength — the PM was telling China not to think that its assessment of the asymmetry of power between the two countries will make India retreat in the face of aggression. By repeatedly highlighting the bravery of soldiers and honouring them, the PM was preparing the Indian armed forces, as well as the rest of the country, for the challenges that may lie ahead. And by acknowledging Ladakh as India’s pride, the people of Ladakh as patriots, and the sites of Ladakh as having witnessed Indian bravery, he was laying an unequivocal claim to the region — all of it — as Indian territory, which is not up for negotiation.In the face of Chinese attempts to change the status quo at the Line of Actual Control, and the lack of substantive movement through negotiations at the military and diplomatic level, India had a choice. One option was to underplay the incursions, keep the issue in cold freeze, and slowly normalise the India-China relationship. The other option was to recognise the threat, decide to take on the adversary irrespective of potential costs, and reframe the entire framework of the relationship to impose costs on China. PM Modi has made his choice by picking the second option. It is now up to China to decide whether it wants to risk an escalatory spiral at the border and beyond at this juncture, or whether it is willing to restore the status quo and make peace. PM Modi has made it clear that while India hopes for the latter, it is prepared for the former.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/pm-modi-has-made-his-choice-ht-editorial/story-4koulJYebtWdoUGsHmCl4I.html
