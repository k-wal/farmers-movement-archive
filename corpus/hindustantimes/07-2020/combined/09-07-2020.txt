09-07-2020||News||Chanakya can trump Confucius, writes Abhishek Manu Singhvi||China is not only responsible for the spread of the Wuhan virus, but has used this crisis to fulfil its expansionist agenda, to inaugurate what its president defines as China’s “New Era” to its preamble. A major amendment to the Chinese constitution was passed unnoticed, adding “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” into its preamble. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is the most ill-concealed example of imperialism. That China has reached thus far in its expansionism is a tribute to its focus, tenacity and persistence. A country whose nationhood idea hardly existed before 1912 is now claiming both contiguous territories as also geographically far away ones. From Mongolia to Manchuria, from Tibet to Taiwan, the list is endless. The Communist regime is even ready to take on Russia, by claiming authority over Vladivostok. The current stand-off in eastern Ladakh is but a small blip in its bigger world view. Facing enemies on two fronts and fighting the pandemic makes it tough for India. This, however, is when the tough must get going. On the diplomatic front, there is a need to rethink and reject India’s “One China Policy”. Why should India continue to recognise “One China” if it stabs India in the back and tries to undermine “One India”, by salami-slicing at different points? Though India has adhered to the policy, New Delhi should find ways to violate it, if not in letter, then in spirit. Let us establish diplomatic relations with Taiwan and support the freedom movement in Tibet. The democratic movement in Hong Kong is receiving massive worldwide support. We merely need to add our voice at diverse forums. There are ways of doing all this while retaining official plausible deniability, and, yet, not missing the slightest opportunity to needle, embarrass and shame China. Indeed, we need to go further to underline human rights violations in Xinjiang (East Turkestan) and give oblique support to the Uighur and Turkic communities in their struggle. In 2016, India denied a visa to the famous Uighur leader, Dolkun Isa, to attend a conference of communities persecuted by China in Dharamshala. This is the time to provide unequivocal support to the Uighurs. Indian parliamentarians should join the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, consisting of hundreds of legislators from eight countries and the European Union. The alliance has taken some prominent initiatives within a month of its creation. Yes, China will internationalise Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), but India’s restraint is doing nothing to stop it. Didn’t China attempt to block the attempt to designate Masood Azhar as a terrorist? Hasn’t it, in the past year, repeatedly taken up the issue of J&K at the United Nations? No. So, India has nothing to lose but its inhibitions.Strategically, India must strengthen and streamline the working of global alliances against China. The global ambience has never been more conducive, given the anti-Chinese sentiment. Make the working of the Quad — India, the United States (US), Japan, Australia — active and ensure greater concrete cooperation qua the Indo-Pacific. There is urgent need to play a leadership role in the Democracy-10 alliance, comprising G7 plus India, Australia and South Korea. India should strengthen its diplomatic ties with Vietnam and the Philippines and provide them with resources. The US, especially President Donald Trump, is always an unpredictable ally, but at least till the November elections, Trump will do anything to critique China. It is we who must unabashedly know how far to leverage his electoral, anti-China instincts.Economically, Chinese imports to India have been significantly declining, falling to $48.66 billion in FY 2019-20 from $63 billion in FY 2017-18. The major imports from China include electrical and electronic equipment, plastics, watches, toys, furniture, sports products, iron and steel, metals, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and fuel. We need a judicious mix of import substitution, discriminatorily skewed tariffs and steep anti-dumping duties, apart from bans in patent or gross cases. It is a misconception that these multi-pronged, shrewdly-designed measures will fall foul of the World Trade Organization (WTO). First, a specific level of protection for specific import categories is in accordance with WTO provisions. In the Australia-Canada salmon case of 2000, WTO held that “Australia was not in violation of Art. 5.5, as it found that although Australia was employing different levels of protection to different, but sufficiently comparable situations, the different treatment was scientifically justified, and not arbitrary or unjustifiable and the different treatment was thus not a disguised restriction on international trade.”Second, India can use the logic of compliance with sovereign laws of the land. In the Argentina-Brazil poultry anti-dumping case of 2003, WTO ruled: “Argentina was not in violation of Art. 6.8 when it disregarded information submitted by a company that had not fulfilled procedural provisions of the domestic law...as information submitted by such companies was not considered appropriately submitted”. Since Taiwan manufactures many items that China produces, we must exponentially increase India’s diplomatic, economic and technological relations with it: Our trade has travelled from $66 million to $6 billion.Benjamin Disraeli said, “What we call public opinion is generally public sentiment.” Never has any Indian government after 1962 got greater anti-China bipartisan support than now. We need only to lose our self-imposed chains. Chanakya can trump Confucius: “Do not reveal what you have thought upon doing, but by wise council keep it secret being determined to carry it into execution...Once you start working on something, don’t be afraid of failure and don’t abandon it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/chanakya-can-trump-confucius-writes-abhishek-manu-singhvi/story-EdTsV1TSmooZyzm3IHwLAJ.html
09-07-2020||News||The economic challenge in decoupling from China | Opinion||China’s most recent incursions into Indian territory are threatening to push the economic relations between the two countries into unchartered territory. Calls for the boycott of Chinese products have persisted for several weeks now, but the question in the minds of most people is the extent to which the Indian economy can decouple from China. Is it possible in the foreseeable future?A closer look at facts provides a clear picture as to where India stands vis-à-vis its dependence on China. One important point is that China had established itself as India’s largest import source from 2004-05, having accelerated its exports to India from at least a couple of years earlier. Between 2003-04 and 2007-08, the period of rapid expansion of the Indian economy before the “Great Recession” struck, the nation’s imports from China expanded from about $4 billion to over $27 billion, or at a compound growth of nearly 61%. Consequently, China’s share in India’s total imports more than doubled, from 5% to 11%. Over the next decade, China’s expansion in the Indian market continued and by 2017-18, China’s share had expanded to 16.4%. In the two financial years since, this share dropped to 14%. However, there is evidence that China’s presence has certainly not decreased.These numbers do not give the true picture of India’s dependence on China; imports at the product level do. There are two major sectors in which India’s dependence on China is particularly worrying: Electronic products, including telecommunication equipment, and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), the intermediates for manufacturing pharmaceutical formulations. Both these sectors are immensely significant for India. While the former is critical for the government’s Digital India programme, the latter supports India’s pharmaceutical industry that supplies affordable medicines, to the domestic market and several developed and developing countries.It is no surprise that a large share of mobile phones that India imports is from China. The question is, how large is this share? In 2017-18, more than 90% of India’s imports of mobile phones and components were sourced from China. Data shows that in the following two financial years, imports from China came down significantly, but the reality is that Hong Kong is acting as a conduit for China’s exports to India. In 2017-18, India’s imports from Hong Kong were nearly $11 billion; the following year it increased to over $18 billion. China has, for long, used Hong Kong strategically to distribute its products to the rest of the world. Thus, when sentiments in India were against China following the Doklam dispute, Hong Kong began to be used to tranship products manufactured in China. Therefore, in effect, there was no real reduction in imports of mobile phones from China.Other imports of electronic and telecommunications equipment from China were equally significant. Although there is a common perception that large volumes of consumer electronic products are sourced from China, the fact that 82% of colour TV sets imported into the country in 2018-19 were from this country will come as a surprise to many. Further, 80% of optical fibres and 92% of personal computers were imported from China in 2018-19.The dependence on China is even worse in the case of APIs. Among the medicines whose APIs are imported is paracetamol, an essential medicine in the first aid kit of every household. In 2018-19, the entire stock of imports of this medicine came from China. The same was the case with streptomycin, an antibiotic used for treating several bacterial infections, including tuberculosis. Besides these medicines, China was the source of 95% of imports of APIs for penicillin and 98% for ibuprofen, a common medicine used for treating pain, fever and inflammation of various kinds, including arthritis. The APIs of many other critical medicines are also sourced from China.The list of industries which depend on China for their essential supplies is fairly long, but there are two that are important. The first is the motorcycle industry, which, in 2018-19, sourced 85% of its imports of parts and components from China. While most motorcycle components are obtained locally, the industry imports critical parts such as wheel rims from China. India is also heavily dependent on China for solar photovoltaic cells, which are expected to be the lifeline of the energy sector as the country seeks greener options.That India should bring down its dependence on China is a no-brainer. But progress towards reducing this dependence can only be made if the government and businesses make concerted efforts. In some sectors, especially in the production of APIs, the government will have to play a more proactive role by using the public sector units, as three decades of the growth of the Indian pharmaceutical industry has shown that the private sector is not willing to invest in a segment that involves considerable risk-taking. In other words, only a carefully-crafted industrial policy can reduce India’s dependence on China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-economic-challenge-in-decoupling-from-china-opinion/story-EfCBUbAOkmX9J1xpOJZErO.html
09-07-2020||Chandigarh||Fake Covid-19 reports: Probe transferred from state vigilance to Amritsar police, activists smell a rat||The investigation into the case of alleged preparing of fake Covid-19 positive reports by an Amritsar-based private laboratory in connivance with a hospital to fleece patients has been transferred from the Punjab vigilance bureau to the local police. A fortnight ago, the vigilance claimed to have unearthed the scam that involved swindling the rich, including foreign returnees, out of their money. It had registered a case against four doctors, including Dr Robin Tuli, owner of Tuli Diagnostic Center (TDC), under attempt to murder, fraud, criminal conspiracy and corruption on June 23. Also, the owner of EMC Super Specialty Hospital, Dr Pawan Arora, and a doctor were booked for allegedly colluding with the lab.In a letter, the state government has asked the additional chief secretary (home and justice) to take “necessary action” claiming that the vigilance has “decided to transfer the case to the police”. A senior VB official confirmed the development. Amritsar police commissioner Sukhchain Singh said he was not aware of it. “I have not received such order yet,” he said.Mandeep Singh Manna, a social activist, said, “The probe has been transferred with a clear motive to give clean chit to the accused. This is happening for the first time when the probe is transferred without the complainants’ intervention.”One of the complainants, Varinder Dutta, whose three family members allegedly contracted the virus from the EMC Hospital, expressed shock on the move. He said, “Before approaching the vigilance, we lodged complaints with the city police, but they did not act saying the issue pertains to the health department. The vigilance was conducting a fair probe, which was just about to complete. The move will help the accused get bail.” THE CASEThe fake Covid-19 report scam surfaced when some people who were found positive by the private labs turned out to be negative in retesting conducted at Government Medical College (GMC), Amritsar.The bureau registered the case after receiving several complaints in this regard. In its FIR, it also suspected the involvement of government officials and health staff in the scam.It also found that some of those tested positive were admitted to the isolation ward of the EMC Hospital where Covid patients were being treated. At least three patients reportedly contracted infection due to this, it was claimed.A few days after the registration of the case, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had also started probe into the alleged nexus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fake-covid-19-reports-probe-transferred-from-state-vigilance-to-amritsar-police-activists-smell-a-rat/story-NdvAHYvIrFmuCs49HrXeUI.html
09-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Just 8% of construction workers out of nearly one lakh workers received financial aid||Just about 8 percent of construction workers in the city registered with the district labour department have received monthly financial aid of ₹4,500—announced by the state government in light of the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent lockdown—during the last three months, revealed an RTI reply. Only 7,720 construction workers out of 96, 593 workers registered with the labour department have received the monthly aid in April, May and June, the Gurugram labour department said in a reply issued on July 3 to an RTI (right to information) request filed by a city-based activist. The aid was paid to the workers by Haryana Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board, an agency which works under the aegis of the state labour department.District labour department officials, meanwhile, said that the criteria for paying the aid to workers was finalised by the welfare board in Chandigarh and the relief money is being paid to only those workers who fulfil the eligibility criteria. “Registration of workers with the labour department alone does not mean that everyone is eligible for the financial aid, and also only one person in a family is entitled to the aid,” said Ramesh Singh, additional deputy director, industrial safety and health, labour department, Gurugram. The reason that less number of workers were paid relief is that a large number of registered workers don’t renew their registrations, and many have not paid their yearly registration fees, the official said.On March 23, the Haryana government had announced that workers registered with welfare board, but not registered under Mukhyamantri Parivar Samriddhi Yojana (MMPSY), would be provided with a sum of ₹4,500 per month from March 30 directly into their bank accounts.Across the state, around 3.5 lakh workers were benefitted by the scheme out of the 8.68 lakh workers that are registered with the department through the labour department portal, the reply said. Aseem Takyar, a city-based RTI activist, who had filed the RTI said that nearly one lakh construction workers are registered in Gurugram but relief has been given only to few. “The government must find out the reason for such low numbers and ensure more people get relief in the city,” he said. “Majority of workers who were found eligible for relief in Gurugram have received it already,” said RS Malik, deputy director, industrial safety and health, labour department, Gurugram. Trade union leaders, meanwhile, said that city construction workers were going through a very bad time as many of them had lost their daily wage jobs amid the lockdown. “Only a small minority has been able to get financial relief from the government and most of the construction workers are suffering due to lack of any financial and material help. Most of the migrant workers have gone home with whatever money they had and others are stuck here with little resources,” said Rajender Saroha, general secretary, Bhawan Nirman Kaamgar Union, Gurugram. As per trade union leaders around 2 lakh construction workers have left Gurugram for their home towns and very few have shown interest in returning despite the state government’s recent announcement on paying ₹1,500 as transport fare to construction workers who return to Haryana.Deepkamal Saharan, media coordinator, deputy chief minister Haryana Dushyant Chautala, said that the number of workers who have got financial relief in Gurugram as per the RTI figures is quite less. “The government will certainly look into this matter and find out the reasons for such low numbers which seem far behind the state average,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-just-8-of-construction-workers-out-of-nearly-one-lakh-workers-received-financial-aid/story-GzkXhB9BfTVSzYNv7Kt2jJ.html
09-07-2020||Gurugram||FIR filed against private lab for misreporting Covid-19 results||Gurgaon Police on Thursday lodged an FIR against SRL Diagnostics, a private lab, for allegedly misreporting Covid-19 test results in April this year.The action was taken after Haryana health minister Anil Vij on Monday said that directions have been issued for lodging an FIR against the lab based in Gurugram, which in April had reported Covid-19 negative samples as positive in Ambala and other districts.Gurugram police commissioner KK Rao confirmed the development , “An FIR has been registered against SRL Diagnostics in sector 18 police station under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 . Necessary action will be taken based on the provisions of the Act for violation of norms.”.Contacted, SRL Diagnostics, however, in a statement said they had not received any information from the police in the matter. “Some media reports are citing that there has been an order to file an FIR against SRL Diagnostics owing to a discrepancy in Covid-19 test results. We haven’t received any official communication on this,” the lab’s statement said.On Thursday, Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, wrote a letter to police commissioner Rao demanding an FIR and appropriate action against the lab for misreporting Covid-19 tests. “Based on investigations done by a committee constituted at the state level, the lab was found to have misreported Covid-19 test results. The FIR was lodged in Gurugram since the lab is based in the city,” said Yadav.On April 24, civil surgeon of Ambala, had called for an inquiry in the case after three people of a family were reported Covid-19 positive by the SRL Diagnostics. They were in contact with a positive case in Panchkula. They were asymptomatic when they got themselves tested and were confirmed positive by the private lab. Worried about their test result, they approached the civil surgeon Ambala for a re-test. Their samples were then sent to a government lab in Karnal, where they tested negative in 24 hours.In April, when private labs were allowed to conduct RT-PCR tests, Gurugram was the only district in Haryana where privately owned labs were functional. Samples, which could not be tested in the government labs due to capacity constraints, were sent to these private labs.The incident triggered a controversy when SRL diagnostics rubbished the government lab result and said it stood by its results, while stating that they had re-tested the samples using the RNA extract stored with them.The health minister later in April had ordered an inquiry into the case. The Director General Health Services (DGHS) constituted a committee of five doctors for conducting the probe. The team visited the diagnostic lab and enquired into the matter and found misreporting of Covid-19. The DGHS sought legal opinion from the Advocate General of Haryana, who in turn suggested that the lab be completely investigated.SRL Diagnostics confirmed that their Gurgaon Clinical Reference lab was visited by the state health department teams on multiple occasions between April and May this year and their team of doctors had been grilled on multiple occasions.“In April 2020, upon receiving notice from the Haryana Medical Service Corporation Limited, SRL had retested the preserved RNA of the cases mentioned by the Ambala civil surgeon office on an alternate FDA and ICMR approved RT PCR kit. The results, the lab said, were still positive. SRL Gurugram lab even today stands tall on the results that were released by us earlier,” reads the official statement by the lab.On July 6, Vij addressed the media at his residence in Ambala and said that instruction has been issued to lodge an FIR against the lab. He said, “Based on the complaint received against the SRL lab, a departmental enquiry was conducted. The samples claimed by the labs to be positive were found to be negative when tested in another lab.” Officials privy to the matter said that such discrepancy of the test reports has been reported from other districts too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/fir-filed-against-private-lab-for-misreporting-covid-19-results/story-40IPve5SLFOPboYLe09mdI.html
09-07-2020||City||Two days of rain worsen leachate run-off at Bandhwari landfill||Gurugram Following fresh spells of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday, residents of Bandhwari and Mangar villages have reported large amounts of leachate run-off near the Bandhwari landfill site, located 20 kilometres from Gurugram city. The ‘leachate problem’ at Bandhwari is alleged to have caused severe degradation of the water table in the region and poses a risk to the health of local residents. The issue of landfill run-off in the area has persisted for close to a decade, and routinely worsens during the monsoon, experts and local activists said. During a spot visit to the Bandhwari landfill site on Thursday morning, an HT team found that at least five large ponds of leachate had breached near the landfill’s boundary wall. Sunil Harsana, an activist from Mangar village, located adjacent to the landfill, said that fresh pools of leachate had formed immediately after rains this week. “This is a clear violation of the Solid Waste Management Rules, and has been observed time and again ever since the landfill started coming up. There is already evidence of groundwater contamination in the region, based on multiple independent and government inquiries. We rely on this groundwater for our own sustenance,” said Harsana. Responding to timestamped photographs of the scene at the site taken by HT and shared with Ecogreen Energy, a company spokesperson said, “These pictures seem out of our plant (landfill) area. However, we will take a sample tomorrow from the picture area and send it to the lab. We will share the report with you once we receive it.”Ecogreen Energy, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram’s concessionaire for waste management in the city, is in-charge of daily operations at the landfill. When asked about the issue, Kuldeep Singh, regional officer (Gurugram), Haryana State Pollution Control Board, said, “We will look into the issue and take appropriate action.” Experts said that leachate problems usually worsen during the monsoon. “Landfills such as Bandhwari release more leachate during the rainy season because of direct exposure to atmospheric moisture and rainfall,” said Rekha Singh, an environment expert of the Quality Council of India, which is under the ministry of environment, forest and climate change. Over 250,000 tonnes of garbage, which has been dumped at the site since 2008, lie in the open, thereby exposing them to the rain, she said, explaining that rainwater seeps into the waste and leaches various harmful metals and elements from it. “This liquid is toxic and should not be allowed to come into contact with the surrounding environment,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-days-of-rain-worsen-leachate-run-off-at-bandhwari-landfill/story-Qifa3af841U939IuJCSgIO.html

All of them attended a meeting of their association in a Chandigarh hotel on July 3 to protest against the arrest of a fellow official, Tarsem Singh, posted as regional transport authority (RTA) in Faridkot, by the state vigilance bureau on corruption charges. Nearly 40 PCS officers were part of the meeting. The state health department has asked at least 300 of their direct contacts, including family members and government employees, to put themselves in home quarantine. The reports of five PCS officers are still awaited, said a senior health department official. All the 40 officials kept performing their duties till Tuesday when Ludhiana additional deputy commissioner (ADC development) Amarjit Bains, who was found infected with the virus. After the July 3 meeting, the officials also met chief secretary Vini Mahajan in the civil secretariat. A PCS officer posted as a deputy secretary in the chief minister’s office (CMO) also met them.Besides, they are learnt to have met their acquaintances in the state secretariat thereafter. By Wednesday, 11 officials were confirmed positive. PANIC AMONG PAYAL FUNCTION ATTENDEES The news of Payal sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Mankamal Singh Chahal getting infected on Thursday sent shockwaves among some senior politicians as he was the main organiser of a state-level function July 5 in which health and family welfare minister Balbir Singh Sidhu was the chief guest. Among those present in the function were Payal MLA Lakhvir Singh Lakha, Fatehgarh Sahib MP Dr Amar Singh, Samrala MLA Amrik Singh Dhillon, Khanna MLA Gurkirat Singh Kotli, Bassi Pathana MLA Gurpreet Singh GP, former minister Malkit Singh Dakha and Khanna senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harpreet Singh. Most of these individuals have been meeting the public since, it is learmt.“I haven’t got any information from the administration yet but I will definitely take precautions as per the protocol,” Khanna MLA Gurkirat Kotli said. Another MLA said he has decided not to meet the public and will get his Covid-19 test done.Health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said all social-distancing norms were followed during the July 5 function. “I haven’t received any official communication so far but I am ready to get tested for the coronavirus, if needed,” he said. “Soon after the chief secretary got information, she quarantined herself and got tested for the virus but was found negative on Wednesday evening. She is back at work,” a government official said. FAMILY MEMBERS, STAFF TO UNDERGO TESTSA senior health department official said all family members and employees posted in the offices of the PCS officers will be tested for the coronavirus. “We are even tracing members of the general public who met these officials for their routine work,” he added.Also, working in the offices of the officials found positive has been suspended till further orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-babudom-in-a-tizzy-as-14-pcs-officers-turn-positive/story-2YlCJu0Qfo8z0SE2izQoSM.html
09-07-2020||Gurugram||Students of International Baccalaureate Board disappointed with final diploma programme results||Students and parents across the city have raised concerns about the International Baccalaureate (IB) result for diploma programme that was announced on Sunday. Many students say that there was a significant gap between their predicted score and the final score. With the drop in the scores, many students said that their admission prospects to a foreign university might be impacted. The IB is a Geneva-based international educational body that offers four educational programmes, one of which is the diploma programme meant for students who are between 16 and 19 years of age. A diploma examination is the international equivalent to an Indian Class 12 board examination, although the scores of IB are widely accepted across various universities in the world. There are at least 10 schools that offer International Baccalaureate Diploma Program.The IB was one of the first organisations to call off the diploma examination, which was scheduled between 30 April and 22 May, 2020, in view of the coronavirus pandemic. In the absence of the examination, the final grades were based on the student’s coursework throughout the two-year programme, predicted grades provided by affiliated schools, and historic assessment data, stated the IB. For the subjects where students would normally sit for exams, historic data was analysed to determine the relationship between marks of previous coursework and predicted grades provided by schools. A predicted grade is a grade likely to be scored by a student that is calculated on the basis of his/her past performance. Students, however, claimed that there was no transparency in the grading process and expressed their concerns. Mihir Sardana, an IB student from the city, said that he was disappointed with the results and was considering a revaluation. “There was a massive gap between the score that was predicted for me and the one that I got finally. As a whole, all other classmates of mine have seen a considerable drop in the results. There are two subjects where I missed the next level by a small margin,” said Sardana. Sardana said that the board had re-formulated the process of grade evaluation in an opaque manner in a year when the world is going through an unprecedented crisis. Sardana has applied to universities in Australia for further studies and has been able to secure admissions in most the courses of his choices barring some that he missed due to the drop in the IB points. “There was a course that I was very keen on taking up. However, I missed it by two points. I would have got it easily if my final score was close to my predicted score,” he said.Malvika Mathur, whose daughter Eesha is an IB student, said that there was no logic or transparency in the manner the evaluation was done. “My daughter is academically bright and had received a high predicted score. We are unable to understand how the final score was brought down so drastically,” said Mathur. Eesha said that her predicted score was 38 out of 42, but she ended up getting 36 out of 45, which was a significant dip by the standards of IB. “Coronavirus really changed the situation and we were told that we were being graded based on our internal assessment, predicted scores and past performances of the schools. The IA was externally graded and we were not aware about the system in place. We have not received a break-up. We don’t know what percentage of the grade is from what component,” said Eesha, who plans to continue further studies in the USA. She said that while her plans had not been affected, the drop in results has affected those who had secured a conditional offer from universities in countries such as the UK, where the past performance is taken into account.In an official statement shared with HT, the IB said that IB World Schools could request a re-evaluation of students’ work for the May 2020 session through the Enquiry Upon Results (EUR) services. “There are some changes to the EUR services in this exceptional session due to the fact that marks have been calculated in the absence of examinations in some subjects, and these have also been communicated to IB World Schools (sic),” the statement mentioned. The statement further mentioned that since the release of results, the IB had listened to its global community of IB students, teachers and IB World Schools. “The IB understands there have been mixed emotions and disappointment expressed by some. The decision to cancel the May 2020 examinations due to the Covid-19 pandemic was incredibly difficult, and as the IB responds to these exceptional circumstances, it has endeavoured to be as transparent as possible. The IB is confident that it has awarded grades in the fairest and most robust way possible in the absence of examinations, and the grades awarded to students are of equal value to those awarded in any other year (sic),” it said.The statement also read, “Prior to the attribution of final grades, this process was subjected to rigorous testing by educational statistical specialists to ensure our methods were robust. It was also checked against the last five years’ sets of results data, to ensure that it would provide reliable and valid grades for students. The stability of results for students has been maintained for the May 2020 session. The mean total points for May 2020 DP students show small increases in the average grade achieved compared to previous years. The grade distribution level is also in line with the previous four years of results data (sic).”Sudha Goyal, principal of Scottish High International School, said that children in her school had performed well. “Like every year, some students are happy while some are not. Our students have largely done well and there will always be someone or the other who is not satisfied with the process. So far, there hasn’t been much outcry in our school regarding the issue,” said Goyal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/students-of-international-baccalaureate-board-disappointed-with-final-diploma-programme-results/story-itUCGSgBsC3vYjSSt9BxwJ.html
09-07-2020||Chandigarh||Not my fault if Brahmpura’s aides joined me: Dhindsa||Rajya Sabha MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa on Thursday said there was no point blaming him if some associates of taksali leader Ranjit Singh Brahmpura joined his newly formed splinter group of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). Brahmpura, president of the Shiromani Akali Dal (Taksali), on Wednesday had strongly objected to Dhindsa’s move, saying he felt betrayed by the MP. Dhindsa, who was in Amritsar to pay obeisance at the Golden Temple, said, “I don’t want to say much on the issue as I still respect him (Brahmpura). I fail to understand how I betrayed him?” “Actually, he put the condition of retaining the nomenclature of his party for unity. But my supporters were not willing to go by that name,” claimed Dhindsa, who was accompanied by former minister Sewa Singh Sekhwan, one of the founders of the SAD (Taksali). Dhindsa’s MLA son and former minister Parminder Singh Dhindsa also paid obeisance at the shrine.Sekhwan and former Punjab assembly deputy speaker Bir Davinder Singh resigned from the Brahmpura-led party to join the new outfit. Sekhwan said, “Four of the five core committee members of the SAD (Taksali) requested Brahmpura to go together under the leadership of Dhindsa. He had admitted to quitting as president but remained adamant on not dissolving the party.

Of these, 49 people were found to have developed antibodies necessary to stave off repeat infection by the SARS-Cov-2 virus, said health department officials. A serological survey is an epidemiological tool used by health department officials to find out the prevalence of Covid-19 within communities. “A total of 362 people were tested for antibodies using IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(Elisa) kits. Of them, there were 24 people who had already been confirmed positive by a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test earlier. As per the guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), confirmed positives also need to be tested to see if they have developed antibodies or not. Out of the remaining 338 tests conducted on subjects whose history of infection was unknown, 25 people had a seropositive diagnosis,” said Dr Ram Prakash Sharma, district epidemiologist, Gurugram. “This is a good sign, especially since the samples were collected largely from areas, such as Dundahera, Sirhaul, Pataudi, and others, where there have been a large number of positive cases. A significant portion of the samples were taken are from local shopkeepers, who come into contact with lots of people daily,” said Dr. Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), Gurugram. He added that serosurveillance is going to become a routine practice in the coming weeks, with at least 400 tests to be conducted every month, as part of a larger, nationwide effort by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to understand the prevalence of Covid-19 in communities. Serological surveys make use of Elisa tests, and are conducted to estimate the proportion of a population which has been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. “As of now, the results from preliminary antibody tests show that while there are undetected cases in Gurugram, the extent of the spread is not so much as we had initially feared,” said Dr. Prakash, adding that a wider sample, of about 2,000 people, would soon be tested for SARS-Cov-2 antibodies. “That should confirm more strongly that we have been able to prevent large-scale community transmission,” he added. The district health department is currently working on a plan to extend the coverage of the serological survey to 2,000 people. Experts, however, said that a sample size of 360 people for Gurugram, which has an estimated population of about 25 lakh people, is too small to give an accurate picture of what the prevalence of Covid-19 really is. Dr. Prabhakaran Dorairaj, vice president (research and policy) at the Public Health Foundation of India, said, “Even if the right kinds of subjects are selected, it will not adequately represent the whole of Gurugram’s population. If the goal is to get a correct picture of prevalence, then the department must first classify the district into two areas: old Gurugram and new Gurugram. Within these areas, you have to use socio-economic data at the ward level and census enumeration block level to create a sample representative group of the larger demography of the city. That will tell you how prevalent the disease really is in Gurugram,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/serological-survey-in-gurugram-of-362-people-tested-49-found-with-antibodies/story-Chq8YXQHNPDcPG4qKJ7bcI.html
09-07-2020||Gurugram||MCG scraps waste treatment plant at Farrukhnagar||Giving into pressure from various quarters, the municipal corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Thursday decided to scrap its planned waste treatment plant that was supposed to come up at a landfill on the outskirts of Farrukhnagar.This now leaves the civic body with no place to treat Gurugram’s waste, as a result of which operations at the Bandhwari landfill will continue. Last year, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had directed both the MCG and municipal corporation of Faridabad (MCF) to stop dumping waste at the overfilled Bandhwari landfill, which was leading to various environmental hazards. It also directed both to find an alternative site to temporarily dump their city’s waste, while treating the 2.8 million tonnes of waste at Bandhwari. For this purpose, the MCG had, last year, identified a 25-acre plot at Chand Nagar Ki Dhani Road in Farrukhnagar, located around 30 kilometres from Gurugram, for processing city’s waste and the estimates for processing the waste were also duly approved by the Haryana government. The MCG had set up the necessary infrastructure at the site and was set to start treating the city’s waste from June-end. However, almost soon after the announcement, residents of 20 villages located over 5 km from the site, as well as local political leaders, protested. Despite a number of meetings between MCG officials and protesters, the plan could not move forward. Officials said they are now looking at possible sites in neighbouring cities.“We are looking at identifying panchayats in neighbouring cities that will permit us to use their land for setting up a landfill to transport Gurugram’s waste. We will be using a different strategy this time around, instead of first approaching the local civic body, we will instead get the consent of the people and then subsequently proceed with tying up with the concerned public body. This way the whole exercise will not be futile,” said Mahabir Prasad, additional commissioner, MCG.Prasad said that the MCG will first sensitise the residents of the area about the positives of setting up the plant.“Firstly, people need to know that the process of setting up a plant in their area is only temporary. We already have eight trommel machines that have started segregating waste at the Bandhwari plant. We are expecting 12 more such machines to arrive by November-end. The clearing of legacy waste would take us a minimum of six months or a maximum of 18 months. Once cleared, we will shift our entire operations back to the Bandhwari plant leaving the existing infrastructure behind for the local civic body of the particular city to use,” said Prasad. He also said that as a trust-building gesture the MCG will collect the waste from the area where the plant will be built, free of charge. Once they return to Bandhwari, the local civic body can then continue to use the facility.“Even at the finalised site, we will not be using the landfill to simply dump waste. We will be treating, and segregating waste there to derive three main materials- inert, compost, and refuse-derived fuel (RDF). Inert is used in construction projects, compost is used as fertilizers, and RDF will be used in the waste-to-energy (WTE) plant at Bandhwari for converting waste into electricity,” said Prasad.As per MCG officials, privy to the matter, the civic body has been offered land by a few local political leaders in Mewat, and they are exploring the possibility of setting up a plant there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-scraps-waste-treatment-plant-at-farrukhnagar/story-skR2RZKSHuwwY1Bk9N7KDN.html
09-07-2020||Noida||Noida officials inspect shopping mall after video of roof collapse goes viral||A team of Noida authority inspected the DLF Mall of India on Wednesday after a video showing a portion of the arcade’s roof collapsing went viral.According to officials, the demolition of the roof was pre-planned, controlled and permission had been sought prior. The Mall of India, located in Sector 38A, has been closed for the visitors ever since the lockdown was imposed in March in view of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.“We had inspected the shopping centre to confirm if it was an accident or a controlled demolition. There is some renovation going on and mall officials presented the approvals they took last month to perform such activities and dispose of the debris. They had also paid the Noida authority in advance to dispose of the debris likely to be generated, at our Sector-80 construction and demolition waste plant,” said Salil Yadav, senior manager (electric), Noida authority.He added that the renovations were being carried by the galleria to improve certain parts of the structure to avoid seepage, in a bid to save the fire alarm systems and projectors in multiplexes, which had been developing faults due to the gas emissions from the Shahdara drain flowing nearby.A DLF spokesperson had stated earlier that the collapse was part of controlled renovation work, adding that the video was from last month.The video that was circulated widely on social media purportedly showed a section of the roof collapsing, emitting a huge cloud of dust. The mall authorities have, however, asserted that the collapse of about 650 square metre of the roof was deliberate and part of renovation work.“We had commenced planned enhancement works in a part of The Mall of India, Noida, when the lockdown was suddenly implemented. During this time, a small portion, measuring approximately 650 square metres -- under 3% of total roof area -- was in the process of being prepared … The thunderstorm and extreme weather conditions that hit the city of Noida in June adversely impacted this portion of the roof in its vulnerable state. As a consequence of the damage suffered, a decision was taken to bring down that entire portion of the roof and rebuild it completely with enhanced standards,” said an official statement from the mall, adding that the enhancement work will continue in a safe manner and reopening of the mall is not linked to the work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-officials-inspect-shopping-mall-after-video-of-roof-collapse-goes-viral/story-cyufRTLFvxN55WQRrHLGnK.html
09-07-2020||City||Gurugram: Health dept to take action against those getting repeated Covid-19 tests||Gurugram The district health department will take strict action against a person who is found getting tested for Covid-19 multiple times, officials said on Thursday. Clarifying that there is no objection to getting tested in case of being symptomatic or a high-risk contact of a Covid-19 patient, the health officials said that many people are repeatedly getting themselves tested through the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test and rapid antigen testing by manipulating their contact details.“Be it asymptomatic, symptomatic or those who have recovered, a number of people who are anxious and cannot await test results are going for both RT-PCR and antigen tests. Asymptomatic patients who have recovered are also getting themselves tested twice through either of the test,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO). It puts an additional burden on the testing infrastructure, he said, adding that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) does not allow repeated tests of an asymptomatic patient. Yadav said that action will be taken under the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897. “Giving incorrect contact details is an offence punishable under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code,” he said. Section 188 is the penal provision in case of failure to comply with official directives. It includes fine or imprisonment for a month. Since July 1, the health department has been conducting antigen testing in a campaign mode in large outbreak areas of the district. The campaign will run till July 14. When HT visited one such camp at Jyoti Park, several asymptomatic patients, who had tested positive almost 15 days back, were at the camp to get themselves tested for antigen detection. “Some residents are getting tested in Gurugram and Delhi by giving their wrong addresses or phone numbers. Sometimes they give same mobile numbers but wrong names or vice versa. On our data portal, our teams are trying to identify such duplicity,” said CMO, mentioning that the discrepancy is leading to data mismanagement. However, he did not disclose the number of such cases where duplicity has been reported till now.As per the norms, for an RT-PCR test, a person has to show an identity proof. The district administration officials have clarified that Aadhaar card is not mandatory as it gives the native address of the person instead of the temporary address. “People often give wrong address as labs and hospitals are now asking for current residential address. In a situation like this, misinformation adds additional burden to the existing machinery which is already under pressure for contact tracing and testing,” said Yadav. Meanwhile, Gurugram on Thursday reported 151 new cases, taking the total number of persons infected with Sars-CoV-2 virus to 6,467 in the district. Of the total positive cases, 987 are active cases while 5,377 patients have recovered, as per the official data. The Covid-19 toll in the district stands at 103. At least, 741 patients are under home quarantine, the officials said. According to the officials, in Gurugram, 54,724 people have been tested through RT-PCR and antigen testing till now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-health-dept-to-take-action-against-those-getting-repeated-covid-19-tests/story-2XexFLJcSIvZTsqqjg5U1M.html
09-07-2020||Noida||162 new charging stations for electric vehicles in Noida soon||Over 160 charging stations for electric vehicles (EV) are set to come up soon here, with the Noida Authority and the Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) signing an agreement for it on Thursday, officials said.The move is aimed at promoting electric vehicles by installing public EV charging stations and developing related infrastructure here, they said. This agreement builds upon a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between the EESL and the Noida Authority last year, which led to the installation of 20 EV chargers in the city, the officials said.Thirteen of those EVs have been commissioned while seven are yet to be functional. These EV chargers were installed at prominent places of Noida such as Ganga Shopping Complex (Sector 29), near the Electronic City Metro Station (Sector 63), opposite Shopprix Mall (Sector 61), near RTO office (Sector 33), Advant Chowk (Sector 142) and the main market of Sector 50, among others.Noida Authority CEO Ritu Maheshwari on Thursday said developing a sustainable landscape with strong supporting EV infrastructure is the key to cultivating consumer confidence in electric vehicles and will significantly enhance consumer convenience as well.“With increasing penetration of EVs, the local pollutants emission levels are also expected to reduce, leading to cleaner air and several public health beneﬁts,” Maheshwari said in a statement.The agreement was signed for the Noida Authority by its General Manager Rajeev Tyagi and Amit Kaushik, Executive Director (Growth) of EESL, a joint venture of public sector undertaking (PSUs) under the Union Ministry of Power.“Electric vehicles are at the forefront of the world’s agenda to move towards a sustainable future and EESL is proud to be progressively leading initiatives to promote EV adoption in India under its national e-mobility programme,” EESL’s Kaushik said.According to the agreement, the EESL will make an upfront investment on services pertaining to the agreement along with the operation and maintenance of public charging infrastructure by qualified manpower, while the Noida Authority will be responsible for the provision of space for the work.“The initiative is estimated to save over 3.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per e-car per year,” according to the statement.The Noida Authority has been sanctioned 162 public EV charging stations, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/162-new-charging-stations-for-electric-vehicles-in-noida-soon/story-kQrl0R5IsaUjmDaUa3nBhK.html

09-07-2020||City||Noida: Rain likely only after July 15||Noida Though monsoon has arrived in Noida and adjoining areas, the region will be deprived of rains for at least a week due to unfavourable weather conditions, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Thursday.According to the weather department, the region will have clouds and some areas may see light rainfall or trace- level drizzling on July 11, but the overall rainfall situation seems bleak due to the change in weather conditions.“There will be a break in the rainfall despite the monsoon. We can expect rain on July 11 but even for that the chances are very less or it might be mere drizzle. The low-pressure monsoon trough line that passes through Punjab and West Bengal keeps oscillating. It has now shifted towards northern foothills and mountain states, so the parts of foothills in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Uttarakhand will see heavy rainfall but not the western UP, including Noida and Ghaziabad. It’s only after July 15 that the trough line may oscillate again and come back to western UP, which will lead to moderate or heavy rainfall in the region,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.So far, the region has seen only two days of proper rainfall – the amount of rain which could be measured – 34.8 mm on July 5 and 0.6mm on July 7, while on July 4 there was a trace which means rainfall was too low to measure. According to the IMD records, in July last year too, the region only recorded continuous rainfall from July 15 with cumulative rainfall of 199.2mm in that month. The rainfall below 15mm is considered light, between 15 and 64.5mm is moderate and above 64.5mm is heavy.The IMD said that due to the absence of rains, the region may see marginal rise in the temperature, while the humidity levels will be between 50% and 90%. On Thursday, the maximum humidity in the city was recorded at 92%.“The sky will remain cloudy, so there will be no major rise in the temperatures. However, the maximum temperatures will hover around 39 degrees Celsius for the next seven days,” said Srivastava.On Thursday. the maximum temperature was recorded at 37.8 degrees Celsius, two notches above the season’s average, against 37 degrees a day earlier. The minimum temperature was recorded at 27.4 degrees, same as a day earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-rain-likely-only-after-july-15/story-oUYnsqXvW4X4G7Dfxe3yxN.html

09-07-2020||Noida||Noida: Fearing FIRs, three doctors, two nurses resume duties at pvt hospital||Three days after the Uttar Pradesh government said that it can lodge cases against doctors and health care workers who decide to quit their jobs amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, three doctors and two nurses—who had been stopped reporting to work for nearly a month at a private hospital in the district— resumed their duties on Thursday, the officials said.Seven doctors and 47 nurses of Sharda Hospital had resigned last month without offering any explanation, said hospital authorities.Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said the three doctors and two nurses of the Sharda hospital, resumed their duties after the administration had decided to book health care workers who quit their job during the ongoing public health emergency situation. “I am sure that very soon other doctors and nurses, who had quit their jobs recently, will also join their duties,” he said.The DM further said that any dereliction in the duties during the pandemic will not be tolerated. “We have cancelled all the leaves of government employees in the district till further notice. They have been asked not to leave their establishments (areas of posting) without my prior permission,” he said. When contacted, the spokesperson of Sharda hospital said that three out of seven doctors, including four anaesthesiologists, and two out of the 47 nurses, who had stopped coming to work last month, resumed their duties Thursday. “I hope very soon the remaining doctors and nurses will also join us again,” he said.On Monday, additional chief secretary (health education) Rajnish Dubey, in a meeting with senior district officials in Noida, had expressed concern about the rising tendency of escapism among doctors during the pandemic situation. In context with the reports of health workers quitting their jobs at Sharda hospital, Dubey had said that the government will first warn them for dereliction of duty. “If they’ll still do not resume their duties, FIRs will be lodged against them and they can even be jailed for violation of rules under the Epidemic Act,” he had said in the meeting.NOIDA COUNT REACHES 3,182At 172, Gautam Budh Nagar recorded its highest single-day spike of coronavirus cases on Thursday, taking the total to 3,182. One more death was recorded, raising the fatality count to 31 in the district, the officials said.According to the daily health bulletin released by the state control room, a total of 2,136 people had been discharged, including 125 on Thursday, in the district so far. “As a result, the district now has 1,011 active cases,” the bulletin stated.On the other hand, the district achieved less than 60% of its target of collecting 4,000 samples in a day on the seventh day of the 10-day massive surveillance drive on Thursday.GB Nagar acting district surveillance officer Dr Manoj Kushwaha said that they were targetting their samples, which was 2,310 on Thursday, using different methods, including on-site rapid antigen kits, TrueNat machines, and lab-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-fearing-firs-three-doctors-two-nurses-resume-duties-at-pvt-hospital/story-CzvYDn3JFEXKKkKQqMg5VJ.html
09-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad proposes Haj House as 1,200-bed Covid care centre||In order to deal with rising number of cases, the Ghaziabad district administration has sent a proposal to the state government for converting the Haj House, located adjacent to GT Road on the banks of river Hindon, into a Covid care centre with 1,200 beds.The officials said the facility is proposed to be converted to a L1 category hospital for about 1,200 non-critical patients. Due to rise in number of Covid-19 cases, the health department has opened L1 category hospitals in Niwari and Modinagar and planning to open two more. However, none of the hospitals has more than 400 beds and there is a need to have more facilities as cases in July are being reported at an average of 114 a day.“Due to a rise in the number of Covid-19 patients, we have decided to convert the Haj House into a Covid care centre for asymptomatic patients. We have proposed 1,200 beds and all other infrastructure will be arranged soon. A proposal has also been sent to the state officials. I have directed the municipal commissioner to make the arrangements,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, Ghaziabad.Earlier in March, there were plans to use the Haj House as an isolation facility but no formal proposal was sent to the government.“The building is located away from city limits and also has a boundary enclosed space. Apart from the officials of the municipal corporation, I have also directed the officials of the minority department, electrical safety department and officials of the UP Jal Nigam to ensure that all facilities are in place within 10 days,” Pandey said.The Haj House had been marred in controversy since its inauguration in 2016 and could not be made operational as activists moved the National Green Tribunal seeking its demolition saying that it was located in the floodplains of river Hindon.On February 6, 2018, the NGT had dismissed the petition saying that the facility cannot be demolished as it does not fall in the flood plain zone. However, the tribunal directed its sealing in the absence of a specific capacity sewage treatment plant (STP).The tribunal had further directed the UP Haj Committee to ensure that there is STP to treat the domestic effluent of 136 KLD (kilolitres per day) installed and commissioned at the site as per the requirement of the UP pollution control board (UPPCB). The STP was installed and made operational as per directions.“All the legal issues are now resolved and the facility can be opened up,” Pandey added.Dinesh Chandra, municipal commissioner said that the corporation will soon take up all arrangements.“The basic arrangements will be taken up at the earliest. Since, this will be a big Covid-19 facility, we will require additional funds for putting in the required infrastructure. We will seek some funds from the district magistrate,” Chandra said.The district administration of Lucknow have also decided to convert the Maulana Ali Miyan Memorial Haj House on Kanpur Road in Sarojini Nagar area, into a Covid-19 care unit. Lucknow’s district magistrate Abhishek Prakash, who inspected the Haj House on Wednesday, said the decision had been taken in view of the rise in the number of asymptomatic Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-proposes-haj-house-as-1-200-bed-covid-care-centre/story-IAe93bndASp8GGtY49rK6K.html

09-07-2020||City||Gzb health dept finds anomalies in Covid-19 count as hospitals don’t update data on state portal||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad health department has found that a number of the district’s inactive coronavirus (Covid-19) disease cases were still reflecting as active cases on the state portal even though they had been cured and discharged from hospitals, its officials told HT.During an exercise conducted Wednesday, health department officials contacted about 450 patients, which were listed on the state portal as active Covid-19 patients, and found that a majority of them had already been discharged from hospitals but still reflected as active patients in records. These records are accessible to every hospital in the district via login IDs and passwords, and have to be updated daily with the number of patients admitted or discharged. Till July 8, the Ghaziabad district had the most number of cases among all 75 districts in Uttar Pradesh, with 1,477 active Covid-19 cases, according to the state portal. According to the report of the state control room on Wednesday, the district was the only one in the state to have more than 1,000 active cases to its tally and accounted for almost 14% of the 9,980 active cases in the state, till July 8.“The alarming rise in the number of cases was a growing concern. So, we roped in a team and pulled out a list of about 450 patients from the portal, who were slated to be at certain Ghaziabad hospitals. Then, we began telephoning the patients. We were surprised when they told us that they have already been discharged and are at home, which is how we came to know that some government and private hospitals in the district are still not updating data of discharged patients on to the portal,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.He said now, officials are taking up corrections and updating the figures on the state portal. He added that when teams spoke to patients, they found that some had been discharged as far back as 15-20 days ago.According to the latest discharge guidelines issued by the state government on June 19, if any asymptomatic patient shows no symptoms, he/she can be discharged without undergoing any test on the tenth day from their date of admission. However, such patients will have to remain in home quarantine for seven days after being discharged from the hospital.According to officials, the recovery rate of L1 category patients ranges from eight to 16 days while the L2 and L3 patients, having moderate to critical conditions, need full recovery before they can be discharged.“Since all government and private hospitals have login IDs and passwords over the portal, they are supposed to make immediate entries. Now, we are trying to rectify the anomaly and hope that our discharge rate goes up and the number of active cases comes down. If need be, we will also issue show-cause notices to the concerned officials and hospitals otherwise the issue could be repeated in future,” Dr Gupta added.Going by the health department’s figures for Ghaziabad, from a discharge rate of 66.66% discharge rate with a total of 66 patients up to April 30, it came down to 41.04% with a total of 2,612 cases till July 8. Likewise, the rate of active patients, at 33.33% till April 30, climbed to 56.54% by July 8.On the other hand, the rate of discharge of patients for the state stood at 65.25% out of a total of 31,156 cases till July 8, according to state figures.“Apart from this, we received complaints from some asymptomatic patients who were lodged at private hospitals that they were kept in hospitals for a period of about 14-15 days. After one such complaint was received recently, I intervened and asked the hospital authorities to discharge the patient immediately, as the guidelines state that asymptomatic patients need to be discharged after 10 days from their date of admission. The hospitals must avoid any such issues as it puts additional financial burden over the patient,” Dr Gupta added.The Ghaziabad district at present has total of 63 Covid-19-related deaths and the prime focus is now on reducing the death rate. The officials said that early tracing and testing of people having symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) or severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) and their immediate referral to appropriate Covid-designate hospitals is now being taken up.The district reported four deaths till May 31 while 51 were added in the month of June alone. In the ongoing month, eight deaths have been added so far, till July 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gzb-health-dept-finds-anomalies-in-covid-19-count-as-hospitals-don-t-update-data-on-state-portal/story-s9MD5klQU9IQJHTPvfqb7H.html

Officials, especially in NCR districts of Gurugram, Faridabad, Rohtak and Sonepat, are dealing with inaccurate and misleading personal details such as phone numbers, names and addresses provided by patients who appear for Covid-19 tests. Rohtak civil surgeon Dr Anil Birla said, “We have provided a list of five untraceable patients to local police and they are making efforts to find them. Every day, we see four to five reports where initial details for verification are missing. Most of the patients give wrong contact information. Now, we have asked the testing employees to verify the contact number and address of all people appearing for the Covid-19 test.”Sharing his experience with such patients, he said a doctor couple from Delhi had appeared for Covid-19 test last month and was found infected.“They claimed that they hailed from Rohtak. After their report arrived, we called on their number, but it was invalid. Then we contacted the Indian Medical Association and enquired whether they were registered with them or not. The medical body shared their address which was in Delhi’s Mayur Vihar. We informed the Delhi health department, following which they were hospitalised and their area was declared as a containment zone,” Birla said. Sonepat civil surgeon Dr BK Rajoura also raised similar concerns. He said they had been witnessing at least 10 such cases on a daily basis. A health department official, who didn’t want to be named, said across the state, there were over 2,500 corona patients who had given wrong information and many of them were yet to be traced. Dr Ramesh Punia, a biologist who is also Covid-19 quarantine in-charge in Hisar, said they trailed at least 150 people who had attended a wedding in Hisar last month after the groom’s father tested positive for Covid-19.“We managed to trace the guests with the help of the wedding photographer. Nearly 20 of them were found infected. In another case, a Hisar-based youth, who had tested positive, gave the wrong number and address. We had to track him on Facebook and contact his online friends before we could find him in person,” Punia added.In another case, Hisar health officials had to scan footage of 200 CCTV cameras to trace a 20-year-old shopkeeper, who had given lift to an infected transport company worker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wrong-contact-info-makes-tracing-uphill-task-in-haryana/story-0iCQ72siCw6k8VMdYkzEoJ.html

For this, we have issued notices to many property owners. We’ll issue three notices every week and even then, if they don’t apply, action will be taken.”“The fee for the licence is very nominal and depends on their turnover. We checked our records and found that only two parties had renewed their licence with us this year. Every trader has to apply for the licence which will be valid for one year and has to be renewed thereafter,” Rana added.MC commissioner Parth Gupta said, “This is an old practice and essential for traders. Normally, they don’t apply for one, but now they have to.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/trade-licence-made-compulsory-by-ambala-city-mc/story-O2MFP4d8fYNux718Dxp6RJ.html

It said despite giving four-five opportunities to the Delhi government, it still has not clarified the grievances in a plea that had sought testing and results of pregnant women.“A genuine human problem has been made into a bureaucratic nightmare. It is totally inexplicable. How long do we wait? Four to five opportunities have been given to address the issue since the filing of the petition,” the court said.The court said officials appeared to be “confused” and were “unable to understand that pregnant women do not go to a hospital 48 hours before the delivery”.“When a pregnant woman goes for delivery or surgery, they cannot wait for 48 hours for a result. Sometimes they go at the last moment. Your (Delhi government) secretaries should understand that pregnant women do not go 48 hours before delivery. …..As per your status report, they will be kept in isolation till the declaration of results without a family member close by. What kind of society are we living in?” the court said.The observations came after the Delhi government told the court that it had passed an order on July 5 on testing of high-risk patients and shared a status report. However, the court said the July 5 order does not include pregnant women, even though it has been mentioned in the status report.“Your July 5 order and status report are entirely contradictory,” it said while stating that there is a contradiction with regard to whether asymptomatic pregnant women need to undergo rapid antigen test.The court directed the Delhi government to correct the contradictions and clarify if asymptomatic pregnant women have to undergo Covid-19 testing before being admitted.“If yes, then the Delhi government should ensure the time taken for sample collection and declaration of results should be minimum,” the bench said while observing that pregnant women are being made to wait for 24-48 hrs for the reports.The Delhi government did not respond to requests for a comment.With these observations and directions, the court listed the matter for hearing on July 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/clarify-stand-on-covid-test-for-pregnant-women-hc-to-delhi-govt/story-gskwdM1xutsSN1ttyCYoSO.html
09-07-2020||Chandigarh||Delhi duo booked for duping Ludhiana man of ₹47 lakh in lieu of medical admission||The police have booked two Delhi-based agents for duping a Jamalpur resident of Rs 47.5 lakh on the pretext of facilitating his daughter and niece’s admission into a medical college in Delhi.The accused have been identified as Lucky and Rinku Singh.The accused were operating from office number 34, third floor, Sewak Park, Uttam Nagar, in Delhi. They have been booked under Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.The victim, Prem Chandra Sinha, who is working as a general manager in a steel unit here, told the police that he had come in touch with the duo in June 2018 after reading an advertisement in a leading English daily.“The duo assured admission for his daughter and niece under ‘national quota’ in a reputed medical college in Delhi,” said Sinha. The accused demanded Rs 50 lakh for the seats. However, the deal was struck at Rs 47.5 lakh.Prem said by July he had paid the amount through bank transactions, cheques and cash.“The duo had even presented documents proving that the names of both, my daughter and my niece, had appeared in the list of a noted medical college for MBBS and BDS courses,” said Sinha.Few months elapsed and they kept dilly-dallying the issue on the pretext of some technical glitch.When Sinha visited the college, he was shocked to find out that the list shown to him was fake and the admission process was long over.“The agents later visited the city and submitted in writing to the police that they had taken money for admission. They assured the return of money and gave cheques that were also dishonoured on presentation. The duo finally stopped answering calls afterwards,” said Sinha.He said he approached the police again and a case was registered at the Moti Nagar police station.Investigating officer Gurjeet Singh said the accused will be arrested soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/delhi-duo-booked-for-duping-ludhiana-man-of-47-lakh-in-lieu-of-medical-admission/story-qFCuJR2ELxMs8cjb5NyqXM.html

The Muslim foreign nationals were residents of Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka and South Africa.The court of additional sessions judge, Mewat, Prashant Rana in its July 6 order said none of the accused knew that they had coronavirus infection. “Their testing was conducted after the registration of the first information report (FIR). Even the investigating officer came to know about the infection of nine accused two days after the registration of FIR. Offences under sections 269 and 270 of the IPC were added merely on the basis of apprehensions and imaginations of the investigating officer,” the court said, puncturing the police theory.The judge held that all foreigners had valid passports and tourist visas. “There is no documentary evidence with the prosecution or any witness, who would say that the accused persons were holding Tablighi jamaat in any village. It does not amount to violation of any condition of their tourist visa. The accused had permission to visit India, travel across the country and stay here, in a legal manner, which they did. Hence, no offence under sections 14(B) and 14(C) of the Foreigners Act was made out,” reads the order. The court also asked the authorities to ensure safe return of the foreigners to their countries.The caseThe police had on April 2 booked 57 Muslim foreign nationals under sections 269, 270, 188, 120-B of the IPC and sections 14(b), 14(c) of the Foreigners Act. The prosecution said these foreigners were propagating religious teachings in a ‘Tablighi Jamaat’ without visa permission. The prosecution said the foreigners could not produce permission for religious teaching and their passports were seized.Nine of them were found to be coronavirus positive following their medico-legal examination. The accused though were not arrested being foreigners and from a particular religion, the prosecution said. Trial court struck down all charges except oneThe trial court, however, chargesheeted the accused for commission of offence under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC and struck down the sections pertaining to negligent and malignant acts likely to spread infection of disease danger­ous to life and violations of the Foreigners Act. The court on May 22 sentenced the accused to pay a fine of Rs 1,000 each for commission of offence under section 188 and directed the state to send them back to their respective countries. Aggrieved by the trial court’s orders of framing of charge under section 188, the Haryana government had filed a revision plea before the Mewat additional sessions judge, which was dismissed.

09-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi University ‘playing with the lives of students’, says HC, demands date-sheet before July 14||The Delhi High Court on Thursday came down heavily on Delhi University for its repeated postponement of the final-year students’ Online Open Book Examination (OBE) and directed the varsity to file an affidavit detailing the schedule of the examinations.The varsity, on Wednesday, through a notification, had pushed the date beyond August 15 after considering the University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines and the complaints received by the students regarding the mock test in the last two days.On Thursday, a bench of justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad, while hearing a bunch of pleas challenging the OBE exams, lambasted the university and said that the careers of thousands of final students were at stake and “turning turtle”. The court sought to know the reason for the postponement stating that DU was “dying to conduct the exams”.“We are not impressed and take everything with a pinch of salt. We all have gone through the examination process, which is nerve-wracking for students, more so during the times of the Covid-19 pandemic,” the bench said.“Why are you pushing the exams to a date beyond August 15, knowing that the careers of thousands of students are at stake? If you keep changing the date, where will the students go?” the court remarked.It asked that when the varsity was more than prepared as claimed by DU counsel Sachin Datta, then why were the exams being postponed even after August 15.Despite several attempts, however, DU’s Dean of Examinations Vinay Gupta did not respond to calls or text messages for comment. A senior official, though, on condition of anonymity, said: “The university will discuss the dates of the exam and inform the court in due time.”“You (DU) only see your own difficulties and not that of the students who might be suffering from Covid-19 or have infected family members. But you postponed the exam just because one of your officers was affected, without even worrying about thousands of students and their families. Their careers hinge on the exams,” Justice Hima Kohli said.Following this, the court asked the University’s counsel, senior advocate Sachin Datta, to file an affidavit detailing the schedule for the final-year undergraduate exams which have been postponed from July 10 to beyond August 15. The court also asked the varsity to explain in the affidavit as to how it proposes to conduct exams —online, off-line or both modes, besides the complete date sheet, providing clarity to students.The bench directed DU to file the affidavit by July 13 while asking it to mull over the schedule given by UGC and to come back with a firm datesheet and examination schedule.In the affidavit filed by DU on Thursday morning, it was averred that a meeting of a High-Powered Committee of the university took place on July 7 at 9.30pm to discuss exam-related matters and take stock of the developments pursuant to the revised guidelines issued by UGC on July 6.During the hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was representing the UGC, informed the court that on July 6 and July 8, it had issued a circular/ guidelines to all universities informing them that the examination process for final-year students must be completed by the end of September and the mode of conducting examination could be online, offline or a blend of both methods.On being asked by the court as to whether UGC insisted that exams be conducted to promote students, Mehta said exams were compulsory for final-year students and the process had to be completed by September 30.The matter will be now heard on July 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-university-playing-with-the-lives-of-students-says-hc-demands-date-sheet-before-july-14/story-ourGCM6wT8fLA8xmTOvaRI.html

This has led to the alleged misdiagnosis of some health care workers who succumbed to Covid-19-like illnesses. Late Dr Abhishek Bhayana’s death summary clearly mentions manifestations consistent with Covid-19 – tachypnea (shortness of breath), tachycardia (racing heart beat), reduced saturation of oxygen on room air. The diagnosis of the health-worker turned patient should be made taking Covid-19 into consideration until and unless proven otherwise,” the letter reads.A similar letter addressed to the chief minister by the Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association has asked for an expert committee to determine the cause of death. It says, “The young doctor was posted to the out-patient department of MAIDS. He developed sore throat, which was diagnosed as chest infection on X-ray and he tested negative for Covid-19. He succumbed to Myocardial Infarction (heart attack) as per the death summary of the hospital on July 2. Myocardial Infarction is a cardiovascular disease affecting the elderly and is unlikely in a young 26-year-old person,” the letter on Wednesday said.Dr Vijay Gurjar, assistant professor of geriatric medicine at AIIMS, has also come forward in support. “There was an 80-year-old woman in our hospital who tested negative for Covid-19 four times, she was treated as a Covid-19 patient as per clinical diagnosis. She had Covid-19 antibodies. The clinical judgement should be followed.” HT was unable to reach the woman in question. “Dr Abhishek Bhayana ... fell ill while on a visit to his home town in Rohtak. He reported last on duty at MAIDS on June 23. It has been learnt from the family of the deceased that his Covid-19 test reports were negative. MAIDS is a non-Covid-19 hospital and takes utmost care to screen and triage patients prior to rendering necessary patient care. Further, the institute takes adequate precautions in maintaining hospital infection control, providing regular training of healthcare workers of the institute,” a release from the director of the institute Dr Sangeeta Talwar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/consider-maulana-azad-junior-resident-s-death-as-covid-fatality-demand-delhi-doctors/story-ounUWaWE1K7YeFD4DimhaK.html

Almost 85% cases of murder, 100% of culpable homicide, 92% of attempt to murder, 98% of hurt and 84% of kidnapping/abduction were successfully solved in the first six months of 2020, the DGP said in a statement.There was a decline in the number of heinous crimes such as murder, attempt to murder, robbery, kidnapping for ransom in the first half of 2020, Yadava said, pointing out that in overall terms, crime against persons went down by 4.06% during this period.While the number of murder cases registered between January and June were 488 compared to 590 in 2019, the cases of attempt to murder also went down from 467 to 449 during the same period.The DGP said there was a massive fall in cases of wrongful confinement of persons as from 5,155 in 2019, the cases went down to 4,198 in 2020, registering 18.56% dip.

09-07-2020||Delhi||Mentally ill people in hospitals, shelters are traceable, why do they need IDs for testing, asks Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Thursday sought to know from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Delhi government why homeless mentally ill people needed to submit an identity proof in order to get tested for Covid-19 in the national capital.The court asked why there was a need for homeless mentally ill people to produce identity papers and valid phone number when many of them were institutionalised or in shelter homes and therefore, traceable. The court was hearing a PIL by advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal seeking directions to the ICMR and the Delhi government to suitably modify guidelines for Covid-19 testing of mentally ill homeless persons in Delhi.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan said such people (mentally ill who are institutionalised) should not be left out of the testing ambit and they, along with the mentally ill homeless persons on the streets, should be looked after.The court asked the additional solicitor general (ASG) Chetan Sharma, appearing for ICMR, the apex research body in the country, to consult its officials on what can be done to address this issue.“Once addressed, the same should also be communicated to all hospitals,” the bench said and gave the ICMR time till July 24 to find a solution and inform the court.The order came after the Institute for Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences (IHBAS), represented by advocate Tushar Sannu, told the court there were two hurdles in testing mentally ill persons admitted at IHBAS. Sannu said that according to the ICMR advisory of June 19, every person who is to be tested for Covid-19 has to provide a government issued identity proof and should have a valid phone number for tracing and tracking the individual and his/her contacts.He said a majority of mentally ill persons would not be able to satisfy either of these conditions and therefore, they cannot be tested for Covid-19. IHBAS suggested that the ICMR guidelines be suitably modified to address the hardship faced by mentally ill homeless persons.In its response to the plea, ICMR has said in its advisory, dated June 23, point of care diagnostic assay in combination with gold standard RT/PCR test is recommended for persons with neurological disorders, whether hospitalised, seeking hospitalisation or residing in hot spot areas.Delhi government, in its affidavit, said it was adhering to the ICMR advisory of June 19 which mandates that all patients being tested by any method must furnish a government-issued photo identity proof and a mobile phone number.It also said that “in the absence of any specific guidelines or rules for testing of homeless mentally ill or suspected mentally ill persons, the Delhi government was trying its best to do all that is necessary for such persons” .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mentally-ill-people-in-hospitals-shelters-are-traceable-why-do-they-need-ids-for-testing-asks-delhi-hc/story-wilVTdKvYapxiFY9g8LB0K.html
09-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi Police ASI succumbs to Covid-19||A 53-year-old assistant sub-inspector with the Delhi Police succumbed to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) at a private hospital in the national capital on Thursday morning, taking the total number of known deaths due to the disease in the police force to 13. He had received plasma from a colleague, but the therapy did not work on him. The policeman, Jeevan Singh Bisht, was posted to the motor transport department of the Delhi Police’s Special Branch. Its office in central Delhi’s Asaf Ali Marg has been part of a containment zone for over a month. “A total of 30 police personnel deployed at our office have tested positive so far, but this is the first death in our department,” Suman Nalwa, the deputy commissioner of police (Special Branch), said. Bisht, who lived in Noida with his wife, teenage son and 22-year-old daughter, was in charge of maintaining official vehicles. His daughter, who works for a private firm, said that he was a physically healthy man who had tested positive for Covid-19 on June 21. Neither the family nor the police know exactly how he got infected, but police officers said that he would visit the Special Branch office on alternate days for work. Initially, Bisht was admitted to a quarantine centre in Noida, but when his family realised that he wasn’t receiving food and water on time there, they got him moved to a private hospital in Lajpat Nagar the next day. “Here, he initially displayed no symptoms, but began facing breathing issues some days later. Doctors said the oxygen level in his blood was falling and he needed plasma treatment. Since that facility wasn’t available there, he was moved to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital on June 27,” DCP Nalwa said. A head constable from the Special Branch office donated plasma to him, but Bisht did not recover. His daughter said that their remaining family quarantined itself at home after his hospitalisation. “We had mild symptoms, but we didn’t get ourselves tested. Instead, we stayed in home isolation,” Bisht’s daughter said. The family last spoke to him over a video call on the day he was moved to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. “He couldn’t speak properly due to breathing issues. We asked him to rest instead of talking, but he kept asking about us,” his daughter said.Bisht, who was in the intensive care unit, passed away on Thursday morning. So far, the virus has infected more than 2,200 Delhi Police personnel. Of them, over 1,400 have recovered from the viral infection and resumed their duties, a Delhi Police spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-police-asi-succumbs-to-covid-19/story-YCLhHWAnH5I8WQNb39cEsL.html
09-07-2020||City||EPCA starts early review of measures to curb farm fires in view of Covid-19||New Delhi: Ahead of winter, the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) on Thursday asked officials of Delhi and its neighbouring states of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh to submit a status report of measures being taken by them to curb stubble burning this year. The status report is to be submitted every two weeks until October, the Authority said.Bhure Lal, EPCA chairman, said this year, they have started reviewing the measures being taken to prevent agriculture residue burning early, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, as a collision of these two could turn out to be a cause of public health concern. Both, the fumes resulting from the stubble burning and the Sars-Cov-2 virus affect the lungs.Farm fires from neighbouring states have been a major contributor to high levels of air pollution in parts of north India, including the National Capital and its surrounding areas, during winter months.“The states have been asked to ensure farmers have all the necessary tools to do away with paddy straw, which is otherwise put to fire to clear the fields. This time, with the pandemic still raging, states must ensure burning is minimised,” said Lal. The EPCA chief met officials from the states as well as those from the Union agriculture ministry via video-conferencing. He added that every two weeks until October, they will have a digital meeting with the four states to take stock of preparations to prevent the farm fires.“Enforcement has to be stepped up by all agencies. While in Delhi, which bears the impact of the fumes travelling from neighbouring regions, there is no crop residue burning reported as such, the major problem is of waste burning, which needs to be monitored closely,” said Lal.In addition, the respective state pollution control boards have been told to make extensive use of remote sensing technology to monitor incidents of crop stubble burning and take timely action, Lal said.Farm fires are at their peak during October and November, which is when paddy varieties are harvested and fields are cleared to be readied for sowing of Kharif crops. Delhi sees peak pollution levels during this period because of a combination of geographical factors, local emissions and fumes from farm fires in neighbouring states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/epca-starts-early-review-of-measures-to-curb-farm-fires-in-view-of-covid-19/story-MQHQSuCXs3nh0Q3pPjaijL.html

Delhi is gearing up to revive its economy despite facing many challenges in the aftermath of the pandemic, he said.“Delhi is a city of opportunities. Our state GDP has doubled in the past seven years and we have a per capita income of ₹3,89,000 which is three times the national average. We also have an effective people-centric government under the leadership of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. The highest growth on all economic indicators have been made possible due to the honest and progressive government which was re-elected for a third time with an overwhelming majority,” Sisodia told delegates at the Invest India Exclusive Investment Forum.Delhi’s GDP is around ₹8.56 lakh crore currently, as compared to ₹4.04 lakh crore seven years ago. The capital city’s current per capita income is ₹3,89,145 compared to the national per capita of ₹1,35,050, government data showed.Stressing on the range of trade and service sector opportunities for investment offered by the Delhi government, Sisodia said, “Contrary to public opinion, Delhi has a substantial land bank for investment in sectors such as tourism and hospitality, automobile parts, handloom and handicrafts, gems, jewellery and perfumes, packaged foods, leather goods and garments, steel fabrication, e-commerce, retail, and information technology. The upcoming industrial hubs in Ranikhera Mundka, Baprola and Kanjhawala along with the Mundka North Warehousing Cluster have ample capacity available and makes Delhi an ideal destination for companies looking to set up retail or sourcing operations.”The forum was attended by investors from 30 countries. As many as 20 industry sectors, including apparels, automobiles, e-commerce, health care and sportswear from countries such as the USA, Japan, Germany, the UK, Switzerland and Australia participated in the webinar on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/citing-delhi-s-high-gdp-and-per-capita-income-sisodia-woos-e-commerce-players/story-SFW5bNsSSLs1XmiiCcwmyK.html
09-07-2020||Delhi||Gangster who threw chilli powder at Delhi cops nabbed after 29 months in Siliguri||One of the Capital’s most wanted gangsters, who had fled from Delhi Police’s custody in 2018 after his associates allegedly threw chilli powder in the eyes of police personnel and exchanged fire at a government hospital, was arrested from Siliguri in West Bengal on Wednesday ending a 29 month-long search.Senior police officers on Thursday said the arrested gangster, Sandeep alias Dhillu, is a key confidant of jailed gangsters Neeraj Bawana, and Sunil alias Tillu Tajpuriya. Involved in nearly two dozen crimes, including murder, kidnapping, robbery, extortion, and attacking police personnel, Dhillu carried a reward of ₹2 lakh on his arrest. This was the highest reward announced by the Delhi Police on a wanted criminal after the arrest of another gangster Jitender alias Gogi against whom a reward of ₹4 lakh had been declared. According to the police, Dhillu’s group had a longstanding rivalry with Gogi and their enmity allegedly led to several murders in the national capital in the past five-six years. Gogi was caught along with his three associates from an apartment in Gurugram on March 3.Deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Pramod Singh Kushwah said several teams had been looking for Dhillu since he fled from police custody in February 2018. He had allegedly shot Gogi’s gang member, Monu Nepali, outside the Rohini court on directions of Tajpuriya (who was in jail) a month after fleeing, the police said.“Our team was tracking Dhillu’s movements since a long time, but he managed to give the police the slip. To avoid police attention, he had been using the latest communication and social media techniques to talk to his associates,” said Kushwah.In June, the DCP said, a team had raided his hideout in Rajasthan but Dhillu had escaped before the police could reach the spot. The team continued collecting intelligence about his latest hideouts and on July 5, the team learned about Dhillu’s hideout in Siliguri. Accordingly, a team was sent to arrest him. “On July 8, our team members spotted him in a market in Siliguri and caught him after a brief scuffle. His transit remand was secured and he has been brought to Delhi,” the DCP said.Originally from Haryana’s Jhajjar, Dhillu was first arrested in 2003 for his alleged involvement in the case of an attack on a police party and another case of murder and criminal conspiracy. Since then, Dhillu has allegedly been active in criminal activities in Delhi and Haryana, said a special cell officer associated with the operation, asking not to be indentified.Dhillon was last arrested in 2015 in a murder and assault case, and was lodged in Mandoli jail. On February 19, he was brought to Maulana Azad Institute of Dental Sciences in Central Delhi’s Daryaganj for a dental check-up by police personnel. Around 11.20am that day, Dhillu’s associates arrived on three motorcycles, and allegedly threw chili powder on the personnel, using the cover of the commotion to escort him away from police custody.An exchange of fire between the personnel and Dhillu’s associates also took place and no one was injured in the incident, which took place barely a kilometre from the then Delhi Police headquarters. The three policemen who were escorting Dhillu were suspended.“As Dhillu continued his criminal activities after the escape in an organised manner, a case under Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) was also registered against him,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gangster-who-threw-chilli-powder-at-delhi-cops-nabbed-after-29-months-in-siliguri/story-4OjkyWAdH70wP2fT5MsHQJ.html

09-07-2020||Chandigarh||Consider claim of 7 retd HFS officers for grant of IFS induction benefits: Tribunal||The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) has directed the Union government to consider the claim of seven retired Haryana Forest Services (HFS) officers for grant of benefit of induction into Indian Forest Services (IFS) against their relevant select lists. The applicants had sought directions to the Union government to consider their case for induction into IFS as per the selection lists of 2008-2009.“Applicant Balbir Singh joined Haryana forest department as forest ranger in 1982 and was inducted into HFS from January 12, 2001 and April 1, 2001 and confirmed as such with effect from November 1, 2008 and December 1, 2009,” it was mentioned. As per IFS Regulations, 1966, an SFS officer becomes eligible for induction into IFS against promotion quota after eight years of service. The applicants claimed that despite availability of vacancies and their eligibility, recruitment to IFS by way of promotion could not be finalised for the years 2008-2015 primary due to disputed seniority lists and court cases.It was following high court’s direction that seniority list was issued in 2015 and meeting of selection committee for induction of SFS officers into IFS was held in 2018 for years 2008-2015. By this time, the applicants had retired.However, the Haryana government proposed to the Union government that all 16 HFS officers, including applicants in selection lists of 2008 to 2015, may be appointed as IFS officers.The Union government issued notification in May 2020 appointing various persons as IFS officers, but applicants’ names were missing. Following this, they moved tribunal. The tribunal chaired by Sanjeev Kaushik and Ajanta Dayalan observed, “It is undisputed that state of Haryana has specifically recommended 16 HFS officers (including the applicants) may be induced to IFS. It is also not in dispute that at relevant point of time, the applicants were eligible, available and within the zone of considerations.”“The applicants cannot be made to suffer on the part of delay caused by the authorities...on the relevant date they were in employment and as such cannot be denied appointment to IFS,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/consider-claim-of-7-retd-hfs-officers-for-grant-of-ifs-induction-benefits-tribunal/story-ifHZhdI7xO4lqtpqwcT2mO.html

A meeting of the STF is expected to take place on July 20 in Chandigarh.Sources in the civic body said that the MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal also slammed the PPCB officials for not being able to conduct a survey of scattered units till this time.On the demand of Punjab Dyers Associations, directions were also issued to the PPCB officials for taking action against the scattered dyeing units, if the owners fail to get these units attached with Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETP) and continue dumping untreated waste in the nullah. Ashok Makkar, Bobby Jindal and Vijay Mehtani represented the dyers in the meeting and said that the construction work of CETPs for units at Tajpur road and Focal point would be completed within three months.Sabharwal said, “The demarcation process has been commenced and officials of the irrigation and revenue department are also involved in the same. It will be completed in 15 days. After identifying the encroachments, notices would be issued and encroachments would be removed for beautification and widening of the nullah.”“When we visited Bhaimiyan village to inspect the demarcation process, I saw around a dozen dairy units dumping waste in the nullah in Bhamiyan village, but the PPCB officials have not planned to deal with the issue,” said Sabharwal.Spokesperson of Naamdhari sect, Sukhvinder Singh Lyall said, “Satguru Uday Singh has sought a final survey report on dairy and dyeing units in the city including the scattered units from PPCB within a week. The reports would be tabled in the next meeting of STF, which is also mulling shifting of dairy units outside the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stf-chief-inspects-demarcation-process-of-buddha-nullah-seeks-report-on-scattered-dairy-dyeing-units/story-UT3Oss29IX80XJTkNBrSpL.html
09-07-2020||Chandigarh||Confusion over new Himachal BJP chief after Vijayvarigya’s congratulatory tweet||Rajya Sabha member Indu Goswami was mistaken to be Himachal’s new BJP chief after the party’s national general secretary Kailash Vijayvarigya congratulated her for being appointed to the post on Twitter.“Congratulations and Best Wishes!!! Congratulations and best wishes to Indu Goswami for being appointed as Himachal BJP President,” Vijayvargiya wrote on his official twitter handle at 10:46pm on Wednesday.Since speculations were already rife that Goswami may be the new BJP chief of the state, people took Vijayvarigya’s tweet as confirmation.Goswami’s supporters, BJP workers and some lower rung leaders flooded her Facebook page with congratulatory messages.However, the state party executive denied having information about Goswami being appointed as the new state chief.Confusion prevailed for over 12 hours until Vijayvargiya deleted the tweet on Thursday afternoon and clarified that his team had tweeted the message by mistake on the basis information received from a news link.“My team wrongly tweeted about Indu Goswami being appointed as new Himachal BJP on the basis of a link. In fact, no one has been given the responsibility of the state yet. Error is regretted” he tweeted.He also tagged national president JP Nadda, union minister Anurag Singh Thakur and party general secretary Arun Singh in the tweet.SHIP WITHOUT CAPTAIN The Himachal BJP is without a captain since May 27 after then president Rajeev Bindal resigned after his name cropped up in a scam in the state health department.Bindal was appointed on January 18. Indu Gowami is a front-runner for the post given her organisational skills and her links in the power corridors in Delhi.Hailing from Baijnath in Kangra district, Indu Goswami started her career as a student leader. She worked with Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he was in-charge of party affairs in Himachal in late 90s.Goswami served as the chairperson of the Himachal Pradesh State Commission for Women from 1998 to 2000. She was the chief of state Bharatiya Janata Mahila Morcha from 2016 to 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/confusion-over-new-himachal-bjp-chief-after-vijayvarigya-s-congratulatory-tweet/story-zIPEsuDsosyxqFurXz8JSO.html

09-07-2020||City||LIT removes encroachments in Model Town extension area||The Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) razed encroachments from around 1.25 acres of land in the Model town extension (part 1) area on Thursday amid heavy rainfall.A heavy police force was deployed during the anti-encroachment drive to avoid any untoward incident. Last week, LIT executive engineer Jagdev Singh was manhandled when the trust made an attempt to raze the encroachments. The LIT officials also suspected that the encroachers might create a ruckus to avoid action. The drive continued till evening and the LIT officials postponed the drive to vacate another chunk of land (1800 yards) in the same area after the residents and local Congress leaders claimed that the residents have proof of ownership. The residents have been given time to present ownership documents, otherwise, encroachments would be removed.LIT chairman, Raman Balasubramaniam said, “The land has been encroached upon for over two decades and the shanties established at the site have been razed in a peaceful manner in presence of police force. Few residents claimed that they have ownership documents pertaining to a chunk of land and they have been given time to produce the documents, otherwise action would be taken against them.”The LIT had made an attempt to raze the encroachments last week, but a resident Ravinder Sonu manhandled executive engineer Jagdev Singh. The situation went out of control and LIT had to postpone the drive. The police had booked Sonu and raids were being conducted to nab the accused.Around 60 families left homelessThe drive conducted by the LIT left around 60 poor families homeless, which have been residing in the shanties for over two decades.The labourers said they have nowhere to go to amid the pandemic and their goods and furniture, kept in open, would also get damaged due to rainfall. One of the labourers, Rakesh said, “We are left homeless, and finding a place on rent amid the pandemic will prove to be a herculean task. We were living here for around 25 years.” The labourers rued that they cannot even move back to their hometowns and would be forced to sleep on roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lit-removes-encroachments-in-model-town-extension-area/story-ywGshemIewH7X3umxLetFI.html

The ongoing rumblings in Grand Alliance (GA) in Bihar with regard to seat sharing and other related issues brought the two main parties of the alliance, the RJD and the Congress, on the dinner table on Wednesday night, but it failed to break much ice.The Congress team comprised AICC in-charge for Bihar, Shaktisinh Gohil, BPCC president Madan Mohan Jha, Rajya Sabha MP Akhilesh Prasad Singh and Congress Legislature party leader Sadanand Singh while RJD was represented by leader of opposition in Bihar assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and former CM Rabri Devi.The “dinner diplomacy”, which continued well past 10 pm on Wednesday, veered around talks related to seat-sharing and role of smaller parties in the alliance.Sources in the Congress said that though the talks were held in cordial atmosphere, the RJD has been communicated that the oldest party of India would “not accept anything less than an honourable settlement.”“We are not prepared to be meted out with old treatment,” said a Congress leader, wishing not to be quoted.A senior Congress leader said that party wanted to contest at least two seats every district, which puts the total seats to 76. “The JD(U) had contested on 100 seats when it was part of the Grand Alliance, so we would definitely like to get a majority share of its seats, plus would like to retain our winning seats,” said a party leader.The Congress had contested on 41 seats in 2015 and won 21, with a vote share of 6.7%, while the RJD had contested on 101 seats and won 80 seats with a vote share of 16.8%.The Congress delegation also tried to convince the RJD leaders to “respect and take along other alliance partners together.”Congress leaders, in a bid to prevent desertion from alliance, also held a meeting with HAM-S president Jitan Ram Manjhi on Thursday evening and tried to convince him not to take “any drastic step.”Sources said Manjhi was informed by the Congress leaders about the concerns of smaller parties to the RJD, which has assured to look into their grievances. If sources are to be believed, Manjhi also told the Congress about the “immature” behaviour of leader of opposition. The meeting with Manjhi lasted more than an hour.Manjhi’s party, which contested the Lok Sabha elections as part of the Grand Alliance, had demanded a discussion on the forthcoming polls on issues of seat adjustment, candidates, etc. It had also demanded immediate need for a co-ordination committee in the GA by June 25.Senior BJP leader and deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi took a dig over internal rumblings in GA. “The number one party of GA (RJD) has rejected demands of co-ordination committee, and has even ignored senior Dalit leader’s ultimatum. The number two party has virtually become spineless, while other parties are like slaves,” said Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dinner-with-tejashwi-tea-with-manjhi-cong-sues-for-peace-in-ga/story-yMsUbed2PVNJrUoElECJcN.html

There were 76 samples from Ghaziabad and one of them was positive.” There were two more instances of the coronavirus infection from prisons of the adjoining districts in western Uttar Pradesh, but those inmates have now recovered and returned to the jails, he said.Prison authorities have stepped up precautionary measures and introduced quarantine system for new prisoners, and started offering inmates ‘kaadha’ -- a traditional concoction of herbs and spices -- to boost their immunity and check the spread of the infection.“Screening is done regularly and any inmate with symptoms like cough or fever is isolated. They are also offered ‘kaadha’. New prisoners are kept in temporary jail in quarantine for 14 days unless they test Covid-19 negative,” Mishra said.Gautam Buddh Nagar and Ghaziabad are two of the districts worst-hit in Uttar Pradesh by the pandemic. The two districts, adjoining Delhi, together have nearly 2,500 active cases of Covid-19 and recorded 93 deaths, according to official figures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/3-inmates-of-noida-ghaziabad-jails-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-oO3KzpD0PGWywY3wSF4wdL.html

In a letter sent to the Prime Minister’s office, the industrialists stated that the policy will not only help owners to get an incentive for old polluting vehicles with low value but will also boost the automobile sector which is facing a crisis due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. President of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertaking (CICU) Upkar Singh Ahuja and general secretary Pankaj Ahuja said, “The announcement of the policy is hanging fire for a long time and if introduced, it would bring some relief to the automobile sector which is reeling under slowdown.”CICU organising secretary, JS Bhogal said, “The vehicle scrappage policy would reduce old polluting vehicles on roads. With the resale value of vehicles beyond 15 years being extremely low, these vehicles can be sent to scrap yards with some sort of monetary compensation to owners which could ensure two benefits - an incentive for owners to get rid of such vehicles and putting these polluting vehicles out to save the environment.”Further reusing/recycling of scrap material like steel and aluminium can be used for manufacturing new vehicles. The scrap can also be made available to the steel industry, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/introduce-vehicle-scrappage-policy-to-boost-automobile-sector-cicu-urges-centre/story-8V0XTcpkmk5nLtDvtijJvJ.html

Gurdeep had told the CBI that he had already paid Rs 2 lakh to Jaswinder for not lodging a cheating case against him and was to pay Rs 3 lakh more.In her application, the suspended cop stated that when she was posted as the station house officer (SHO) of Manimajra, a complaint was received against Gurdeep and his wife that they had allegedly duped one Randhir Singh of Rs 30 lakh on the pretext of a government job. She said that on June 21, a compromise was brokered between them by Bhagwan Singh and the money was part of the compromise between the two parties.In her application she said there was no proof of any demand of bribe. “The CBI has registered an FIR on distorted facts. Even the 14-page long recorded conversation between Gurdeep Singh and Bhagwan Singh, has no mention of the bribe,” the application stated.She stated that Gurdeep is a man with a “chequered past” and is an accused in a job- for-money scam. “He is facing trial and Randhir Singh is the witness against Gurdeep in the case,” the cop stated in her application, adding that Gurdeep was even interrogated with regard to his role in the JBT scam at Chandigarh.In her plea, Jaswinder said that she apprehends arrest “because of the mounting pressure and media reports”.The court has asked the CBI to revert by Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/graft-case-suspended-cop-jaswinder-kaur-files-anticipatory-bail-plea-says-she-was-framed/story-WyK27uXqlYIrzAq28QFEZN.html

Pune-based firm Sonai Cooperative Society quoted ₹315 per kg (desi ghee) and ₹225 per kg (milk powder). Milkfed quoted ₹399 per kg and ₹250 per kg, respectively,” the SGPC office-bearers said.Mehta said, “Had we allotted the tender to Milkfed, the SGPC exchequer would have spent ₹5.2 crore extra in three months.”He also said, “Tender allotted to Milkfed for the supply of Verka fresh milk at ₹38 per litre expired on March 31. Due to the lockdown, we asked the Milkfed to continue the supply of milk at the same rate. However, they jacked up the rate to ₹42 per litre even as milk prices came down.”The SGPC office-bearers said they received 41kg less desi ghee in 37 tins a few months back and when the matter was brought to the notice of the Milkfed managing director, he termed it a technical fault. “Randhawa should remove the shortcomings in his department, instead of targeting the SGPC,” Mehta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tenders-for-dairy-products-to-pune-firm-as-per-rules-sgpc/story-aMYx4u9LmOYlTxgeSYrmuN.html

The langar of diesel and petrol was a symbolic protest to wake the state government up from its slumber and think about the plight of the farmers and middle class,” Gosha said.SAYS NO PERMISSION NEEDED FOR CHARITYAsked if he had taken the permission from authorities to hold the langar, he said, “No one needs permission to do charity. I have been doing langar sewa for four months.”Station house officer (SHO) of Division No 1 police station Harjit Singh said that no permission was sought to hold the event. He said that Gosha has been asked to report at the police station.Gumber, who helped in the distribution of fuel slips, said, “We have been distributing ration for four months and today we distributed fuel for free to register our protest. We appeal to the government to bring down taxes on fuel and help check the rising prices.”COMMUTERS MAKE MOST OF THE OFFERPardeep Kumar, an autorickshaw driver from Salem Tabri area, said that the pandemic led to a drop in the number of passengers but now he is also struggling to make ends meet due to the fuel price hike. “I saw Gosha and his supporters offering slips of one litre of diesel for free. I did not waste time and took the slip to save Rs 70 on diesel,” he said.Ankur Sood, a commuter, said, “I came on a motorcycle to fill petrol when I saw the langar. It was a golden opportunity but the government should cut the fuel prices.”Gosha had earlier organised a langar of milk in front of liquor vends to register his protest against the state government for allowing liquor shops to operate during the Covid-19 curfew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-youth-akali-dal-leader-holds-fuel-langar-to-protest-price-hike/story-QG75I6wiKoGpzwntqTVCUO.html

It is a private lab which is conducting the Covid-19 diagnostic tests and it has shown many negative cases as positive. After we rechecked the reports with the National Institute of Virology (NIV), we found the reports to be negative,” said Ram, who issued an order late on Wednesday. “We have not received any notice or any intimation so far so.

09-07-2020||Bangalore||Karnataka HC stays state government’s order banning online classes by schools||The Karnataka High Court has stayed the Karnataka government’s order banning conduct of online classes by schools stating that banning it encroaches upon the Fundamental Right to Life and Education. The State government had passed orders on July 15 and 27 imposing a ban on conduct of online classes from LKG to Class X. “The executive orders passed by the State Government cannot curtail the fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 21A of the constitution,” a division bench noted in its interim order. The court observed that the academic year has already started and the only way to provide education is through online teaching. The bench also noted that denying online classes on the ground that certain sections of the society do not have the facility was not a reason to impose restrictions. The court, however, made it clear that the order should not be perceived that the schools have the right to make online education mandatory or collect extra fees in the name of online classes. Two days ago, the expert committee formed by the Karnataka government to look into the modalities of online classes during the Covid-19 pandemic,submitted its report. It gave a slew of recommendations and fixed the time slot for the online classes. After receiving the report, Karnataka Primary and Secondary Education Minister S Suresh Kumar said the government would review the recommendations and take a decision accordingly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-hc-stays-state-government-s-order-banning-online-classes-by-schools/story-y4kh3nM5tIfO1NFIrDyueI.html

The FDRC, located at the Knowledge Park police station in Greater Noida, was inaugurated by Police Commissioner Alok Singh on Wednesday, the officials said. “To give professional counselling a primal place in conflict resolution, the Gautam Buddh Nagar police is partnering with domain experts from the Sharda University to resolve cases of marital and relationship discord at its new Family Dispute Resolution Centre,” Deputy Commissioner of Police, Women Safety, Vrinda Shukla said. The centre aims at providing effective intermediation with the participation of experts in matters of familial conflicts and domestic disputes, according to a police spokesperson. “At this centre, efforts will be made to resolve cases of domestic and family disputes and other similar conflicts by mediation of clinical psychologists, psychiatry, law experts and police personnel so that maximum number of families can be saved from bickering,” the spokesperson said. Amid changing environment of family and social values, domestic disputes are “increasing rapidly” among the couples in a family, which often turn into criminal cases, the police said. “Every year thousands of families get split, which weakens our society and takes it back. This increases the burden on the criminal justice system,” the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/counselling-centre-set-up-to-nip-domestic-conflicts-noida-police/story-K73pGxtvX4Lu2wK37DzcjP.html

Two of the positive patients are undertrials in jail, four are pregnant women, five are inter-state travellers and three are nursing staff members of the local Government Rajindra Hospital. With this, the district’s coronavirus case count has gone up to 484.FEAR OF QUARANTINE MAKESVISITORS HIDE TRAVEL HISTORYThe civil surgeon said: “Inter-state travellers coming from Delhi and Haryana are turning out to be the main reason behind spike in Patiala district. People coming from these states are not informing health authorities about their visit. The fear of being quarantined makes visitors hide their travel details. Some turn violent and abuse health workers when they are identified.”Dr Malhotra said though vigil has been stepped up at inter-state borders but frequent travellers sneak in through link roads.A health department official admitted that more than 60% of cases are of inter-state travellers and their contacts. The cases started increasing after the lockdown restrictions were relaxed by the Centre.The Punjab government has started e-registration of inter-state travellers from July 7. Patiala senior superintendent of police Mandeep Singh Sidhu said check-posts have put up at Shambhu on the national highway and other points in Samana, Patran and Ghanaur.“We are not letting any visitor to enter Punjab without e-registration on COVA app. Even transit vehicles and transport vehicles are covered under this process,” he said.SANGRUR MAN DIES COVID-19, 14 TEST POSITIVEIn neighbouring Sangrur district, 14 people tested positive on Thursday, while a 59-year-old resident of Ahmedgarh town succumbed to Covid-19 at a private hospital in Ludhiana on Wednesday.Health department officials said the patient was suffering from fever, cough and breathlessness.

09-07-2020||Ranchi||Workers divided into ‘Pod’ at Jamshedpur Tata Steel||Tata Steel has rolled out a novel system called Pod that will minimize the number of workers at a given time and place to reduce the risk of infection among them, company officials said here on Tuesday.This apart, the steel giant has also brought in scientific contact tracing through a ‘Suraksha Card’, CCTVs, drone cameras, crowd sensing (assemblage analysis), face detection and social distancing checks and replacing biometric attendance by thermal scanning and radio frequency identification (RIFD), ending all possible manual touch interactions in its Jamshedpur, Kalinganagr and Angul plants.“We are first among the corporates to develop and design a novel Pod system in partnership with Boston Consulting Group (BCG). It has been implemented across Jamshedpur, Kalinganagar and Angul. It can be best described as a multilayer protection to break the chain of transmission. These measures are beyond the stipulated SOPs and MHA guidelines, which are, anyway, being strictly followed by the organisation,” Kulvin Suri, Tata Steel chief (corporate communication), said.As the name suggests, the Pod concept is modularization of the workforce into pods. The idea is to divide the staff seating arrangement into small units, called pods, thereby restricting inter-pod movement. The factory workforce has been divided into hundreds of pods across locations and departments.“Each pod can have a maximum of 10 workers with a self-contained set of skills so that they do not have to depend on anyone outside their group for closing an assigned job. Additionally, to reduce the risk of contamination across shifts, a 30-minute air gap is maintained between two shifts and it also enables easy and prompt contact tracing,” said Runa Rajeev Kumar, Tata Steel corporate communication head here.“Fifteen minutes before the shift ends, each work area and tools are sanitised. Exit is only allowed through designated gates. Employees of the next shift enter 15 minutes later through a separate gate and again clean the work area and tools before usage,” she added. Another measure introduced by the company is real-time workforce tracking through ‘Suraksha Card’, a device which can communicate using Long Range Wide Area Network. Its features have been further enhanced to sense (spot and record) a gathering of large group of people in any section of the workplace through the crowd sensing (assemblage analysis) solution and it detects violation of social distancing at shop floors, canteens and on roads inside the factory premises.With historical data, the Suraksha Card enables scientific contact tracing. Additionally, Suraksha Card bar code scan provides the risk profile of the person with respect to their travel history, contact history or proximity to any Covid patient during the course of work inside the workplace. A centralized portal and a mobile-based app has been developed to monitor the safe working of the workforce .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tata-steel-splits-workers-into-pods-scientific-tracing-to-contain-covid/story-zdXLQBHI8ps9kfDZ5OTojN.html
09-07-2020||Chandigarh||Stop Punjab Police SIT probe into sacrilege cases, CBI urges Mohali court||Chandigarh/Jalandhar: Two days after a special investigation team (SIT) named Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim as an accused in the 2015 theft of a ‘bir’ (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib, the CBI on Wednesday moved a Mohali court, urging it to stop Punjab cops from carrying out a “parallel probe” in the sacrilege cases.The CBI plea, filed by the additional superintendent of police Anil Kumar Yadav, claims that the agency is still conducting a probe in these cases and there can’t be two simultaneous investigations by two agencies in the same cases.The parallel investigation conducted by Punjab Police, amounts to violation of established procedure of the law, the plea said.The special CBI court has issued notice to Punjab and others parties and according to the defence counsel, Vivek Gulbadhar, and the next hearing will take place on July 10.After outrage over three sacrilege incidents in 2015, the then SAD-BJP government had handed over the probe to the central agency.TWISTS AND TURNS IN THE CASEOn July 4, 2019, the CBI had filed a closure report giving a clean chit to some dera followers who were named as sacrilege accused by the deputy inspector general (DIG) Ranbir Singh Khatra-led SIT in the chargesheet.The Same accused were arrested by Khatra-led SIT a few days ago.“We had filed a closure report but on July 29, 2019, when the agency got a letter from the special DGP, Bureau of Investigation of Punjab Police (Parbodh Kumar was holding this charge that time), in which some fresh leads related to the case were shared and he requested the CBI undertake further investigation,” the CBI plea said.In pursuant of the letter, an application was filed in the special CBI court in Mohali on August 26, 2019, to keep the closure report in abeyance till conclusion of further investigation, said the plea.The court on November 20, 2019, directed the CBI to file the status report of investigation and the same was filed on January 8 this year.In September 2019, a Punjab government notification withdrew consent to the CBI to probe the case. The CBI challenged it in the Punjab and Haryana high court, which in December 2019 upheld the state government’s notification.The agency challenged the order in the Supreme Court. The top court in February dismissed the CBI’s plea against withdrawal of consent by Punjab to probe cases.CASES STILL WITH CBIIn Wednesday’s application, the CBI claimed that the apex court dismissed its special leave petition (SLP) on the ground of delay in filing it but has left the ‘question of law’ open.The CBI claimed it also challenged the apex court’s decision by filing a special leave petition on March 5, 2020, and the same is pending before the apex court.The plea said the CBI has not been denotified by the Government of India from these cases and the notification of empowering the agency to investigate these cases still exists.“The Punjab government had requested the Centre on a couple of occasions to hand over the investigation of these cases to the state. The last such letter was sent by Punjab on May 14 and the decision to return these cases is yet to be taken by the CBI. These facts show that the investigation has not been handed over to Punjab and the cases are still with the CBI,” reads the plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stop-punjab-police-sit-probe-into-sacrilege-cases-cbi-urges-mohali-court/story-sgbaSuEIUoq2x9ni7MkxAM.html

09-07-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab has been a CSR-deficit state, it’s time it got its fair share||For the past three decades, Dr Sandeep Goyal has worn many hats – a veteran adman, entrepreneur, investor, author, and head of a think-tank – but he has always been itching for new challenges. Goyal has taken up the unenviable task of helping his home state Punjab get its “fair share of CSR spends”. HT spoke to the first CEO of the newly constituted Punjab CSR Authority about the task at hand and challenges ahead. Excerpts: What made you take up this assignment? I am a Chandigarh boy – St John’s High School and DAV College – but have been away from the city for nearly 40 years now. I took up this assignment last month purely as “give back” to my home state. I am working pro bono for the government and will try to use, and leverage, my 36 years in corporate India to the state’s advantage. I have been Group CEO of Zee, and founder chairman of Dentsu India among other assignments over the years. I have had the privilege of working with large corporates. I am hoping to use some of that outreach to advantage in my new role. Punjab has a minuscule share of less than 1% of the total CSR spending by industry. How do you plan to improve this? Yes, Punjab has been a CSR (corporate social responsibility) deficit state. The state does not get its fair share of CSR spends. The state ranks quite low on India Inc’s priority list for CSR. The state has received just Rs 234 crore of the total Rs 42,467 crore of CSR spending by industry across all the different states and UTs between 2015-16 and 2017-18. There are no easy answers on how to channelize more funds except that I am preparing an action plan for Punjab domiciled companies, to focus their spends in the state. Also, I am starting to get in touch with the BSE 100 companies across the country that have substantial CSR budgets, and a Punjab presence of some size, to get them to consider some of their CSR allocations to Punjab. What special efforts are being planned? We are working on a destination for CSR funds for these companies prioritised along the lines of actual spends of BSE 100 companies in sectors such as education and skilling so that there is synergistic opportunity for fund allocation. We have already written to Punjab companies to understand how current CSR monies are being spent and what the state government can do to ensure there are no external leakages. Also, efforts are being made to reach out to corporates to support start-ups in the state by supporting incubators and accelerators as multipliers of business opportunities. How will you persuade companies in times of Covid-19? The present situation in corporate India is grim. Covid has played havoc with revenues and profits this year. I doubt there will even be any surpluses to actually support CSR allocations in most companies. The situation is likely to remain gloomy for quite some time. CSR is voluntary, not mandatory. There are no compulsions in the law. No penalties, only guidelines. My job is to do the best with one-on-one persuasion by reaching out and getting better sense to prevail. Punjab companies are also spending more CSR funds outside the state. What can be done to change this? The best we can do is to request, and persuade, Punjab companies to not take their funds outside. So far, that has perhaps not been proactively done. Owners and managements have perhaps not been sensitised that they need to help the state and not take their benevolence outside. I am hoping my meetings and appeals will help. Still, it is the choice and discretion of individual companies. What steps have been taken so far? No magic wand as yet. I am trying to prepare the action plan to put a method and purpose into the entire system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-has-been-a-csr-deficit-state-it-s-time-it-got-its-fair-share/story-27Y9D2cLeXYohsarvbJmMP.html

09-07-2020||Delhi||Delhiwala: Billi with no distancing manners||The cat quietly ambles towards him, circles around his feet—slowly and thoughtfully—as if she were an elderly neighbor taking a walk in the park.The masked man in red sandals doesn’t seem startled by the cat’s proximity to his person. “We meet everyday,” he says in a tone that hints a wide smile.The cat lives on the pavements of this quiet part of south Delhi’s East of Kailash. It is difficult to find out where exactly she sleeps at night, but during the day she is always seen loitering about the neighborhood’s popular Mother Dairy milk booth—one of the few places that stayed open during the strict lockdown months triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. The aforementioned man is a customer waiting for his turn in the queue. He stands responsibly inside one of the (already fading) yellow circles drawn on the pavement to maintain physical distancing.It turns out that the cat knows many regulars to the milk booth. Now another man appears and she lunges towards him. She settles down on his shoes as if it were her living room sofa. The man—he too is in a mask—mutters some indecipherable words to her. He says it’s French language—he’s from France, currently living in Delhi, he explains. The Frenchman now turns his attention back to the cat and speaks some more French words to her. One doesn’t know if this cat can understand any human language, but she seems absorbed by his white mask.Nobody seems to know about the cat’s background. Not the pavement tailor nearby, not the pavement vegetable seller (who gives huge bundles of green chillies and dhaniya leaves for free with every purchase), not the security guard outside the ATM, not the police constable standing with a notepad, not even the person manning the milk booth, who says—“I know her, we are friends.” The gentleman informs that the cat has a name. “She’s called Billi.”But Billi is simply the Hindi for cat.The man shrugs.The milk booth customer in red sandals butts in, saying, “Yes, many people in the area call her Billi.” He also says that the milk booth owner feeds her regularly with.... well, milk of course.Handing over a yoghurt packet to a customer, the milk booth man looks conscious and smiles out of embarrassment, as if wishing his tender side hadn’t been outed.Indeed, there are many such tender-hearted people in this stretch, including tea stall owner Mayawati, who would regularly walk from her faraway home—even during the lockdown—just to feed a stray dog in the area.Some minutes later the customers leave. Nobody is to be seen. The man at the booth disappears somewhere inside his booth. It is deathly still. Billi, the cat, ambles back to where the customers were standing in a queue some minutes ago. She circles around one of the empty yellow circles. Who can tell if she is enjoying the circle’s emptiness, or missing the usual pair of human legs standing inside it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwala-billi-with-no-distancing-manners/story-GjvcNmBCK46AYMtl5jUyjL.html
09-07-2020||Mumbai||Education department to reduce syllabus soon||After the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) announced reduction in syllabus owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, the Maharashtra education department on Wednesday said that it is also working to reduce the syllabus of the state board. Dinkar Patil, director, Maharashtra State Council of Educational Research and Training (MSCERT), said, “A decision with the details will come in the next few days.” A senior official from the education department said, “We have been working on syllabus reduction since the past two months, way before the CBSE and CISCE announced their decisions. A final outline of the reduced syllabus will be out soon.” On Wednesday, fake messages claiming to have details of the revised syllabus were doing the rounds on social messaging applications. CISCE, which governs the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) and Indian School Certificate (ISC) exam, on July 2 announced a reduction in syllabus for Class 10 and 12 by up to 25% for the academic year 2020-21. Five days later, on July 7, CBSE announced up to 30% reduction in the syllabus for Classes 9 to 12 for the current academic year. Some of the chapters removed from the syllabus include secularism, nationalism, federalism, demonetisation, GST, India’s foreign relations with neighbouring countries and citizenship. Experts said the state board needs to announce a reduction in syllabus soon to ease the stress on students. “We demand an immediate reduction in the syllabus for Classes 9 to 12 because a lot of teaching hours are lost due to the prevailing situation,” said Anil Bornare, coordinator of the BJP teachers’ cell. Vaishali Bafna, from Pune-based think-tank SYSCOM, said the department should ensure that the syllabus is not reduced too much for Class 11. “Class 11 is a preparatory class for Class 12, and omitting key concepts would affect students next year,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/education-department-to-reduce-syllabus-soon/story-eKjYvxX3Hb5niBh97M7JsO.html

09-07-2020||City||‘Global Hub Covid Hospital working with 30% staff’||The recent confusion about patient’s identities at the newly set-up Covid hospital at Global Hub in Balkum, Thane has brought to the fore the dearth of manpower in the hospital. While the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) is increasing the number of beds in their jurisdiction, there is limited number of medical staffers in the city. The dearth of staffers is adding pressure on those who are currently on duty. Global Hub Covid Hospital, a 1,024-bed facility, currently has patients in 50% of total beds while the manpower is mere 30% of the total requirement. The city recorded 410 new positive cases and 17 deaths on Wednesday, taking total cases to 11,308 and death toll to 430. The city has seen a sudden spike in cases since June, with the number of cases jumping from 3,271 on June 1 to 11,308 on July 8.The hospital has been in news this week following a mix-up about a patient’s identity wherein a family was informed that the patient was dead while he was actually seeking treatment.The deficit of manpower is making it harder for the current medical staff. “We are working in shifts and have a lot of patients to attend to. It becomes physically and mentally exhausting as we have to be in PPE kits through the shift. Around 680 beds in the hospital are occupied at present. On some days we have to extend our shift timings to be able to check on all patients,” said a doctor at Balkum’s Global Hub Covid Hospital.Apart from doctors, the hospital is also in need of more staffers including receptionist, nurse and ambulance drivers. In view of this, TMC has sought help from the Indian Medical Association (IMA) to get additional doctors for the hospital. Dr Dinkar Desai, president, IMA Thane Chapter, said, “The Global Hub facility at present has 75 doctors while the requirement is of around 150 doctors. We are coming up with two more Covid facilities consisting a total of 1,500 beds for which 300 more doctors will be needed for smooth management.”He added there are around 200 doctors working with private hospitals across Thane city while civic hospitals have 30 doctors and another 100 doctors are part of the Thane Rapid Action Team.Eknath Shinde, guardian minister of Thane, said they are working to meet the requirement. “The Indian Medical Association’s Thane Chapter provided us with additional 50 physicians and 7 intensivists from Monday onwards. We have also asked all general practitioners to start their clinics to help ease the load on Covid hospitals. The doctors will also be provided with all necessary care if they contract the virus,” he added.TMC, on the other hand, said the situation was manageable. “Although there has been a spike in positive cases, most of them only require isolation at Covid care facilities. Hence, we are able to manage with the current medical staff. However, it is true that we are making provisions to rope in additional medical staff and infrastructure facilities,” said Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/global-hub-covid-hospital-working-with-30-staff/story-E7uOlcA0e1jMGsUQ16EJ8N.html

The family had earlier cremated a 72-year-old man, whose body was handed over to them by the Covid hospital at Global Hub in Balkum. The 67-year-old died late on Tuesday night after his family members met him in the hospital. The family of the 72-year-old Kalwa resident, which has been looking for him for five days, is distraught as they could not complete the last rites of their father. The Kopri family allowed the family from Kalwa to attend their father’s funeral as a goodwill gesture.TMC chief Dr Vipin Sharma spoke to both the families about the mix-up, while the medical health officer, Dr Charudutta Shinde, has been released from his duties as official to specifically handle the pandemic and in-charge of the Covid hospital in Balkum. Shinde had joined on June 11.On Monday, the 72-year-old’s family had filed a missing person’s complaint. The police investigation showed the man had died on July 3 and his body was handed over to the Kopri family. “We are awaiting video footage or some documentation as evidence for the mix-up. The hospital is yet to submit a final report on the incident,” said A Deshmukh, senior inspector, Kapurbawdi police station.A family member of the 72-year-old man said, “We have been running from pillar to post searching for our father, while he passed away on July 3. We could not even complete his last rites due to the lackadaisical attitude of the corporation.” The family of the 67-year-old, too, was shocked on knowing this. “We had no idea that we cremated someone else. The past few days have been a roller coaster of emotions for us. We invited them to be a part of the funeral and join us in the last rites and consider our father as their own,” said a relative. Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner, TMC, said, “Our three-member committee is yet to submit a report and their inquiry is underway.”Ex-MLA Kirit Somaiya, said, “I will meet the Governor to discuss the situation in Thane.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-mix-up-two-cremations-for-a-man-other-s-kin-don-t-get-to-see-him-even-once/story-pSS2wklcNWeE53nLKUpBeL.html

AL Quadros, leader of the city’s largest taximen’s union — Mumbai Taximen’s Union, represented other taxi and autorickshaw unions. Quadros asked the state government to provide financial relief to taxi and autorickshaw drivers along with allowing additional passengers. “It has been an extremely difficult time for taxi and autorickshaw drivers in the state. Business has been completely down, and allowing only essential passengers has made it even more difficult for us. We have asked the government to allow us to carry normal passengers. We have also sought financial aid of ₹10,000 per month to the drivers during the lockdown,” he said.Autorickshaw and taxi unions have also asked for an increase in fare. Taxi unions have asked to increase minimum fare from ₹22 to ₹25 and the same for autorickshaws from ₹18 to ₹22. Auto unions also urged the state to release seized autos and to cancel e-challans during lockdown along with waiver of the interest of loans taken by autorickshaw drivers in Maharashtra.A 13-member transport task force, headed by transport minister Anil Parab, was formed on June 25 to address transportation issues in the state and to suggest measures on effective operations during the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/allow-us-to-ferry-all-passengers-hike-fare-auto-taxi-unions-to-state/story-OMQgVLZ64ChmRLiIZYYirK.html
09-07-2020||Lucknow||Border face-off: UP govt treads cautiously on Chinese investment||The faceoff between India and China on the border, followed by a ban on Chinese apps, has put the state government in a dilemma over the large investment that Chinese companies are making, or have already made, in the electronics manufacturing sector in Uttar Pradesh.Although Chinese companies are making investment in accordance with policies of the union government and provisions of Uttar Pradesh Electronics Manufacturing Policy-2017, the authorities are treading cautiously in view of the tension on the border that may even have an impact on the process of investment by Chinese companies in the state.“We are treading cautiously. A large investment of about Rs 15,000 crore to Rs 20,000 crore is being made by the Chinese companies that are setting up their units in electronics manufacturing sector in the state. Many of these companies are already here and have made make-shift arrangements to start their production. Large incentives have been promised to them. We are now adopting a wait and watch policy before pushing ahead the process of investment that includes giving them a letter of comfort,” said a senior functionary dealing with foreign investment in electronics manufacturing sector in the state.“Major Chinese companies in the process of making investment in the state include Haier Appliances (Rs 2,800 crore), Holitech Technologies (Rs 1,700 crore), Sunwoda Electronics (Rs 1,500 crore) and Vivo (Rs 7,000 crore). We have not yet issued them letter of comfort,” said a senior officer of the state government on condition of anonymity.“After the tension of the border everything has slowed down. We will expedite the processes once the border tension is over,” said the functionary, adding, “Another Chinese company Oppo has already made an investment of Rs 2,000 crore and proposes to make an additional investment of Rs 1,500 crore in the state. There is a long list of Chinese companies that have started production or are in the process of making small investments.”Minister for industry Satish Mahana said many Chinese companies have already started production in Uttar Pradesh and the state government would act only in accordance with guidelines from the union government on the issue. “Various incentives are promised to companies that propose to make investment in the state under the provisions of Uttar Pradesh Electronics Manufacturing Policy-2017. Chinese companies are obviously here to take advantage of the policy and have been given subsidised land to set their units in accordance with the policy,” said the functionary, adding, “UP’s development authorities, including Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority, Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority and Noida have given 25 per cent rebate while providing the land to foreign companies. These include the Chinese companies. The state government is committed to reimburse to the development authorities a subsidy of about Rs 200 crore given to foreign companies.”Other incentives to be given to companies making investment as per the provisions of electronics manufacturing policy include 100 per cent exemption on stamp duty, capital subsidy on fixed capital, 5 per cent per annum subsidy on interest for seven years, 100 per cent reimbursement of actual filing costs on awarded patents, 100 per cent state GST reimbursement for 10 years. Special incentives on case to case basis are also promised to companies making investment of more than Rs 200 crore with approval by the empowered committee and the state cabinet.Meanwhile, professor SK Dwivedi, former head of department political science, Lucknow University, said: “There is definitely a need for caution. We need to keep a watch on Chinese investment and taken action on economic front, too, besides countering China politically. The union government should take whatever action is required to safeguard India’s interest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/border-faceoff-up-govt-treads-cautiously-on-chinese-investment/story-Ns8duyGASgac21rnUBPW9I.html
09-07-2020||Mumbai||‘Textile workers’ lung diseases make them vulnerable to Covid’||Cities from Maharashtra known for textile industries – Solapur, Malegaon and Bhiwandi – have higher fatality rate than the state, according to the data. Civic authorities from these cities have identified occupational lung diseases among textile workers, comprising a majority of the fatalities, as one of the reasons. The authorities are now actively tracing and targeting workers to reduce the fatalities.As of July 7, Solapur city has reported 2,825 cases and 285 deaths, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 10%. Malegaon’s CFR is 7.14%, as it has reported 82 deaths and 1,147 cases. The Bhiwandi-Nijampur Municipal Corporation has 2,620 cases and 140 people have died with a CFR of 5.34%. The state’s CFR stands at 4.22%.Most textile workers suffer from byssinosis, a lung disease caused by inhalation of cotton dust, which makes them more vulnerable to infections. Besides the textile hub, Solapur city also houses the beedi industry. Beedi workers, too, suffer from respiratory ailments. Solapur has 60,000 beedi workers and 30,000 textile workers. Many patients, who died were found to be textile or beedi workers.“Besides the compromised immunity due to weakened lungs, they do not pay proper attention to their diet and medical treatment. The symptoms for Covid-19 are reported late, making it worse, while treating and saving lives. If not treated in time, the risk of spread is also high. We have identified 60,000 such workers and people with comorbidities. We are carrying out aggressive screening and testing to reduce the death rate,” said Dr Pradeep Dhele, civil surgeon, Solapur.Dr Amol Annadate, who has worked with the Malegaon Municipal Corporation to reduce the cases, said, “Many textiles workers suffer from tuberculosis and pneumoconiosis. Their respiratory system works at half of the capacity, making it difficult to treat them for Covid-19. Some patients come very late and in some cases, the lungs are badly damaged. One of the lessons Covid-19 has taught us is the need to relocate highly populated towns like Malegaon and restructure the textiles industry,” he said.Dr Jaywant Dhule, medical officer of health in Bhiwandi, said 30% of the patients are employed in textile industries. “Besides respiratory problems and comorbidities, the workers live in highly dense areas, mostly slums, where vulnerability increases rapidly. We have started mohalla clinics to reach out to them and reduce the fatality rate by earlier identification,” he said. While the death rate in textile towns is high due to the occupational hazards, the spike in the cases in Jalgaon is because of the high rate of inter-state transportation for banana trade. ‘Banana belt’, where migration from other states is high, is cited as the reason for the fatality rate of 6.40% in Jalgaon, where 4,712 cases have been reported so far. “Another reason is the traffic movement as three national highways pass through the district,” said a state government official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/textile-workers-lung-diseases-make-them-vulnerable-to-covid/story-PTPDBUiYvv3hQnLVZ6BnTM.html

But, we are seeking legal options on implications of cancelling the deal. A final decision on the issue will be taken at the top level,” said Deepak Kumar, principal secretary, urban development department.Kumar though refused to elaborate further, those aware of the unfolding developments said the state government was unlikely to heed to the request for more time made by the Chinese company.Those aware with the developments said under the provisions of MoU the company was expected to invest about Rs 560 crore to provide 700 electric buses for operation in the major cities.Also read| Border face-off: UP govt treads cautiously on Chinese investmentCost of each bus was estimated to be about Rs 1.25 crore and the Centre under the Phase-II of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles (FAME) was expected to give Rs 45 lakh per bus.The state government was expected to set up bus stations and charging stations to start the plying of buses in Lucknow, Varanasi, Meerut, Agra, Ghaziabad, Kanpur, Moradabad, Aligarh, Jhansi, Bareilly, Gorakhpur, Shahjahanpur, Mathura and Vrindavan.The proposal to operate these 700 electric buses in 14 cities was approved by the state cabinet on October 1, 2019.The operation was to start later this year after the completion of the biddings process, which was carried out in December last year.

09-07-2020||Chandigarh||Final-year exams: UGC’s latest orders leave students, teachers in a fix||University Grants Commission’s (UGC’s) decision to hold the exams of final year students in universities and colleges by September 30 has come as a surprise to many. Thousands of students as well as their teachers are now in a fix as the government had earlier announced that such students would be promoted on the basis of their performance in previous semesters. Even the educational institutions are concerned and waiting for the state government’s decision in this regard. “We are waiting for the complete set of UGC guidelines besides directions from the state government (about conducting exams). The decision will be taken accordingly,” said Kurukshetra University vice-chancellor Nita Khanna. Students not in favour of examsRising Covid-19 case count clubbed with incomplete syllabus has evoked a sense of fear among students. “This decision is shocking. How can we appear in exams when the number of coronavirus cases are multiplying?” asked Nishika, a final-year student pursuing bachelor’s degree in mass communication from Kurukshetra University. It is pertinent to mention here that earlier in June, the Haryana government’s notification directing the higher and technical education institutions to conduct exams of final year students in July had drawn criticism. Kurukshetra University had even written to the government about the issues raised by at least 6,000 students in their final year. On June 23, the government had decided to promote the final-year students without conducting exams. Then the latest directions came on Monday regarding the September-30 deadline to conduct final-year exams in either pen and paper mode, online, or a combination of both as per the feasibility and suitability. “Conducting exams will be challenging at this stage, but we will follow the guidelines and arrangements will be made as per the government’s orders. There are 1,000 final-year students in our college,” said Abha Khetarpal, principal of DAV Girls College, Yamunanagar.New guidelines, but same old concernsTeachers have also expressed concerns over holding exams in the prevailing situation. “How could the exams be conducted now? There is no clarity on the transportation and accommodation of students coming from other parts of the state and country,” said a senior professor of Kurukshetra University, who sought to remain anonymous. “It would be very risky for students to appear in exams as the case count in most of the districts of the state is on its peak,” he added. Officials in the state’s higher education department have meanwhile confirmed that a meeting will soon be convened and new directions will be issued to the universities as per the decision taken in the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/final-year-exams-ugc-s-latest-orders-leave-students-teachers-in-a-fix/story-XJCumttotKN7eHKxIWqJ7I.html
09-07-2020||Chandigarh||42 pvt hospitals notified for Covid-19 treatment in state: Haryana to HC||The Haryana government on Wednesday told the Punjab and Haryana high court that 42 private hospitals have been roped in to provide Covid-19 treatment in the state.The response came on a petition filed by Sameer Vashisht, a Gurugram resident, who in his public interest litigation had raised several issues regarding shortage of testing labs, masks, beds, and ventilators in private and government hospitals in Gurugram. The state’s additional advocate general, Deepak Balyan, told the high court bench of Chief Justice RS Jha and Justice Arun Palli that Covid-19 tests are being conducted for free in government hospitals while the prices have been fixed for the private labs. Keeping in view the possibility of high number of patients which may occur, 42 private hospitals have been notified for treatment, he told the court, adding that for testing, eight labs have been approved by ICMR in addition to 12 government labs. Of these, one government and seven private labs are in Gurugram, he further submitted. In Gurugram, rapid point-of-care antigen tests have been started, he added. The Haryana government also denied that there was shortage of N95 masks and other requisite equipment. The court disposed of the plea observing that it was apparent that government has addressed most of the issues raised in the plea. The court, however, asked the petitioner to submit representation to the government, in case he had further suggestions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/42-pvt-hospitals-notified-for-covid-19-treatment-in-state-haryana-to-hc/story-4aW6WsvCHEc3DvOQmKljrO.html

09-07-2020||Mumbai||HC reprieve for 62 textile units in Malegaon||In a major reprieve for 62 textile units from Malegaon engaged in sizing of yarn used for manufacturing of grey cloth, the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday stayed notices issued by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) that refused to grant consent to operate the units.The bench of justice Ujjal Bhuyan and justice Riyaz Chagla also restrained the regional offices of MPCB from taking any coercive steps, such as disconnection of electricity, water and other basic amenities, against the textiles units pursuant to the notices issued on May 18, 2020.MPCB had issued the notices primarily on the grounds that the 62 units were located in non-conforming zones, and asked the owners of the units to submit adequacy reports either from NEERI or Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay. The unit owners were also asked to submit no-objection certificate issued by the city engineer of the Malegaon Municipal Corporation with recommendation to operate the industry at their present location, as a pre-condition for granting consent to operate.The unit owners have moved HC contending that the notices were illegal, arbitrary and oppressive. Their counsel, advocate Manoj Harit, claimed that they had not violated any of the conditions imposed while granting consent to operate.That apart, Harit said, the issuance of the show-cause notices with only a 15-day period to reply during Covid-19 pandemic reflected a mechanical approach. “Getting reports from NEERI or IIT within such a short span of time during this pandemic is impossible and therefore, the notices are required to be stayed,” he added.Advocate RV Govilkar, representing MPCB, opposed the prayer and submitted that the notices were issued in compliance with the principles of natural justice. He added that the petitioners must respond to the show-cause notices and satisfy the statutory authority about the fulfilment of conditions to get consent to operate. The bench found substance in the argument advanced on behalf of the petitioners. It said MPCB has the powers to direct closure or regulate operation of an industry under section 33A of the Water Act and section 31A of the Air Act, but these powers are subject to provisions of the respective Acts, and the authority will have to follow other provisions of the Acts, before invoking the powers. “It is not an unguided power to be exercised dehors the provisions of the two Acts.”Besides, the judges noted that the Malegaon Municipal Corporation had not yet submitted its reply regarding verification of the industrial units within non-conforming zone. “That being the position, a prima facie view can be taken that the impugned show-cause notices have been issued without jurisdiction, and that too hastily,” said the bench while staying the notices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-reprieve-for-62-textile-units-in-malegaon/story-Up1SApbb8iz8ZB8J5dnw2K.html

If a person is found with these symptoms, we record their details and send it to the nearby KDMC primary health centre. Following this, the civic body conducts rapid antigen tests on them the next day,” said Nilesh Kale, a volunteer.The volunteers, aged between 20-40 years, have been divided in three teams, two teams deployed at Dombivli and one at Kalyan, to carry out the survey for four days. “After four days of carrying out survey, they will be asked to be quarantined for the next four days at the school. They will be tested if required and given treatment if tested positive,” said Kale.“The volunteers will work on ground-level to help identify more Covid patients and treat them on time. This will help curb the spread,” said Vijay Suryavanshi, KDMC commissioner.“Those patients detected through this survey will be tested for the infection with the use of rapid antigen test kits. NGOs or social groups willing to help in the survey can come forward,” said Suryavanshi. The civic body has recently acquired 10,000 rapid antigen kits for mass testing.KDMC recorded 471 new Covid-19 cases and seven deaths on Wednesday. The number of cases has crossed the 10,000-mark with the total number at 10,351 while death toll stood at 158.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kdmc-ropes-in-100-volunteers-to-carry-out-covid-19-survey/story-cRDavKHbptTBOvSOHkfyBP.html
09-07-2020||Mumbai||BMC calls Fadnavis’ claims of reduced testing ‘baseless’||After leader of Opposition in the state assembly Devendra Fadnavis criticised the civic body for inadequate Covid-19 testing, BMC denied the allegations, saying that daily testing has only increased by introducing antigen tests and easing testing conditions in private clinics. “It was relieving to see yesterday’s Covid cases in Mumbai coming down to 806 until I realised that only 3300 samples were tested. Are we playing with the lives of Mumbaikars?” Fadnavis had tweeted on Wednesday. In a clarification issued later the same day, BMC said, “All such claims are baseless.” The civic body said that nearly one lakh antigen tests are being conducted, and by allowing testing in private clinics without any prescription, it has increased the daily testing average from 4, 000 daily tests earlier, to 5, 500 daily tests as on July 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-calls-fadnavis-claims-of-reduced-testing-baseless/story-tMiGF1boslEh26pRi2lRdL.html
09-07-2020||Chandigarh||Infection curve to rise as contagion spreads to other districts in Haryana||In a worrying sign, forecasts made by the Haryana health department have indicated a rise in the number of fresh Covid-19 cases in the next 10 days.This despite the fact that the number of new infections in the last two weeks — from 3,427 (June 15-21) to 3,194 (June 22-28) to 3,176 (June 29-July 5) — has declined.The fresh calculations peg the number of cumulative infections at over 23,000 by July 18. The projections are on the basis of July 7 data by taking into account an average increase of about 453 infections every day. However, on a brighter note, the forecasts also indicate an improvement in the number of patients cured of the infection — pegged at 19,156 — and a dip in the number of active cases per day — predicted to be 3,853 — by July 18.Top health officials attribute the predicted spike to wider resumption of normal day-to-day activities and movement of a large section of population across several districts. Officials said gradually, the infection will also move towards the north from the southern districts.“The number of cases in Gurugram and Faridabad has stabilised at a particular level and the districts throw up almost identical numbers everyday. However, there are other districts like Rewari and Rohtak which are witnessing a spurt,” said additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora. He said industrial zones such Rewari’s Bawal and Dharuhera, where economic activity has resumed and transportation of men and material is in large numbers, are the key contributors to the infection tally. “What eventually matters is the number of active cases and not the cumulative infections. If the number of active cases is below 5,000, then there is not much to worry about,” Arora said. Slow contact tracing in Gurugram, FaridabadAs per the health department statistics, Haryana has done well overall in tracing the contacts of infected persons across the state, achieving a success rate of 72%. However, it needs to pull its socks up in the troublesome districts like Gurugram, where contacts of only 56% cases have been traced. “There still are 2,611 patients of whom the authorities have not been able to trace contacts. Considering the fact that there are less than 1,000 active cases in Gurugram and many of the patients whose contacts could not be traced would have recovered or died, the authorities need to get their act together,” said an official.Contact tracing in Faridabad, another hotspot district, is about 76% with the authorities not being able to trace contacts of 1,055 patients. “We will be focusing more on contact tracing efforts in these two districts and our success rate will improve,” said another official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/infection-curve-to-rise-as-contagion-spreads-to-other-districts-in-haryana/story-OJiFLtaFkei80F9zuModpL.html
09-07-2020||City||1 held for vandalism at Dr Ambedkar’s house||Matunga police on Wednesday detained one person in connection with the vandalism at Rajgruh, the residence of Dr BR Ambedkar in Dadar. On Tuesday evening, at around 6pm, someone trespassed into the Rajgruha compound and caused minor damage to the property. A complaint was filed by Bhimrao Ambedkar, one of Dr Ambedkar’s three grandsons. State home minister Anil Deshmukh immediately ordered an inquiry and the police detained one person on Wednesday afternoon.“The detained suspect looks similar to the one whose image was captured in the CCTV installed at the house, while he was damaging the plants in the compound of the house. We are questioning the suspect. He will be arrested if his involvement is found,” said Viresh Prabhu, additional commissioner of police (central region).The city police have already registered a first information report (FIR) against an unidentified person under section 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) and 447 (criminal trespass) of the Indian Penal Code.The accused, who was barefoot, entered Rajgruh premises through a three-foot-high gate which was unlocked. He damaged potted plants and broke some window panes when he threw stones at them. No CCTV cameras were damaged, a senior police official said.This is the second time that an unidentified person has been seen loitering around Rajgruha, according to the complainant Bhimrao. On July 6, Bhimrao had seen someone who ran away when confronted. Bhimrao had told police that the person caught on camera resembled the man he’d seen earlier, Prabhu said.The heritage structure of Rajgruha has a museum, Dr Ambedkar’s library of more than 50,000 books, and a memorial on the ground floor. Dr Ambedkar’s family live in other parts of the bungalow.Soon after the incident, a crowd of approximately 200 reached Rajgruh and were eventually dispersed by the police. Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi leader, Prakash Ambedkar in a video statement appealed to followers of Ambedkar to remain calm and maintain peace.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray described the incident as shocking. “Rajgruh is a revered place not just for followers of Dr Ambedkar, but for all communities. We will not tolerate anyone insulting Rajgruh and I have ordered the police to take strict action,” Thackeray said on Wednesday. Leaders from other political parties also expressed their shock at the incident, including housing minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Jitendra Awhad, who went to Rajgruh to meet the Ambedkar family members on Wednesday morning, on instructions from NCP chief Sharad Pawar.The former chief minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis also spoke to Bhimrao after the incident. Bhimrao appealed to everyone to observe restraint and has demanded police security. “It will be better if a police guard is stationed here to protect the books,” he said. Police security has been assigned to Rajgruh since Tuesday evening.With inputs from Naresh Kamath||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1-held-for-vandalism-at-dr-ambedkar-s-house/story-UG1k9N9OUg2cDCEH8rBdXN.html

During the protest, SFI members burnt a copy of the guidelines to express their displeasure. SFI has accused the central government of being incapable of controlling coronavirus spread and said that it was because of this that the educational institutions had to remain closed.SFI state secretary Amit Thakur said that more than 20,000 cases of Covid-19 are being reported throughout the country every day and if the exams are conducted then crores of students and lakhs of teaching and non-teaching staff will be at risk.He added that the classes were not being conducted as educational institutions had been shut since the last four months and online classes were being conducted as a ‘formality’.The decision to conduct examinations is their way to avoid their responsibilities, he added.Students are not mentally prepared for exams due to the ongoing pandemic and conducting exams in such a situation is nothing but an invitation for a community spread among students, he said.SFI has also appealed to students to share their opinions and suggestions in an online poll started by them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-pradesh-sfi-protests-against-ugc-mhrd-s-decision-to-conduct-exams/story-zza3O2OAoRBshogIEotErJ.html

09-07-2020||Mumbai||Find ways to reduce waste dumped in mangroves: NGT||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the state bodies to come up with an action plan to reduce waste that is affecting mangrove forests and coastal wetlands along Mumbai.NGT’s principal bench passed an order on Tuesday, which was published on Wednesday, directing the state to report on the extent of garbage and develop a mitigation plan for its removal in six weeks.“We direct the divisional forest officer of the area and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to submit the remedial measures which are required to be taken to solve the problem,” the order read. The next hearing date is scheduled on October 7.The bench was hearing an application by environment group Vanashakti on coastal water pollution and the impact of solid waste entering the Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary (TCFS). “If the matter is not addressed, TCFS and our mangrove forests will become garbage dumps very soon,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti.The mangrove cell under the forest department had informed the NGT during an earlier hearing that 8,000 tons of garbage were removed from different mangrove forests in successive clean-up operations. The cell estimates Mumbai’s mangrove forests (6,600 hectares) have around 50,000 tons of plastic waste strewn due to improper waste treatment.“An action plan based on NGT’s orders will be prepared. We have already developed a strategy to tackle waste at TCFS under the sanctuary’s recently approved management plan,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell). According to MPCB, creeks, rivers and the sea along Mumbai’s 437.71 sq km coast is under threat from municipal waste including plastic that is directly discharged into nullahs. Untreated domestic waste accounts for 93% pollution for these water bodies, wetlands and mangrove areas, MPCB said.“Over 25% of total sewage (2,600 million litres per day) generated in Mumbai enters the sea without treatment. We have highlighted this to the NGT. While the forest department will develop the mitigation plan, it will be implemented by BMC, and monitored by us,” said YB Sontakke, joint director (water quality), MPCB. “Repeated reminders and directions for adequate waste management to BMC over the years have not been attended to.”BMC denied MPCB’s submission while stating that Mumbai’s eight sewage treatment plants (STPs) at marine outfall and lagoons were being upgraded as per the Centre’s latest norms. “Work at the Colaba STP has been completed. Tenders for six other STPs have been issued while one remaining will be completed within a month. It will take at least three years to enhance the treatment system. Owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, work slowed down. However, cognisance of previous NGT orders have been taken,” said Atul Rao, chief engineer, BMC’s Mumbai Sewage Disposal Project.Counsel for petitioners, Zaman Ali said as per an Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay report Mumbai needed 37 STPs for a lasting solution to this pollution. “MPCB had highlighted this to NGT. The bench during Tuesday’s hearing indicated that this needs to be considered in the remedial plan along with short-term and long-term measures,” he said.Stalin added, “Our suggestion before NGT for installing nets to strain solid waste from stormwater drains was accepted by state and Central agencies but the BMC has conveniently ignored it.”Sanjay Sadashiv, under-secretary, state environment department said, “Making use of nets as suggested by petitioners can solve this crisis much faster. BMC is duty-bound to stop waste from entering the sea, and is currently not implementing the Maharashtra Non-Biodegradable Garbage (Control) Act, 2006.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/find-ways-to-reduce-waste-dumped-in-mangroves-ngt/story-eC1jVWohvcHxd7MgSmM9KP.html
09-07-2020||Mumbai||Result of Mission Zero will show in 10 days, says BMC||Even as data shows the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) ‘Mission Zero’, a rapid action plan to check Covid-19 cases in Mumbai’s six suburbs, has brought down the numbers marginally, civic officials say it will take another 10 days for the situation to improve.The 36-day plan was launched on June 22 to focus on Mulund, Bhandup, Dahisar, Borivli, Kandivli and Malad, with door-to-door screening, fever camps and mobile ambulances. The work kickstarted the next day. These areas contribute to more than half of Mumbai’s Covid-19 cases. The six wards are Malad (P-North), Borivli (R-Central), Dahisar (R-North), Kandivli (R-South), Bhandup (S) and Mulund (T). These areas now have a growth rate of over 2%, with the R-Central ward topping the list at 3.2%, followed by T ward with a growth rate of 3.1%. This is much higher than Mumbai’s average growth rate of 1.54%. When ‘Mission Zero’ was launched two weeks ago, all six wards had a higher growth rate with the highest in R-Central ward at 3.8%, followed by T ward at 3.7%. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in charge of BMC’s health department, said, “It is my estimate that situation in these suburban wards will improve in the next 10 days. Now, we have started antigen tests for high-risk contacts, which has increased the number of people we test.”Vishwas Shankarwar, deputy municipal commissioner of zone 7, who is in charge of R-Central, R-South and R-North wards, said, “Cases in my areas are stagnating since the rapid action plan started. There is a small reduction in cases as well. We have started rapid antigen testing also. High-risk contacts who are in quarantine facilities are tested on the 10th day of their quarantine. So far, we have observed 4% positivity. That means transmission is not high from the index patient. It is good news.” In the three wards, 579 rapid antigen tests have been conducted, of which 25 tests have shown positive results, while 554 have tested negative.‘Mission Zero’ also mandated BMC to trace up to 20 high-risk contacts per positive patient, as opposed to Mumbai’s average of 13 contacts for every positive patient. Assistant commissioners and deputy municipal commissioners in charge of the remaining wards could not be reached for a comment on Wednesday. On the other hand, the previously known hot spot of Dharavi (G-North ward) in the island city recorded three new cases on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Dharavi recorded only one case, its lowest since the day a case was first detected in this slum on April 1. The tally stands at 2,338, with 329 active cases.Mumbai on Wednesday recorded 1,347 new cases, and 62 new deaths. The case count is 87,856, and toll 5,064. Of the total cases, 23,543 are active. The fatality rate is 5.7% and doubling rate is 45 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/result-of-mission-zero-will-show-in-10-days-says-bmc/story-5OKrHMWabl3CnCTDmql8XJ.html

The SIDS is an unexplained death of a child under one years of age and such a case is called crib death or cot death where the death is usually reported between midnight to early morning hours, said a doctor. The toddler was breast fed by his mother the same evening and later both went to sleep on Tuesday night but when his parents tried to wake him up, the boy was motionless. Post-mortem report of the child is awaited.The toddler was given the polio vaccination on Tuesday noon, but suddenly the boy died the same night. Dr Mahesh Patil, medical superintendent (MS) of Rural Hospital in Mokhada said, “The boy may have died due to SIDS and is quite rare. We conducted the post-mortem and have also sent the viscera for forensic analysis to the Kalina lab.

09-07-2020||Mumbai||Did NCP just show the mirror to CM Thackeray?||The friction between the Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), ruling partners in the state, seemed to have ended on Wednesday, as five Sena corporators from Parner town in Ahmednagar, who had joined the NCP, returned to the party.The development came after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and deputy CM Ajit Pawar had a telephonic conversation in front of all corporators at the latter’s residence on Wednesday. On Tuesday evening, both the leaders also had a two-hour-long meeting at the mayor’s bungalow at Dadar, the proposed site for Bal Thackeray memorial. The corporators went to Matoshree, Thackeray’s residence in Bandra, and re-joined the party in the presence of the CM on Wednesday afternoon.Earlier, they had joined the NCP in the presence of Ajit Pawar in Baramati on Saturday.The transfer of 10 deputy commissioners of police (DCP) in Mumbai and poaching of Sena corporators by NCP had angered Thackeray, who heads the Sena-NCP-Congress government in Maharashtra. “It is not like our ministers were unaware of the consequences of the two moves on the coalition government, but it was done to point out that the chief minister should take all parties together. If he takes unilateral decisions while running the government, we can do so too and then there will be free for all,” said a top NCP functionary, wishing not to be named.What was the NCP upset with Thackeray?NCP leaders said the discontent among ruling partners was brewing for over two months over several transfers of senior officials such as municipal commissioners and collectors by the chief minister’s office and that too without keeping in loop the guardian ministers of the district. Not only the NCP, but Congress ministers and legislators, too, were unhappy. “The ministers were upset as they were unaware about what was going on in their own districts,” he said.The CM was very upset after Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh decided to transfer the 10 DCPs. Although Singh has the transfer powers, the Sena claimed the norm of consulting the CM was not followed. The home department is with the NCP and Singh had reportedly kept home minister Anil Deshmukh in the loop. Thackeray has not only stayed the transfers, but also directed the police officers to resume work in their original positions.When the issue was raised by the chief minister in his meeting with the NCP leadership on Monday evening, the latter pointed out all transfers made by the CMO in the last two months without informing the ministers concerned, said an NCP insider. On May 29, Solapur municipal commissioner Deepak Taware was transferred and guardian minister Dattatray Bharne wasn’t informed about it. Earlier, Parbhani municipal commissioner Ramesh Pawar was replaced by Devidas Pawar and guardian minister Nawab Malik did not know about it. This, despite Parbhani municipal corporation being ruled by the NCP, said another NCP leader.There has been a demand that transfers of all IAS and IPS officers be discussed in the coordination committee of the three parties, while transfer of officers from the rank of deputy collectors and others be made after consulting with the guardian ministers concerned. But the demand was overlooked conveniently, he added. However, all matters concerning the ruling partners have been resolved in the meeting held at Thackeray’s residence, stressed the NCP leader.Nilesh Lanke, NCP MLA from Parner Assembly constituency, who was leading the corporators to join his party, said the decision was taken as it sends a “wrong signal”. “Ajit dada held a meeting with the corporators and convinced them to return to their original party, as they are in a coalition government,” Lanke said.The Sena said the corporators returned to the party-fold as Thackeray was upset and the Sena had initiated action against them under the anti-defection law. Anil Desai, Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament, said, “All administrative decisions taken by the government are in coordination with all ruling partners. Uddhavji wasn’t happy with what had happened. We issued show-cause notices to all corporators asking why action can’t be taken against them under the anti-defection law. Following stern action taken by the party, they decided to come back to the party fold.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/did-ncp-just-show-the-mirror-to-cm-thackeray/story-3pawDJlzWl82uCZi2OUe7H.html
09-07-2020||Mumbai||Drop in rain intensity as Mumbai passes 1,000-mm mark for season||Even as the city and suburbs witnessed a drop in rain intensity on Wednesday with intermittent sunshine after a week, both south Mumbai and the suburbs surpassed the 1,000mm mark for the season.From June 1 to July 8 (8.30pm), the Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 1,005.2mm. In June, the weather observatory had recorded 524.5mm rain which was 97% of its monthly rainfall. In July so far, south Mumbai has received 480.7mm of 711.6mm of rain or 67% of its monthly average in the first eight days.Though monsoon onset was declared on June 14, India Meteorological Department considers seasonal rainfall from June 1, including pre-monsoon showers. This means Mumbai surpassed the 1,000mm mark in just over five weeks. Last year, Mumbai crossed 1,000mm on July 3 itself after 375.2mm rain was recorded in 24 hours.The Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded 1002.9mm rain from June 1 to July 8 (8.30pm). The suburbs had received its lowest June rain in five years at 395mm against the monthly average of 505mm or 78%. However, in July, the weather station has already received 72% of its average rain with 607.4mm rain against 840.7mm mean rain for the month in eight days.With intense rain activity between July 3 and 7, the suburbs and island city have recorded 30% and 28% excess rain for the period June 1 to July 8. Other than Mumbai, Thane (1,149mm), Ratnagiri (1,339mm), and Sindhudurg (1,634mm) have all recorded over 1,000 mm rain along the Konkan coast.On Wednesday, sporadic spells of light to moderate showers were witnessed both in the city and suburbs with pockets of sunshine during early morning and afternoon. Between 8.30am and 8.30pm Wednesday, the suburbs recorded 17.4mm rain while 5.8mm was recorded in south Mumbai.Meanwhile, after a drop in rain intensity on Wednesday, the IMD downgraded its forecast and removed rain warnings for the coming days for Mumbai, Thane and Palghar. On Tuesday, IMD had issued a yellow alert for all three zones from Thursday to Saturday. However, heavy rain warnings persist for south Konkan districts.“With few spells of intense rain, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region on Wednesday observed moderate rain over 12 hours. This trend is expected to continue on Thursday,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general, western region, IMD. “After the active spell over Maharashtra, the well-marked low pressure moved further north towards the Gulf of Kutch and surrounding areas, marginally reducing the intensity of active monsoon conditions for the north Konkan coast. However, the offshore trough extending from Gujarat to north Kerala will lead to heavy to very heavy rain for south Konkan districts,” Hosalikar said.With a drop in rain activity, the day temperature in the suburbs on Wednesday increased 1.5 degrees Celsius above normal to 32.1 degrees Celsius while south Mumbai recorded 30.8 degrees Celsius, 0.4 degree Celsius above normal. The minimum temperature was close to the normal mark. Humidity was 92% in south Mumbai and 88% in the suburbs.The city and suburbs can expect cloudy conditions with the possibility of intermittent moderate showers on Thursday and Friday, predicted IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/drop-in-rain-intensity-as-mumbai-passes-1-000-mm-mark-for-season/story-W2XM0CJOlTi66SwiwI9slL.html
09-07-2020||Mumbai||Thackeray approves new members of State Board for Wildlife||Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray’s approval of new members led to the reconstitution of the State Board for Wildlife (SBWL) on Tuesday late evening. The new-look 29-member board was formed eight months after the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government came to power last November.SBWL is responsible for taking key conservation-related and policymaking decisions for all 49 wildlife sanctuaries, including six tiger reserves, five national parks, and protected forests in Maharashtra. It also issues clearances for development projects, suggests wildlife mitigation measures, and is the recommending body for notification of new protected areas. The board will be able to exercise powers in line with the Wildlife Act, 1972. SBWL authorities had last met in December 2018, due to which several key decisions, including translocation of big cats, the fate of big-ticket development projects, and wildlife measures have been on hold over the past 18 months. On Tuesday evening, the Maharashtra government announced and published a government resolution (GR) that the CM would be the chairman of the board, with forest minister Sanjay Rathore as vice-chairman.Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF) (wildlife), was appointed the member secretary of SBWL starting July 7, a post which has a fixed three-year tenure.HT had reported on May 17 that the state chief wildlife warden had written to the Maharashtra government, drawing attention to the defunct SBWL and requesting its immediate reconstitution.SBWL is the nodal authority that takes decisions on major research projects in wildlife zones.“It is an important body for all wildlife-related activities in the state. The reconstituted board will give an impetus for wildlife conservation in Maharashtra,” said Kakodkar.SBWL’s new meeting date is yet to be announced. “We hope a meeting is convened urgently to take several pending decisions on the lines of similar exercises that have been undertaken by the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL), under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), via video-conference links because of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic,” he added.SBWL’s final recommendations on key development projects such as the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train; wildlife mitigation measures for Mumbai-Nagpur expressway (Maharashtra Samruddhi Mahamarg); 126km-long Virar-Alibag multi-modal corridor; railways’ dedicated Delhi-Mumbai freight corridor; Goregaon-Mulund tunnel which will pass through the boundaries of Sanjay Gandhi National Park and Tungareshwar Wildlife Sanctuary, and two interstate irrigation projects Pranahita Chevella and Chanaka-Korata between Maharashtra and Telangana have been pending since December 2018.Other members of SBWL include state environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray; minister of state (forests) Dattatraya Bharane, and Dheeraj Deshmukh, a member of the Maharashtra legislative assembly (MLA).Environmentalist Bittu Sahgal from Mumbai; Kishor Rithe from Amravati; Anuj Khare from Pune; Vishwas Katdare from Ratnagiri; Kundan Hate from Nagpur, and Suhas Waingankar from Kolhapur are among the non-government members of SBWL.The board will also include a representative each for the MoEFCC, Maharashtra Police, Indian Army, Zoological Survey of India (ZSI), Botanical Survey of India, Bombay Natural History Society, Wildlife Institute of India, Wildlife Conservation Trust, and commissioners of both state fisheries and animal husbandry departments. “SBWL is the highest wildlife policy-making body in the state. Maharashtra has followed several good practices since 2010 while dealing with the negative impacts of infrastructure projects. The new-look SBWL will take this work forward. Besides, CM Thackeray himself is a wildlife lover,” said Rithe, a non-government member of the board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/thackeray-approves-new-members-of-state-board-for-wildlife/story-BsPXXQ3LGGH4cYMCKZqz0M.html
09-07-2020||City||Overworked doctors at Panvel hospital write to civic chief for reinforcements||Overworked and short-staffed, the doctors at the sub-district hospital in Panvel – a dedicated Covid-19 hospital (DCH) – have written to the Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC) commissioner complaining about the shortage of manpower to deal with coronavirus cases at the facility. At least six doctors on bond have also complained of not receiving their salary for the past two months.The 150-bed Dr Nanasaheb Dharmadhikari Sub-District Hospital is the only civic-run DCH in the PCMC jurisdiction apart from the trust-operated MGM Hospital in Kamothe. Five other private dedicated Covid-19 health centres (DCHC) and two Covid-19 care centres (CCC) have also been established.The hospital, which requires 30 staff members, including 18 medical officers, is currently operating at a strength of 10 to 15, with merely six medical officers, as per a letter written from the hospital to the Raigad collector and civic commissioner last week. Moreover, at least three doctors from the hospital have been re-assigned to work at Konkan Bhavan – the divisional office of the five districts of Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg, and a fever clinic.“We are working for over 60 hours a week with little rest. We are not shying away from our duty, but it has ultimately taken a toll on us. Three of our doctors are aged over 55 years and suffer from diabetes and hypertension. They are working despite the high risk because we have no choice,” said a doctor from the hospital, requesting anonymity.The doctor added that only one physician is available, and to make up for the shortage, gynaecologists and paediatricians are performing the physician’s duties.“While we understand these are exceptional times, one physician cannot possibly look after 150 patients. Many patients are admitted with 30% saturation of oxygen levels, and they need immediate intensive care. We have eight ICU beds, which are occupied at all times,” he added.Another doctor at the hospital said that at any given time, at least 40 patients are on oxygen support. Additionally, only six doctors are available per shift, and they are pulling extra night shifts. The doctors are further stretched thin as the DCH is also a swab collection centre.A 27-year-old doctor from the hospital tested positive last week, after which the hospital superintendent Dr Nagnath Yempalle wrote to PMC commissioner Sudhakar Deshmukh highlighting the doctors’ issues.Confirming the shortage of staff, Dr Yempalle said, “We currently have 14 doctors, and all of them are overburdened. We have requested reinforcements and additional staff. Regarding ventilators, we only have a capacity of 10 and are properly equipped on that front. We handed over five extra ventilators to MGM Hospital in Kamothe.”Meanwhile, a senior doctor privy to developments on the matter, said they are planning to advertise for the recruitment of additional doctors at the hospital.“We are trying for three to four extra doctors, which will be advertised and decided based on applications,” he said.Six doctors on bond have not received remuneration for the last two months. The hospital administration informed them that the government has not cleared the grants, so the salaries are stuck. Bonded doctors are required to work at a government-run hospital or medical facility for a stipulated period after graduating from government medical colleges.Civic commissioner Deshmukh said, “The head of the department should talk to me. If some doctor is not paid, their salaries might be in the process and they will be paid. They will not be made to work for free.”The commissioner refused to comment on the shortage of doctors at the hospital and said it is an administrative matter which will be dealt with internally.Despite its staff shortage, the Panvel DCH has reported a good recovery rate so far. Since the start of the pandemic, 1,180 patients have been admitted there, of which 914 have recovered and been discharged. Twelve patients have died, including positive and suspected Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/overworked-doctors-at-panvel-hospital-write-to-civic-chief-for-reinforcements/story-dK7hXy9QXJFAIdd9bt5V3M.html
09-07-2020||Mumbai||Cabinet empanels 15 district co-op banks, 2 regional rural banks, IDBI for government salaries, pension, investment||After withdrawing its accounts from six private banks after the new government came to power, the state cabinet on Wednesday allowed the empanelment of 15 district cooperative central banks (DCCB), two regional rural banks (RRB) and IDBI for government investment and salary accounts.The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, comprising the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, had scrapped its agreements with six private banks in March. The earlier government’s decision to rope in certain private banks had led to allegations of favouritism.The MVA government published the list of nationalised banks with which agreements were made for salary and pension accounts, and investment. The state cabinet on Wednesday decided to include the DCCBs, RRBs, and IDBI in the list of banks through which it would be conducting transactions. The cooperative banks are the backbone of the rural economy, while the other two banks have state and central government stakes, the statement by the government mentioned.“The finance department enters into a contract with these banks with conditions related to the interest rates and service charges on salary and pension. We had already finalised contracts with nationalised banks in March this year. There will be fresh contracts with these banks added on Wednesday,” said an official from the finance department.The state cabinet also decided to revise its lease rent levied for 490 sqm allotted to the food court at Juhu Chowpatty according to a Supreme Court order. Of the 80 stalls at Juhu Chowpatty, 38 are on state government land, while 42 are on 794 sqm owned by the Airport Authority of India (AAI).AAI had reduced the rent as per the court order. The state government has now brought it down at par, a move that is expected to lead to revenue reduction by ₹6.39 crore.The state cabinet has also decided to keep the rate of Shiv Bhojan thali at ₹5 for three more months till September. The rate was reduced on March 30, in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.Additionally, the cabinet gave its approval for the conversion of excessive milk into skimmed milk powder to avoid losses to dairy farmers. The demand for milk has reduced by 17 lakh litre a day, owing to the Covid-19 lockdown announced in March.Cabinet to amend MRTP Act for extra time to work on DPThe Maharashtra cabinet on Wednesday approved a proposal to amend the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act, to seek extra time lost during the lockdown for the completion of procedures related to development plans (DP), excluded parts (EPs) and regional plans.Section 148-A of the MRTP Act gives powers to municipal corporations to extend the deadline for the process in case of a lapse of time because of the code of conduct or court orders. “This will help in the extension of the deadline of the EP for Mumbai and Shirdi, and DP of Aurangabad, Beed, and Nanded,” said an official from the urban development department.The official, however, clarified that the period of the lockdown is yet to be decided as it still has not ended.‘Give extension to all development boards’Congress leaders Ashok Chavan and Nitin Raut demanded that extension be given to the Vidarbha Development Board, Marathwada Development Board and Development Board for the Rest of Maharashtra on an urgent basis. While the five-year extension to these boards, meant for equal distribution of development funds to all regions, ended on April 30, the extension proposal has been put on hold as the MVA government wants to appoint representatives from three parties. The government is also considering separate boards for north Maharashtra and Konkan regions. It is also planning to add the word ‘statutory’ in their names as it was dropped by the previous Fadnavis government. Congress ministers said that the decision should be taken at the earliest as sentiments of the people from Vidarbha and Marathwada are linked with the boards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cabinet-empanels-15-district-co-op-banks-2-regional-rural-banks-idbi-for-government-salaries-pension-investment/story-3PJAIta1KBy2FCLrjs77HI.html
09-07-2020||Mumbai||6,603 new cases take Maha Covid-19 count to 223,724||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 case count reached 223,724 on Wednesday after 6,603 new infections were reported, even as hotels and lodges reopened their shutters. The number of new cases rose after recording relatively fewer fresh cases for three consecutive days till Tuesday. The state has 91,065 active cases, according to the health department. The number of recovered patients also increased to 123,192 after 4,634 patients recovered and were discharged from various hospitals across the state. The recovery rate of the state has improved to 55.06%.Wednesday’s single-day jump was the second highest after Saturday, which saw 7,074 cases. Maharashtra crossed the grim 2-lakh case mark in 17 weeks since the first case was reported on March 9. The state on Wednesday recorded 198 more deaths, pushing the toll to 9,448, health officials said. The highest one-day toll of 295, too, was reported on Saturday.Mumbai’s case tally reached 87,856 after 1,347 cases were reported in the past 24 hours. The city has 23,543 active cases. On Tuesday, the city had recorded 785 cases, lowest single-day spike in the last 57 days. Mumbai’s toll stands at 5,064 after 62 deaths were reported. On June 27, Mumbai reported its highest single-day spike of 2,077 cases. Health experts said that the decline in new cases will have a significance only if it sustains for 10-14 days. After the single-day spike in cases crossed the 7,000 mark, the state reported a relatively lower increase in new cases — 6,555, 5,368 and 5,134 — on July 5, July 6 and July 7, as against 7,074 cases on July 4. “Though it is a good sign, the three-day period actually has no significance. In case of such a pandemic, we will have to monitor the trend for over a period of seven to ten days and if it continues to reduce for 14 days, then we will be in a position to say that it is a very good sign,” said Dr Subhash Salunkhe, public health expert, who is also heading the communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee of the state.In the past eight days (since July 1), the state recorded 48,965 cases, as against 302 cases in March, 10,196 cases in April, 57,157 cases in May and 102,172 cases registered in June. It means, on an average, the state is getting as many as 6,120 cases per day.Before that, a sharp surge in cases was observed in the previous 12 days — as on June 24, the state had 3,890 cases, which rose to 4,841 the very next day. It then recorded over 5,000 cases for five days and over 6,000 cases for two days and crossed 7,000 on July 4.The state is also wary of the surge in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). In the region, the cases have increased to 138,695 cases (on July 8) from 55,086 cases on June 3, when the state decided to provide relaxations in red zones, which includes MMR.Along with spike in cases, the state is also facing a large number of deaths on a daily basis. In the past eight days (since July 5), it has recorded 1,442 Covid-19 casualties.The state has recently decided to form task-force of expert doctors in all districts to control the situation.With 9,448 deaths, the case fatality rate (CFR) of the state was recorded as 4.22%. It is second highest in the country after Gujarat where CFR is 5.26% with 1,977 deaths (37,550 cases) till Tuesday, according to statistics shared by the state medical education department.Maharashtra still has highest number of deaths across states in the country.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that they are focusing on reducing CFR and for this they have decided to increase daily number of tests in the state. “We have decided to conduct more testing so that more people can be traced and CFR as well as positive rate against total testing can be reduced and be brought under 10%,” Tope said.Currently, the positive rate against total tests is 18.77% as 223,724 tests were found positive out of total 11,91,549 samples tested so far.He said that the state is doing more tests than the target of 140 per day against per million population in each district set by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Currently, 47,072 people have been kept in institutional quarantine and 6,38,762 people have been put under home quarantine across the state. The health minister said the existing institutional quarantine facilities in Metro cities need to be augmented, considering aggressive contact-tracing in slum areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/6-603-new-cases-take-maha-covid-19-count-to-223-724/story-5Cmgzdw88rTOIGSaWKbfKP.html
09-07-2020||Mumbai||Act against government officials shirking Covid duties: HC||Coming down heavily on negligent and errant officials who have been shirking their Covid duties, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has sought criminal proceedings against such officials. The court, while hearing a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL), was informed that though the court in an earlier hearing on July 3 had issued strict orders to public servants to do their duty diligently and report to work, the situation remained unchanged.A division bench of justice TV Nalawade and justice SD Kulkarni, while hearing the report of advocate Rajendra Deshmukh, senior counsel appointed as amicus curiae, was informed that despite the court’s order, there was still no discipline among public servants and many in charge of Covid-19 control programme were not reporting on duty.Public prosecutor DR Kale submitted a compilation of details on actions taken against errant officials, as sought by the court. The suo motu PIL had been initiated by the court after concerns were raised over the spike in Covid-19 cases and lack of coordination between various authorities in Aurangabad. Kale further submitted that Aurangabad city would go under a strict nine-day lockdown from July 10 and all necessary steps would be taken to contain the spread of the virus.After perusing records submitted by the district superintendents of the police, the court noted that show-cause notices were issued to private hospitals, but their replies were not produced. The court said, “The authorities are expected to take further criminal action against those hospitals not complying with the orders, as only after that the beds will be made available for patients.”With regards to the errant officials, the court observed, “If the public servants, to save their own lives, are shirking responsibility, then it can be presumed that there is no use of them in the system. After taking criminal action against them, they can be removed, and this way the system can be cleaned.” The court then posted the hearing on July 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/act-against-government-officials-shirking-covid-duties-hc/story-8u5TSTRIYaiT35ZoWUhoMP.html
09-07-2020||Mumbai||Private schools violate SOPs, conduct online classes for lower grades: Parents||Even as the state education department has banned online learning for students up to Class 2, parents said that several private schools affiliated to boards like Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) and International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) are still conducting sessions with students in these classes. On June 15, the state government issued a set of standard operating procedures (SOP) to bring in some uniformity and regulation regarding online learning across schools in Maharashtra. As per the SOPs, schools cannot conduct online classes for students up to Class 2. Even after the guidelines came into effect, several private schools are reportedly conducting online learning sessions with children, according to parents. “The school has started conducting a few Facebook Live sessions for students, which are not made mandatory. But the fact that teachers are conducting these sessions is pushing most parents to attend them to ensure that their kids do not lose out on anything,” said the parent of a student from a school in Andheri.Aditi Save, whose son studies in a Thane-based school, said that teachers had circulated links to the classes on parent WhatsApp groups. “When a few parents tried to point out the rules, they told us that the SOPs do not apply to non-state board schools,” said Save.Vishal Solanki, education commissioner confirmed that the SOPs were framed for all schools in the state. “They are binding on all schools of all boards across the state,” he said.An official from the education department said parents who wish to complain about schools violating SOPs, can write to the department. “They can write to the nodal officers who have been appointed by the state to hear complaints,” said the official.Meanwhile, over 800 parents in the state have signed an online petition urging the state government to conduct an audit of private schools that were charging more than ₹30,000 as fees during the current academic year.“Some schools are also charging transport fees and various activity fees at a time when students are at home. They are charging exorbitant fees and the government needs to look into it,” reads the petition started by Anubha Sahai, president of the India Wide Parents Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/private-schools-violate-sops-conduct-online-classes-for-lower-grades-parents/story-7j2El1lt6FbUpUQB64LqbJ.html
09-07-2020||Mumbai||30% hotels resume business after government partially opens up sector||Barely 30% of hotels and establishments providing accommodation facilities resumed business on Wednesday in Maharashtra after the government announced on Monday that it would allow them to reopen amidst the lockdown.The Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), an apex body of hoteliers, said around 3,192 of the total 10,643 hotels restarted their businesses on Wednesday.Most five-star hotels like Taj Mahal Palace, ITC Grand Central, and Trident hotels started their operations on Wednesday. There was, however, a lukewarm response from patrons.Since the state government has mandated hotels to resume their operations with 33% capacity, many establishments have opted to stay shut and wait for conditions to improve.Many blamed shortage of staff, lack of travel facilities, and the unviable proposition to operate at 33% capacity.According to Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, president, HRAWI, there were multiple reasons for such a weak response. “Many of the hotels don’t have staff as their workers, who were migrants, have not yet returned. Another problem is that since the establishments were closed for months, hoteliers have monetary issues and instead of starting in a huff, are choosing to wait and watch for some days to see how things unfold,” said Kohli.Kamlesh Barot, who manages Empresa Hotel at Andheri, also contended he received no bookings on Wednesday. “This was expected as flights have stopped,” said Barot. “However, we had to start,” he added.Juhu Residency did not open its establishment on medical safety grounds. “We feel that Covid-19 is still an issue, and hence, we are not ready to put both our patrons and staff at risk,” said Sujay Shetty, director of the hotel.As a part of Mission Begin Again, the state government on Monday unveiled rules for hotels to conduct business. It notified that restaurants at hotels and guest houses will be available only for resident guests. The swimming pools, gymnasiums, playing areas, gaming arcades are to be closed to all guests, and gatherings of more than 15 people at these hotels have been prohibited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/30-hotels-resume-business-after-government-partially-opens-up-sector/story-fRoKpKceEvV7YcPlIu06IM.html
09-07-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 impact: A contactless common mobility platform on cards||With authorities exploring the potential of contactless ticketing, Covid-19 may change the way Mumbaiites use public transport. In a meeting held on Tuesday, chaired by the state’s urban development minister Eknath Shinde, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) approved a revised proposal to create a “journey planner”, which is a mobile application under MMRDA’s integrated ticketing services (ITS) project. The authority is likely to invite bids to develop the application so that it can be rolled out in December. Once operational, Mumbaiites can use the application to plan their journey by making a payment on the app, which will create a QR code that can be used for the journey. The app will work across the Metro, the monorail, buses operated by the Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking, aggregator-managed cabs and suburban railways. RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, said, “It is an innovative product that we have been working on during the lockdown. Contactless ticketing is the future of transit, especially after a pandemic when we do not want to take any risks by making use of single-use tokens or tickets.” Currently, each mode of public transport in Mumbai – suburban trains, the Metro One, the monorail, BEST buses, autorickshaws and taxis – has its own ticketing and payment system and some of these must be done with cash. A commuter who wants to travel by a BEST bus, local train or app-managed cab can purchase tickets by generating three QR codes which can be shown at the start of the journey, making it completely contactless. The app would be similar to Finland’s Whim application, started in 2016, which allows commuters to plan and pay for trips across multiple modes of transport. Across the world, metropolitan cities have single or common mobility cards — London has the Oyster Card; Hong Kong, the Octopus card; Sydney, the Opal card; Toronto has Presto; and Manila has the Beep card. Amit Bhatt, director of transport, World Resources Institute, said, “Digital payment is a significant reform in public transport as it plugs the revenue loss in addition to providing much needed data for transit availability and demand. This coupled with paperless tickets will greatly mitigate the Covid risk.”Along with railways, the authority had been debating on either introducing an account-based system, in which a user’s account balance is on the server or a store-value card-based system, in which the balance will be stored on cards. The project also hit a stumbling block when the Central government stressed on the one nation, one card system. Under the revised proposal, MMRDA officials said, that commuters can also get a card, which will be made compatible with the National Common Mobility Card, and the RuPay card launched by the National Payment Corporation of India. Last year, MMRDA had also finalised the designs for the card.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-impact-a-contactless-common-mobility-platform-on-cards/story-rr2wbwr9ym7oLIXPwIB0zH.html

The case will now come up for hearing on July 14 when the Punjab Police will file a reply.Multani, who worked as a junior engineer with the Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (CITCO), was picked up, allegedly by police after a terrorist attack on Saini, the then Chandigarh SSP. Later, the police claimed that Multani, son of a former IAS officer, had escaped from the police custody and his whereabouts were not known.Last month, a case was registered against Saini and seven others in Mohali on a complaint from Multani’s brother Palwinder Singh.On June 6, the Punjab Police moved an application in the CBI court, Chandigarh, seeking documents of the preliminary probe as the case was initially investigated by the CBI in 2007.In its reply, the CBI had stated that though it registered an FIR on the directions of high court and conducted a preliminary inquiry, but the FIR was quashed by the Supreme Court in 2011. As the CBI keeps records of old cases only for five years, it weeded out the same.On June 8, the police filed another application, submitting that in 2016, the High Court had returned a status report to the investigating agency, which also included the documents, which they now want in the wake of an FIR.On Wednesday, in its reply with regard to the additional application moved by the Punjab Police, the CBI told the CBI court that it “does not possess any record” with regard to the case. With regard to the status report, the CBI stated that, firstly, it is “not traceable” and, secondly, it’s “internal communication” between the investigating agency and the high court and cannot be shared.The CBI also raised questions on the territorial jurisdiction of the application moved by the Punjab Police in the Chandigarh CBI court. It questioned the rationale behind Punjab Police filing applications in Chandigarh CBI court when the FIR was registered in Mohali.BoxEx-DGP Saini’s interim bail extended till July 10The court of additional district and sessions judge Rajnish Garg on Wednesday extended the interim bail of former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini till July 10 in the Multani disappearance case. The case was registered against Saini on May 6 this year. Saini’s counsel APS Deol could not appear in the court citing personal reason, following which the judge extend the bail till July 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/multani-disappearance-case-can-t-share-status-report-it-s-internal-communication-with-hc-says-cbi/story-6ianed8FILDxFZHAoIdvxK.html
09-07-2020||Mumbai||‘Acute shortage of remdesivir and tocilizumab in Mumbai’||Anti-viral drug remdesivir and tocilizumab (a drug that modifies the immune system or its functioning), both prescribed for Covid-19 patients in the moderate to critical stage of the illness, are in short supply with chemists and distributors in the city, according to doctors and patients. They claim that drugs are available at five to 10 times the cost in the black market. The cost of remdesivir is between ₹5,000 and ₹5,500. The printed price of tocilizumab is around ₹92,000.HT has accessed the prescription of a Covid-19 patient admitted in a hospital in Navi Mumbai dated July 5, when the doctor prescribed two vials of remdesivir. Relatives of the patient said the drug was unavailable at the hospital. “We’ve been running from pillar to post to get the drug, but with no success. It’s not available anywhere,” said a relative, on the condition of anonymity. They’re still looking for the drug three days on.Remdesivir is the only drug approved by the United States food and drug administration for treating Covid-19 patients. While tocilizumab is still imported, remdesivir has now been certified to be manufactured by two Indian companies Cipla and Hetero Drugs. According to DR Gahane, joint commissioner of the state’s food and drug administration, Hetero has supplied two or three batches of the drug in Maharashtra and around 7,500 units in Mumbai. Cipla’s first batch is yet to arrive in hospitals.“The demand is much higher than supply. Even people in places of power are not able to procure drugs,” said Dr Jalil Parkar, pulmonologist at Lilavati Hospital. He said that doctors prescribe at least six vials of remdesivir to treat a “moderate-to-critical” patient. “Two vials are administered on the first day and one each for the next four days,” he added. Kin of patients are supposed to check at the hospital for the availability of the drug and then look for it outside.With patients running from pillar to post, the shortage has given rise to a black market, said Abhay Pandey, president of the All Food and Drug Licence Holders’ Foundation.“It is a nexus. Black-marketeers are getting these drugs prescribed for asymptomatic patients on hospital letterheads without any signature of the doctor. They stock the drugs and sell it for around ₹25,000,” he said. The foundation has written to Maharashtra FDA to investigate the matter. However, the FDA has not come across any black-market complaints. “Our inspectors are reaching out to recovered Covid-19 patients to find out where they procured the drugs from. So far, we have not come across any patient who purchased the drug from the black market. But we are following the matter and if we find such a nexus, we will organise a raid and take necessary action,” said Gahane. Meanwhile, the FDA is monitoring the manufacture and dispatch of the drugs from the units of Cipla and Hetero. “Our focus is to improve production,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/acute-shortage-of-remdesivir-and-tocilizumab-in-mumbai/story-J6wpJCOtW34p0NhXWkTzuN.html

The action by the civic agencies comes after waterlogging was witnessed in several parts of the city during the recent spell of heavy rainfall that battered the city earlier this week. A special flood control unit of the Gurugram traffic police has been set up for this purpose this year that will work along with MCG and GMDA officials. These officials together will keep a watch on over 300 cameras installed across the city. They will keep a special eye out for waterlogging, sewerage leaks, traffic breakdowns and jams. The flood control room will become operational from Monday.Chander Mohan, DCP, traffic Gurugram, who has charge of additional CEO, mobility GMDA, said that the special traffic police team will coordinate with other civic agencies to manage the situation during monsoon. “Areas where waterlogging takes place will be identified with the help of CCTVs and alert messages will be sent to teams deployed on ground. Immediate action would be initiated to fix the issues,” he said. The Gurugram traffic police has put 12 recovery vehicles, some ropes, and a crane on standby to ensure that vehicle breakdowns and similar matters can be resolved on the spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/special-unit-of-traffic-police-civic-body-officials-to-check-waterlogging-this-year/story-mTRjuVC4sxjgomvsotV9QM.html
09-07-2020||Gurugram||Week after reopening, malls bear deserted look in Gurugram||Though it has been a week since malls reopened in the city, business is yet to pick up, say managers of stores and malls, with the overall footfall remaining 15-20% of the usual. Factors such as cinema halls, which bring their own set of footfall, still being closed, apprehensions about venturing outdoors as number of coronavirus (Covid-19) cases rise, and a lack of awareness about malls having reopened, due to absence of proper advertising, may be why patrons are keeping away, they said.The district administration ordered malls to shut down from March 18 when the city’s first Sars-Cov-2 cases began to surface. The government’s order, however, said that cinema halls would continue to remain closed, which, according to which mall association members and shopkeepers, is affecting their business.“The government has not given us permission to reopen cinema halls. The food court and the limited number of restaurants at our mall are also yet to reopen. As a result, there is no major draw for people to come. Although more than 90% of stores of the mall have now reopened, people are visiting only to purchase specific things from selected stores. Our footfall, hence, continues to remain extremely low and as of now is around 15% less than usual,” said Aman Bajaj, a member of the MGF Metropolitan Mall Association. The shopping centre is located on the Mall Mile.He added that the decision of reopening of malls by the government was sudden and gave them less than five days to prepare.“In the five days between reopening the mall, we were busy ensuring all shops are properly disinfected and sanitised, apart from ensuring that necessary safety equipment is procured and the staff is well informed about the enforcement of safety protocols. We are still getting used to this. As a result, we have had no time to advertise and inform people that malls have reopened. Without any advertisement and marketing, many people may not even be aware that we are open,” said Bajaj.On the first day of reopening, around 30-40% of stores were closed across all arcades in the city.Arjun, a member of the management at the CCDS store, which sells baking and kitchen goods at South Point Mall located on the Golf Course Road, said business as of now is at less than 20% of what it was earlier. He added that with the building not having any food court or cinema hall even prior to the lockdown, those who visited were a niche crowd.Apart from this, at least eight stores here have closed down during the lockdown. Barring two supermarkets, the rest of the plaza appeared to be deserted, with most shops having little to no visitors.“We anyway had a very niche crowd of visitors, even before the lockdown. Now, due to the disease outbreak, almost everyone is reluctant to step outside and, as a result, there is barely any footfall here. We saw a marginal improvement of about 5% in sales over the weekend but our business continues to be at 20% of what it used to be. We are not expecting the situation to improve anytime soon,” said Arjun.At the city’s popular Ambience Mall, despite seeing higher footfall than other plazas on weekends, business is far below the usual mark. Officials of Ambience Private Limited, though, said that with the “right kind of marketing” and more stores reopening by next week, they are hoping to attract more visitors.“Since reopening, on weekdays, we are witnessing an average footfall of 5,000-6,000, and over the weekend it is around 12,000-15,000. Prior to the lockdown, we used to have an average of 35,000-40,000 on weekdays, and around 75,000-90,000 on the weekends. As of now, only 60-70% of the shops have reopened and by next week we are expecting nearly 90% stores to reopen here, which includes food outlets and various brands through which we are expecting to generate a higher footfall. Simultaneously, we are also working on different marketing strategies to first inform people that malls have reopened and that necessary safety protocols are being followed,” said an official representative of Ambience Private Limited, asking not to be named.The few who have been to the arcades over the last week, however, maintain that despite the fact that they saw precautionary measures in place, they are still apprehensive to venture outdoors unless absolutely necessary.“I only visited one of the shopping centres on MG Road as I had to replace some parts of my mobile phone from the store I had purchased it from. Although necessary safety measures such as social distancing, temperature and mask check, hand sanitisers at all entry points, etc., were being followed, I am apprehensive from revisiting any time soon as I fear catching the Covid-19 disease. It will take me some time to readjust to the new norm before venturing outdoors more regularly,” said Manish Sinha, a resident of Sector 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-week-after-reopening-malls-bear-deserted-look/story-Oxo0OhyTMMpi2HkeUfjvfN.html

09-07-2020||Chandigarh||Use your ‘friendship’ with Trump to protect Indian students in US: Bhagwant Mann to Modi||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) state chief and Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann on Wednesday appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to leverage his friendship with US President Donald Trump for the benefit of millions of Indian students studying in the US so that they are not made to leave the country.In a statement issued here, Mann said Trump administration’s decision to ask more than 2.5 million Indian students in the US to leave the country was disastrous.Terming the decision as shocking, Mann said foreign students studying in the US had paid large sums of money in fee to various colleges and universities and asking them to leave will cast a shadow on their future, besides the economic losses.Mann said he had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and external affairs minister S Jaishankar, urging them to immediately get in touch with the White House to protect the interests of Indian students in the US.He said if Trump could authoritatively import hydroxychloroquine tablets from India, why couldn’t our Prime Minister exert pressure on the US to allow the hassled Indian students to stay back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/use-your-friendship-with-trump-to-protect-indian-students-in-us-bhagwant-mann-to-modi/story-igZy1jprAagaIfx8a99s4I.html
09-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram hospitals grapple with shortage of remdesivir||City hospitals are fast running out of the injectable antiviral drug remdesivir that is administered to moderately ill patients in emergency situations. The district administration said the supply of the drug is unable to keep up with the demand.A 100mg vial of the drug costs ₹5,400 and is manufactured by USA-based Gilead Sciences and is distributed in India by Hetero Healthcare Limited. Recently, two other companies were given approvals to sell the patented drug to hospitals in the country by the Drug Controller General of India. According to doctors treating Covid-19 patients, district drug control officials and the chemist association of the city, the availability of remdesivir in Gurugram is rather poor. “Currently, there are 250 vials available in the city in at least three-four big hospitals. The demand is high and supply is less,” said Amandeep Chauhan, district drug control officer, adding that only Hetero was currently supplying the drug to Gurugram.Medanta Medicity, which is treating at least 134 Covid-19 patients, said their stock of around 100 vials at the beginning of the week has run out. Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, critical care, Medanta Hospitals, said, “We don’t have any vials at present. There isn’t enough supply of the drug. The hospital sources it directly from the manufacturing company. If unavailable with us, patients will have to arrange it by themselves. We give them the prescription and the contact details of the person concerned with the manufacturing company in Maharashtra to provide the injection.” At Medeor Hospital in Manesar, a designated Covid-19 hospital. doctors are reluctant to prescribe the drug. “The supply chain of remdesivir is not robust, which raises questions on the quality of the drug,” said Dr Manoj Sharma, senior consultant and incharge – internal medicine. “The drug has been used in 3-4 patients earlier, where kin of the patients were asked to arrange for the drug on their own. A prescription was given to them with the hospital seal on it,” he said, adding that due to the hassle the family has to go through they hardly prescribe the drug. Dr. Manoj Goel, director of pulmonology at Fortis Memorial Research Institute, on the other hand, said that the hospital currently had the drug. Sharad Mehrotra, president, Gurugram Chemist and Drug Association, said, “We are getting lot of enquiries for remdesivir. There are no distributors of the drug in the city and so people are arranging it from Delhi-based distributors.” He said that the association has written to the manufacturing companies, and the state government to put into place a proper distribution policy.Dr. Saket Kumar, managing director, Haryana Medical Services Corporation limited, said, “The department is ensuring the supply is not affected by coordinating with manufacturing companies.” A spokesperson for Hetero Healthcare Limited said, “Vials have been provided to hospitals that have placed their requirement with us. On June 20, the company received the approval from the government for manufacturing the drugs. 3-4 days later, 20,000 vials were given to different hospitals in the country. To address the shortage, we have asked private and state-run hospital to furnish the drug stock with them. From July 13, sufficient stock will be available.”PREVENTING BLACK MARKETING With the possibility of hoarding and black marketing of the drug, the district drug control department has been on high vigil. On July 6, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (enforcement division) directed all state drug controllers to ensure remdesivir is not sold on the black smarket. “We have written to company to deploy their distributors in Gurugram. Hospitals are directly procuring the drug from manufacturers,” said district drug control officer Chauhan. “We have asked the hospitals to share the availability of remdesivir vials on a regular basis to ensure there is no scope for black market.”‘Not a cure’ Senior doctors of private hospitals, who have been treating critical patients said that remdesivir is not a cure. “As per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guideline it is an experimental medicine. It is only given to Covid-19 patients who are moderate to severely ill, especially those who are fresh admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). It is not injected in patients who are in ICU for a long time,” said Mehta. Since the drug impacts liver and kidney, doctors prescribe the drug only after proper investigation. “After that, if the patient requires remdesivir we ask the family to sign a consent form as it is an experimental drug,” said Dr. Manoj Goel of Fortis Memorial Research Institute, adding that the drug is given to patients who have oxygen saturation level below 94%. “Data suggests that the drug improves the recovery rate by 31% but does not improve the mortality rate. It is effective only in the initial phase of infection,” said Goel, who has used the drug in over 15-20 patients who were critical.Ggm tally over 6,300As per the district health bulletin on Wednesday, 133 new cases were reported, taking the total count of infected person to 6316. Of which 987 are active case, 5227 have recovered, while 102 have succumbed to the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-hospitals-grapple-with-shortage-of-remdesivir/story-ahFUYjEAIpv6hJoDWjhOrN.html
09-07-2020||Delhi||In a month, Delhi increased ICU beds three-fold||The number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds in the city to treat coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients have more than tripled in a month — from 582 on June 8 to 1,995 on Wednesday, government data showed.The 115 private hospitals in the city that had Covid-19 wards accounted for 1,325 ICU beds, almost double the number in the 11 public hospitals. The public hospitals include five each under the Delhi government and central government and one under a municipal corporation. The numbers include ICU beds with and without ventilators.As of Wednesday, there were 23,452 active cases of Covid-19 in the national capital, and 4,859 are in hospital. Private Covid hospitals in the city also have a higher occupancy rate of ICU beds. As on Thursday, government data showed around 66% of such beds in private hospitals were occupied, as against 40% in public hospitals.ICU beds with ventilators too have increased during the same period — from 507 to 955 — with almost 54% of them in public hospitals.ICU AUGMENTATIONSenior Delhi government officials said ICU beds were ramped up after roping in more hospitals, as part of a health care infrastructure augmentation plan put in place after a spike in Covid-19 cases. On June 19, Delhi deputy chief minister health minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds temporary charge of the health ministry, asked an advisory committee set up by the Delhi government to focus on ICU beds as the number of cases continued to grow. Since then, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has on multiple occasions stressed that Delhi needed more such beds. Covid-19 treatment rates in the city’s private hospitals were capped last month as well.On Wednesday, Sisodia told HT, “Delhi has set an example in the fight against Covid-19. When the number of Covid cases was increasing in June, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal left no stone unturned to bring the Centre, municipal corporations, NGOs, volunteer doctors and all resources together to enhance the health infrastructure in Delhi. He directed the health department to immediately ramp up the number of ICU beds in government hospitals.”“As a result, the ICUs at three main Delhi government hospitals Lok Nayak Hospital, Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital were not only scaled up to almost triple their capacity, but the services in terms of patient care provided in the government hospitals is also at par with the private hospitals. Today we are in a comfortable position to tackle any emergency situation,” he said.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital, said: “There was a shortage of ICU beds in Delhi before the Covid-19 pandemic hit the city. Now that the ICU capacity has been augmented, it should be permanent. They are needed to tackle day-to-day medical emergencies in Delhi other than potential waves of the pandemic in future.”“The occupancy rate of ICU beds in private Covid hospitals is higher because of two reasons — first, they offer more beds in general and, second, there is a perception about quality of service among people. In terms of patient care, government hospitals in Delhi have witnessed significant changes in the last few years, but there is still large room for improvement,” he added.The Delhi chief minister’s office on Wednesday also said the government planned to add 500 more ICU beds in Covid hospitals by the end of July.Gagan D Bharti, manager of Charity Beds, a non-profit organisation that has been helping people in Delhi avail beds during the pandemic, said: “In the last one month, Delhi has seen some stability in terms of demand for hospitals beds for two reasons. First, the number of total beds and ICU beds have increased. Second, people have also become more aware that not all Covid cases need hospitalisation.”“Delhi, however, needs a proportionately higher number of ICUs. It is because only severe Covid cases are landing in the hospitals and a large number of them would potentially need ICU. General beds’ availability would remain static even if there is a spike in cases again because most mild and moderate cases are isolated at home. In the last one month, 9 out of 10 people we helped with a hospital bed ultimately required ICU,” said Bharti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/in-a-month-delhi-increased-icu-beds-three-fold/story-WPnn75EO7sNGUFuKDQscJJ.html
09-07-2020||Delhi||Hashtags replace placards as dharnas go online||Being the national capital and seat of power, Delhi attracts all manner of dissenters from across India to places like Jantar Mantar and Ramlila Maidan, the country’s most famous protest venues. Through the year, the venues are alive with a cacophony of competing voices making themselves heard on megaphones.This year has been different. The coronavirus disease pandemic, ensuing lockdown and restrictions on public gatherings have confined the protestors indoors, leaving Jantar Mantar and Ramlila Maidan desolate. The demonstrators haven’t been silenced, though -- they have moved online with their placards and other paraphernalia of protests.Innovating and adapting, they now organise e- dharnas, e- strikes, e- memorandums and e- rallies—many of them on Zoom, their “Zantar Mantar.” So, you have traders seeking duty waivers from the government, staff protesting against employers for non- payment of salaries and students demanding scrapping of Delhi University’s online exams – all live on Zoom, Facebook and Instagram -- from their homes, placards in hand.Many take pictures or record videos of their at-home protests and post them on various social media platforms. And this trend of virtual protests, which started in April, is only picking up pace, what with the continuing curbs on large public congregations.Even activists opposed to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, have continued their protests online. They organised a three-day All India Online Protest Conference, in which students, artists, social and political leaders participated in a slew of curated events in mid-June.One event was billed “Artivism,” an online gathering of artists raising their voice against the CAA. Another was called “Shaheen Bagh Zinda Hai “(Shaheen Bagh is alive), named after the venue of a long-running protest against the law, in which women leaders from across the country spoke about how to take forward their campaign.“A lot of people were asking about the future of the anti-CAA movement, the idea behind the event was to send out the message that we may have been forced off the streets by the pandemic, but our democratic and peaceful model of protest is alive. We will be back on the streets once the coronavirus crisis is over,” said Aysha Renna, who represented Shaheen Bagh at the All India Online Protest Conference.“Corona is speeding up the shrinking of democratic spaces all over the world, and pro-democracy voices must find new ways of expressing themselves,” says Fawaz Shaheen, a Delhi-based lawyer and one of the organisers of the online event.Students at the vanguardThe most vocal and vociferous participants in these virtual protests have been students, who are organising online meetings, mass e- mail campaigns, and Twitter Storms ---with hashtags such as PromoteStudentsNotCorona; DUAgaisntOnlineExams; ScrapOBE, #EducationWithoutExclusion --- against DU’s decision to hold final-year exams and to demand an alternative evaluation scheme.On Monday, their two-month-long virtual campaign received a jolt when the ministry of home affairs (MHA) permitted universities to hold final-year examinations by September-end. Delhi University submitted to the Delhi high court on Wednesday that it had postponed the open book exams (OBE) for final-year students until next month. “We will continue our fight. The pandemic has greatly affected the mobilisation of people for protests. During our ongoing protests against DU authorities against online exams, we also protested in small numbers in front of the VC’s (vice chancellor’s) office with placards and then amplified these physical protests online. We have adopted a hybrid model of offline and online protests,” said Sumit Kataria, president of Students’ Federation of India (SFI), Delhi, a left-wing student organisation. “We firmly believe that given the worsening Covid-19 situation in Delhi and mental state of the students, it is wrong to hold exams.”Anil Sethumadhvan, a final year student of Ramjas College in Delhi who often participated in students’ and farmers’ marches before the pandemic, is currently part of a core group of students spearheading virtual protests against Delhi University authorities.He has not yet lost faith in digital protests. “Online tools, though not a replacement for physical protests, can be very effective. Look at the role they played in fuelling the recent Black Lives Matter movement across the world, ” said Sethumadhvan.Migrant crisis the triggerOnline campaigns have to be well- planned and require sustained effort to have any meaningful impact on the social and political processes, experts said.“The idea of online assembly has got a major boost during the ongoing Covid crisis, with civil society and activists adopting it like never before. But sustained efforts and dedicated campaigners are required to ensure these expressions of dissent are channelised into institutional change,” said Apar Gupta, executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundation, a Delhi-based digital rights advocacy organisation.Veteran activists said that what really fuelled online activism during the coronavirus crisis was the plight of migrants workers walking and cycling hundreds of kilometres to their homes in the hinterlands after losing their livelihoods in the cities during the lockdown enforced on March 25.“All activism remained suspended during the initial days of the lockdown, but the migrant crisis prompted activists across the country to go digital,” said Rajendra Ravi, an environment activist and a national convener of the National Alliance of People’s Movements, a coalition of people’s organisations across the country.“While online protests are important, they are as not participatory and democratic as physical protests because of low- digital literacy and lack of access to technology. You can tag a minister or any authority for that matter during a Twitter campaign, but he can easily ignore (you); it will be difficult for him to ignore a protest outside his office,” said Ravi.He also cautioned about virtual protests giving rise to armchair activists. “People may feel that by creating a few compelling social media posts, they have made their contribution. I believe that digital activism can play only a limited role in our country’s socio-political and economic context.”Shaheen agreed. “ We organised an online protest conference as we had no other way of expressing our dissent, but I think online protests are pushing dissenting voices into isolated echo-chambers; you end up talking to people who think like you. There is not much opportunity to persuade new people to join your cause,” he said, “Besides, there is the worrying issue of surveillance by authorities.”Gupta of Internet Freedom Foundation has a different take: “I think Jantar Mantar and other spaces of protest across India will renew and replenish after this pandemic is over with a new generation of tech-savvy activists,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-times-of-social-distancing-demonstrators-and-dissenters-move-online/story-Ec0m8iHEZT15o1S8Y3u5IO.html
09-07-2020||Delhi||To deal with home isolation violations, admin spares the fines, uses counselling||With nearly 14,651 Covid-19 patients being placed in home isolation in the national capital, the major challenge facing the administration is on how to deal with the numerous violations of home isolation guidelines. District officials say the violations are plentiful and range from offences such as tearing off stickers denoting the isolation term, stepping out of homes during the quarantine period, and not answering calls from officials calling to check on patient’s daily health status. Instead of penalising such patients and their family members, which seems harsh given that they are already battling a dreadful virus, the district administrations are now trying to counsel them. Health officials managing Covid care helplines across seven districts of Delhi said since the number of patients being placed in home isolation is increasing, violations of guidelines are also being reported.Data procured by districts shows that every day, at least 20-25 calls are received on their local helpline numbers reporting such violations.“We have given out helpline numbers on which any resident can call and report a violation. If they see a patient or a family member outside the house, they can report the incident. When we get such complaints, we get in touch with the patient or their caretaker. This is also followed by a detailed session of counselling of family members -- we inform them how their actions can affect the health of their neighbours,” said a helpline operator.The operator also said the counselling sessions are either conducted by health department officials or civil defence volunteers.Shashi Kaushal, district magistrate (northeast), said since most of the asymptotic patients are kept in home isolation, the violations, too, are numerous. The administration, she says, prefers to handle them tactically instead of penalising patients or initiating legal action against them.“There have been instances of either the patient or a family member tearing off the home isolation sticker or stepping out of the house. We send our volunteers to counsel them and make them understand the importance of home isolation and the seriousness of the pandemic. The Covid-19 patient and his/her family members are already going through a lot and subjecting them to harsh punishments is not right,” Kaushal said.Nitin Shakya, Covid-19 nodal officer in the New Delhi district, said though there are provisions to take legal action against violators, in most cases, counselling works. “The Epidemic Act allows the administration to lodge an FIR against repeat offenders and/or a fine of ₹500 for offences such as not wearing masks, but this step is hardly considered against patients in home isolation. We have seen that counselling works well to make patients and their families understand what they should not do,” he said.Tanima Sarkar, a resident of south Delhi’s Kalkaji, who completed her home isolation along with two others of her family on Friday, said they were reported by a neighbour after her brother stepped outside to dispose of trash.“While our waste was collected as biomedical waste, the garbage from the rest of the house was accumulating. My brother had tested negative for Covid-19 and we had zero interactions with him. After the complaint, we had a session with officials and we explained the reason for him stepping out, and the administration arranged for sanitation workers to pick up our garbage. This 14-day isolation is not easy for anyone but the health teams were cooperative,” she said.A senior official of the central district also said any penal or legal action is generally avoided. “Patients are already going through a lot of pain and social stigma and booking them for violations will only make things worse. We stick to counselling and persuade them to follow rules for the greater good of society,” the official, on condition of anonymity, said.Two health officials from east and south districts, who have been handling such complaints, said apart from talking to patients in case the violations continue, patients are referred to get professional help.“Many patients are emotionally affected on testing positive for the virus. There is a sense of shame, guilt and also frustration. Many tear off the posters and stickers only because they do not want neighbours to know that they have contracted the infection, fearing the stigma. When we speak to patients, some have also shown violent tendencies and in such cases, we have to involve a professional psychiatrist, who then conducts sessions simultaneously during the course of the Covid-19 treatment,” an east Delhi health official, on condition of anonymity, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/to-deal-with-home-isolation-violations-admin-spares-the-fines-uses-counselling/story-UKTCbaWqOwcz56cBgJnjwL.html
09-07-2020||Education||DU postpones final year online open-book exam till August 15||The Delhi University (DU) on Wednesday postponed the online open-book exams (OBE) for the final year undergraduate and postgraduate students till August 15. This is the second time within a month that the university has postponed the exams with the teachers and students demanding cancellation of exams in the prevailing situation due to the coronavirus pandemic. Despite protest from teachers and students, the university had announced to conduct the online open book exams as a one-time measure amid the Covid-19 pandemic for around 210,000 final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students. The exams were scheduled to begin from Friday.In a notification issued on Wednesday evening, DU Dean of examination Vinay Gupta said, “It is hereby notified for information to all concerned that the Open Book Examination (OBE) for all streams of final year/Semester/Term of undergraduate and postgraduate students including SOL (School of Open Learning) and Non Collegiate Women’s Education Board (NCWEB) scheduled to be held from 10th July, 2020 stands postponed. The OBE will now start after 15 August, 2020, whereas the revised date sheets and other relevant information will be notified in due course of time.”Earlier on Wednesday, the university had informed the Delhi High Court that it has decided to postpone the exams till August 15. The university has cited two reasons behind the decision to postpone the exams --- the recent guidelines of the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the complaints received from students on the issues they faced during the mock online tests in the last two days. The UGC on Monday directed all the universities and colleges to “compulsorily” hold final-year exams by the end of September 2020 in offline/online/blended mode.While hearing the plea filed by several DU students, seeking cancellation of the online open-book exams, Justice Pratibha M Singh was told that the university’s high-powered committee on Tuesday night held a meeting and resolved that there was a requirement of a comprehensive review of the arrangements for the online open-book exams.According to the DU council, the committee had received several complaints about students facing issues while taking online mock tests that had begun Saturday. “The committee has noted that there is a need to spread greater awareness about the OBE examination so that there are no misgivings either about the credibility of the examination process or about its efficacy,” senior advocate Sachin Dutta, appearing for DU, told the court “Taking into account all aspects and circumstances, it is decided to postpone the holding of examinations after August 15,” Dutta said, reading from the minutes of the meeting during the court proceedings via video conferencing.HT had on Sunday reported that hundreds of DU students had complained about technical glitches while appearing for the online mock tests. Responding to this, the court remarked, “See how you are playing with the lives of the students. Look at the careers of the students….When you said that you are ready, then why are you postponing the exams”. The court sent all the matters in connection to the DU online examination to a division bench, which was already hearing a matter with respect to the difficulties faced by visually-impaired students in taking online open-book exams. Criticising the university’s decision of postponing exams, teachers and students said that the exams should have been cancelled considering the prevailing situation. Mehak Garg, a final-year Bcom student at Gargi College, said, “The university is playing with our future by further postponing exams. They should have cancelled the exams and promoted students based on the internal assessment. Further cancellation will affect our future choices. We cannot even give any job interview until the exams happen or take admission in postgraduate courses. Who will hire us without a degree?”Delhi University had earlier scheduled final semester examinations from July 1. The exams were postponed by 10 days owing to the prevailing situation. Abhijeet Shukla, a final year BA (Hons) Political Science student at Maharaja Agrasen College, said, “How can the university be sure that the students will be equipped with devices and proper internet connection by August 15? The university is not considering that the students are going through immense mental pressure due to the delay in getting their degrees.”Pankaj Garg, an associate professor at Rajdhani College, said, “It is going to further aggravate the problems of students. The only solution is to cancel the exams and declare the results of students on the basis of past performance and current session internal assessment. The way Covid 19 cases are increasing every day there would be no improvement in the situation by August 15.”Despite several attempts, DU Dean of Exams Vinay Gupta did not respond to calls and texts sent for comment. A senior official, requesting anonymity, said, “The university might go for a blend of offline and online exams, if the situation allows, in August. We are considering all possible ways to conduct exams of final-year students, as mandated by the UGC’s recent notification.”The matter would be heard on Thursday by a bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/du-postpones-final-year-online-open-book-exam-till-august-15/story-Qkzn3nTeyHjfRNSCUskimI.html
09-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt to enrol at least one lakh more people under food security scheme||The Delhi government’s food and supplies department has restarted the exercise to clear all pending ration card applications in order to extend the benefit of the free ration scheme to more number of people. There are 1.61 lakh application clearances pending with the department of which 13,131 are awaiting approval after completion of field verification, a senior official said, on condition of anonymity. The Delhi government on Tuesday had decided to extend the free ration scheme till November. It also directed the food and civil supplies department to start ration distribution for July in a phased manner from Wednesday, the government said in a statement.“Last week, orders were issued to all food and supplies officers to clear all pending applications. We are currently processing those applications in which the field verification has already been done,” the official quoted above said.“The processing of applications for new ration cards, additions, deletions, transfers, etc., was resumed in circle offices along with work related to servicing containment zones, distribution of ration under the public distribution system (PDS), Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, and Aatma Nirbhar Bharat, among others. The department officials are being provided with necessary protection measures, including face shields, when they go out on field verifications,” another senior official, also on condition of anonymity, said.The approval of new ration cards was put on hold on account of the nationwide lockdown, as field verification was not possible during that time. A food and supplies officer, requesting anonymity, said, “During the lockdown, we were busy distributing rations to schools where temporary shelters had been set up. It was not possible to clear the pending applications then as we could not carry out field verifications. We have now started the process again.” The beneficiary limit under the government scheme is 72.78 lakh people of which 71.54 lakh are already enrolled and currently availing of the benefits. “We have the scope to register nearly one lakh more people. This means we can approve around 25,000 applications as, on average, each applicant family has four members. Moreover, a ration card is a dynamic process and the number of beneficiaries keep changing due to births and deaths in a family,” a fourth senior official said.A week ago, on June 30, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the extension of the government’s free ration scheme, Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, till November-end.According to department officials, the national food security beneficiaries are provided 5kg of foodgrains every month, including 4kg wheat and 1kg rice.A Delhi government spokesperson said, “Issuing ration cards is a continuous process, but it was stalled due to the lockdown imposed because of Covid-19. We have started the process to issue new ration cards now. During lockdown, we were providing ration to all the existing beneficiaries and also to those who are not registered with the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-enrol-at-least-one-lakh-more-people-under-food-security-scheme/story-AmgXrqHXJSBkkH7LnJGePP.html

Plasma therapy is found to have been an effective treatment for Covid-19, but donors are not coming forward which is required to treat critical patients. The donor must be 18-60 years of age. The donor would be thoroughly checked before the plasma is retrieved from the blood and retransferred into the person’s body. The entire process takes about 2-3 hours and the person does not experience any weakness. We need enough donors so that we can set up a plasma bank.”After a meeting with private laboratories, Mhaisekar added that the they must provide reports within 24 hours. “The private laboratories must compulsorily provide reports within 24 hours to their respective health officers. All reports of samples taken till 6 pm must be provided to the nodal officers without fail. The data must be uploaded on Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-hits-highest-spike-in-covid-19-cases-1-147-positives-reported/story-UkkQJcPiwLtC4Z86XN4gHN.html

09-07-2020||Pune||Denied entry into Junnar village, couple consumes pesticide; woman dies||Pune A 40-year-old woman died after she and her husband consumed pesticides after police denied them entry into a containment zone in Junnar. The 50-year-old man, a vegetable vendor, is undergoing treatment in hospital.The incident took place on Tuesday evening when the couple got into an argument with on-duty police personnel who suggested them to take an alternative route to reach their home in village Umbraj under Junnar taluka, according to the police. The restriction was imposed after four positive cases were reported from the village.According to superintendent of police (Pune rural) Sandip Patil, the couple was involved in a squabble with police in the past also, but this time they threatened to commit suicide when stopped from removing barrier and asked to take an alternate route. The couple was carrying pesticides with them in the tempo with vegetables. The deceased and her husband, according to police, were on their way to Umbraj when they were stopped by the police patrol during nakabandi on Tuesday. A war of words broke out between the police and the couple who were returning home after selling vegetables in other villages. The deceased drank poison from a bottle while her 50-year-old husband immediately spat it. The woman was rushed to a nearby hospital but was proclaimed dead on arrival. The quarrel between the couple and police was captured on video by locals in which the husband is seen demanding entry to the village saying that others were allowed. “I am merely asking for entry as others were allowed. I was asked about documents while denying entry,” the man was heard telling grampanchayat member. Junnar sarpanch Sapna Dangat said nakabandi was in place as a precautionary move to check virus spread.According to Patil, the policemen had suggested them to avoid the containment route as it was closed with a barricade. “The police requested them to take an alternate route but they did not listen. Even the gram samiti members tried to convince them. The husband pulled out a pesticide bottle, took a sip and then vomited it, but his wife gulped it. We did not wait for ambulance and took her to the hospital, but unfortunately she died,” he said. The police have lodged a case against the couple under IPC 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and IPC 309 (attempt to commit suicide). The SP said that the family had alleged that the police beat them up, but police personnel did not use any force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/denied-entry-in-junnar-village-couple-consumes-pesticide-woman-dies/story-4Gql67ha7r9dtlzGdnM7xJ.html
09-07-2020||Pune||Pune hospitals report shortage of remdesivir, tocilizumab amidst rise in number of critical patients||Multiple city hospitals are reporting shortage of crucial drugs used for the treatment of critical Covid-19 patients. Nikhil Kumbhar, a resident of Pune was about to leave for Mumbai to get remdesivir vials for his uncle, undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at a private hospitals. The patient had been admitted to Noble Hospital on June 30 and on July 4, doctors informed the family that there is a shortage of remdesivir. “Before leaving for Mumbai, I tried to reach out to multiple hospitals in the city, but none of them responded positively. Finally, when I got in touch with a few retailers in Mumbai who had the vials. I got permission for an e-pass from the Pune police, however, fortunately, the hospital got its vials which they had ordered before and resumed the treatment,” said Kumbhar. Dr HK Sale, executive director of Noble hospital, said, “Despite making a full advance payment to the dealer for about 96 vials of remdesivir, we received only 56 of them. Each patient requires nine doses of the vials which means, I can treat only nine patients. There is surely a shortage of the drugs and the supply is also irrational. Another important drug for Covid-19 treatment, tocilizumab is in shortage.” As of Tuesday, PMC reported 385 critical patients of the 7,859 active cases in the city. Of the 385 critical patients, 63 are on ventilator while 322 are serious in the ICU with comorbidities and undergoing oxygen treatment. Remdesivir and tocilizumab, are two drugs, used for the treatment of Covid-19 patients who require oxygen supply in the city. Only two companies as of now produce the drug in India, namely, Hyderabad-based Hetero and Cipla. Dr Ashok Nandapurkar, civil surgeon and nodal officer for Covid-19 in Pune, said, “The approval to use remdesivir for Covid-19 patients came only a few days ago and we are now placing orders for the same, but we are yet to get the supply. There is a delay in the supply and we require it for government hospitals.” Dr Parikshit Prayag, consultant at Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said, “We are facing a shortage of remdesivir and it has shown some promising results in patients who require oxygen treatment. It shortens the duration of the illness. However, no significant benefit has been found in mechanically-ventilated patients. We have so far used it for 15 patients and it’s too early to comment on its efficacy. But the supply has been inconsistent. Tocilizumab supply has been much better , and now we are also using subcutaneous tocilizumab which requires a smaller dose and has been shown to be comparable to intravenous tocilizumab.” Nikhil Chopra, executive vice-president and CEO-India Business, Cipla, said, “We are proud to commercially launch CIPREMI on Tuesday; amongst the lowest priced globally, we aim to supply over 80,000 vials within the first month itself. To further ensure equitable distribution, CIPREMI will be available via government and hospital channels only. Cipla will also be donating some amount of the drug as part of its efforts to support the community in this time of need.” Dr Sunil Rao, group medical director, Sahyadri hospitals, said, “Earlier, we were not getting the dose of remdesivir, but now the supply has somewhat stabilised. In fact, we have been told by chemists and traders that in a few days there will be an overflooding of remdesivir as more pharma companies are racing in to produce the drug. However, now we are facing a shortage of tociluzumab. It has shown some promise in the treatment of patients. It prevents patients from becoming critical moderately ill to critically ill. Each vials costs around Rs 40,000 and we currently have vials remaining for only one or two patients in all our hospitals. We are hoping to get the supply consistently, but the timing of providing the drug for treatment is essential and we cannot afford to lose those precious hours or days.”One dose of remdesivir costs around Rs 5,400 plus GST, according to doctors. The Pune division health department has sent a demand to the state government on July 3 for a total of 1,850 vials of injection tocilizumab (400 mg) and 7,100 injections of remdesivir (100 mg) for government hospitals in Pune and hospitals in Satara and Solapur, which are yet to be supplied. Of this stock, 500 vials of injection tocilizumab (400 mg) and 2,000 vials of injections of remdesivir (100 mg) has been reserved for PMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-hospitals-report-shortage-of-remdesivir-tocilizumab-amidst-rise-in-number-of-critical-patients/story-e12arkwpWrsFlFFWGM9gVI.html

They will carry out rapid antigen-based tests of residents after undergoing training by the civic administration. The students will be provided stipend, protective gears and medical insurance cover.SPPU vice-chancellor Prof Nitin Karmalkar said, “Pune is one of the worst Covid-19 affected cities. To check the virus spread, testing capacity needs to be increased as limited testing has increased the burden on quarantine. In this context, PMC requested me to help deploy on-site point-of-care rapid antigen detection test for Covid-19 in several selected areas of the city. Accordingly, our 300 students have volunteered to be part of the initiative. They are students pursuing undergraduate and post-graduate courses, mostly from the Science stream and others are from other departments.”“They will be trained by PMC this week and carry out field testing from next week. PMC will provide them medical insurance and stipend. It will be the first opportunity where SPPU students will be working for a social cause on the field during the Covid period,” Karmalkar said.“I personally appealed to UG, PG and PhD students, staff, teachers and researchers from colleges and universities of the city for their voluntary participation in this cause,” said Karmalkar.PMC additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal, who supervises PMC health department, said, “We are involving SPPU students for our rapid antigen detection testing. The first webinar training for the students will begin from tomorrow (July 9). Three students will be deployed at each antigen testing centre (ATC).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/300-sppu-students-to-participate-in-antigen-test-initiative/story-axt00P7llf8KIt6vR7D03L.html
09-07-2020||Pune||Mall owners in Pune look forward to resume business||The wait to reopen malls continues in the city as “Unlock 2.0” does not bring any relief to its owners.Mall owners have kept standard operating procedures (SOP) ready and have already made a representation to authorities under the aegis of Retailers Association of India (RAI) and Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI).“We believe malls are far better placed to enforce SOPs, ensure crowd control and social distancing compared to other establishments that have resumed business. We have reassured the state government of support from the industry to operate in a safe and hygienic environment,” said Amitabh Taneja, chairman, Shopping Centres Association of India.Mall owners are looking forward to resume business after the government allowed hotels and restaurants to operate from Wednesday.“We are ready to open our malls even tomorrow if government gives us the permission. Wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and sanitisation of hands are the three most important aspects to be followed and we are ready for it,” said Arun Arora, centre director, Pheonix Market City.“We have put foot markers on floors and footfall density tracker have also been placed. Total count of visitors will be displayed on boards. If customers cross the limit, then we will ban entry till people exit,” he said.“We need customers to believe that malls are safer social spaces than the conventional high streets. We will maintain regulated and monitored environment, adhering to high standard of safety and hygiene combined with social distancing precautions and technology driven solutions,” said Mahesh M, CEO Creaticity.Many owners have urged authorities to reopen malls like other states.“Malls across India have reopened and no Covid-19 case has been reported from these shopping centres. Maharashtra is the only state where malls are closed. Every mall employs 6,000 to 8,000 people and their jobs are at stake,” said Surjit Singh Rajpurohit, CEO, Amanora Mall.“Once the malls are allowed to reopen, retailers will go for discount sales to clear their pending stock. There will not be any immediate price rise from shop owners,” Rajpurohit said.Malls across India see 77% fall in sales: RAI surveyAccording to a Retailers Association of India (RAI) survey, between June 15-30, 77 per cent decline in business has been noticed in malls because of lockdown as compared to last year. For retailers, there has been 67 per cent decline in business.“Although the quantum of de-growth marginally reduced in June 2020, The first quarter of FY21 continued to witness de-growth of 74%. The figures depict a grim situation for not just retailers but the entire economy as retail is the backbone of consumption. The policymakers too need to ensure uniform opening of all kinds of retail across the country,” said Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, Retailers Association of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mall-owners-in-pune-looking-forward-to-resume-business/story-OFq6VwnXtA2GVmwhpiWm4L.html

The unit allegedly manufactured rifles, pistols, revolvers, double-barrel shotguns, semi-finished arms and cartridges besides other tools used to make them.Narender Bijarnia, the superintendent of police, Nuh, said that assistant sub-inspector Ajit Singh of crime investigation agency and the station house officer of Ferozepur Jhirka informed him regarding the manufacture of illegal arms and ammunition in Bhakroji village, following which they formed 10 teams. “The teams raided the unit on the outskirts of the village. The suspects had been manufacturing illegal arms and ammunition in the unit for over three years. An informer told us that if we raided the place, we could arrest over 10 persons from the spot. Thereafter, we conducted a surprise raid on Sunday, but the suspects fled the spot as soon as we got there,” he said.Bijarnia said they had identified other locations in Nuh where such illegal arm manufacturing units are set up.The weapons manufactured in these units are sold in Haryana and the National Capital Region, which includes Delhi, Noida and Gurugram, Bijarnia said. “Most of the gangs busted in the past few months had bought weapons from people in Nuh. We started connecting the dots—from where these gangs bought weapons and whom they supplied to. We were keeping a strict vigil across the district,” Bijarnia said.The Nuh police are preparing a database of recently busted gangs, and the weapons recovered from them, they said.Bijarnia said that the average price of each of the weapons ranged between ₹5,000 and ₹35,000. “The arms maker would increase the price depending on the demand and urgency shown by the criminals at the time of procurement. These people specialised in making countrymade pistols,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/illegal-arms-manufacturing-unit-unearthed-in-nuh/story-wWEZGSzMYvMbxhP8WxvQdL.html

09-07-2020||Gurugram||Haryana Police launches software to digitise criminal records||The Haryana Police has launched a new software application, named Police Artificial Intelligence System (PAIS), which will allow the police to digitise and centralise all criminal records and quickly match the details of a suspect with a centralised database during an investigation. According to the police, PAIS is an advanced artificial intelligence-enabled software technology to identify any criminal uniquely with the help of facial recognition and textual search. This technology will be made available to police officials of the state through both mobile and web-based applications. The application has been developed by the Digital Investigation Training and Analysis Centre (DITAC), which was set up in 2016 in the Traffic Tower in Sushant Lok-1 to promote digital investigation and training in a bid to enhance cyber policing and monitor social media content, said the police. Anil Rao, the additional director-general of police, Criminal Investigation Department (CID), said that they have launched the PAIS application to support police personnel during field investigation via innovative features, such as gang analysis, phonetic and textual searches and more. “The application has advanced features, such as facial recognition. The mobile application will receive information about criminals from the central database on a real-time basis. It will also create an online dossier that will help in police investigation and apprehension of criminals,” he said.The technology is divided into two components: one is a web-based system that can run on desktops and the other is a mobile application that needs to be installed on phones. Rao said the server for the application has been installed at the command centre of the DITAC. Although the software is ready, the final testing part, known as VAPT or vulnerability assessment and penetration testing, and the training ton how to use the software is still pending. The software has a centralised data bank of criminals, miscreants and history-sheeters that will help the police to nab the proclaimed offenders and bail jumpers, said officials.Each district will train one team, which will further train others. Following the period of training, each police officer will gain access to the PAIS software either through desktops or through mobile phones. Police officials using this software for registration of criminals or for search will be required to log in via a unique password, said the police.Rao said the OTP-based authentication process for profiling or searching criminals will ensure maximum security. “This app will provide matching details from the centralised criminal database within seconds, offering far more accuracy than any other existing criminal recognition system,” he said.Officials said police officials will no longer need to physically go through the register to trace the criminal history of a suspect. This will make the entire process of criminal recognition and registration seamless and digital.Rao said with the help of the application, a police officer can take a photo of a suspect from his camera and upload the same on the application. The application will then search the database and instantly display the name and details of the suspect if matching records are found. In case matching records are not found, the application will then redirect to a criminal information page, where the officer concerned will be able to add the details. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said the criminal record officer underwent training for a day and will train others regarding the functions of application. “The application will be fully operational within a month and the process of collecting the criminal records has already started. The application will be particularly helpful in Gurugram, which has a high density of population,” he said.This is not the first time that an advanced criminal recognition system has been used. Earlier in 2018, the Punjab Police had launched a similar PAIS application and have successfully nabbed several criminals with its help. BOX:What is a PAIS application?PAIS or Police Artificial Intelligence System is an AI-enabled software technology compatible with both desktops and mobile phones that enable police officers to recognise criminals through facial recognition and textual search.Features in PAIS1.

09-07-2020||India||Aravalli Biodiversity Park reopens: Eager visitors venture wilderness with masks, follow social distancing||Face masks, social distancing, avoiding large groups, careful on the benches, no-eatables, one-way signages — visiting the popular nature spot Aravalli Biodiversity Park, during the ongoing pandemic era, won’t be the same considering the new rules put in place to avoid the spread of coronavirus. Gurugram’s favourite spot has reopened, on July 1, and Gurugrammers are kicked to visit even if it means following some strict guidelines. “The park is finally open after the lockdown,” says Priti Sanwalka, one of the board members, adding, “It’s a great time to be at the park and enjoy its flora and fauna; there is a burst of activity on all fronts and lots of flowering, fruiting and bird activity to enjoy. And to ensure the safety of all visitors and our staff, we have put in place measures as per the unlock guidelines of Ministry of Home Affairs.”Latika Thakral, co-founder of the NGO, iamgurgaon, says, “People were eagerly awaiting for the park to reopen and some even checked on call... Now that the park is open, we have arrows put up to identify one-way movement in the main stretch. It’s very difficult to control (once visitors start coming), but we are assuming that people will follow the rules.” Among those who are regular visitors at the park is photographer Dinesh Khanna, who visits with his pets. He says, “Considering the circumstances, I think these are excellent rules and will, hopefully, be adhered properly by all walkers. I definitely will make sure to be responsible as it’s in everyone’s interest.” Another park regular and Gurugram resident Sarika Panda Bhatt says, “We Gurugramers were eagerly waiting for BDP to open! Unfortunately, the Covid-19 crisis is here to stay for some time as we don’t have a cure or a vaccine. A number of studies from around the world have shown that when people maintain the rules of hygiene and protection — like wear face masks, avoid large gatherings, and maintain physical distancing — then the chance of catching the infection is negligible. Therefore, the new regulations at the park are a welcome step. We definitely need outdoor activities to fight with other health issues and going to the forest is the best remedy.”Ecologist Vijay Dhasmana says the place is a “delight” for any nature lover. “The park has been thriving with this year’s early rains. Monsoon is a most productive time, with caterpillar, bugs, and flowering. At the park too, many plants are flowering and fruiting. Unfortunately, people could not witness the spring flowering this year. But now birds are nesting and you can hear the jungle with crickets, cicadas sounds. Lockdown has been tough on people. So when they will now get to go in the wilderness, it will give them positivity and hope. There is so much life happening there; people who understand nature will get to witness all that.”Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/aravalli-biodiversity-park-reopens-eager-visitors-venture-wilderness-with-masks-follow-social-distancing/story-F4nLmbQ7zhv0fiDy1NUVxM.html

Helping people return to gyms safely will also help the nation get match-fit to defeat this virus”.Officials, however, said the people will still need to remain cautious and follow guidance about social distancing, wearing face covering and limiting interaction with people outside their immediate family and friends circles.Leisure centres and indoor gyms, along with swimming pools and other indoor sports facilities, have been closed in the UK since March 21. Various organisations have lobbied the government to allow them to re-open in recent days.Dowden said: “The reopening of gyms is the news millions across the country have been waiting for with many people desperate to jump on a spinning bike or dive into a pool. Our comprehensive guidance will ensure gyms, pools and leisure centres have the support they need to reopen safely for their customers and staff”.“Helping people return to gyms safely will also help the nation get match-fit to defeat this virus,” he added.Leicester in the east Midlands remains under lockdown, unlike the rest of England, where pubs, restaurants and galleries are among those allowed to re-open. Testing in the city with a large population of Indian origin has shown falling number of infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-after-huge-progress-gyms-plays-get-green-signal-to-re-open-in-uk/story-qL7dRooCFTd1Qy7RbHyqeO.html
09-07-2020||World||US Supreme Court denies Trump ‘immunity’, unblocks release of financial records||The US Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the release of President Donald Trump’s personal tax and financial records to New York investigators but turned down subpoenas for the same papers and information from congressional committees in a separate case.But the American public will not be able to see immediately the president’s tax records and financial information because they will be released to a grand jury, whose proceedings were secret. Using other legal recourse still available, the president’s lawyers can prevent the release of these records till at least the November elections.Ruling 7-2 in both cases, the court rejected the central argument put forward by the president’s lawyers to prevent the release thee records — not from him directly, but his accountants — that US presidents enjoy complete and absolute immunity from criminal prosecution while in office.“We reaffirm that principle today and hold that the president is neither absolutely immune from criminal subpoenas seeking his private papers nor entitled to a heightened standard of need.” Chief Justice John Robert wrote in the majority opinion in the New York investigation case.In the same ruling, he also wrote, “In our judicial system, ‘the public has a right to ‘everyman’s evidence’. Since the earliest days of the Republic, ‘every man’ has included the President of the United States.”President Trump, who has refused to release his tax and financial records bucking a long-running practice for US presidents or those even running for the high office, will get to hold on to his financial records for now and until the elections at least, as his lawyers can challenge the New York investigators’ subpoenas for his records in lower courts. And his lawyers have said since that is their plan. It was thus a win for the president also, in a way. But he did not see it that way and lashed out in a string of angry tweets. “This is all a political prosecution. I won the Mueller Witch Hunt, and others, and now I have to keep fighting in a politically corrupt New York. Not fair to this Presidency or Administration!” he wrote in one of them.“Courts in the past have given ‘broad deference’., he wrote in another. “BUT NOT ME!”Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, both nominated by President Trump, ruled with the majority opinion, denying the president’s central claim of absolute immunity from prosecution.The office of the Manhattan district attorney Cy Vance, a Democrat, had sought eight years of the president financial records form Mazars USA, his accountant, in an investigation into the payment of hush-money to Stormy Daniels, a porn star who has said she had an affair with Trump. Michael Cohen, the president’s former lawyer and fixer who is in jail for it, had paid her not to talk about the relationship in the run-up to the 2016 election, and was reimbursed by the president later.The second case was about subpoenas issued separately by the oversight committee and the intelligence committee of the House of Representatives that are also investigating the Stormy Daniels payments and whether Trump underreported his assets to reduce his tax liabilities, or inflated them overplay his worth to obtain loans. The Supreme Court ordered the House committees to go back to lower courts to get these records.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-denies-trump-immunity-unblocks-release-of-financial-records/story-ioSca8mNQ5eEUTdcLxyYOO.html

With testing levels low, the real numbers are unknown.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageSouth Africa has the most confirmed cases with over 224,000, and for the first time Gauteng province — home to Johannesburg and the capital, Pretoria — has the country’s most cases with over 75,000, or 33 per cent.Provincial official Bandile Masuku, a medical doctor, startled South Africans when he told reporters Wednesday that Gauteng is preparing over 1.5 million graves. “It’s a reality that we need to deal with,” he said, and it’s the public’s responsibility “to make sure that we don’t get there.” The province in a statement Thursday sought to calm fears, saying it “does not have over a million already open dug graves” and the number refers to the potential capacity. It also said six members of Gauteng’s Covid-19 War Room have tested positive for the virus.Asked about the comments, Africa CDC chief John Nkengasong said “there’s absolutely no harm to think ahead” and prepare for the worst-case scenario.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pandemic-in-africa-is-now-reaching-full-speed/story-Wf4ghViv5jsPgwgsNzNpwI.html
09-07-2020||World||Pak religious affairs ministry seeks Islamic body’s advice on construction of temple in Islamabad||Pakistan’s religious affairs ministry has written to an Islamic body to seek its opinion on the government’s funding for the construction of the first Hindu temple in the capital city amid opposition from some Muslim groups, a media report said on Thursday.The Krishna temple will come up in a 20,000 sq ft plot in the capital’s H-9 administrative division.Pakistan’s Minister of Religious Affairs Noorul Haq Qadri on Wednesday said there was no problem related to the construction of the temple, but the real issue was whether it could be built with the public money.Pakistan government has approved Rs 100 million (Rs 10 crore) for the temple. Qadri has now forwarded the case to the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), Dawn newspaper reported.The CII is a constitutional body responsible for giving legal advice on Islamic issues to the Pakistan government.In the letter, Qadri sought the council’s opinion on whether the government was allowed to fund the construction of a temple in the city, the report said.The letter asked whether the government can build a non-Muslim place of worship using government funds, it said.It said that a delegation from the Islamabad Hindu Panchayat and some non-Muslim parliamentarians met with Qadri and sought government funding for the temple’s construction.In the letter, the Qadri said his ministry also deals with the Minorities Welfare Fund, which is used for the repair and maintenance of religious sites of minority communities on the basis of recommendations from non-Muslim parliamentarians.“However, construction of a new place of worship for the religious minorities was not permissible under the rules,” the letter said, adding that in view of the situation, the application was forwarded to the Prime Minister’s Office for consideration.Parliamentarians and Qadri met with Prime Minister Imran Khan on this matter. The visit was used by some clerics, who opposed the construction of the temple, to create a controversy, according to the letter.CII Chairman Qibla Ayaz acknowledged that he had received the ministry’s letter and said it has been forwarded to the council’s research department to formulate an opinion on this question.Ayaz said clerics should not protest the matter but should guide the CII on it instead. He said it will be taken up during the CII’s meeting scheduled for September, as it takes two to three weeks for the research department to finalise an opinion after holding consultations and seeking public comments if needed.Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, a lawmaker from the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, told Dawn that the argument regarding the funding for the temple was incorrect.“Some people say that a Hindu temple cannot be built with taxes collected from Muslims. That is correct and we agree with it but has any money been spent on the construction of any temple in the country with taxes paid by the Hindu community in 70 years,” he asked.“Therefore, the government’s grant of Rs100 million is valid, as it was actually our money,” he said.Meanwhile, a protest was also held in support of the temple’s construction at the National Press Club.The protesters said the temple should have been built for the city’s Hindu population decades ago and demanded that the government not bow down to pressure from extremists who have been harassing citizens of the country constantly on various pretexts. A Pakistani court on Tuesday dismissed three identical petitions challenging the construction of the first Hindu temple in Islamabad.A single bench of the Islamabad High Court delivered the judgement, making it clear that there was no bar on the Institute of Hindu Panchayat from building the temple on the land allotted to it, using its own funds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-religious-affairs-ministry-seeks-islamic-body-s-advice-on-construction-of-temple-in-islamabad/story-arvT2rdgfLwXbIztGIPGQK.html

A booming MSME sector will also complement big industry. There are investment opportunities in the defence sector”.“With relaxed FDI norms, one of the world’s biggest militaries invites you to come and make products for it. Now, there are more opportunities for private investment in space sector. This will mean greater access to commercial use of space tech for the benefit of people,” he added.Noting India’s efforts to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, Modi said his government is equally focused on the health of the economy, and mentioned initiatives such as Ayushman Bharat, tax reforms and efforts to increase the ease of doing business.India, he told the virtual audience, will have a key role in scaling-up production of a vaccine for coronavirus, when it is found in ongoing trials across the globe. The pandemic has once again shown that India’s pharma industry is an asset for the entire world, he added.On his government’s relief package for those adversely affected by the pandemic, he said it has been smart and targeted to provide the most poor with the most help.He said: “Thanks to technology, every penny has reached the beneficiaries directly. The relief includes, providing free cooking gas, cash in the bank accounts, free food grains to millions of people and many other things”. “As soon as we unlocked, we have launched one of the world’s largest public works program to provide employment to millions of workers. This will not only re-energise the rural economy, but also help in creation of durable infrastructure in the rural areas.”, he added.Speakers at the three-day event themed ‘Be the revival: India & a better new world’ include Indian ministers S Jaishankar, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Piyush Goyal; British ministers such as Dominic Raab, Matt Hancock and Priti Patel; and Congress MP Shashi Tharoor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/noting-green-shoots-pm-modi-beckons-global-investors/story-Yhxen2FJPvN2KzyH7Wf4zO.html

09-07-2020||World||UN chief seeks end to financing of coal to smooth clean energy shift||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged countries on Thursday to stop financing for coal and commit not to build new coal-fired power plants to enable a shift to clean energy.He spoke at a virtual clean energy transition summit of 40 countries representing 80% of energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. They discussed steps to buoy economies, cut emissions and make energy systems more resilient to climate change.As countries look to revive their economies from the slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic, governments and investors have been calling for recovery packages to focus in part on green stimulus.The European Union and South Korea have already pledged environmentally-minded recovery programmes. But Guterres said some countries have used them to also prop up fossil fuel companies which were already struggling financially, and others have chosen to jump-start coal-fired power plants.“Coal has no place in COVID-19 recovery plans,” Guterres said in a videolink speech to the summit, hosted by the International Energy Agency (IEA).He said the business case for renewables was better than coal in nearly every market and that green jobs and sustainable growth are both crucial.China, the world’s second largest economy and biggest coal producer, said it was committed to a clean and efficient low-carbon development of the energy sector.“We are going to make great efforts to develop hydro, wind and solar,” Zhang Jinhua, director of China’s National Energy Administration, told the virtual meeting.Although coal use has been declining in some regions such as Europe and the United States, and many investors have pulled out of coal financing, it has been growing in other parts of the world as emerging economies say coal use is needed for growth.A recent study found that China has nearly 250 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired power now under development, more than the entire coal power capacity of the United States.Governments have agreed to curb global warming to safer levels to avoid catastrophic effects of climate change and to achieve a net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050.“Global energy demand has declined sharply this year and so did emissions (due to coronavirus-related lockdowns). But whether that decline will rebound or not we do not know. Ministers will decide through the policies they put in place,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol.The IEA, which advises Western governments on energy policy, said last week a huge acceleration in clean energy innovation is needed to achieve a global goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. It has also produced a roadmap for governments to cut carbon emissions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-seeks-end-to-financing-of-coal-to-smooth-clean-energy-shift/story-A82TKy7I2B3DK3gr9eHlTL.html

There is an ongoing trade war, the South China Sea issue– where Washington has dispatched two of its super aircraft carriers – the status of Hong Kong, the tit-for-tat visa restrictions over Tibet and the human rights situation in the remote northwestern province of Xinjiang.“What is alarming is that the Sino-US relationship is one of the most important bilateral relations in the world, but is facing the most serious challenges since the establishment of diplomatic relations [in 1979],” Wang said in a speech in Beijing on Thursday.“Then we should properly manage those disputes and minimise the damage to relations between the two nations based on the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences,” he said.Washington has repeatedly accused Beijing in recent months of covering up the initial outbreak of the coronavirus, which later transformed into an epidemic, and accused it of allowing it to spread to other nations.US President Donald Trump has called it the “Chinese virus” on more than one occasion, triggering strong criticism from China.On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the world should not permit China’s “bullying” to take place, highlighting the country’s territorial disputes with India, Vietnam, and Japan, which has further riled Beijing with the Chinese foreign ministry making scathing comments on the US politician.Wang, who is one of China’s senior most diplomats, suggested that think tanks in China and the US compile three lists, with the first outlining bilateral and global issues the two countries could work on, and the second detailing issues on which they have disputes but expectations that can be resolved through dialogue. The final list should be of issues that cannot be resolved, Wang said.Some people say that China-US relations cannot go back to what they used to be, but that does not mean that the two countries begin anew regardless of history, Wang was quoted as saying.Decoupling cannot be forced either, Wang said, adding that Beijing and Washington should build on the past and advance with the times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-us-relations-facing-most-serious-challenge-minister-wang-yi/story-tZJwEDbLOgUhEkMTBdxfxN.html
09-07-2020||World||Hong Kong tightens social distancing to combat new virus outbreak||Hong Kong tightened social distancing measures on Thursday to combat a fresh coronavirus outbreak in a city that had largely managed to quash local transmissions in recent months.Health officials have been rattled by a cluster of new infections that have suddenly spread through the tightly packed business hub of 7.5 million people.The city recorded 34 locally transmitted coronavirus cases on Thursday, the highest daily tally in more than three months. “Now that the pandemic is coming back, I appeal to everyone to reduce outings, gatherings and dining together,” health minister Sophia Chan told reporters. Authorities announced a reintroduction of limits to how many people can gather together, a repeat of measures taken earlier in the year that helped stifle the coronavirus outbreak. A maximum of eight people can sit together at restaurants while bars, pubs and nightclubs are capped at four people per table.Catering businesses can only operate at 60 percent of their usual capacity. Gyms and karaoke lounges must have no more than 16 people in each room or facility.Hong Kong was one of the first places to be struck by the coronavirus earlier this year after it burst out of central China.But authorities made impressive headway against the disease, helped by a population with previous experience of outbreaks who readily adopted facemasks and social distancing. The city has recorded 1,365 cases of the disease since January, with seven deaths. However the new outbreak shows the stubborn resilience of the coronavirus, even in a city with a strong record of stopping its spread. New infection clusters started to emerge in the past two days, including at an elderly care home that reported at least 32 cases. At least 12 new infections in the last five days have been classified as unknown in origin, meaning authorities are struggling to work out how the disease is spreading in those instances.Last month, Hong Kong relaxed its social distancing rules to allow public gatherings of up to 50 people, reopen theme parks and scrap customer restrictions for restaurants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-tightens-social-distancing-to-combat-new-virus-outbreak/story-SUUMevcxxfEo0Ss5peQ0OI.html
09-07-2020||World||Seoul mayor reported missing, his phone switched off, search underway||The mayor of South Korean capital Seoul has been reported missing and police are searching for him on Thursday.Police officers said they are looking for Mayor Park Won-soon at Seoul’s Sungbuk neighborhood where his mobile phone signal was last detected. They said Park’s mobile phone was currently turned off.His daughter called police earlier Thursday and said her father has been unaccounted for, the police officers said, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to media on the matter.They gave no further details. But Yonhap news agency reported Park’s daughter told police that her father left “a will-like” message before leaving their home earlier Thursday.Yonhap said officers, drones and police dogs have been mobilized for Park’s search.Kim Ji-hyeong, an official from the Seoul Metropolitan Government, confirmed that Park did not show up for work on Thursday because of unspecified reasons and canceled all his schedules, including a meeting with a presidential official at his Seoul City Hall office.A longtime civic activist and human rights lawyer, Park was elected as Seoul mayor in 2011 and became the city’s first mayor to be voted into a third term in June last year. A member of President Moon Jae-in’s liberal Democratic Party, Park has been considered a potential presidential hopeful for the liberals in the 2022 elections.Park has mostly maintained his activist colors as mayor, criticizing what he described as the country’s growing social and economic inequalities and the traditionally corrupt ties between large businesses and politicians.During the earlier part of his terms, Park established himself as a fierce opponent of former conservative President Park Geun-hye and openly supported the millions of people who flooded the city streets in late 2016 and 2017, calling for her ouster over a corruption scandal.Park Geun-hye was formally removed from office in March 2017 and is currently serving a decades-long prison term on bribery and other charges.Seoul, a city with 10 million people, has been a new epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in South Korea since the Asian country eased its rigid social distancing rules in early May. Authorities are struggling to trace contacts amid surges in cases linked to nightclubs, church services, a huge e-commerce warehouse and door-to-door sellers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seoul-mayor-reported-missing-his-phone-off-search-underway/story-A6fQ0DEcuKHAiRqNQ0oDIM.html
09-07-2020||World||‘A hot mess’: Americans face testing delays as Covid-19 cases surge||With a cough and shortness of breath, it took Austin, Texas, resident Sam Lee three tries to get a Covid-19 test.The first time, he showed up an hour before the public testing site was set to close and was told they had reached capacity. He was turned away from a second center when rain shut it down, and voluntarily left a third after someone ahead of him said they had been waiting in line for more than three hours.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here “If you have symptoms and you are just driving around the city trying to figure out how you can get a test, for people who are positive, it is not ideal,” said Lee, who finally got a test on June 29 after he showed up at a site before dawn and waited for more than two hours. Another five days passed before he was able to view the results online, and he didn’t receive a text with the results until seven days after being tested.Four months, 3 million confirmed infections and over 130,000 deaths into the coronavirus outbreak in the US, Americans confronted with a resurgence of the scourge are facing long lines at testing sites in the summer heat or are getting turned away. Others are going a week or more without receiving a diagnosis.Some sites are running out of kits, while labs are reporting shortages of materials and workers to process the swabs.Some frustrated Americans are left to wonder why the US can’t seem to get its act together, especially after it was given fair warning as the virus wreaked havoc in China and then Italy, Spain and New York.“It’s a hot mess,” said 47-year-old Jennifer Hudson of Tucson, Arizona. “The fact that we’re relying on companies and we don’t have a national response to this, it’s ridiculous. … It’s keeping people who need tests from getting tests.”Click here for complete coronavirus coverage It took Hudson five days to make an appointment through a CVS pharmacy near her home. She booked a drive-up test over the weekend, more than a week after her symptoms — fatigue, shortness of breath, headache and sore throat — first emerged. The clinic informed her that her results would probably be delayed.Testing has been ramped up nationwide, reaching about 640,000 tests per day on average, up from around 518,000 two weeks ago, according to an Associated Press analysis. Newly confirmed infections per day in the U.S. are running at over 50,000, breaking records at practically every turn.More testing tends to lead to more cases found. But in an alarming indicator, the percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus is on the rise across nearly the entire country, hitting almost 27% in Arizona, 19% in Florida and 17% in South Carolina.While the U.S. has conducted more tests than any other nation, it ranks in the middle of the pack in testing per capita, behind Russia, Spain and Australia, according to Johns Hopkins University.“I am stunned that as a nation, six months into this pandemic, we still can’t figure out how to deliver testing to the American people when they need it,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute. “It is an abject failure of leadership and shows that the federal government has not prioritized testing in a way that will allow us to get through this pandemic.”Testing alone without adequate contact tracing and quarantine measures won’t control the spread of the scourge, according to health experts. But they say delays in testing can lead to more infections by leaving people in the dark as to whether they need to isolate themselves.Other developments:— While the number of confirmed cases in the US hit 3 million Wednesday by Johns Hopkins’ count, health officials have said that because of inadequate testing and the many mild infections that have gone unreported, the real number is about 10 times higher, or almost 10% of the US population.— A crowd of thousands attending President Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in late June, along with large groups of people who showed up to protest, “likely contributed” to a dramatic surge in new coronavirus cases in the area, Tulsa City-County Health Department Director Dr. Bruce Dart said Wednesday. Tulsa County reported 261 confirmed cases on Monday, a new record one-day high, and another 206 confirmed cases on Tuesday. A spokesman for the Trump campaign didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.— Most New York City students will return to school in the fall two or three days a week and learn online the rest of the time under a plan announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio. He said schools can’t accommodate all their students at any one time and maintain social distancing. The school system in New York is the biggest in the nation, with 1.1 million students. It has been closed since March.In New York City, the most lethal hot spot in the nation during the spring, testing was scarce early on but is now widely available. As many as 35,000 tests are conducted daily through a combination of private health organizations and city agencies, according to the city Health Department.“Widespread testing holds the key to reopening our city safely,” de Blasio said.The US Department of Health and Human Services this week said it will open free “surge testing” sites in three hard-hit cities: Jacksonville, Florida; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Edinburg, Texas. The sites will be able to conduct as many as 5,000 tests a day in each city, with results in three to five days, officials said.In Georgia, one of the states where cases are surging, officials are rushing to expand testing capacity as demand threatens to overwhelm six major sites around Atlanta, said DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond.“If you project this out over the next three weeks, we can’t handle it,” he said.In New Orleans, people were turned away from a free testing site for a third consecutive day after it reached its daily allotment of tests. Health care providers are running low on trays and chemicals needed to run machines used in the tests.Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego called the situation there “desperate” as residents have sat in sun-baked cars for up to 13 hours to get drive-thru testing. Robert Fenton, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said FEMA is doubling the testing supplies it plans to ship to Arizona.Patrick Friday, a United Methodist minister in Alabama, went to several hospitals and clinics in Birmingham this week to get checked after his school-age son tested positive. But he was told that unless he had a preexisting condition, he didn’t qualify.Finally, he ended up at a site offering rapid-result tests and his negative result came back quickly.“We are several months into this,” he said. “How can it be that we can’t go in and get a test?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-hot-mess-americans-face-testing-delays-as-covid-19-cases-surge/story-yuPdHGcCcRrCbF2D8rF1FL.html
09-07-2020||World||Japan rescuers battle to reach thousands trapped by floods||Japanese emergency services and troops scrambled Thursday to reach people cut off by catastrophic flooding and landslides that have killed dozens and caused widespread damage, with more torrential rain forecast.In the scenic tourist area of Gifu in central Japan, officials said landslides and floodwater had left just nearly 1,000 households stranded -- or around 2,300 people.But in the hardest-hit region of Kumamoto, attention was turning to clean-up operations after some of the heaviest rain for years.A Kumamoto official told AFP: “The number of people stranded is zero. We can now reach all the areas which had been isolated.”An AFP reporter in the area saw part of a road collapsed into a river, and scenes of devastation in flood-affected houses.In one home, an elderly man was struggling to clear up the debris and furniture littering the mud-caked floor, his traditional straw tatami mats in one room ruined.The rain front started in the southwest early Saturday and has since cut a swathe of destruction across Japan, dumping record amounts of rain and causing swollen rivers to burst their banks.Japan’s Meteorological Agency (JMA) said “heavy rain will likely continue at least until July 12, calling for “extreme vigilance” for possible landslides and flooding in low-lying areas.The JMA issued its second-highest evacuation order to around 350,000 people. Such orders are not compulsory, however, and most residents are choosing not to go to shelters, possibly due to coronavirus fears.The death toll has climbed gradually as more victims are discovered in isolated areas.Government spokesman Yoshihide Suga told reporters that 58 people were confirmed dead.He said authorities were investigating whether four other deaths were linked to the floods, adding that 17 people were unaccounted for.After five days blocked by floodwater and landslides, troops finally managed to rescue some 40 residents from Ashikita village in Kumamoto region.Kinuyo Nakamura, 68, burst into tears of relief as she finally made it to an evacuation centre.“Gosh, it was scary. My house, it’s such a mess, I cannot live there anymore,” she said as she came across someone she knew at the shelter.“We have experienced flooding disasters in the past many times. But this one doesn’t compare,” she told public broadcaster NHK.Nakamura choked up as she explained that one of her neighbours had fallen victim to the floods.“A truly, truly, fantastic person,” she said, covering her face to hide the tears. “That was the hardest thing.” ‘Hesitating to offer help’ In many areas, landslides reduced houses to rubble and floodwater rushed into homes in low-lying areas, destroying the contents and rendering them uninhabitable.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that around 130,000 rescue workers and troops were battling to save lives.Complicating the rescue efforts, the coronavirus epidemic has claimed nearly 1,000 lives in Japan from more than 20,000 cases.The need to maintain social distancing has reduced capacity at shelters and many have preferred to take refuge in their vehicles for fear of becoming infected.One emergency worker said the coronavirus might be dissuading people from volunteering to help with the rescue.The latest natural disaster is a bitter blow for businesses in the hard-hit regions, already heavily reliant on tourism that has dried up due to the coronavirus.Japan is in the middle of its annual rainy season and often sees damaging floods and landslides during this period that lasts several weeks.However, experts say climate change is intensifying the phenomenon because a warmer atmosphere holds more water to dump in the form of rain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-rescuers-battle-to-reach-thousands-trapped-by-floods/story-uOCmnYuod6ZqOi8rqTIhXL.html

Education minister of Pakistan Shafqat Mahmood at a news briefing said that administrations will have to follow strict “standard operating procedures” set by the government. According to the Ministry of National Health Services, Pakistan registered 3,359 cases and 61 deaths in the last 24 hours due to Covid-19. The total number of cases has now crossed 240,000 and the death toll stands at 4,983.In June, Pakistan was one of the worst-hit countries in South Asia. With a view to curb the spread of Covid-19 and revive the economy, the government decided to impose ‘smart lockdown’ in hotspots across the country. As per the smart lockdown, offices and businesses are allowed to operate five days a week,and medical stores can operate throughout. However, educational institutions, restaurants and movie theatres will remain closed and social, religious gatherings will not be permitted.

09-07-2020||World||Covid-19 cases rise in Australia; lockdown in worst-hit Victoria state||Amidst the rising number of coronavirus cases in Australia, authorities in Melbourne and some regional parts of the hardest-hit Victoria state on Thursday entered into its first day of the second lockdown, imposing restrictions for next six weeks. Victoria recorded another 165 new Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours including several hospital and aged care workers, on the first day of its second lockdown.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage Queensland, South Australia, New South Wales, Western Australia and Australian Capital Territory (ACT) remained closed temporarily along with Victoria to arrest the spread of the Covid-19. Urging residents not to become complacent, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that “about 25,000 tests are being done every day in Victoria, and particularly… in Melbourne. That is an industrial scale of testing, which is an essential part of dealing with the outbreak in Victoria”. Morrison will hold a Cabinet meeting on Friday to discuss the latest coronavirus surge in Victoria and look at the risk to other states. “I would say more broadly across the country that we must guard against complacency, that we must continue to follow those social distancing protocols all around Australia, even in states or territories where the number of cases is effectively zero,” the prime minister said. Please do not think that any of the states or territories are immune, he warned. ‘‘And if there were to be issues that presented in any of those states and territories, the best defence that we have, especially in the first instance, is that all citizens, all residents right across the country, are continuing to practice the appropriate social distancing and other measures. “We’ve seen the images in many parts of the country, where I think we are seeing some of that lapse. And it’s important, because we do not want to see the situation in Victoria repeated in any other part of the country,” he said. Morrison thanked the Melbourne residents for their patience during the ongoing health crisis. In a bid to contain the virus from spreading, the Victorian government has announced a regular temprature check for all the students who would return to school in the next term. The state government will distribute more than 14,000 thermometers to schools in greater Melbourne and Mitchell Shire and in schools that are near the lockdown zones. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said that the coronavirus restrictions in the state will not be tightened “at this stage” after 13 new Covid-19 cases were recorded in the last 24 hours. She said that the rate of community transmission was seen low. Only one new case was recorded in ACT after a man in his 20s contracted the virus. So far, Australia’s death toll from the Covid-19 stands at 106 with no new fatalities reported in the 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-rise-in-australia-lockdown-in-worst-hit-victoria-state/story-YOB1t20entuR2gJt6jOs4K.html
09-07-2020||World||Is that hand strap clean? Tokyo Metro sprays silver to fend off coronavirus||As global public transport operators look for ways to keep the coronavirus at bay on planes, trains and buses, one of Japan’s biggest rail firms is betting on the anti-microbial properties of silver to keep passengers safe on the world’s busiest subway.Tokyo’s labyrinthine rail network of about 900 stations and roughly 85 lines has seen passenger numbers approach pre-virus levels since the city’s de facto lockdown was lifted in late May.This raises the risk of transmission via high-contact points such as hand straps, hand rails and seats, just as the city’s number of new cases of COVID-19 infection is rising again. Tokyo Metro, the city’s main subway operator, has begun spraying its nearly 3,000 cars with a super-fine atomisation of a silver-based compound, taking advantage of silver’s anti-antimicrobial properties to repel the virus from surfaces.“Merely disinfecting the carriages only has a short-term effect, so we were looking for an anti-microbial application to reassure passengers that our trains are safe,” Masaru Sugiyama, Tokyo Metro’s section chief in charge of rolling stock, said at a demonstration on Thursday.After the end of daily operations, masked cleaners hauling motorised atomisers stride through carriages, spraying straps, poles, seats and windows with a mist of 10 micron droplets, roughly the size of a grain of pollen.Tokyo Metro said the anti-microbial compound has been shown to be effective against viruses including influenza and E-coli, though has not yet been proven to repel the novel coronavirus.Other operators are also looking at ways to help Tokyo’s passengers select less crowded trains to increase chances of social distancing on a network serving 40 million daily trips.East Japan Railway Co, the country’s biggest rail network operator, last month updated its mobile app to offer real-time updates on capacity by carriage, along with crowd levels at stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-that-hand-strap-clean-tokyo-metro-sprays-silver-to-fend-off-coronavirus/story-SYqMtzzwVOmdF7inpyma9M.html
09-07-2020||World||Australia suspends Hong Kong extradition deal in swipe at China||Australia is suspending its extradition agreement with Hong Kong and will give skilled migrants from the city five-year visas with a pathway to permanent residence, after China imposed sweeping national security legislation on the financial hub.“Our decision to suspend the extradition agreement with Hong Kong represents an acknowledgment of the fundamental change of circumstances in relation to Hong Kong because of the new security law,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison said at a briefing in Canberra on Thursday.Morrison said Australia had formally notified Hong Kong and advised Chinese authorities. His announcement -- which swiftly earned a strong rebuke from Beijing’s embassy in Canberra -- came after Canada suspended its extradition agreement with the former British colony last week, making it the first country to break law enforcement links with the city since China enacted the legislation.Other nations with extradition links with Hong Kong include the Southeast Asian countries of Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia, which have all clashed with China in recent years over its territorial claims in the South China Sea. Beyond the region, Hong Kong has extradition treaties with nations including the U.S., India, Germany and New Zealand. The latter on Thursday announced it would review all its policy settings with Hong Kong due to the security law.Though China remains Australia’s largest trading partner, Morrison’s moves have fueled tensions between the two countries. Australia said earlier Thursday that its citizens in Hong Kong were at an increased risk of detention, saying the security law could be interpreted broadly.China said Thursday that Morrison’s moves “severely violated” international law and it reserved the right to take countermeasures.“Any attempt to exert pressure on China will never succeed,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a daily news briefing in Beijing. “China urges the Australian side to immediately change course and stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form so as to avoid further damage to China-Australia ties.”In another move that could aggravate Beijing, Morrison said his government will be actively seeking to lure Hong Kong-based businesses to relocate to Australia.“There’ll be citizens of Hong Kong who may be looking to move elsewhere, to start a new life somewhere else, to take their skills, their businesses, and things that they’ve been running under the previous set of rules and arrangements in Hong Kong and seek that opportunity elsewhere,” Morrison said. “Australia has always been a very welcoming country to such people.”Fuelling TensionsRelations between the two nations have become increasingly fraught since 2018, when Morrison’s government banned Chinese technology giant Huawei Technologies Co. from building its 5G network on national security grounds. That year, it also said Beijing’s “meddling” was a catalyst for legislation designed to halt foreign interference in its governments, media and education sector.Since April -- when Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne called for independent investigators be allowed into the mainland city of Wuhan to probe Covid-19’s origins -- China has imposed crippling tariffs on Australia’s barley industry, halted beef imports from four meat plants and urged its tourists and students to avoid going to Australia citing a risk of racist attacks.“We advise the Australian side to look at the national security legislation in Hong Kong in a correct and objective light, stop interfering in China’s internal affairs with Hong Kong as a pretext, and refrain from going further down the wrong path,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said July 2 in response to a question on the possibility of Australia offering Hong Kong citizens a safe haven.Beijing has also been irked by Payne’s statements against Hong Kong’s new national security law, which she’s labeled “deeply” concerning, following criticism from other foreign governments including the U.S. and UKThe British Passport Stoking Controversy in Hong Kong: QuickTakeUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week refused to back down after China warned of “consequences” if it pressed ahead with an offer of home for millions of Hong Kong residents. Johnson called the new law a “clear and serious breach” of the 1984 handover treaty between London and Beijing, which preceded the British colony being returned to China’s hands in 1997.China hit back, questioning the UK’s right under the “joint declaration” treaty to make the offer to people in Hong Kong. “China strongly condemns that and reserves the right to make further reactions,” Zhao said. “All the consequences shall be borne by the UK side.”The law “undermines the ‘one country, two systems’ framework and Hong Kong’s own Basic Law, and the high degree of autonomy guaranteed in the Sino-British Joint Declaration,” Morrison said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-suspends-hong-kong-extradition-deal-in-swipe-at-china/story-4VZzW3PMQ7FxxGAfu91sNN.html
09-07-2020||World||Srebrenica killings: 25 years on victims solve world’s ‘biggest forensic puzzle’||A quarter of a century after they were killed in Europe’s worst massacre since World War II, eight Bosnian men and boys will be laid to rest Saturday in a cemetery just outside of Srebrenica — their marble gravestones joining thousands more, each with the same month and year of death.Over 8,000 Bosnian Muslims perished in 10 days of slaughter after the town was overrun by Bosnian Serb forces in the closing months of the country’s 1992-95 fratricidal war. Their executioners tried to ensure they would never get the sort of memorial Srebrenica holds every year. Their bodies were plowed into hastily made mass graves and then later dug up with bulldozers and scattered among other burial sites to hide the evidence of the crime.But, since 1996, Bosnian and international scientists have slowly unlocked what was once described as the “biggest forensic puzzle anywhere in the world,” unearthing the bones from those gruesome death pits and connecting them with the names of the people they belonged to.When the remains are identified, they are returned to their relatives and reburied in the Potocari memorial cemetery. And each year on July 11, the anniversary of the day the killing began in 1995, relatives gather for a funeral of the recently identified. Most of the dead were men and boys, so most of the mourners are women — mothers and sisters, daughters and wives.Massacre survivor Fazila Efendic will attend the collective funeral this year to witness her sisters in grief bury a handful of bones, as she once did.Having a grave to visit will bring them some relief, Efendic says. Her husband, Hamed, and her only son, Fejzo, were killed in the massacre.For years, every time a new mass grave was found, she rushed to the site hoping to see something she would recognize as having belonged to her loved ones.“There are no words to describe the sorrow you feel when you are looking for (your loved ones) bone by bone,” Efendic said. “I visited every newfound mass grave; I’ve seen the inside of every one of them.”All of Hamed’s remains were found in two mass graves, one unearthed in 1998 and the other in 2000. Fejzo — or rather two of his leg bones — was found in another one several years later. Efendic buried her husband at Potocari after his remains were found but waited years before finally deciding to do the same with Fejzo’s partial remains.“I wanted him to be next to his father and to be able to come and pray over their graves,” she said.Typically, thousands of visitors from various countries attend the July 11 service, but this year — because of the coronavirus pandemic — only a relatively small number of survivors will be allowed at the cemetery.Instead, many speakers will attend “virtually,” explained Emir Suljagic, the director of the Srebrenica Memorial Center at Potocari.That the massacre survivors are able to visit their dead at all is a testament to the forensic scientists at the International Commission on Missing Persons.Set up in 1996 at the urging of then-U.S. President Bill Clinton, the commission designed a DNA-based system to find and identify the remains of some 40,000 people — the vast majority of them from Bosnia — who had been reported as missing as a result of the 1990s conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.In 2014, the commission became a permanent global body, expanded its mission to other conflicts and natural disasters, and moved its headquarters to The Hague. But not before helping to identify more than 70% of all the missing victims of the 1990s Balkan wars, including close to 7,000 of those killed in Srebrenica.Damir Marjanovic, an early member of the then Bosnia-based commission, said the team’s work has greatly increased scientists’ ability to pull DNA profiles from skeletal remains.“For us, finding and identifying the missing was a mission,” said Marjanovic, who today is a professor of genetics and anthropology at the International Burch University in Sarajevo.The Srebrenica massacre is the only episode of the Bosnian war to be defined as a genocide, including by two U.N. courts, in part thanks to the commission’s findings, including DNA records, that have been admitted as evidence at trials.While many Bosnian Serbs continue to deny the extent of the crime, the still-expanding sea of white marble at Potocari makes the truth plain.“This is Srebrenica,” said Efendic, looking out at the gravestones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/srebrenica-killings-25-years-on-victims-solve-world-s-biggest-forensic-puzzle/story-gRPCV7etcUIODCctAbeUOP.html
09-07-2020||World||‘Unprecedented shock’: Covid-19 pandemic could cause Canada’s federal deficit to increase tenfold||Canada’s projected deficit for the year has multiplied 10 times and net debt could reach $ 1.2 trillion due to the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. These figures were among those detailed by Canadian finance minister Bill Morneau while presenting a fiscal update in the wake of what he described as, “an unprecedented shock to our system.”Before the coronavirus crisis hit and forced the closure of much of the economy, Canada was expected to record $ 34.4 billion for 2020-21 and this number has now been revised to a whopping $343.2 billion. As the deficit balloons, so does the net federal debt, crossing a trillion dollars for the first time in the country’s history.Even the country’s GDP is hitting historic highs, projected to decline by 6.8 per cent this year, placing the country in a situation not witnessed since the Great Depression.Also read: Canada’s Trudeau has exposed China’s attempt at hostage diplomacyThe document described these circumstances as “truly the challenge of our lifetime” but sounded a cautiously optimistic note, looking ahead to a return to 5.5 per cent growth next year.There are other systemic challenges: debt-to-GDP ratio is nearly at 50 per cent, a near 20 per cent spike from what was projected earlier.The update also said, “the projected contraction in federal budgetary revenues is unprecedented since the Great Depression with an expected decline in 2020-21 more than twice as big as in 2009-10 following the global financial crisis.”The burgeoning deficit can be attributed to emergency support measures announced by the government amounting to $212 billion with a loss of $81.3 billion to the treasury due to the slowdown caused by coronavirus-induced restrictive measures across the nation. Morneau said, “Some will criticize us on the cost of action. But our government knew that the cost of inaction would’ve been far greater.”The government was under pressure to present a full budget for the year but Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau had argued that was not possible given that the impact of Covid-19 could not be predicted. Instead, he settled on the compromise offering of this fiscal snapshot which was presented by Morneau in the House of Commons.And clarity regarding the future could be a while away, as the update stated, “Due to the unprecedented degree of uncertainty clouding the economic outlook, providing a fiscal forecast beyond the current fiscal year with an appropriate degree of confidence is not possible at this time, and would potentially be misleading.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unprecedented-shock-covid-19-pandemic-could-cause-canada-s-federal-deficit-to-increase-tenfold/story-7szma75MV9ni9Sz0AkYbuN.html
09-07-2020||World||Brazilian Prez Bolsonaro now the ‘poster boy’ for dubious Covid treatment||After months of touting an unproven anti-malaria drug as a treatment for the new coronavirus, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is turning himself into a test case live before millions of people as he swallows hydroxychloroquine pills on social media and encourages others to do the same.Bolsonaro said this week that he tested positive for the virus but already felt better thanks to hydroxychloroquine. Hours later he shared a video of himself gulping down what he said was his third dose.“I trust hydroxychloroquine,” he said, smiling. “And you?”On Wednesday, he was again extolling the drug’s benefits on Facebook, and claimed that his political opponents were rooting against it.A string of studies in Britain and the United States, as well as by the World Health Organization, have found chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine ineffective against Covid-19 and sometimes deadly because of their adverse side effects on the heart. Several studies were cancelled early because of adverse effects.US President Donald Trump has promoted hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Covid-19 but chloroquine — a more toxic version of the drug, produced in Brazil — has been even more enthusiastically promoted by Bolsonaro, who contends the virus is largely unavoidable and, what is more, not a serious medical problem.“He has become the poster boy for curing COVID with hydroxychloroquine,” said Paulo Calmon, a political science professor at the University of Brasilia. “Chloroquine composes part of the denialist’s political strategy, with the objective of convincing voters that the pandemic’s effects can be easily controlled.”Also read: Sick with Covid, Brazil’s Bolsonaro defends his coronavirus approachTrump first mentioned hydroxychloroquine on March 19 during a pandemic briefing. Two days later, and a month after Brazil’s first confirmed case, Bolsonaro took one of his only big actions to fight the coronavirus. He announced he was directing the Brazilian army to ramp up output of chloroquine.The army churned out more than 2 million pills — 18 times the country’s normal annual production — even as Brazil’s intensive care medicine association recommended it not be prescribed and doctors mostly complied.The White House on May 31 said it had donated 2 million hydroxychloroquine pills to Brazil. Two weeks later the US Food & Drug Administration revoked authorization for its emergency use, citing adverse side effects and saying it is unlikely to be effective.Brazil’s audit court on June 18 requested an investigation into alleged overbilling from local production of chloroquine, which it called unreasonable given the drug’s ineffectiveness and cited the FDA decision. Meantime, stocks of sedatives and other medications used in intensive care ran out in three states, according to a late-June report from Brazil’s council of state health secretariats.A former defence minister, Aldo Rebelo, told The Associated Press that he is concerned the army will be wrongly blamed for its involvement in production of a drug that most experts call ineffective against the coronavirus.“All they did was to follow a legal order and produce the pills,” said Rebelo. “The problem is the health ministry and the decision that the president made.”Brazil’s interim health minister, an army general with no health experience before April, endorsed chloroquine as a Covid-19 treatment days after assuming the post in May. His predecessor, a doctor and health consultant, quit rather than do so.As Brazil’s death toll continued to climb — nearing 68,000 on Wednesday, the second-most in the world — the health ministry distributed millions of chloroquine pills across Brazil’s vast territory. They have reached small cities with little or no health infrastructure to handle the pandemic and even a far-flung Indigenous territory.“They’re trying to use the Indigenous people as guinea pigs to test chloroquine, use the Indigenous to advertise for chloroquine like Bolsonaro has done on his live broadcasts, like a poster boy for chloroquine,” Kretã Kaingang, an executive coordinator of the Indigenous organization APIB, said by phone from Brazil’s capital, Brasilia.In Brazil’s largest city, Sao Paulo, three doctors treating Covid-19 in different hospitals told AP that patients routinely requested chloroquine as the pandemic spread, often citing Bolsonaro. In recent weeks, inquiries about the drug were less frequent after scientific doubts arose about its effectiveness, two physicians said.All say they worry Bolsonaro’s cheerleading will spur a new wave of desperate patients and relatives clamoring for chloroquine.“I tell them that I don’t prescribe it because there’s no study proving it improves patients, that there are important risks with the indiscriminate use of this drug,” said Dr. Natalia Magacho, an attending physician at the Hospital das Clinicas. “Some even get angry at first. But all prescriptions are the doctor’s responsibility and, as the risk outweighs the benefit, I don’t prescribe it.”Most doctors oppose any protocols for the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, but some physicians continue to believe and have pressured local authorities to permit its use, said João Gabbardo, the former No. 2 official at Brazil’s health ministry.“This issue has been framed in a very polarizing, politicized manner,” said Gabbardo, who is now executive coordinator of Sao Paulo’s Covid-19 contingency center. “We are moving away from the discussion of science, of scientific evidence, toward a discussion of political positions.”Bolsonaro’s supporters and aides have amplified his message. Eduardo Bolsonaro, the president’s son and a federal lawmaker, said his father will beat the disease because he is taking the anti-malarial drug.“Treatment with chloroquine is rather effective at the start of the illness (and should be available for any Brazilian who needs it),” the younger Bolsonaro wrote on Twitter, without distinguishing between the two types of the drug.Margareth Dalcolmo, a clinical researcher and prominent respiratory medicine professor at the state-funded Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, said she has no objection to Bolsonaro and his doctor agreeing on hydroxychloroquine treatment. The problem, she said, is broadcasting that information to an impressionable public that, if he recovers, will believe a potentially dangerous drug was responsible.Dalcolmo treats patients and contracted Covid-19 herself. Before she bounced back, some friends asked if she would authorize administration of either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine were she unable to grant consent.“Over my dead body, dear,” she said. “I said if I’m in a coma, intubated, none of you are authorized to put me on chloroquine. I would never authorize its use on me. And I haven’t used it on my dozens of patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazilian-prez-bolsonaro-now-the-poster-boy-for-dubious-covid-treatment/story-YT4nWPcvmuwFXsuhjiD8HM.html
09-07-2020||World||Covid: China defends WHO, lashes out at United States’ withdrawal decision||China defended the World Health Organization and lashed out at the US decision to withdraw from the UN body, adding to a litany of disputes between the world’s largest economies and increasing geopolitical rivals.Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the move was “another demonstration of the US pursuing unilateralism, withdrawing from groups and breaking contracts.”WHO is “the most authoritative and professional international institution in the field of global public health security,” Zhao said at a briefing Wednesday, adding that the US departure would particularly hurt developing countries in need of international support.WHO plans to send a team to China to investigate the source of the virus, which was first detected in the central city of Wuhan last year. China has said it remains unclear where the virus originated and has rejected an independent probe, but reiterated this week that it is working closely with WHO and will “continue to support scientists from all countries to carry out global scientific research on the source and spread of viruses.”President Donald Trump has harshly criticized WHO over its response to the coronavirus pandemic and accused it of bowing to Chinese influence. Trump said in a White House announcement that Chinese officials “ignored” their reporting obligations to WHO and pressured the organization to mislead the public about an outbreak that has now killed more than 130,000 Americans.In comments Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Beijing’s response to the virus outbreak showed the ruling Communist Party has an “enormous credibility problem” and that its actions fitted a pattern of behavior that threatens freedom, democracy and the rule of law.“I am convinced more than ever that the free peoples of the world will come to understand the threat that’s presented not only internally inside of China, but importantly, that the impact that General Secretary Xi has on the world is not good for free peoples and democracy-loving peoples,” Pompeo told reporters.The Trump administration formally notified the UN on Monday of its withdrawal from WHO, although the pullout won’t take effect until July 6, 2021. That means it could be reversed by a new administration or if circumstances change.Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said he would reverse the decision on his first day in office if elected.Health officials and critics of Trump’s administration say the withdrawal would cost the US influence in the global arena while undermining an important institution that is leading vaccine development efforts and drug trials to address the coronavirus.The US is WHO’s largest donor and provides it with more than $450 million per year, but owes about $200 million in current and past dues. Those financial obligations must be met before a US withdrawal can be finalized.Apart from the WHO, China and the US have tangled over human rights, China’s crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong and Xinjiang and its assertions of sovereignty over strategic waters and islands in the South China Sea.

09-07-2020||World||‘Strike for Black Lives’ to highlight racism||A national coalition of labour unions, along with racial and social justice organizations, will stage a mass walkout from work this month, as part of an ongoing reckoning on systemic racism and police brutality in the US.Dubbed the “Strike for Black Lives,” tens of thousands of fast food, ride-share, nursing home and airport workers in more than 25 cities are expected to walk off the job July 20 for about eight minutes — the amount of time prosecutors say a white Minneapolis police officer held his knee on the neck of George Floyd in May — in remembrance of Black men and women who died recently at the hands of police.The national strike will also include a handful of worker-led marches through participating cities, organizers said Wednesday.According to details shared exclusively with The Associated Press, organizers are demanding sweeping action by corporations and government to confront systemic racism in an economy that chokes off economic mobility and career opportunities for many Black and Hispanic workers, who make up a disproportionate number of those earning less than a living wage.They also stress the need for guaranteed sick pay, affordable health care coverage and better safety measures for low-wage workers who never had the option of working from home during the coronavirus pandemic.“We have to link these fights in a new and deeper way than ever before,” said Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, which represents over 2 million workers in the US and Canada.“Our members have been on a journey … to understanding why we cannot win economic justice without racial justice. This strike for Black lives is a way to take our members’ understanding about that into the streets,” Henry told the AP.Among the strikers’ specific demands are that corporations and government declare unequivocally that “Black lives matter.” Elected officials at every level must use executive and legislative power to pass laws that guarantee people of all races can thrive, according to a list of demands. Employers must also raise wages and allow workers to unionize to negotiate better health care, sick leave and child care support.The service workers union has partnered with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the American Federation of Teachers, United Farm Workers and the Fight for $15 and a Union, which was launched in 2012 by American fast food workers to push for a higher minimum wage.Social and racial justice groups taking part include March On, the Center for Popular Democracy, the National Domestic Workers Alliance and the Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of over 150 organizations that make up the Black Lives Matter movement.Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson, a strike organizer with the Movement for Black Lives, said corporate giants that have come out in support of the BLM movement amid nationwide protests over police brutality have also profited from racial injustice and inequity.“They claim to support Black lives, but their business model functions by exploiting Black labor — passing off pennies as ‘living wages’ and pretending to be shocked when Covid-19 sickens those Black people who make up their essential workers,” said Henderson, co-executive director of Tennessee-based Highlander Research and Education Center.“Corporate power is a threat to racial justice, and the only way to usher in a new economy is by tackling those forces that aren’t fully committed to dismantling racism,” she said in a statement Trece Andrews, a Black nursing home worker for a Ciena Healthcare-managed retirement home in the Detroit area, said she feels dejected after years of being passed over for promotions.The 49-year-old believes racial discrimination plays a part in her career stagnation.“I’ve got 20 years in the game and I’m only at $15.81 (per hour),” she said in a phone interview.As the single mother of a 13-year-old daughter and caregiver to her father, a cancer survivor, Andrews said inadequate personal protective gear makes her afraid of bringing the coronavirus home from her job.“We’ve got the coronavirus going on, plus we’ve got this thing with racism going on,” Andrews said.“They’re tied together, like some type of segregation, like we didn’t have our ancestors and Martin Luther King fighting against these types of things. It’s still alive out here, and it’s time for somebody to be held accountable. It’s time to take action.” The strike continues a decades-old labor rights movement tradition. Most notably, organizers have drawn inspiration from the Memphis sanitation workers’ strike over low wages, benefits disparity between Black and white employees, and inhumane working conditions that contributed to the deaths of two Black workers in 1968.At the end of that two-month strike, some 1,300 mostly Black sanitation workers bargained collectively for better wages.“Strike for Black Lives” organizers say they want to disrupt a multi-generational cycle of poverty perpetuated by anti-union and other policies that make it difficult to bargain collectively for better wages and working conditions.Systemic poverty affects 140 million people in the U.S, with 62 million people working for less than a living wage, according to the Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival, a strike partnering organization.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/strike-for-black-lives-to-highlight-racism/story-20j21rHOTOiXBjV0dJQKhM.html
09-07-2020||World||Vindman retiring from Army, lawyer blames Trump of bullying, intimidation||Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a national security aide who played a central role in President Donald Trump’s impeachment case, announced his retirement from the Army on Wednesday in a scathing statement that accused the president of running a “campaign of bullying, intimidation, and retaliation.” The statement from attorney David Pressman said Vindman, 45, was leaving the Army after more than 21 years after it had been made clear “that his future within the institution he has dutifully served will forever be limited.” “Through a campaign of bullying, intimidation, and retaliation, the President of the United States attempted to force LTC Vindman to choose: Between adhering to the law or pleasing a President. Between honoring his oath or protecting his career. Between protecting his promotion or the promotion of his fellow soldiers,” read the statement, first obtained by CNN. Vindman’s name was on a promotion list sent to Defense Secretary Mark Esper earlier this year, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the matter. But that list was delayed for weeks because the White House asked for an investigation of Vindman, one of the officials said. The Pentagon did a review and found that any suggestion of misconduct was unfounded. One official said the list was resent to Esper about a month ago, but again was delayed. A senior defense official said the list was held up by a routine personnel review, not related to Vindman. Esper received the final promotion list Monday and approved it, with Vindman’s name included, and it was expected to be sent to the White House in the next day or two, the defense official said. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an internal personnel matter. It’s not clear whether Esper already knew of Vindman’s plan to retire before he signed the list, or whether the White House would have approved the promotion list. The White House and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Pressman said Vindman “did what the law compelled him to do; and for that he was bullied by the President and his proxies.” “LTC Vindman’s patriotism,” he said, “has cost him his career. Today our country loses a devoted soldier, but it is incumbent upon all of us to ensure it does not lose the values he represents.” Trump in February ousted Vindman from his job on the National Security Council, where he served as an expert on Ukraine, just two days after the president’s acquittal by the Senate. Vindman’s lawyer said then that his client had been told to leave in retaliation for “telling the truth.” Vindman’s twin brother, Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, was also asked to leave his job as a White House lawyer. Both men were reassigned to the Army. Vindman had testified that he didn’t think it was “proper” for Trump to “demand that a foreign government investigate” former Vice President Joe Biden and his son’s work for the energy company Burisma in Ukraine. And he told impeachment investigators that he twice raised concerns over the administration’s push to have Ukraine investigate the Bidens. In the aftermath, senior Pentagon leaders insisted that Vindman would not see any retaliation as a result of the testimony. Talking to reporters in November, Esper said the department has protections for whistleblowers. Vindman ”shouldn’t have any fear of retaliation. That’s DOD’s position,” Esper said, adding that he flatly rejected suggestions that the soldier’s career was over. He said he had spoken with Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy about the matter. McCarthy said in February that Vindman was not under investigation, and that he was serving in an Army headquarters job and would go on to senior service college in the summer. In gripping testimony, Vindman also spoke of his family’s story and his father bringing them to the USfrom the Soviet Union when he was a young child. “Dad, my sitting here today in the U.S. Capitol, talking to our elected officials, is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to United States of America in search of a better life for our family,” he testified. “Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement Wednesday, “History will remember Lieutenant Colonel Vindman as an American patriot.” She said his firing from the White House “was a clear and brazen act of retaliation that showcases the President’s fear of the truth, which continues to this day.” Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the Intelligence Committee chairman who led the impeachment probe, penned a letter to Vindman saying, “I hope that you are able to reflect on these events, unprecedented as they are, and find solace in knowing that you did the right thing.” Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill, blamed Esper for his “failure to protect a decorated combat veteran against a vindictive Commander in Chief.” Duckworth, a a former Army helicopter pilot who lost both legs during a 2004 attack in Iraq, said last week that she was blocking Senate confirmation of 1,123 senior military promotions until Esper confirmed whether or not he was approving Vindman’s promotion. “Secretary Esper’s failure to protect his troops sets a new, dark precedent that any Commander in Chief can interfere with routine merit-based military promotions to carry out personal vendettas and retaliation against military officers who follow duly-authorized subpoenas while upholding their oath of office and core principles of service,” Duckworth said in a statement Wednesday. Vindman, who served in Iraq and later was assigned to the National Security Council as the director for European affairs, appeared at the congressional hearing wearing his uniform full of medals, including the Purple Heart he earned for wounds suffered in a roadside bomb attack. When a soldier requests retirement, it must be approved by the Army’s Human Resources Command, and normally it can take months to process before the person actually leaves the military. It was also not clear Wednesday if Vindman’s brother was on the promotion list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vindman-retiring-from-army-lawyer-blames-trump-of-bullying-intimidation/story-UlE4OJD7ypNlTU4BepxhRN.html
09-07-2020||World||Jair Bolsonaro plans to appease investors with ban on Amazon fires||Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro plans to put a four-month ban on fires in the Amazon and Pantanal regions in response to criticism from international investors and Brazilian companies about a surge in deforestation.The decree is being drafted by the Environment Ministry, with a start date yet to be decided. Last year, the government banned burning for 60 days before adding another 60 days. This year, it’s going straight to 120 days to prevent another jump in uncontrolled fires in the dry season.The moratorium is one of the measures the administration will use to try to convince international investors that it’s taking a stand against deforestation. The stricter rules for the Amazon and Pantanal regions won’t apply in the Cerrado biome, a tropical savanna increasingly used for farming.A video conference with businessmen and senior executives is scheduled for Thursday. In attendance will be Vice President Hamilton Mourao, who chairs the Council of the Amazon, Central Bank President Roberto Campos Neto as well as ministers for the environment, agriculture and foreign affairs, said two people with knowledge of the event.The far-right government has faced mounting pressure from investors and entrepreneurs to do more to protect the environment amid surging deforestation in the Amazon.On Tuesday, a group of companies including pulp maker Suzano SA, meatpacker Marfrig Global Foods SA and agribusiness giant Cargill Inc. sent a letter to authorities stating that the negative perceptions are potentially damaging to both reputation and business prospects.Amazon deforestation has surged in the past two years under the government of Bolsonaro, who defends opening up the world’s largest rainforest to agriculture and mining.In early June, Amazon Environmental Research Institute, known as Ipam, warned that an area 11 times the size of New York City could be incinerated in the dry season. In June, the first month of the dry season, fires in this biome rose to a 13-year high, National Institute for Space Research data show. In Pantanal, the world’s largest wetland area, the number of fires this year through June is more than the double all of those recorded last year.According to Ipam, smoke from fires may also inhibit Brazil’s efforts to contain Covid-19 infections.In a closed-door meeting in May, Environment Minister Ricardo Salles urged Bolsonaro to take advantage of global leaders’ Covid-19 blinders to simplify regulations, according to a video of the gathering released by the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jair-bolsonaro-plans-to-appease-investors-with-ban-on-amazon-fires/story-mAPnh5vF5GH4mOevQWPPsM.html
09-07-2020||World||Canada’s Trudeau has exposed China’s attempt at hostage diplomacy||The bitter recriminations have further plunged the ongoing acrimonious relations between Canada and China to new low. Limiting ties with China, Canada suspended the extradition treaty with Hong Kong. The Canadian decision was prompted by the new security law Beijing imposed on Hong Kong in violation of its international treaty.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday said “effective immediately, Canada will not permit the export of sensitive military items to Hong Kong”. Canada would also assume that all sensitive goods exported to Hong Kong are meant for mainland China, he added further. The Canadian foreign minister termed the new law “a significant step back” for liberty.The development infuriated China that rebuked Canada for its criticism of the Hong Kong security law while Hong Kong officials expressed disappointment over Canada’s suspension of the extradition treaty.Ties between Ottawa and Beijing have been strenuous since 2018 when Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, the Chief Financial Officer of Huawei, under the US warrant. After Meng was detained, China arrested Canadian citizens Michael Kovri, a former diplomat, and Michael Spavor, a businessman, on charges of espionage.It has been more than 18 months since the Chinese government arbitrarily apprehended two Canadian citizens. It hasn’t even allowed them consular access. Their arrests were widely interpreted as a retaliation for Canada detaining the top Huawei executive and the daughter of the company’s founder on an extradition request from the United States. The US wants to try Meng for fraud relating to her alleged violating sanctions imposed on Iran.The Chinese reprisal has caused much anguish and frustration in Canada. Interestingly, the two Canadians were chosen randomly to be pawns in a wider game that China has been playing to reshape the world order to one where its desires and sensitivities determine decision-making in other countries. China wants the rest of the world to know that bad things would happen to any country that doesn’t toe its line - would invite arm-twisting in the form of arbitrarily jailing foreigners, straining of trading ties and sending fewer Chinese students. China is employing the same tactics against Australia because it had demanded an investigation of Chinese mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak.Pressure was also brought upon the Canadian government to settle the issue with China. But Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stayed firm, rejecting suggestions that his government should arrange for the release of the Huawei executive in the hope of securing the release of two Canadians currently jailed in China.“If the Chinese government concludes that detaining (citizens) is an effective way to gain leverage over Canadians and the Canadian government, to randomly arrest Canadians, then no Canadian will be safe,” Trudeau said. Any regime anywhere would be likely to start arresting “random Canadians” to press diplomatic goals, he said. “To demonstrate to China that they can just arrest Canadians and they can get what they want out of Canada - even for us going against the independence of our judicial system - would be absolutely unacceptable,” Trudeau added.PM Trudeau’s forceful rejection of the prisoner swap plan exposes the Chinese Communist Party’s style of “hostage diplomacy”. For China, the Huawei executive is a highly-valued individual due to her position as a senior executive in a company with strong links to the party, securing her release is not anaim in itself. It merely forms part of Beijing’s broader international objectives. The Trudeau government feels that submitting itself to the release of Meng would instead likely increase China’s antagonism towards Canada. It would also make Canadians in China less safe, and conditions less stable for Canadian businesses that export to China. With one norm successfully broken, Beijing would actively target Canada for the next.Prime Minister Trudeau correctly insisted that it would not legitimise China’s hostage-taking and place more Canadians at risk. The Canadian government recognises the importance of preventing China’s belligerent behaviour from becoming normalised. By doing so, Canada has completely exposed the Chinese government’s game plan that hostage-taking is an acceptable diplomatic tool.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-trudeau-has-exposed-china-s-attempt-at-hostage-diplomacy/story-4ePAzASrk2xZrYP6MhoUNL.html
09-07-2020||World||United Nations rejects Russia’s bid to limit humanitarian aid to Syria||The UN Security Council on Wednesday overwhelmingly rejected a Russian resolution that would have cut back the delivery of humanitarian aid to Syria’s mainly rebel-held northwest to just one crossing point from Turkey. Western countries that voted against the resolution have insisted on keeping the two current crossings from Turkey, with strong backing from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and humanitarian groups. UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock has called the two crossings from Turkey “a lifeline for millions of civilians whom the UN cannot reach by other means.” The Russian resolution needed a minimum of nine “yes” votes in the 15-member council for approval, but Moscow got support from only three other countries — China, Vietnam and South Africa. Its failure to get the nine votes meant the US, UK and France didn’t need to consider using their veto. Those three permanent council members voted against the resolution along with Germany, Belgium, Estonia and the Dominican Republic. Four countries abstained — Tunisia, Niger, Indonesia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Russia, Syria’s closest ally, circulated the draft resolution after it joined China on Tuesday in vetoing a draft resolution co-sponsored by Germany and Belgium to maintain aid deliveries through two border crossing points from Turkey for a year. It received 13 “yes” votes. The current Security Council mandate for UN cross-border aid deliveries expires Friday, and Germany and Belgium are expected to circulate a new proposal, likely to authorize the two current crossings from Turkey for six months. In a joint statement after the vote, Germany and Belgium said that “millions of people are counting on the Security Council to allow for as much humanitarian access as possible ... (and) we will keep on working to this end.” Whether the differences between the five veto-wielding council members can be resolved in the next 48 hours remained to be seen. Russia has argued that aid should be delivered from within Syria across conflict lines. But the UN and humanitarian groups say aid for 2.8 million needy people in the northwest can’t get in that way. US Ambassador Kelly Craft accused Russia and China of “breathtaking callousness and dishonesty” and distorting the realities on the ground. Their actions in both resolutions underscore “a harrowing truth — that Russia and China have decided that millions of Syrian lives are an insignificant cost of their partnership with the murderous Assad regime,” she said in a statement. Moutaz Adham, the Syria director for the humanitarian group Oxfam, called the council’s failure to reach agreement “a devastating blow to the millions of Syrian families who rely on this aid for clean water, food, health care and shelter.” “Cross-border aid is needed now more than ever, as Syrians face the threat of Covid-19,” he said. “All available avenues for delivering aid will be critical in helping the more than 11 million people in need of assistance across Syria.” In January, Russia scored a victory for Syria, using its veto threat to force the Security Council to adopt a resolution reducing the number of crossing points for aid deliveries from four to just two, from Turkey to the northwest. It also cut in half the yearlong mandate that had been in place since cross-border deliveries began in 2014 to six months, as Russia insisted. The defeated German-Belgian resolution had dropped a call for the re-opening of an Iraqi crossing to the northeast to deliver medical supplies for the Covid-19 pandemic. In May, Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said: “Do not waste your time on efforts to reopen the closed cross-border points.” The German-Belgian resolution would have extended the mandate for the two border crossings from Turkey to the northwest — Bab al-Salam and Bab al-Hawa — for a year. The Russian-drafted resolution would only authorize cross-border deliveries through the Bab al-Hawa crossing for six months. Germany’s UN ambassador, Christoph Heusgen, said that while the Bab Al-Hawa crossing is used to deliver aid to Idlib province, the Bab al-Salam crossing reaches the region north of Aleppo, where an additional 300,000 Syrians displaced by the last offensive are now sheltering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-nations-rejects-russia-s-bid-to-limit-humanitarian-aid-to-syria/story-SG1Mw5IlcXm3VyNDgi0ZmO.html
09-07-2020||World||‘Investigate acts of genocide in China’: Uyghurs urge UN in new report||The Uyghur Turks and other Muslim communities in China have asked the United Nations and other international organisations to put pressure on China and investigate the acts of genocide perpetrated against the Uyghurs.Campaign for Uyghurs, which works for the community and keeps highlighting their status in China, has released a report titled ‘Genocide in East Turkistan’ in which it has listed instances where the Chinese government has persecuted Uyghurs.The report said that despite the Covid-19 pandemic, the Chinese government continues its oppression and persecution of Uyghur Turks and other Muslim communities for its own political and economic interests.“The Chinese government sent 1.1 million Han Chinese cadres to East Turkistan to control the daily life of Uyghurs. Their job is to stay in Uyghur homes, share the same bed with them if necessary and to control all aspects of their daily lives,” the report said.“With the ‘Double Relative Program’ initiated by the Beijing government, Han Chinese cadres make visits at least once every two months and stay for about a week. During the stay, while constantly spreading Chinese Communist Party propaganda, they also spy on them. During these visits, they encourage drinking of alcohol and eat pork, all of which are forbidden in Islam. If a Uyghur requests ‘halal meat’ from the market and if they do not drink, they are declared a suspect and sent to the camps,” it further added.In order to disrupt the Uyghur family structure, the Beijing administration offers the Han Chinese money, jobs and free homes for these arranged marriages, Campaign for Uyghurs claimed.The report said that young girls and women are the worst sufferers among the Uyghurs. Campaign for Uyghurs Executive Director Rushan Abbas pointed out that this situation has led to government-sponsored mass rape.The report goes on the say that the Beijing administration has breached the “Prevention of Genocide” contract which was signed and approved by them before the international community.“As such, the President of the People’s Republic of China, Xi Jinping, and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Secretary, Chen Quanguo, and other executives are all responsible and accountable for these crimes,” the report said.It has recommended stripping China of its participatory status on the UN Human Rights Council Panel and has urged the UN to demand immediate, unfiltered access to the entire region of East Turkistan in order to perform independent, unescorted investigations of the concentration camps and factories suspected of using Uyghur forced labour.The implementation of Han Chinese immigration into East Turkistan and intrusion into Uyghur home should cease, the report said demanding that the United Nations should formally recognise the present events as genocide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/investigate-acts-of-genocide-in-china-uyghurs-urge-un-in-new-report/story-0EbuaRlOu4f9LEhNDPT4VL.html
09-07-2020||World||New US CDC school reopening guidelines promised after Trump complains||The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plans to issue new guidelines for reopening schools, Vice President Mike Pence said on Wednesday, after President Donald Trump criticized the agency’s recommendations as too expensive and impractical.Trump, a Republican who is seeking re-election in November, accused Democrats of wanting to keep schools shut for political reasons and threatened to cut off federal funding to schools that do not reopen, despite a surge in coronavirus cases.“I disagree with @CDCgov on their very tough & expensive guidelines for opening schools. While they want them open, they are asking schools to do very impractical things. I will be meeting with them!!!” Trump said on Twitter.Flanked by top administration health and education officials, Pence said the CDC next week will issue a “new set of tools ... to give more clarity on the guidance going forward.“The president said today we just don’t want the guidance to be too tough,” Pence said at a White House coronavirus task force briefing at the Department of Education.CDC Director Robert Redfield stressed that agency guidelines were not requirements. “It would be personally very disappointing to me, and I know my agency, if we saw that individuals were using these guidelines as a rationale for not reopening our schools,” Redfield said.White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told reporters the White House did not pressure the CDC to revise its recommendations.The CDC has made a number of recommendations for schools, including testing for Covid-19, dividing students into small groups, serving packaged lunches in classrooms instead of cafeterias, and minimizing sharing of school supplies.It has advised that seats be spaced at least six feet apart and that sneeze guards and partitions be put in place when social distancing is not possible. Administration officials said local leaders would tailor their decisions on how schools reopen.“Ultimately it’s not a matter of if schools should reopen, it’s simply a matter of how. They must fully open,” Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said. States are responsible for primary and secondary education under the US Constitution, but some have been holding off on deciding when and how to open schools, concerned about the resurgence of coronavirus across the country.The US outbreak has crossed the 3 million mark in confirmed cases, with a death toll of 131,336, according to a Reuters tally. “The Dems think it would be bad for them politically if US schools open before the November Election, but is important for the children & families. May cut off funding if not open!” Trump said on Twitter.Acknowledging that the lion’s share of school funding comes from states, Pence said that the administration would work with Congress to look for ways “to give states a strong incentive and encouragement to get kids back to school.” “It’s time for us to get our kids back to school,” he said.The federal government provides some supplementary funding for schools, including through congressional appropriations. With Democrats controlling the House of Representatives, any effort to curtail funding is sure to face roadblocks.McEnany said Trump is “looking at potential redirecting (of funding) to make sure it goes to the student and it is most likely tied to the student and not to a district where schools are closed.”Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia said school reopenings were necessary for the US economic recovery. Business and conservative groups have said parents need to get back to work.On Tuesday, Trump said he would pressure state governors to open schools in the fall.However, the surge in US cases has raised concerns about the increased risk of children spreading the virus to vulnerable adults at home as well as to older teachers and school staff.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the federal government has no authority on schools and his state will announce its reopening plans in the first week of August.In neighbouring New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy said he planned to reopen state schools in the fall, but reserved the right to “tweak that if it means saving lives.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-us-cdc-school-reopening-guidelines-promised-after-trump-complains/story-CQmetkWcJ2LYhySlpVKFlI.html
09-07-2020||World||Facebook takes down false accounts linked to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro||Social media giant Facebook said Wednesday that it has removed dozens of accounts, some used by employees of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and two of his lawmaker sons. The company said its decision was based on the creation of false profiles that engaged in “coordinated inauthentic behavior.”“We could see that there were employees of these offices engaged,” Nathaniel Gleicher, the company’s head of cybersecurity policy, said in a call with journalists. “We cannot see evidence and we do not see evidence of the politicians … or whether there is systemic coordination and direction from the leadership of those offices or not.”Gleicher added that some of the content posted by the accounts had already been taken down for community standards violations, including hate speech.There was no comment from Brazil’s presidential office about Facebook’s action.Facebook’s decision comes as Brazil’s president careens from crisis to crisis, with different investigations drawing close to him, his family and allies. Bolsonaro has faced growing political isolation since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, which has also affected his popularity.He frequently denounces the media for undermining his administration, and often opts to speak directly to his supporters -- whether on Facebook or in person, as they livestream his comments to their followers.Brazil’s Supreme Court is investigating a network of Bolsonaro supporters who have targeted justices, politicians and the media. Some of them were jailed in June and early July as the investigations moved forward. The country’s top electoral court is also looking into the accusation that the president’s 2018 campaign has illegally financed the spread of false news online.Gleicher said in a statement that 73 Facebook and Instagram accounts, 14 pages and one group were removed. About 883,000 accounts followed one or more of the Bolsonaro-linked pages and an additional 917,000 followed one of more of the Instagram accounts that were removed.“This network consisted of several clusters of connected activity that relied on a combination of duplicate and fake accounts — some of which had been detected and disabled by our automated systems — to evade enforcement, create fictitious personas posing as reporters, post content, and manage pages masquerading as news outlets,” Gleicher said in the statement.He said the accounts were linked to the Social Liberal Party, which Bolsonaro left last year after winning the 2018 presidential election, and to employees of the president, two of his sons, Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro and congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, and two other lawmakers.Atlantic Council, a research firm used by Facebook, said a third son of the president, Rio de Janeiro city council member Carlos Bolsonaro, is also connected to one of the members of the network.It said the only operator of the accounts that is directly employed by the presidency is Tercio Arnaud Tomaz, a former staffer of Carlos Bolsonaro in Rio’s city council and a member of the president’s digital team in the 2018 presidential campaign. Tomaz did not reply to a request for comment.Bolsonaro’s allies have previously been accused by adversaries of running information operations, but this is the first time their staffers have been connected to inauthentic accounts, Atlantic Council said.“This network steered a significant and longstanding operation, stretching back to at least the 2018 presidential campaign and having amassed an audience of millions, that fused political spin and disinformation with targeted online harassment,” the research firm said.The Social Liberal Party’s spokesperson Luiz Passos denied any responsibility over the removed accounts. He also said the accounts belong to employees of lawmakers who are at odds with the party and are close to switching to another that is led by staunch supporters of the president.Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro said in a statement that “it is impossible to evaluate what kind of profile was banned and if the platform crossed or not the limits of censorship.” Lawmaker Eduardo Bolsonaro did not comment.Facebook suspended three other networks on Wednesday, including one it attributed Roger Stone, a longtime ally of US President Donald Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-takes-down-false-accounts-linked-to-brazilian-president-jair-bolsonaro/story-oudZlfotqzRODSoGmjK44I.html
09-07-2020||World||Amid Covid-19 crisis, Donald Trump tells schools to ‘reopen or you may lose federal funds’||Determined to reopen America’s schools despite coronavirus worries, President Donald Trump threatened Wednesday to hold back federal money if school districts don’t bring their students back in the fall. He complained that his own public health officials’ safety guidelines are impractical and too expensive.Shortly afterward, Vice President Mike Pence announced that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would be issuing new guidance next week “that will give all new tools to our schools.” The recommendations will keep students safe, he said, but “the president said today we just don’t want the guidance to be too tough. ”Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Despite Trump’s increased pressure on state and local officials, New York City announced that most of its students would return to classrooms only two or three days a week and would learn online in between. “Most schools will not be able to have all their kids in school at the same time,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio.For a nation that prides itself on its public school system, it’s an extraordinary situation in this pandemic year.With millions of the nation’s parents anxious about their children’s safety in the fall — and their own work interruptions if they must stay home — Trump continued to inject politics into public health. He accused Democrats yet again of wanting to keep schools closed for election-year reasons rather than health concerns. And he issued a veiled threat to CDC officials over their reopening guidelines, tweeting, “I will be meeting with them!!!”Elsewhere in the nation, many states continued to confront a resurgence of the virus, which has claimed more than 130,000 lives in the US But safety obstacles in schools can be surmounted, Trump insisted, and reopening “is important for the children & families. May cut off funding if not open!”He did not say what funding he would pull, but Pence suggested at a coronavirus task force briefing that future Covid-19 relief bills could be tied to reopening schools as one way “to give states a strong incentive and encouragement to get kids back in school.”Click here for complete coronavirus coverage On Twitter, Trump argued that countries including Germany, Denmark and Norway have reopened schools “with no problems.”Germany did begin to reopen its schools in May, but in many cases students are taking turns going to school and studying at home for half the week — just the thing administration officials have criticized. Germany authorities are aiming for classes to resume in close to normal fashion after the summer vacation.Trump’s Twitter warnings drew backlash from some governors who said he has no authority over schools’ fall plans. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, said officials will reopen when it’s safe to do so.“School reopenings are a state decision, period,” he said at a news conference. “That is the law, and that is the way we are going to proceed. It’s not up to the president of the United States.”Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer tweeted, “Our schools & child care providers need MORE federal funding — not less — to be able to safely open.”Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made reopening schools a priority to help parents get back to work, and he said Wednesday he supports CDC guidance to help that happen.Senate Democrats have proposed $430 billion for schools and child care providers as part of the next aid package to be debated in Congress later this month. McConnell, too, has suggested more money for schools will be needed.Trump made his threat a day after launching an all-out effort pressing state and local officials to reopen the nation’s schools and colleges this fall. At a White House event Tuesday, health and education officials argued that keeping students out for the fall semester would pose greater health risks than any tied to the coronavirus.Among those pushing for a fall reopening was the chief of the CDC. But Trump on Wednesday complained the agency’s school opening guidelines were too tough and costly.“While they want them open, they are asking schools to do very impractical things,” Trump wrote.The CDC’s director, Dr. Robert Redfield, has emphasized that his agency’s guidelines are only recommendations.“I want to make it very clear that what is not the intent of CDC’s guidelines is to be used as a rationale to keep schools closed,” he said at Wednesday’s coronavirus task force briefing, which was held at the Education Department.The CDC’s guidance recommends that students and teachers wear masks whenever feasible, spread out desks, stagger schedules, eat meals in classrooms instead of the cafeteria and add physical barriers between bathroom sinks.Trump did not clarify which of the guidelines he opposed. But a White House spokeswoman later offered an example, saying the president takes issue with the CDC’s suggestion that students bring their own meals to school when feasible.“There are 22 million children in this country who depend on these meals at schools, who depend on access to nutrition in schools,” Kayleigh McEnany said.Democrats slammed the president over his threats and warned him to keep out of the CDC’s work. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, ranking Democrat on the Education Committee, said the agency needs to be trusted to make decisions based on scientific evidence, “not on President Trump’s Twitter outbursts.”At the task force briefing, and a day earlier in a call with the nation’s governors, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said anything less than a full reopening would be a failure for students and taxpayers. But some of the nation’s largest districts plan to bring back limited numbers of students for only a few days a week, saying it would be unsafe for all to return at once.DeVos singled out Virginia’s Fairfax County Public Schools, which are asking families to decide between fully remote instruction or two days a week at school.“A choice of two days per week in the classroom is not a choice at all,” she said, according to audio of the call with governors obtained by The Associated Press.In announcing New York City’s plan for in-person instruction two or three days a week, de Blasio said schools can’t accommodate all their students at any one time while maintaining social distancing. The city’s public school system, with 1.1 million students, is by far the nation’s largest.Lily Eskelsen García, president of the National Education Association, said, “Educators want nothing more than to be back in classrooms and on college campuses with our students, but we must do it in a way that keeps students, educators and communities safe.”The American Academy of Pediatrics recently issued guidelines suggesting that districts aim to start the academic year with students “physically present in school.” Keeping students at home can lead to social isolation, the organization said, and prevent schools from identifying learning deficits, abuse, depression and other issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-covid-19-crisis-donald-trump-tells-schools-to-reopen-or-you-may-lose-federal-funds/story-sUr3X2flPl3znw7vMNbYxO.html
09-07-2020||World||US lawmakers seek probe into efforts made by Chinese govt to exploit Covid-19 outbreak||A group of 14 US lawmakers have introduced a bill in the Congress which demands the government to identify, analyse and combat alleged efforts made by the Chinese government to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic for nationalistic gains. Introduced by Congressman Jared Golden and co-sponsored by 13 other congressmen, the ‘Preventing China from Exploiting COVID-19 Act’ would mandate the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to investigate the ways in which the Chinese government intends to seize on the COVID-19 pandemic to promote its interests on the national stage and evaluate the risks to the United States. It also asks the DNI to provide policymakers with information they need to address and counter Chinese actions, when necessary, and report its findings to the Congress. “Since COVID-19 began, there is evidence that China is at work using the pandemic crisis against Americans through cyber-theft and the spread of misinformation,” said Golden. “We need to fully understand these threats and respond to them. We’re introducing the ‘Preventing China from Exploiting COVID-19 Act’ to gather and analyse important intelligence our country needs to protect American people and businesses,” Golden said. The bill requires the DNI -- in coordination with the Secretaries of Defense, State, and Homeland Security -- to prepare an assessment of the different ways in which the Chinese government has exploited or could exploit the pandemic, which originated in China, in order to advance China’s interests and to undermine the interests of the United States, its allies, and the rule-based international order. The assessment must be provided to Congress within 90 days and posted in unclassified form on the DNI’s website. “As we fight to save American lives and rebuild our economy, no country should be allowed to exploit the pandemic for its own advantage, yet reports indicate that China has done exactly that,” said Congressman Torres Small, a co-sponsor of the bill. “This is a time when countries should be coming together to fight the spread of COVID-19, not exploiting breakdowns in supply chains or a shortage of critical equipment like masks, gloves and gowns in order to advance their own national security interests. This is unacceptable, and the United States must be able to hold China accountable if it continues,” he said. Among others, the legislation requires the DNI to investigate, analyse, and report on the techniques used by the Chinese government to obstruct or retaliate against nations that have sought a full inquiry into China’s role in the emergence and spread of COVID-19, and the Chinese government’s motivations for such efforts. It seeks investigation into the activities undertaken by the Chinese government, like cyber-theft, intended to acquire information and intellectual property related to COVID-19 testing, treatment, and vaccines. The bill also asks the DNI to probe the manner in which the Chinese government seeks to advance its foreign policy interests by providing economic aid or medical equipment to nations adversely affected by COVID-19, and the degree to which this aid makes recipient countries more likely to adopt positions favourable to China and detrimental to the United States. The ways in which the Chinese government is using, or may be planning to use, the global disruption and distraction associated with COVID-19 as an opportunity to more aggressively pursue longstanding objectives, including with respect to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Xinjiang, and territorial disputes, is another subject being pointed out by the Congressmen. Relations between Washington and Beijing have spiralled downward since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. US President Donald Trump has questioned the Asian powerhouse’s handing of COVID-19. The two countries have also sparred over China imposing a new national security law in Hong Kong, restrictions on American journalists, treatment of Uyghurs Muslims and security measures in Tibet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-seek-probe-into-efforts-made-by-chinese-govt-to-exploit-covid-19-outbreak/story-KGby0gr4LbWBofm05BHChL.html
09-07-2020||World||United States considering additional actions against China: White House||The United States is preparing to take additional actions against China, the White House has said, but what those presidential measures would be was not made clear. Relations between Washington and Beijing have spiralled downward since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. US President Donald Trump has questioned the Asian powerhouse’s handing of Covid-19. The two countries have also sparred over China imposing a new national security law in Hong Kong, restrictions on American journalists, treatment of Uyghurs Muslims and security measures in Tibet. “I’m not going to get ahead of the president on what our actions on China will be, but you will be hearing about some upcoming actions that pertain to China. So, I can confirm that,” White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters on Wednesday. McEnany was responding to a question on recent statements made by top administration officials, including White House Chief of Staff, National Security Advisor and Secretary of States, hinting the president could take additional measures against China in the coming days. US National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien on Wednesday had told reporters that China had annexed Hong Kong, referring to the new security law in the former British colony. “I think you’re going to see a significant rollout of measures with respect to China over the coming days and weeks. There’s no president that’s ever stood up to China the way President Donald Trump has. He was the first president to put a massive tariff on the Chinese to stop the trade imbalance,” he said. O’Brien said that he gave a speech in Arizona two weeks ago on the Communist Party of China and the threat that it poses to the United States. FBI Director Christopher Wray gave a speech a day earlier about the massive theft of Chinese intellectual property. Referring to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s comments made last week, O’Brien said the president is looking very closely at TikTok, WeChat and some of other applications that the Chinese government is allegedly using to obtain personal and private data of Americans. “We are looking very closely at the apps,” O’Brien said, adding the president has already said that Hong Kong will no longer be treated as a separate entity, that it will be treated as part of China. “So there will be a number of regulations and a number of actions that take place to implement the president’s vision,” he said. He described the Chinese actions on Hong Kong as one of the biggest stories of the decade. “We have Hong Kong that’s basically been annexed by the People’s Republic of China, by the Communist Party of China, and they’re imposing their will on free and democratic people and not only are they doing it in Hong Kong, but they’re using this Hong Kong law to try and impose their will extra-territorially,” he said. “They’ll use the law, but they also use their economic leverage. So, when the general manager of the Houston Rockets tweeted in support of the peaceful protestors in Hong Kong, the Chinese Communist Party said that they’re not going to broadcast Rockets games in China, and they made the NBA kowtow to China because--simply because an American citizen supported free peaceful protests in Hong Kong,” he said. “So, what the Chinese Communist Party is doing isn’t just in Hong Kong. It’s affecting all of you. It’s affecting how we operate in the United States and we can’t let that happen,” O’Brien told reporters. In a tweet, Congressman Matt Gaetz said the US needs to be more resilient, diligent, and aware of the fact that China is an enemy. “And we shouldn’t be aiding the enemy by using the US dollar to prop up their companies and their operations in the United States,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-considering-additional-actions-against-china-white-house/story-g9JcVZsyXx106fGDNZSJhL.html
09-07-2020||World||Covid-19 could kill more through hunger, 122 million more may be pushed to starvation: Oxfam||More people could die as a result of hunger linked to Covid-19 than from the disease, warned charity group Oxfam in a new report published on Thursday, estimating that 122 million more people could be pushed to starvation this year.The scenario, it says in the report titled The Hunger Virus, is the result of the social and economic fallout from the pandemic including through mass unemployment, disruption to food production and supplies, and declining aid.Danny Sriskandarajah, chief executive of Oxfam GB, said: “The knock-on impacts of Covid-19 are far more widespread than the virus itself, pushing millions of the world’s poorest people deeper into hunger and poverty. It is vital governments contain the spread of this deadly disease, but they must also prevent it killing as many – if not more – people from hunger”.“Governments can save lives now by funding the UN Covid-19 appeal and supporting the call for a global ceasefire to end conflict in order to tackle the pandemic”, he added.The group wants the UK to champion debt cancellation at the G20 finance ministers meeting next week to pay for social protection measures such as cash grants to help people survive.The report reveals the world’s ten worst hunger ‘hotspots’, including Afghanistan, Syria and South Sudan where the food crisis is most severe and getting worse as a result of the pandemic.It also highlights emerging epicentres of hunger – middle income countries such as India, South Africa, and Brazil – where millions of people who were barely managing have been tipped over the edge by the pandemic.On India, the report says: “Travel restrictions left farmers without vital migrant labour at the peak of the harvest season, forcing many to leave their crops in the field to rot. Traders have also been unable to reach tribal communities during the peak harvest season for forest products, depriving up to 100 million people of their main source of income”.Women, and women-headed households, are more likely to go hungry despite the crucial role they play as food producers and workers, the group said.Labour MP Preet Kaur Gill, shadow international development secretary, said on the report: “Even before this pandemic, billions of people were facing unnecessary hunger, preventable deaths and extreme poverty”.“Covid-19 has worsened inequalities around the world and pushed millions more into hunger. We simply cannot overcome the challenges we face without global cooperation to provide humanitarian support now and to tackle the root causes behind the lack of access to nutritious food.”Since the pandemic began, Oxfam said it helped 4.5 million of the world’s most vulnerable people with food aid and clean water, working with over 344 partners across 62 countries. The international agency aims to reach a total of 14 million people by raising a further $113 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-could-kill-more-through-hunger-122-million-more-may-be-pushed-to-starvation-oxfam/story-67nncIVucQYuOEgrAPW6aK.html
09-07-2020||World||Trump forgoes insults of past, calls Mexico cherished friend||President Donald Trump, who has denigrated Mexican migrants and threatened the U.S. ally with crippling tariffs, welcomed President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to the White House on Wednesday, called him a cherished partner and claimed the countries’ economic and security ties were reaching new heights.Trump’s warm words were in stark contrast to the days when he called Mexicans “rapists” and railed against migrants entering the United States illegally. López Obrador had cordial words for Trump, too, saying that while they have disagreed, it was better to find common ground and avoid slinging insults.The meeting was billed as a celebration of economic ties and the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, but critics in Mexico worried López Obrador was being used as a political pawn to bolster the Trump campaign and his “America first,” anti-illegal migration agenda. Despite the verbal backslapping in the Rose Garden, thorny issues — from immigration to investment — remain.Trump has dialed back his harsh words since López Obrador took office a year and a half ago. And López Obrador signaled he wanted to put the insults in the past.“As in the best times of our political relations, during my term as president of Mexico, instead of insults toward me and more importantly against my country, we have received from you understanding and respect,” López Obrador said.Their relationship is an odd bromance: López Obrador is a veteran leftist and Trump tacks right.“Some thought that our ideological differences would have led us inevitably to confrontation,” López Obrador said. “Fortunately, this bad omen didn’t materialize and I consider that in the future there will be no need to break our good political relations, nor the friendship between our governments.”Later, Lopez Obrador said: “The forecasts failed. We didn’t fight. We are friends, and we’re going to keep being friends.”Trump their friendship developed “against all odds.”Trump’s national security adviser Robert O’Brien said the two leaders have “really hit it off” and exchanged gift baseball bats during their meeting. Trump signed and gave López Obrador a custom Louisville Slugger, and the Mexican president gave the president a bat manufactured by indigenous people in southern Mexico, O’Brien said on Fox Business Network’s “Lou Dobbs Tonight.”The two signed a declaration highlighting U.S.-Mexico relations and the USMCA. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau decided not to come to Washington to celebrate the agreement, citing scheduling conflicts.Trump and López Obrador also pledged to cooperate in responding to the coronavirus, which has rocked both nations. Since March 2020, movement across the border has been restricted to essential travel while allowing the flow of goods and services. Last year, Mexico became the largest goods trading partner of the United States.López Obrador arrived at the White House after morning stops at the Lincoln Memorial and a statue of Benito Juarez, a former Mexican president and national hero. Trump and a military honor guard greeted him at the White House. The two posed for pictures and Trump flashed a thumb’s up. They also were to have dinner at the White House with about 20 U.S. and Mexican business leaders, including Carlos Slim, one of the richest men in the world.With the U.S. looking to reduce its dependence on China for parts and supplies, Mexico is well-positioned to step into the void, though U.S. businesses have viewed some recent actions taken by the Mexican government as harmful to U.S. investors and say they undermine the framework of the USMCA. López Obrador didn’t publicly address U.S. business’ concerns.“If there is not a better investment climate for both foreign and domestic private investment, it will be very difficult to use the opportunity of USMCA and the drift between China and the United States to our advantage,” Geronimo Gutierrez, who was Mexico’s ambassador to the U.S. in 2017 and 2018, said during a virtual event hosted by the Wilson Center.With no meetings planned with former Vice President Joe Biden, López Obrador seemingly is banking that Trump will win a second term. The Democratic Party chairman, Tom Perez, recalled Trump’s insults of Mexicans and said the president was now trying to take credit for a trade deal that Democrats in Congress helped make possible.“Latino communities, immigrants, and the American people deserve a president with the empathy and experience to lead us forward, not a demagogue who cheers on bigotry from the White House,” Perez said, urging voters to elect Biden.When he arrived at the White House, López Obrador and Trump did not shake hands as would have been customary before the pandemic. White House spokesman Judd Deere said all members of the Mexican traveling delegation were tested for the virus. The presidents sat at tables positioned many feet apart to sign their joint statement.López Obrador likes to point out that Trump helped Mexico reach a deal with other oil-producing nations to cut production and aided Mexico in obtaining more ventilators to cope with the coronavirus pandemic. Both presidents talk about a blossoming friendship that seems to stem from their pursuit of nationalist agendas.Many Mexicans, however, remain wary of Trump, whose denunciations are intended to rally his most loyal supporters. Trump has threatened tariffs to strong-arm Mexico into playing an uncomfortable role in U.S. immigration policy and insisted that Mexico will pay for a border wall meant to keep migrants out of the U.S.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany wouldn’t get into detail about what the two presidents said about immigration. Mexico deployed 27,000 troops to the border to help stem the tide of illegal immigrants from Central American.___Associated Press writer Christopher Sherman in Mexico City and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-forgoes-insults-of-past-calls-mexico-cherished-friend/story-6iJ6JIcc8BA708mB37SOUP.html
09-07-2020||World||Beijing fears its people’s free thinking than any foreign foe, says Pompeo||US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, on Wednesday (local time) came down heavily on Chinese Communist Party and called for releasing Xu Zhangrun who was detained by Chinese authorities for publishing articles criticising Xi Jinping over coronavirus pandemic.“As with all unelected, communist regimes, Beijing fears its own people’s free thinking more than any foreign foe. We were deeply troubled to learn this week that the CCP detained Xu Zhangrun for criticizing General Secretary Xi Jinping’s repressive regime and the CCP’s mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Pompeo.“He should be released. He was simply telling the truth. He should be released as soon as possible,” the US Secretary of State said.According to media reports, Xu had published an essay in February criticising Xi’s policy of deception and censorship over the coronavirus situation in China.Xu worked as a law professor at Tsinghua University. He had earlier spoken against the 2018 abolition of presidential term limits. Stating that the CCP has an enormous credibility problem, the US Secretary of State said: “They failed to tell the world the truth about this virus, and now hundreds of thousands of peoples all across the world are dead. We need the truth; we still need the truth.”“We need to open up. We need to engage in a serious way with scientists around the world. And they now say they’re going to allow the WHO to come in. That’s great, but the WHO needs to be free to do its real work. We need to make sure the right people are there to engage in this investigation, and we need real answers, not a perfunctory political solution. This is about science, not politics, and the Chinese Communist Party needs to come clean with the world about this virus,” added Pompeo.The US Secretary of State also slammed China for its recent actions over Hong Kong.“Beijing said that for 50 years they’d give the people of Hong Kong “a high degree of autonomy.” And you all have seen what’s happened after only 23 years - empty promises made to the people of Hong Kong and to the world,” he said.Pompeo lauded Google, Facebook, and Twitter for “refusing to surrender user data to the Hong Kong government”. “Other companies should follow them and do the same,” he said.China’s decision to impose draconian national security law in Hong Kong has invited criticism with many saying the move would lead to erosion of its autonomy and also crush political dissent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-fears-its-people-s-free-thinking-than-any-foreign-foe-says-pompeo/story-C6PkBtXuJ7LuxqHxtLsrPM.html
09-07-2020||World||Brooks Brothers, which dressed 40 US presidents, files for bankruptcy||Brooks Brothers Group Inc filed for bankruptcy, felled by the pandemic’s impact on clothing sales and its own heavy debt load.The famed apparel company is the latest to succumb as a nationwide lockdown during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak added to the woes afflicting old-line retailers. Neiman Marcus Group Inc, J Crew Group Inc and John Varvatos Enterprises Inc each filed for bankruptcy since the virus took hold.The company that says it’s put 40 US presidents in its suits, survived two World Wars and navigated through casual Fridays and a loosening of dress standards even on Wall Street, but the Covid-19 pandemic pushed the 200-year-old company into seek Chapter 11 protection.The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in Delaware allows Brooks Brothers to keep operating while it works out a plan to turn the business around and pay its debts. The company listed assets and liabilities of at least $500 million each in court papers, and a spokesperson said via email it had lined up a $75 million bankruptcy loan.The pandemic has hit Brooks Brothers hard, shuttering office buildings and hurting demand for business wear as people worked from home. The retailer has been trying to sell itself since last year as many of its roughly 250 US locations struggled with declining sales, Bloomberg reported earlier. It’s continuing to seek a buyer, according to the spokesperson.With its first store in 1818 on the corner of Cherry and Catherine streets in lower Manhattan, the company’s simple, classic suits became a staple on Wall Street. Brooks Brothers, which calls itself the oldest US clothing retailer, has dressed US presidents, including Abraham Lincoln, and now sells men’s, women’s and children’s clothing.The store began its international expansion with a Tokyo flagship in 1979 and now has more than 250 locations outside the US. Its many stores have become a burden amid changing consumer habits and a shift toward more casual work attire.More bankruptcies are anticipated in the retail sector.The virus-induced recession has cratered spending in most sectors of the economy and accelerated shifts in where people shop, mostly to the benefit of online retailers like Amazon.com. Online sales are up a sizable 31% from a year ago.Brooks Brothers was one of the few national chains that produced its clothing in the US. In March, it shifted some production at plants in New York, North Carolina and Massachusetts to produce 150,000 masks per day for frontline healthworkers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brooks-brothers-which-dressed-40-us-presidents-files-for-bankruptcy/story-hOOcAQ6nooPQV4BZYXtjZK.html

Oli was set to meet Wednesday with his Nepal Communist Party rival, Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, who argues it is his turn to rule, ahead of a series of party meetings in coming days and weeks that will decide whether Oli is removed from his post.Oli’s troubles within the party also come as he deals with blowback from India over a new map that includes a disputed area claimed by both India and Nepal.Kathmandu’s relations with New Delhi only worsened after Oli said last week that India was attempting to oust him from office with help from some of the members of his own party. India has denied all allegations.India had been a dominant force in Nepal until recently, when China’s involvement began to grow. Besides China’s investment in the building of airports, highways and hydro-power projects in Nepal, Chinese diplomats have worked to increase ties with Nepali political leaders.Just this week, China’s ambassador to Nepal held meetings with some top Nepal Communist Party leaders.China views Nepal as key to its massive transcontinental infrastructure Belt and Road Initiative that builds on old Silk Road routes that once connected China to the West, analysts say.“Because Nepal remains in a strategic geographic location, both of these countries think they have to have importance in Nepal’s politics,” said Guranaj Luitel, editor of Nepal’s popular Nagarik newspaper. “The present government looks more inclined toward China, and because of that India’s role looks like it’s gradually declining.” Oli was elected PM in 2017 after the Nepal Communist Party won a majority of the seats in parliament. Just before the general election, two Communist parties led by Oli and Dahal had merged to become a stronger political force. It was widely believed that Oli and Dahal would split the five-year term, with each taking turns in office. But 2 1/2 years after taking power, Oli has shown no signs of stepping down. “Having differences and feuds is nothing new in our political party, but this time it has turned into a national crisis because we are the largest party and we are in the government,” said Khatiwada||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/power-tussle-in-nepal-ruling-party-over-china-influence/story-JeKDYs8b6EMsBrf9qekpFL.html

AIIMS director Dr Gitanjali Batmanabane said the hospital was facing a shortage of staff as many of the employees had tested positive for the disease and their contacts were in quarantine. Besides, many employees were residing in containment zones and therefore unable to report for duty.Earlier, the MKCG Medical College and Hospital in Berhampur town of Ganjam and Acharya Harihar Regional Cancer Centre at Cuttack district had shut their OPD departments as many of their patients and doctors tested Covid-19 positive.Odisha’s Covid-19 scenario continued to be grim as the state’s daily growth rate continued to outpace the national average for about a week. On Thursday, Odisha’s daily growth rate was 5.43 per cent compared to the national growth rate of 3.5 per cent. The state has been reporting around 3,100 cases in the last 7 days.The sample positivity rate at 9.17 per cent has also overtaken the national average of 7 per cent. The surge in local cases as percentage of total cases continued to be higher than 30 per cent indicated community transmission.Meanwhile, the state government on Thursday decided to constitute an expert panel to examine the cause of the Covid-19 deaths. Health and Family Welfare minister Naba Kishore Das said the expert committee comprising specialist doctors, scientists from the Regional Medical Research Centre, Drugs Controller and Director Medical Education and Training would examine the cause of the deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-posts-highest-single-day-spike-of-covid-19-cases-with-577-new-patients/story-AKR1YtODYxc2Hy3axpmqKP.html

The statement didn’t say how many Pakistanis are still stranded in the country.A total of 627 Indian nationals stranded in Pakistan because of the pandemic returned to the country via the Wagah-Attari crossing during June 25-27.About 100 Indians are still in Pakistan and the government is in touch with Pakistani authorities and awaiting clearances to facilitate their return, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/75-pakistanis-stranded-in-india-due-to-covid-19-return-home-via-wagah-attari-crossing/story-QS7MZ9it1uIRnvAVtt09CL.html
09-07-2020||India||Nepal’s cable operators remove Indian news channels||Nepal’s cable TV operators on Thursday yanked Indian news channels from their networks over coverage of the Chinese ambassador’s meetings with senior Nepalese leaders even as country’s envoy in New Delhi raised the media reports with the external affairs ministry.Multi-system operators (MSOs) such as Dishome, Mega Max, DSN and My TV decided to stop beaming Indian news channels in Nepal from Thursday, with the sole exception being state-run Doordarshan News.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that there was no official ban on Indian news channels by the Nepal government.In a related development, Nepal’s ambassador Nilambar Acharya raised the issue of Indian media coverage of the Chinese envoy’s recent meetings with senior Nepalese political leaders and certain derogatory references in these reports during a conversation with the external affairs ministry, one of the people cited above said.Dhruv Sharma, vice-president of Mega Max TV cable network, said Indian news channels were resorting to “exaggerated and uncontrolled propaganda” about Nepal, especially “objectionable” reports that referred to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Chinese envoy Hou Yanqi.Rajan Bhattarai, a member of the central committee of the ruling Nepal Communist Party and foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, tweeted: “The news coming from Indian media against our PM and government after publication of new Map is condemnable. We completely reject their fabricated & fake reports. We urge them to respect Nepali government & people’s unified position on our sovereignty & national independence.”Nepal’s information minister Yuba Raj Khatiwada was asked specifically during a news conference whether the government would ban Indian channels, and he replied it would be better if the media exercised self-restraint and provided accurate news instead of the government resorting to a ban.However, he said the government will seek political and legal remedies against the Indian media’s reports that jeopardise the nation, nationality, sovereignty and self-respect of Nepali people.“We also request the media not to disseminate news that infringes on the sovereignty and self-respect of Nepalis. This includes the media of neighbouring countries,” said Khatiwada.The Chinese envoy in Kathmandu has had a series of meetings with the President and leaders of the Nepal Communist Party, including Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, who are seeking the ouster of Prime Minister Oli, who has been accused of poor governance. The move against Oli has come at a time when his government issued a new map showing the Indian territories of Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepal, thus triggering a border row with India.The people cited above said the Nepalese political leadership was particularly irked by derogatory references to Oli and the Chinese envoy by an Indian news channel, which suggested the premier could be “honey trapped” by the ambassador.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-s-cable-operators-remove-indian-news-channels/story-8WGa3TYqqLwSduBv5iDNGL.html

However, over the last few weeks, cheaper IMFL drinks from neighbouring states have been pouring into Odisha resulting in excise losses for the state.Last month, manufacturers of alcoholic beverages had urged the state government to reduce the special Covid fee from 50 per cent to a reasonable rate and allow retailers in the state to sell such products from outlets, an official said on Saturday.Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies director general Vinod Giri in a letter to the Odisha chief minister said the 50 per cent cess had led to a drastic fall in liquor sales.The state government from the beginning of this month has permitted opening of outlets after allowing them to sell via online. However, the shops would be open till 6 pm to avoid the evening crowd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-reduces-special-covid-19-cess-on-liquor-to-15-per-cent-amid-slump-in-sales/story-qBO78VGRhDp9Je6J3Gg8fL.html

The meeting with Manjhi lasted more than an hour.Manjhi’s party, which contested the Lok Sabha elections as part of the Grand Alliance, had demanded a discussion on issues of seat adjustment, candidates etc for the forthcoming Assembly polls. It had also set up a deadline for constitution of a co-ordination committee to manage the affairs of GA by June 25. The deadline came and went without any favourable outcome for Manjhi’s party.Senior BJP leader and deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi took a dig at the internal rumblings in GA. “The number one party of GA (RJD) has rejected the demands for a co-ordination committee, and has even ignored senior Dalit leader’s ultimatum. The number two party has virtually become spineless, while other parties are like slaves,” said Modi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dinner-with-tejashwi-tea-with-manjhi-cong-sues-for-peace-in-ga-as-bihar-assembly-polls-draw-near/story-7CG07L8JPt1Om9sFqUXXLL.html

The owner who had seen him on TV became suspicious and called up the private security agency at the temple and informed them.” Ujjain’s superintendent of police (SP) Manoj Kumar Singh told reporters at a briefing.The Ujjain’s police chief said Dubey who had been on the run since Friday after carrying out an ambush that killed eight Uttar Pradesh policemen in Kanpur, had tried to hoodwink the security guards by giving a false name. “When he entered, private security guards informed our officials at Mahakal Chowki and started talking to him and asked his name. He gave them a false name but later gave his correct name. He was then taken to the police station where we interrogated him,” Singh said.The SP said Ujjain police also sought Dubey’s photograph from their counterparts in Kanpur for further confirmation that they had indeed nabbed UP’s most wanted man.“For further confirmation, we contacted Kanpur SSP and the STF and asked for his photo. We handed him over to the STF when they reached here. They later left for UP with Dubey,” Singh said.While Dubey was nabbed in the morning, teh UP STF arrested his wife Richa Dubey and elder son in the evening on charges of harbouring the gangster and acting in connivance with him, a senior officer of the Lucknow police commissionerate said.The UP police killed five of Dubey’s gang members and aides since they mounted a massive manhunt for him. Two of them were killed on Thursday – one in an encounter and the other while trying to escape from police custody. On Tuesday, Dubey had escaped from a Faridabad hotel shortly before the STF raided it.On Wednesday, the UP Police had raised the bounty on Dubey’s head to Rs 5 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shopkeeper-outside-mahkal-temple-tipped-off-security-guards-about-vikas-dubey/story-RfDKBBHcLn8EMuOxFad1yN.html

Among this active cases are 2,295 and recovered patients are 3,710. The state has reported 29 coronavirus deaths so far. Out of the 339 new cases, 133 contracted the disease through local contacts, 117 came from abroad 74 from other states. The state has pressed the emergency button after locally- transmitted cases surged.“According to World Health Organisation norms super spreading has occurred in some places including the fishing hamlet Poonthura on the outskirts of the state capital. If we lower our guard next is community spread which is round the corner,” said the CM adding the government was forced to enforce triple lockdown in the state capital after the situation worsened. He said the number of daily tests will be increased in the coming days.“Those who are on reverse quarantine are most vulnerable. They should heed the guidelines strictly. One tiny fault will derail all our efforts,” he said adding if the contact cases rise at the same pace community transmission will be imminent. Reverse quarantine is a practice of detaching most vulnerable people, aged or people with co-morbidity conditions, from the rest and monitoring their health indicators closely-- a method of protecting vulnerable people from getting the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-339-new-covid-19-cases-kerala-logs-highest-single-day-surge-critical-phase-says-cm/story-cSk61DfuwVJNt7e7p6kwPO.html

So I decided to come back,” said Tandi.But several of his friends in the nearby villages who worked in states like Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka could not return for more than a month. Many of them returned a couple of months later, some by hopping onto a bus or walking or by cycling. Sitting at home, without work, and seeing the videos of migrant workers travelling in pitiable condition stoked the inner rage of Tandi.After coming back, Tandi, who goes by the nickname of Rapper Dule Rocker in Kalahandi, did a 2.45 minute rap video called “Telling the Truth” in which he vents out his angst against the politicians. In May, Tandi made a 3.5 minute rap video called “Sun Sarkar, Sat Katha” in which he narrated how the migrant workers got a rude jolt by the virus and the subsequent distress.“In that video I rapped about how the migrant workers who had saved their hard-earned money lost everything and they lost everything in a matter of days after the factories and construction sites were closed due to lockdown. All that the leaders were doing were giving us sermons instead of helping the migrant workers. I was angry and so wrote down the rap song,” said Tandi, who first migrated out for work soon after completing his BSc degree in chemistry from a government college in Kalahandi in 2013.With the two acres of land mortgaged with a bank in 2014 for Rs 50, 000 in the year 2014, when his mother had to undergo a surgery in a hospital in Visakhapatnam, Tandi said he had no other way than to go out for work. He initially wanted to be a doctor, but had to give it up due to his family’s financial conditions. He then started giving tuitions in Borda village, but found the income too meagre to sustain and had to leave for other states. In 2017, his father, Nilamani Tandi, a farmer and local police station assistant, passed away.Though getting two square meals was difficult for Tandi, the Dalit boy had set his heart in rap music since his college days. “When I used to write lyrics for rap music, everyone used to dissuade me. Everyone used to say what would you gain out of it. But in my heart I knew that I wanted to be a rapper,” he said.In 2014, someone from Punjab saw one of his rap videos on Facebook and called him to perform at Chandigarh. “It was a new experience for me as I performed in different competitions,” he said. In 2015, he came to Bhubaneswar and visited studios, channels for making the videos. However, no one helped him as he did not have the money required to make slick rap videos. “One needs at least Rs 50,000 for making each such rap video, which I did not have. So I decided to stick to making the videos on my mobile phone,” he said.The rap songs on migrants that Tandi composed during lockdown have slowly become popular. After hearing his songs, Odia singer Humane Sagar recently gave Rs 30,000 to him. A local recording studio recently called him expressing an interest in recording his music.The Dalit youth insists that his rap songs would be about common people and their hardships. “I don’t want to promote sleaze or liquor in my songs. Migrant workers like us have too many issues. Those things would find a place in my songs,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-rapper-from-odisha-s-kalahandi-is-telling-the-truth-about-migrants/story-bINseEJ7nJFTPntcNeA5cI.html
09-07-2020||India||Kanpur gangster Vikas Dubey’s wife, son arrested in Lucknow||The wife and son of gangster Vikas Dubey were arrested by a team of the Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force (UP STF) on Thursday evening.Richa Dubey, the wife of Vikas Dubey, and the couple’s elder son were arrested in Lucknow on the charge of harbouring the gangster and acting in connivance with him, a senior officer of the Lucknow police commissionerate said.They were being taken to Kanpur, the officer added.The gangster, wanted in the killing of eight policemen in Kanpur last week, was arrested earlier on Thursday morning in Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain.The policemen, including a deputy superintendent of police, were ambushed in Bikru village in the Chaubeypur area of Kanpur, where they had gone to arrest Vikas Dubey and fell to bullets fired from rooftops last Friday.Watch how gangster Vikas Dubey reacted after being nabbed by police in MPVikas Dubey was on run since then and was finally arrested earlier today outside a famous temple in the pilgrimage city of Ujjain, ending a six-day manhunt across three states.Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra said that Dubey had arrived at the famous Mahakal temple in his car and was identified by a police constable, who alerted three others before he was questioned and arrested. He described Dubey’s arrest as a big achievement for Madhya Pradesh police.Dubey was carrying a reward of Rs 5 lakh for information leading to his arrest and has been on the run since the barbaric encounter of policemen near his residence in Kanpur. A dreaded gangster, Dubey is wanted for several criminal cases, including murders. He was accused of killing a BJP MLA in a police station 20 years ago but was acquitted for lack of evidence.He has been handed over to UP Police. Meanwhile, two more aides of Dubey were gunned down in separate encounters in Uttar Pradesh, police said. Five persons have been killed in police encounters since the Kanpur ambush.A relative of DSP Devendra Mishra, who was among the eight policemen killed in the Kanpur ambush, claimed that the arrest of Vikas Dubey was staged and the gangster was “saved from death”, according to PTI.“This is not an arrest but he has been saved from death. It was a surrender made in a well-planned manner,” he was quoted as saying by the news agency.Congress, too, has questioned Dubey’s surrender and demanded a CBI probe into the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kanpur-gangster-vikas-dubey-s-wife-son-arrested-in-lucknow/story-sIZlLfjIkZI1gfILbd1a6H.html
09-07-2020||India||In response to NGO’s plea to transfer funds, Centre defends PM Cares before SC||Creation of funds like the PM Cares Fund is not barred by the existence of other statutory funds like the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) under the Disaster Management Act of 2005, the Central government told the Supreme Court on Wednesday.In its affidavit filed before the top court, the Centre defended the PM Cares Fund stating that it is a fund established to carry out relief work and there are several such funds that have been established on similar lines in the past.“Mere existence of a statutory fund (NDRF) would not prohibit creation of a different fund like PM Cares Fund which provides for voluntary donations,” the affidavit said.The Centre’s response came on a petition by NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL) seeking transfer of all contributions made to PM Cares Fund till date to the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF).The NDRF is a fund created by the Central government under Section 46 of the Disaster Management Act for dealing with disasters.The PM Cares Fund, the petition claimed, has been set up in violation of the legal mandate under the Disaster Management Act as per which any grant made by any person or institution for the purpose of disaster management should be compulsorily credited to NDRF.The PM Cares Fund was set up by the Central government on March 28 as a public charitable trust with the primary objective of dealing with any kind of emergency or distress situation such as that posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.The petitioner pointed out that two weeks before setting up the PM Cares Fund, the Central government had, on March 14, communicated to all states that Covid-19 would be treated as a notified disaster for the purpose of providing assistance under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), a fund similar to NDRF and setup under the Disaster Management Act at the state level.The petitioner said that apart from SDRF, the Central Government should have included NDRF too, for the purpose of providing assistance in the fight against Covid-19 which was decided to be treated as a notified disaster. However, the same was not done so that the central government could later create the PM-CARES Fund.The Supreme Court had sought the Centre’s response to the plea in June.The Centre, in its affidavit, also gave details about steps taken by it to alleviate grievances of the poor and migrant workers.As on the July 7, around 42 crore people received financial assistance of Rs. 67,478 crore under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan package, the affidavit stated. Further, 37.07 Lakh Metric Tonnes (LMT) of food grains were distributed covering 74 crore beneficiaries in April. The number was 36.87 LMT in May and 31.18 in June. Similarly, under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat package, 8 LMT food grains were allocated for stranded migrants for two months, the affidavit highlighted.The Indian Railways operated 4,611 special Shramik trains from May 1 to July 6 bringing back 63 lakh migrants from various cities to states including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh.“Mere criticism of a few may not be enough to undermine the humongous and unprecedented response given by our nation which includes, Central government and all state governments, local bodies, health care workers, sanitation workers and each individual citizen who are all corona warriors,” the affidavit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-response-to-ngo-s-plea-to-transfer-funds-centre-defends-pm-cares-before-sc/story-aN2CUBFXuhNZoEHvedovNJ.html

09-07-2020||India||Uttarakhand family claims pregnant minor committed suicide, police suspect murder||A 15-year-old pregnant girl died in suspicious circumstances in Bageshwar district of Uttarakhand. The incident came to light after her mother lodged a complaint on Wednesday stating that she committed suicide but police are suspecting she might have been murdered, said police. According to the police, the girl, a student of class 10 used to live with her paternal grandparents in a village of the district. Both her parents used to live separately in two different villages. One of the cops investigating the case said the girl’s pregnancy was detected two days ago on Tuesday. “On Tuesday, the girl complained of uneasiness after which her grandmother took her to a nearby health centre, where during diagnosis, the doctor revealed that she is five months pregnant. He also suggested her grandparents take her to a higher centre in Bageshwar,” said police inspector Prahlad Singh.Singh says that the girl’s grandmother, however, took her home, where the girl was scolded by her father who had arrived there after receiving the news. He left the same night.“All this while, they didn’t inform the girl’s mother who lives in another village about 2 km away. Then in the wee hours of Wednesday, the grandparents found her dead in the home,” said Singh. Heavy rains trigger landslides across Uttarakhand, one dead in car accidentThe police officer said that the grandparents, however, didn’t inform the police and buried her with the help of villagers after performing the last rites. “On Thursday morning, her mother came to know about the whole incident and lodged a complaint. Based on her complaint, we have booked a case against unidentified accused for rape and abetment to suicide under sections 376 and 306 of IPC and section 5/6 of POCSO Act followed by investigation,” said Singh.He added that permission has been sought from the district magistrate to exhume her body for post-mortem examination and DNA test to ascertain the cause of death and find the rape accused respectively.Uttarakhand braces for wet spell after MeT office sounds rain alertMeanwhile, another police officer privy to the investigation, said on the condition of anonymity that it could be a case of dishonor killing, “So far in the initial investigation, the case seems to be of honour killing.

The PIL cited that Maharashtra has been reporting a surge in Covid-19 positive cases even though the state government is still maintaining that community transmission has not occurred yet.It also questioned the policy of keeping the identity of Covid-19 patients under wraps while expressing fear that such unwarranted lack of voluntary disclosure might deepen the healthcare crisis, as the community transmission in the state appears to be a distinct reality soon.The PIL it is likely to come up for hearing on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disclose-identity-of-covid-19-patients-for-safety-of-others-pil-urges-hc/story-wiFrWxGSo4lYIM7mhvdppL.html

District magistrate (DM) Nawal Kishor Chaudhary on Thursday issued a notice of this effect.All private shops and business establishments would remain closed except pharmacies, shops selling grocery, milk, fruits, vegetables and meat, which can remain open from 6 am to 6 pm.At least 226 people in the district, including policemen, medicos and other officials, have tested positive so far.In Purnia town areas, a weeklong lockdown will be enforced from July 10. Purnia district has reported 347 Covid-19 cases so far, of which 50 were reported from town areas during the last one week.In Supaul, where Covid-19 cases have grown sharply during the last few days, the lockdown will be enforced from July 10 to July 12. The district has reported 316 cases so far. A three-day partial lockdown in Kishanganj ended on Thursday.In Nawada, a three-day lockdown will begin on July 10.In Darbhanga, district magistrate Thiyagrajan SM said any decision on lockdown will be taken on or after July 13. “In view of the weather forecast, which has predicted heavy rainfall from July 9 to 12, a lockdown would affect relief operations in case of a flood-like situation. Heavy rains are expected in the basins of river Kamala and Bagmati in neighbouring Nepal and adjoining plains in this part of region,” he said.Meanwhile, Muzaffarpur District Magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh, who chaired a meeting with district officials to assess the condition, said, “The decision on imposition of a lockdown will be taken at the right time.”He, however, asked the office-bearers of North Bihar Chambers of Commerce and Industries to open their establishments only between 10 am to 5 pm and remain closed on Saturdays and Sundays.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-more-districts-in-bihar-clamp-lockdown-to-contain-covid-19/story-57DAH8cjjJ9NsKbUEAcH9K.html

The present is not an adversarial litigation and it is the duty of the State to find shortcomings and lapses, wherever found, and to do the needful. The state cannot claim that unless the state is informed of the materials, it cannot reply or act”, the court said.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe SC bench, which also comprised justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MR Shah, asked the Maharashtra government to file a fresh affidavit giving details about migrants who are still awaiting return to their hometowns.The Maharashtra government had stated in its affidavit that none of the migrant workers left in the state were desirous of returning home since the resumption of economic activities provided them with employment opportunities.“Ask Maharashtra to file a proper affidavit. Your (Maharashtra) affidavit is adversarial. This is not an adversarial case,” justice MR Shah told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Maharashtra government. The case will now be taken up on July 17.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The case on migrant workers was initiated suo motu (on its own) by the top court on May 26, nearly two months after migrants’ exodus from cities began after clamping of a nationwide lockdown on March 25. The top court was initially reluctant to entertain petitions relating to the troubles faced by migrant workers. Hundreds of thousands of migrant workers, who had lost their jobs due to the lockdown, made frantic efforts to reach their home towns and villages from metro cities. Scores of them had set out on foot, to cover thousands of kilometers, in a bid to reach their homes. Many perished in road and rail accidents on the way and some others died of heart attack.In late April, the home ministry came up with a protocol to transport them by buses. Soon after, on May 1, the rail ministry announced special Shramik trains to carry them home. But the problems continued despite these measures, which eventually led to a suo motu case by the apex court.The court, on May 28, ordered state and central governments to adopt a slew of measures to alleviate the sufferings of the migrant labourers. The measures included free travel to home states, making provision for food and water and registration of migrant workers who are waiting to return home.During the hearing on Thursday, senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, representing the state of Bihar, pointed out that after the lockdown was lifted, the process of reverse migration had started with migrant labourers returning to the metros from their home states.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta had called it a healthy sign of reopening of the economy leading to job opportunities for migrant workers. “In their home states, they were not getting work as per their skills. Now they are returning (to cities) after the economy is opening. It is a healthy (sign)”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-s-response-on-migrants-issue-makes-sc-remind-state-of-duty/story-ZxMzzqgNoMOEdktTxscBiP.html

He also sent a copy of the complaint to the district superintendent of police.In his complaint, Srinivas said when he, along with MLAs and a couple of ministers, addressed a press conference a few weeks ago to question the MP’s anti-party activities, the latter had described them as a flock of pigs.“He has been trying to instigate groupism in the party by raising the caste bogey and creating law and order issues,” the MLA said.He requested the police to take action against Raghurama Krishnam Raju for abusing the party MLAs and tarnishing their prestige in public.Another senior YSRCP leader and state housing minister Ch Sriranganath Raju also filed a separate complaint with Poduru police station in his Achanta assembly constituency, demanding that a criminal prosecution be launched against the Narasapuram MP for his alleged derogatory comments against the party MLAs and ministers.Sriranganath Raju alleged that the MP had abused him and his son and described them as thieves and robbers.“This has hurt us a lot and damaged my reputation in public. Raghurama Krishnam Raju has been making wild allegations against us for his selfish political benefits,” the minister complained.A Similar complaint was lodged by YSRCP MLA from Narsapuram Mudunuri Prasada Raju with the local police.

Chances of multiple clusters forming in city regions and leading to superspread cannot be ruled out with the rising number of daily cases, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Thursday.“In Kerala, Poonthura is witnessing superspread of Covid-19. We have increased the number of testing and put in place strict measures,” the Kerala CM said.“We are going through a critical phase. We have to see whether we are edging close to community spread. A Covid-19 case in a fish market has spread to other areas leading to the imposition of triple lockdown in Thiruvananthapuram,” the chief minister added.Kerala has been witnessing a record surge in coronavirus cases over the last few days. On Thursday, the southern state added 339 new Covid-19 cases, another single-day spike and 149 recoveries were also reported.Of the fresh coronavirus cases, 117 people had returned from abroad, 74 had come from other states, and 133 contracted the viral disease through local contacts.As many as 149 people have recovered from the infection on Thursday and 2,795 people are under treatment.

The leader also tweeted before and after pictures of the railway station suggesting the neglect over the years without naming anyone.Representing Amethi since 1999, Rahul Gandhi lost to BJP’s Smriti Irani at the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Gandhi now represents the Wayanad constituency in Kerala. “A heartfelt thank you to Piyush Goyalji for bringing about a transformation in Amethi’s Gauriganj station which has been lying in neglect for years,” tweeted Irani in Hindi. वर्षों से जर्जर स्थिति और नागरिक सुविधाओं के अभाव में जूझ रहे अमेठी के गौरीगंज स्टेशन का कायाकल्प करने हेतु रेल मंत्री @PiyushGoyal जी का हार्दिक धन्यवाद।स्टेशन पर यात्रियों के लिए Wi-Fi, कोच जानकारी प्रणाली जैसी सुविधाओं के सफल कार्यान्वयन हेतु @drmlko25 जी के प्रति भी आभार। pic.twitter.com/ewzUPooRWzThe station also boasts of facilities like Wi-Fi, coach information system for passengers, she said.A railway project linking Amethi to Unchahar in Rae Bareli, conceived originally in the 80s when Amethi was represented by the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, is also something Smriti Irani is pushing hard at.The union minister, on her multiple visits to the constituency, has also discussed development of lesser known but locally important temples and sites.Right from her campaign time, Irani has been highlighting how Amethi despite being represented by Gandhi continues to lack in infrastructure and basic amenities. In April, just days after nationwide lockdown was imposed to check the spread of coronavirus, Rahul Gandhi sent 12,000 sanitisers, 20,000 face masks and 10,000 soaps for distribution among the people of Amethi.On his visit to Amethi in July 2019 days after the loss to Irani, Rahul said he would not abandon the UP constituency and would continue to visit it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/smriti-irani-s-before-after-pic-jab-as-railway-station-in-ameti-gets-makeover/story-RfV3hK2FxcVoyqzQGSH5zO.html

It will be put out in public domain soon,” said Rajesh Bhushan, an officer on special duty (OSD) at MoH&FW, during a press briefing.He also announced that a follow-up sero survey by ICMR was also being conducted.“There is another sero-prevalence study being planned by ICMR across India as a follow-up to its mid-April study. Besides, the data of at least 22,000 samples that were collected as part of the Delhi sero-prevalence survey between June 25 and July 5 across 11 districts by the state government and National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is being analysed in 15-odd laboratories of both Delhi and central governments,” Bhushan said.The blood samples are tested for detecting Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. Usually, the IgG antibodies start appearing after two weeks of the onset of the viral infection and last for several months even after a Covid-19 patient has recovered. The IgG test is not useful for detecting acute infection but indicates an episode of SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, according to experts. “Merely knowing the volume of people, who have been infected, will only provide a sense of the extent of the spread of the disease. However, what we must try to know is the quantity and quality of antibodies being produced against the virus. Also, for how long these antibodies stay in human blood in a bid to know if it’s enough to offer protection against the disease,” said Dr. Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology division, ICMR.ICMR is working towards making Covid-19 testing available even at a district level and in some states even at a block level in a bid to prevent the spread of the contagion.“We are focusing on the test, track, and treat approach for which we have to ensure that Covid-19 testing is accessible even at the grassroots level for early diagnosis. If we manage to detect the disease in its early stages, then the burden on our health infrastructure, especially hospitals, will be greatly reduced,” said Dr. Nivedita Gupta, scientist, epidemiology division, ICMR.ICMR has made the testing process smoother by waiving off the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) certificate for a private laboratory while applying for approval to conduct Covid-19 tests.“We are allowing even those laboratories that have applied for NABL certification to seek ICMR validation for Covid-19 testing. However, these laboratories will be given a month’s time for obtaining the certificate and to submit it to ICMR,” said Dr. Gupta.Bhushan seeks to ensure that the country’s healthcare infrastructure isn’t unduly burdened amid a widening gulf between Covid-19 active and recovered cases.At present, India has 3,914 dedicated Covid-19 facilities complete with 3,77,737 isolation beds (without intensive care unit, or ICU, support), 39,820 ICU beds, and 1,42,415 oxygen-supported beds along with 20,047 ventillators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/some-localised-outbreaks-but-no-community-transmission-yet-govt/story-GN3IiC7rpRM3T2A1h9b0VJ.html

As a precautionary measure administration has cautioned villagers and slum dwellers residing near the river and asked them to stay away from it during the rainy season.Additional police personnel and city patrol unit (CPU) were deployed at water logged intersections and highway points to divert and manage traffic. Traffic snarls were reported for over two hours from various parts of the city.Haridwar Mayor Anita Sharma has blamed local legislator and urban development minister Madan Kaushik for not cooperating with her in providing a long term solution of water logging in the city.“For the past 20 years he (Kaushik) has been the local legislator. He is also the urban development cabinet minister but the water logging problem has still not been solved. Owing to political interests, the BJP government has been ignoring my suggestions and proposals in this regard,” said Sharma.Denying the mayor’s charges, Kaushik said that already work has started under Amrit Yojana to provide a permanent solution to water logging at Chandracharya square, the busiest square of Haridwar.Meanwhile, in Pauri Garhwal, 11 village roads were blocked due to landslides triggered by rainfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-braces-for-wet-spell-after-met-office-sounds-rain-alert/story-PShgn9XTzh0fhXB3POkkpI.html

09-07-2020||India||Main accused in Kerala gold smuggling racket moves HC for anticipatory bail||The ruling CPI(M) in Kerala on Thursday asked the Union Government to speed up the probe into the gold smuggling racket even as the main accused Swapna Suresh moved the High Court for anticipatory bail.“Some people are creating a smoke screen to target the state government. We have nothing to hide. The CM had sent a letter to the Prime Minister saying the state is ready for any probe. But it is getting delayed. We suspect delay is aimed at embarrassing the government,” said LDF convenor V S Vijayaraghavan.He said the state has scaled many heights in the fight against the Covoid-19 pandemic and the opposition Congress and BJP were worried over its growing popularity.The Customs department had seized 30 kg gold from an air cargo consignment from the United Arab Emirates to the country’s consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on Sunday. Swapna Suresh, who was working as the operational manager of the Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited under the state IT Ministry, had gone underground after the seizure. Later the CM had transferred his principal secretary M Sivasankar who was close to Suresh.Amid the controversy Suresh sent an audio tape to a news channel on Thursday claiming that there was a concerted move to target the government ahead of the assembly elections next year and she had been made a scapegoat. She also claimed that she made a call to the Customs to release the consignment after she was asked by the UAE consular office. She also said she feared for her life.Despite the CPI(M) and coalition rallying around the CM many party insiders say the latest incident has dented the image of the government when the elections are just 10 months away. The case has surfaced at a bad time for chief minister Vijayan who is known for his tough postures. Many political pundits had predicted an easy re-election fuelled by records in fighting the pandemic.Since the 1970s, no government has returned to power for a second successive term in Kerala but Vijayan was tipped to break that record until the gold smuggling racket blew up leading analysts to draw parallel with the 2013 solar scandal in which a woman allegedly cheated many by flaunting her connections.“If something serious happens in his office the CM is responsible for this,” Vijayan’s words during the solar scandal, has returned to haunt him. Social media activists have gone on overdrive reproducing some of his fiery speeches cornering his predecessor Oommen Chandy.“This has a familiar ring to the solar scandal that routed the ruling UDF in 2016. A scandal is a scandal and whether there is substance in the allegations is electorally irrelevant. That is the history of the state,” said senior journalist and political observer John Mary. Some of the allies of ruling dispensation have started airing their displeasure against the way Vijayan protected former principal secretary M Sivasankar. Junior partner the CPI said it warned him about the “freestyle” of his secretary several times but the CM ignored them.

09-07-2020||India||Incessant rains prevent Nepalese pensioners from visiting Indian banks||Incessant rains in the high altitudes of far-western Nepal caused further inconvenience for Nepalese nationals in drawing their monthly pensions from the bordering town of Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh district, as they have not been deprived of the facility since end-March because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, an official said. On Thursday, only 132 Nepalese nationals could draw their monthly pension from Pithoragarh district, he added. Entry points and bridges on the Indo-Nepal border at Jhulaghat, Jauljibi and Dharchula areas of Pithoragarh district have been opened for three days from Wednesday amid the Covid-19 outbreak. Around 2,000, 700 and 800 Nepalese nationals from Kanchanpur, Baitadi and Darchula districts, respectively, from far-western Nepal, have not been able to withdraw their monthly pensions after the Indo-Nepal border check-post was sealed because of the lockdown restrictions, which were imposed in Uttarakhand on March 22 to contain the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak. Earlier, the Nepalese nationals had demanded the Indian authorities for the opening of the international border check-post in a bid to withdraw their pending monthly pensions from the Indian banks amid their deepening financial woes and acute cash crunch.On Wednesday, incessant rains prevented many Nepalese pensioners from visiting Pithoragarh district, even though the border check-post is opened from Wednesday till Friday.Official data showed that 86 and 51 Nepalese pensioners visited banks at Jhulaghat and Dharchula, respectively, on Wednesday to withdraw their monthly pensions, while nobody turned up at Jauljibi area because of heavy rainfall.Nepalese pensioners are allowed to enter India only after they produce a medical certificate declaring them Covid-19 negative at the international border check-post, officials said. “I had to obtain a fitness certificate from Dasharathchanda, the headquarters of the Baitadi district. I could only enter India after I showed the certificate and underwent a thermal screening at the border check-post,” said Mahadev Bhatt (62), a pensioner and a resident of Baitadi district in far-western Nepal.The monsoon fury makes it an arduous trek to India for the Nepalese pensioners, who have a tough time to make the journey amid negotiating gushing mountain streams and overflowing nullahs that are swollen due to incessant rains.“Most senior citizens are avoiding the journey to India because it has become doubly risky to travel to their respective district headquarters for obtaining the fitness certificate and then visit an Indian bank in Jhulaghat to withdraw the monthly pension,” said Prem Chand, a Nepalese pensioner’s son, who accompanied his elderly father to Pithoragarh district.Some of the veteran ex-servicemen pensioners were carried on backs by their sons on Thursday, as they are too weak to walk.Jhulaghat market was shut on Wednesday in the wake of the Nepalese nationals’ arrival amid fear of a community transmission following a spike in Covid-19 positive cases in some districts in far-western Nepal.“Jhulaghat market was shut down on Wednesday amid fears of Covid-19 pandemic that’s spreading in far-western Nepal and the arrival of Nepalese nationals. So far, Baitadi district has reported 239 Covid-19 positive cases,” said Pramod Bhatt, who owns a mobile phone shop in the market.Kamlesh Joshi, the bank manager at State Bank of India’s Jhulaghat branch, said: “132 Nepalese pensioners withdrew their monthly pension till 2 pm on Thursday. Wearing of masks and maintaining of social distancing is our priority. The bank premises were sanitised on Wednesday, as a precautionary measure.”Dhan Singh (78), a Nepalese national, died on Wednesday evening after withdrawing his monthly pension. He was suffering from asthma, his son had told the police. Singh died on the Indian side of the border check-post on his way back home. Later, his body was handed over to the Nepalese authorities, the police added. Nepalese are recruited in the Indian Army as per 1950 Indo-Nepal Treaty.The Nepal government allows its citizens to serve in Indian Armed forces and in return India permits Nepalese to work anywhere in the country, except the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), in accordance with the treaty.Many Nepalese nationals serve in the Indian Army and after retirement they return to their respective native places in Nepal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/incessant-rains-prevent-nepalese-pensioners-from-visiting-indian-banks/story-o86G0Go8xg0XoMqDC2Jf0K.html

Dubey, who was spotted a day ago at a hotel near Faridabad, turned up at Ujjain’s Mahakal temple when he was reportedly identified by the temple guard who informed the police. Upon arrest, the notorious criminal, in dramatic fashion, yelled “main Vikas Dubey Hoon, Kanpur wala”, promoting the policeman standing behind him to thwack him on the head, while other policemen around him were seen guarding him. The criminal, who has 60 criminal cases against him, has been on the run since last Friday after allegedly killing eight policemen in an ambush who had gone to arrest him. He was finally arrested in Madhya Pradesh. Here are the top 10 developments in the story:* Vikas Dubey was arrested outside a temple in the pilgrimage city of Ujjain on Thursday after purchasing prasad and an entry ticket to the shrine. However, temple sources, according to PTI, say Dubey reached the temple gate in the morning and purchased a Rs 250 ticket from a counter near the police post. When he went to a nearby shop to buy prasad for the deity, the shop owner identified him and alerted police. Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra said two of Dubey’s associates were also arrested.* Dubey will be brought to Uttar Pradesh on a transit remand. “Our campaign against all those involved in the Kanpur case will continue till not even a single member of the Dubey gang is left,” said UP ADG, Law and Order, Prashant Kumar. A police team, led by the investigation officer (IO) in the case from Kanpur, will reach Ujjain as soon as possible to bring Dubey to the state, the officer added.* Asked whether it was a joint operation of the Madhya Pradesh police and Uttar Pradesh police, The Uttar Pradesh top cop said, “No, our team was not there.” * Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan tweeted, “Those who feel that after going to the Mahakal temple, their sins will be wiped out, they do not know about the Mahakal. Our government will not spare any criminals.” Chouhan said he spoke to his UP counterpart Yogi Adityanath after the arrest.* Dubey’s mother Sarla Devi said that her son is with the Samajwadi Party, a claim denied by the party. On being asked what should be done by the government after her son’s arrest, Sarla Devi said, “The government should do whatever it feels appropriate (sarkar jo uchit samjhe, woh kare).”“At this time, he is not in the BJP, he is with the SP,” she told reporters.* Two more aides of Dubey were gunned down in separate encounters in Uttar Pradesh today, police said. * Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has sought a Central Bureau of Investigation probe in gangster Vikas Dubey’s case, raising questions over grant of “protection” to him.* Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav asked the Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday to clarify whether it was a “surrender” or an “arrest”.* The UP administration bulldozed Dubey’s house and his cars and launched a massive hunt for him. Over the last week, five of Dubey’s accomplices were killed. * Eight policemen, including a deputy superintendent of police, were ambushed in Bikru village in the Chaubeypur area of Kanpur, where they had gone to arrest Vikas Dubey and fell to bullets fired from rooftops last Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vikas-dubey-s-dramatic-run-from-up-ends-at-madhya-pradesh-temple-10-points/story-jgnUYrqTLJ0Cixt6ynDXtM.html

We are keeping abreast with the information coming from WHO headquarters on this aspect,” Rajesh Bhushan, OSD, Ministry of Health said.The WHO had initially maintained that the SARS-CoV2 primarily spreads through droplets expelled from the nose and mouth of an infected person that quickly sink to the ground.But in an open letter to the WHO, published on Monday in the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal, 239 scientists in 32 countries outlined evidence that they claim shows floating virus particles can infect people who breathe them in. The scientists gave urged the WHO to update its Covid-19 guidance because the smaller particles can linger in the air.Despite a surge in new cases of Covid-19, India has maintained that there is no community transmission of the disease yet.“World Health Organization (WHO) has also not provided any standard definition of the localised outbreak and community transmission. They have given its member states the right to report after assessing the local conditions,” Bhushan said.India’s Covid-19 tally on March 25 when the lockdown began stood at 618 including 562 active cases. In the next three and a half month, the tally has risen to over 7.67 lakh including 4.76 lakh recovered cases, 2.7 lakh active cases and over 21,000 casualties. While the Centre insists that there is no community transmission of the disease, the Assam government on July 5 conceded that community spread of Covid-19 has taken place in the state’s biggest city, Guwahati and the rest of Kamrup Metro district and the ongoing total lockdown to control the pandemic might be extended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-a-dynamic-and-evolving-situation-says-health-ministry/story-TSOxyUPRDECTwqOaDsf0xN.html

District collectors have already been empowered to take over wards, rooms and blocks and if necessary, entire hospitals in the private sector, based on the requirement.The government has instructed private hospitals to start isolated rooms, wards and blocks to treat suspected Covid-19 cases duly following safety measures. The allocation of beds will be monitored by the respective district administrations to ensure optimal usage of resources.Accordingly, the state government has classified all private hospitals into three categories: exclusive Covid-19 hospitals which will treat only Covid-19 patients, Covid-19 and Non-Covid-19 hospitals which can cater to both types of patients with separate facilities for Covid-19 patients and non-Covid-19 hospitals which will be allowed only to treat non-Covid-19 patients.The hospital management is responsible for transferring the normal patients to Covid-19 hospitals, if they develop any symptoms of the viral disease.The order further fixed the rates to be charged by the private hospitals for Covid-19 patients. For patients who have mild symptoms for Covid-19 with no abnormality, they would be charged a fee of Rs 3,250 per day. For critical care patients who need treatment in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) but without ventilator, the fee would be Rs 5,480 per day.For patients, who are admitted to ICU with oxygen support, the hospitals can charge Rs 5,980 per day. Those who are put on ventilator support in the ICU, the charges will be Rs 9,580; for patients with Sepsis the charges are Rs 6,280 without ventilator and Rs 10,380 with ventilator.“If the patient falls under the Dr YSR Arogyasri scheme, the treatment will be free and the government will reimburse the fee as per the fixed rates to the hospital management. Those who do not fall under the scheme will have to pay the charges as fixed by the government,” the special chief secretary said in the order.If the non-critical Covid-19 patient prefers to stay in a private room, the private hospitals can charge an additional amount of Rs 600 apart from the price fixed for non-critical Covid-19 cases.The government instructed that no patient who requires immediate medical attention can be turned away by any hospital and treatment should be administered without waiting for the results of the Covid-19 test. “Until the patient tests negative, he/she should be treated as a Covid-19 case,” the order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-patients-below-poverty-line-to-get-free-treatment-in-andhra-s-private-hospitals/story-8wDmXSMI95HDZvrJTakhBJ.html

The block is located about 20 kilometres (km) from Almora town, the district headquarters, in the hill state’s Kumaon region.Earlier on Tuesday, state forest department officials had declared the leopard a “man-eater” after it claimed five lives in the area.Sanchita Verma, range officer, Almora, said, Anandi Devi (70), wife of late Hari Ram of Petshaal village, had gone missing since Tuesday evening. Her half-eaten body was found by villagers around 100 metres away from her house the following evening. “She used to live alone, as her husband had passed away. Forest officials reached the spot after the villagers informed them and took the body in their possession. Later, the body was handed over to her relatives after an autopsy was done, ” Verma said.Petshaal village is located 15 km away from Almora town.“We have installed a cage in Petshaal village and deployed forest officials there to catch the man-eater leopard. Two cages have also been set up in Udal village,” she saidShooter Shaifi Ashif from Bijnore in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh reached Almora on Wednesday evening at the invitation of the state forest department officials and a hunt has been launched for the man-eater leopard.A delegation of local Congress workers has handed over a memorandum to Nitin Singh Bhadauria, district magistrate (DM), Almora, urging him to pass it on to Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat.The memorandum has demanded an immediate elimination of the man-eater leopard from the Bhaisiyachhana block of Almora district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-after-18-month-old-baby-leopard-now-kills-elderly-woman-in-same-area/story-Kbj17MxU58IFMzTcwQcfGP.html
09-07-2020||India||Harish Rawat has bounced back in Uttarakhand politics with lockdown protests, say experts, BJP calls it show off||Former Uttarakhand chief minister and party national general secretary Harish Rawat has held several protests against the BJP-led Central and state governments in the past two months, marking the party’s presence in the state. In the past few days, Rawat has held at least three individual protests including the bullock cart rally, sit-in demonstration near the Governor’s house and a rally over the fuel price hike issue. All these were held after he came out of home quarantine followed by a visit to Delhi amid the pandemic. Believing that Rawat had managed to build a momentum in favour of the party, the top leadership of the Congress asked him earlier this week to guide the party to victory in 2022 state Assembly elections. Rawat assured the party leadership including state unit president Pritam Singh and leader of opposition Indira Hridayesh of contributing fully for the stated party cause. Also Read: Uttarakhand CM says state won’t use Chinese equipment and devices in govt projectsRawat said the party needed to pull together under Pritam Singh’s leadership to defeat the BJP, “I am ready to be present for the party wherever and whenever it needs me. We all have to put our differences to rest by sitting together and resolving them. Then only we can fight BJP in the state.”Indira Hridayesh said Rawat’s position as a senior leader in the state was an important factor, “We all have to leave our differences behind with the sole motive of defeating the BJP in the 2022 elections. We all asked Rawat to guide the party towards that goal as he is a senior leader.”Political experts believe Rawat has played his hand well to remind the party of his importance in Uttarakhand politics. “Rawat is a very well seasoned politician. He knows when to play which card as he, too, is aware of his importance in the state Congress and Uttarakhand’s politics,” said MM Semwal, political expert and professor of political science at Garhwal Central University in Srinagar, Pauri Garhwal,Also Read: Uttarakhand fixes distance for setting up of stone crusher, hot-mix plants near Ganga, other riversHe added that Rawat’s individual protests refurbished his image of a leader with political heft and acumen.“With the individual protests away from the party line, he was very successful in getting all the limelight and bringing Congress back into focus. It was evident from the fact that many top leaders of the ruling BJP had to come forward to counter him as they know him to be clever,” said Semwal. Semwal claimed that Harish Rawat had reminded the Congress that his popularity, both in Garhwal and Kumaon regions of the state, made him difficult to sideline despite the loss in the last elections. He added that “Rawat definitely has his eyes set on fighting 2022 elections.”The BJP however, took a dig at the developments in the state Congress and brushed it off as mere “show-off”.“They are showing unity because they have been given a dose on the issue from their national leadership. Having said that, no matter what they do, we have a very strong worker base in every booth of the state which Congress can’t match,” said Bansidhar Bhagat, BJP state president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harish-rawat-has-bounced-back-in-uttarakhand-politics-with-lockdown-protests-say-experts-bjp-calls-it-show-off/story-rC6OA3BDmE1zO7ZnvRzo2H.html

09-07-2020||India||India, China diplomats to meet on Ladakh stand-off tomorrow to expedite pullback||India and China will on Friday discuss ways to build on the disengagement process that was started this week after the conversation between National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, people familiar with the development said. Friday’s meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on Indo-China Border Affairs (WMCC) is the first formal interaction at a diplomatic level after the Doval-Wang icebreaker video call on Sunday on the Ladakh stand-off. The WMCC, set up in 2012 to address tensions along the Line of Actual Control, is headed by Naveen Srivastava, the joint secretary (East Asia) in the external affairs ministry, and Wu Jianghao, director general in the Chinese foreign ministry.Naveen Srivastava and Wu Jianghao had their last meeting on June 24 when they concurred that the two sides need to quickly implement disengagement and de-escalation steps agreed on by senior military commanders. But this agreement did not lead to any change in the ground situation and a belligerent Beijing continued to attempt to amp up pressure on India, accusing New Delhi of violating bilateral agreements and provoking the June 15 clash in Galwan Valley that led to casualties on both sides.Also Read: At top panel meet on China border, India reviews troop pullback and possible red flagsGovernment sources told Hindustan Times that Friday’s meeting was being held under different circumstances, largely on account of the seven-hour-long video call between Doval and Wang. The two leaders had agreed that diplomatic and military officials would continue discussions at their level including under the WMCC framework.Doval and Wang are expected to touch base in another 2-3 weeks to review the progress made on the ground.For now, the Chinese troops have pulled back about 1.5 km at the Galwan valley standoff point - also the site of the June 15 violent scrap - where they were at a clear disadvantage. India was in control of the heights at this location while the Chinese People’s Liberation Army soldiers had been camping near the Galwan river bank. At one point, their camps were also flooded due to a rise in the water level.“The PLA made a virtue out of necessity,” an army commander said, underlining that the PLA’s position in Galwan Galwan valley had been untenable. At the other two standoff points in the Galwan region - Hot Springs and Gogra - the process of disengagement is in progress but is proceeding at a slow pace.The thinning out of Chinese soldiers is, however, the slowest around the fourth standoff point near Pangong Tso, the saltwater glacial lake spread across 700 sq km.Beijing, which has been facing pressure on other fronts including the South China Sea, stressed that the “situation along the border is stable and improving.The two sides will continue dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels including by holding (a) meeting of the WMMC on border affairs,” foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian told a news conference on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-diplomats-to-meet-on-ladakh-stand-off-tomorrow-to-expedite-pullback/story-m5pwHrTMxKycWzCd4w2KMM.html

Despite a population of 1.3 billion people, India has been able to manage Covid-19 relatively well. If you look at cases per million populations, it still remains amongst the lowest in the world,” Rajesh Bhushan, OSD, Ministry of Health said.Amid a sudden surge in coronavirus patients across states over the last few weeks, the country’s viral caseload is an estimated 2,69,000 people. “When we talk of the caseload of Covid-19 in India, it is 2,69,000 people. This tells us that at the end of the day we’ve managed a situation where our health care infrastructure is not unduly burdened and is not creaking due to the pressure,” Bhushan said.ALSO READ | India’s pharma industry an asset for entire world, says PM Narendra ModiCurrently, India has 538 cases per million population, which is as per the World Health Organization’s situation report. Cases per million population in some countries are at least 16-17 times more than what it is in India. The country has 15 deaths per million population whereas there are countries where it is 40 times as much, the health ministry data indicated.“The number of Covid-19 tests has increased, on an average, we are testing more than 2.6 lakh samples per day. We hope to see a further rise by the use of the antigen test,” ICMR’s senior scientist Nivedita Gupta said.About 10 per cent of India’s population (60 years and above) accounts for 53 per cent of the country’s Covid-19 related deaths, the health ministry official said.National capital Delhi which recently crossed the 1 lakh mark of Covid-19 cases has showed remarkable improvement, with a recovery rate of over 72 per cent, according to the ministry’s latest data.

09-07-2020||India||Uttarakhand CM says state won’t use Chinese equipment and devices in govt projects||Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Thursday weighed in on the India-China border stand-off and announced that the state government would refrain from using any Chinese equipment and devices in state-run projects, while lavishing praise on the Central government’s Atmanirbhar or self-reliant programme that seeks to tide over the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced economic distress.Rawat made the announcement during a press conference in the state secretariat in Dehradun while replying to a question from a media person on stopping Chinese involvement in government projects amid the growing boycott Chinese goods call following a violent clash between India and China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops in eastern Ladakh on June 15.The incident had occurred in Galwan Valley along the disputed Line of Actual Control (LAC) that left 20 Indian soldiers dead.“Our government had discussed this issue a few days ago. We have decided not to use Chinese equipment and devices in any manner in our projects,” said Rawat.The CM’s announcement came days after state tourism minister Satpal Maharaj had said that his department would reconsider all projects that have had Chinese involvement or raw materials are sourced from China.Earlier, the hill state’s pharmaceutical industry had cautioned against the boycott Chinese goods call while drawing the state government’s attention to an overwhelming dependence on China for sourcing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for manufacturing life-saving drugs.It had warned that a boycott call could lead to an acute shortage of several drugs.The sector has urged the state government to work out an alternative strategy before implementing a blanket ban on Chinese raw materials.Earlier during the press conference, CM Rawat addressed the media persons on the steps taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government to make the country Atmanirbhar or self-reliant.“To revive the economy affected by the pandemic, PM Modi in a significant move has announced a stimulus package of Rs 20 lakh crore for various sectors. It will be very helpful in not only boosting the economy but also generating employment in the country,” said Rawat.Citing the “major” steps taken in the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector, he said, “The Centre has focussed on the MSME sector. It is one sector, where employment could be provided to a significant number of people for a small investment. One major step in it was the announcement of the Centre on granting of loans without any guarantee for four years. It is a big gift for those, who are associated with the sector.”The CM also lauded the Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Yojana.“About 80 crore people have benefitted from the scheme under which each intended beneficiary is being provided with a monthly free ration of five kilograms (kg) of rice and one kg dal. Senior citizens were given three months pension in advance in a bid to ensure that they don’t face any difficulties during the Covid-19-induced lockdown restrictions.”The CM also heaped praise on the Centre’s Agriculture Infrastructure Fund worth Rs 1 lakh crore in a bid to boost the country’s farm sector, including an uptick of minimum support price (MSP) for crops by at least one and a half times. He also justified the government’s move of desisting from direct cash transfer but a raft of schemes and programmes in a bid to generate self-employment.“Our government doesn’t believe in giving an egg to a needy for a day, but a hen for him to have eggs throughout the year. Cash will run out after a while, but schemes will help him earn a livelihood for long,” he said.However, the opposition Congress took a potshot at the CM and punctured holes in his airy-fairy claims. “Measures that have been taken to boost the economy and help the public during the lockdown restrictions and the raging Covid-19 pandemic are plain lies. The ground reality is vastly different, as no green shoots of government’s measures are visible,” said Suryakant Dhasmana, the party’s state vice-president.“Atmanirbhar is a farce. It has left the public to fend for themselves and their own devices,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-cm-says-state-won-t-use-chinese-equipment-and-devices-in-govt-projects/story-0M9Df65EC3TEDiBbZiCMQN.html

Police said that two men were involved in the attack on the trio in their shop which is on the ground floor of their house close to the Bandipore police station.Inspector General of Police, Kashmir Range, Vijay Kumar who visited the spot along with senior police and army officers and later examined the CCTV footage of the incident said the attack was pre-planned and the BJP leader was killed inside the shop as the militant had fired on him from a very close range. “The Laskhar group is behind this killing and the attack was carried by a local militant, Abid and a foreigner. One militant targeted him while the other was giving directions.’’Kumar said Bari had returned to his house after visiting his in-laws house. He later went downstairs to the shop where his father and brother were already present. The personal security officers (PSOs) of the three men then went to their room. “One terrorist walked into the shop and shot the three men from close range. All three were shot in their heads.” IG Kumar said that after watching the CCTV footage along with senior army and the CRPF officials they have come to the conclusion that Bari was being followed. “When he had left his house early in the evening for his in-laws house, a person could be seen in the CCTV footage and when he returned, the same person was there. It was a planned attack. We have identified the militants and they will be neutralized very soon.’’Kumar said that the entire incident was recorded in the CCTV cameras installed in the police station which is close to the place where the BJP leader was killed. ‘’Bari had 10 PSO’s (eight from district police and two from security wing) which is more than enough. Even if two of his PSO’s had remained with him they would have killed the militants. All the PSO were suspended yesterday and arrested. They will be dismissed from their services for this security lapse.BJP state president, Ravendra Raina and general secretary Ashok Koul visited the house of Bari and paid condolences with the family members of the BJP leader. Bari, his father and brother were laid to rest close to their house in the afternoon amid tight security in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-police-say-let-terrorists-stalked-bjp-leader-before-killing-him/story-Vdd0T5MkXUhiXVIBTkRJFM.html

His purpose was tourism, so he was asked for the standard requirements by the Himachal Pradesh government -- a within 72 hrs Covid 19 negative test and a 5-days advance booking at a hotel. Those things were not with him,” news agency ANI quoted the Kangra SP as saying.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesEarlier this month, the Himachal Pradesh government opened up the gates of the state for tourists after three months of ban while making their entry incumbent on a set of standard operating procedures that have laid out the conditions for tourists’ movement in the state.The conditions set by the state tourism department include a Coved 19 free certificate issued not more than 72 hours ago by an ICMR accredited laboratory and an advance hotel booking for at least five days. Only a handful of tourists have entered the state ever since the restrictions were lifted.The credentials of tourists are being checked at the border checkpoints connecting neighbouring states. Kangra SP Vimukt Ranjan said the Chinese national had been detained and put into an institutional quarantine facility. He added that the Chinese tourist had also not registered himself with the tourism site of the state.“He had not registered himself with the tourism site of the Himachal Pradesh government. So we detained him there and put him in institutional quarantine. Today we’re getting him tested. Further action will be taken as per the report of the Covid-19 test,” said Ranjan.Also Read: Border situation ‘improving’, next round of meeting soon, says ChinaThe detention of the Chinese national comes close on the heels of a three month long border stand-off between the two countries in eastern Ladakh sector that resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers in violent clashes with the Chinese PLA.

09-07-2020||India||Congress tweets video, says it shows Vikas Dubey’s arrest is scripted||Vikas Dubey, the Kanpur gangster on the run after he killed eight Uttar Pradesh policemen trying to arrest him on July 3, turned up at Ujjain’s Mahakal temple in Madhya Pradesh early on Thursday morning. Dubey, 48, is reported to have been spotted by the temple’s private security guard who called the police. He was arrested by Ujjain police and the Uttar Pradesh police informed.The Madhya Pradesh government rushed to take credit for the arrest. “Those who think their sins will wash away by going to Mahakal, they have not understood the Lord. Our government won’t spare any criminal,” Chief Minister Shivraj Chouhan tweeted, praising Ujjain Police for the breakthrough.The pushback from opposition parties in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi came soon after. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav tweeted the first shot, asking the government to clarify if his arrest was a surrender or an arrest. He also asked the Yogi Adityanath government to make his phone records public so that people who had collaborated with the gangster could be exposed.Also Watch l Vikas Dubey arrested: Watch what Priyanka Gandhi & Akhilesh Yadav said Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra had told reporters that Vikas Dubey was arrested by the police after the Ujjain police received a tip-off. He also told television channels that his government had told the police across Madhya Pradesh to stay on “alert mode” right after the July 3 ambush in Kanpur, over 650 km away.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said Vikas Dubey’s arrest reflected that the UP police had “completely failed” to act with alacrity. “Despite an alert, the gangster reaching Ujjain exposes the chinks in security and points to collusion,” she said in a tweet in Hindi. Gandhi also referred to reports that local police officers in Kanpur haad kept Vikas Dubey’s name out of the list of most wanted criminals to allege collusion.The harshest attack on the MP government, however, came from Srinivas BV, the Indian Youth Congress, who spotlighted a video circulating on social media that showed Vikas Dubey walking out of the temple barefooted, the private security guard walking along with him. “From what angle does it appear that this terrorist Vikas Dubey has been arrested by the police. This was scripted. This video is the proof,” he said.इस वीडियो में कौनसे ऐंगल से आतंकवादी विकास दुबे को उज्जैन पुलिस ने 'गिरफ्तार' किया है ?सब कुछ स्क्रिप्टेड था, ये वीडियो गवाही है । pic.twitter.com/cSF6FfN5BWThere has been no word on who shot this video. Or the one in which Vikas Dubey is heard telling policemen that “I am Vikas Dubey, from Kanpur” before a policeman slaps him on the head.Srinivas, responding to home minister Narottam Mishra’s statement about the MP police being on alert, called it a “good joke”.The police were so alert that Vikas had to shout to identify himself. “That is when the police got to know that Uttar Pradesh’s Vikas had appeared in Madhya Pradesh,” Srinivas tweeted.Congress leaders also asked how Vikas Dubey travelled from Kanpur to Faridabad near Delhi and then to Ujjain when the borders were sealed and the police were on alert. Did Vikas turn into ‘Mr India’ to reach Ujjain,” he said, a reference to Anil Kumar-starrer movie from the 1980s where the superhero could turn invisible at will.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arrest-or-surrender-congress-takes-a-swipe-at-bjp-with-a-video-of-vikas-dubey/story-kHxQWF4FFwmS0Uvowb7VZL.html

We are laying a red carpet for all global companies to come and establish their presence in India. Very few countries will offer the kind of opportunities India does today,” PM was quoted as having said at the virtual meet by news agency ANI.The India Global Week 2020 is themed, ‘Be The Revival: India and a Better New World’ and the event boasts of 5,000 global participants from 30 countries including 250 global speakers participating in 75 sessions.While India’s the currently placed number three globally among countries that have registered the most number of coronavirus cases, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said far from letting the disease overwhelm it, India was focused equally on defeating the pandemic and releasing the economy from its throes.Watch: ‘India will play leading role in global revival’: PM Modi at India Global Week“Indians are natural reformers. History shows that India has overcome every challenge be it social or economic. On one hand India is fighting a strong battle against the global pandemic with an increased focus on people’s health (on the other), we are equally focussed on the health of the economy,” he was quoted as saying by ANI at the meet.The PM’s pitch came at the global meet organised by the business fraternity which has brought together global thought leaders and captains of industry to discuss opportunities in India as well as the global economic revival in the post-Covid era, the prime minister’s office had said yesterday.Prime Minister Narendra Modi built further on the theme by highlighting that India’s pharma industry was proving to be an asset not just for India but for the entire world during these challenging times by producing life saving drugs at a reduced cost, especially for developing countries.“When India talks of revival it’s revival with care, with compassion, which is sustainable both for the environment and economy. Indians have the spirit to achieve what is believed to be impossible. No wonder that in India, we are already seeing green-shoots of economic recovery,” he added.Watch: ‘Varanasi can emerge as a centre of ‘self-reliant India’: PM ModiExternal affairs minister S Jaishankar, commerce and railway minister Piyush Goyal, UK’s foreign secretary Dominic Raab, home secretary Priti Patel, and US ambassador to India Ken Juster are some of the other important leaders participating in the three-day long event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-reconciles-india-s-call-for-investments-with-message-of-self-reliance-at-india-global-week/story-FbGrt10dKXlNCynoZTFOWN.html

He also directed that detailed planning for such large scale vaccination should be undertaken immediately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-pharma-industry-an-asset-for-entire-world-says-pm-narendra-modi/story-dJ9YC7BNzAMsTArJsASssK.html
09-07-2020||India||SC pulls up Maharashtra govt for claiming everything fine on migrant workers’ issue||The Supreme Court Thursday pulled up the Maharashtra government on the migrant workers issue and refused to accept its claim that there was no problem in the state on this front, saying it is its duty to find out the lapses and act on them.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, S K Kaul and M R Shah asked the state to file a fresh affidavit listing the steps taken to mitigate the problems of migrant workers wanting to return to their native places amid the Covid-19 crisis.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIt is not an adversarial litigation, the bench said, posting the matter for further hearing on July 17.During the hearing of the case taken up suo motu (on its own) by the top court on the miseries of migrant workers during the Covid-19 lockdown, the bench said: “What is happening in Maharashtra? Large number of migrant workers are still in the state.” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the state, said that the latest affidavit has been filed on July 6 in compliance with the apex court’s order.He said that a list was provided to the Centre with regard to migrant workers, who have been sent to their native places by the state.Mehta said the crux of the affidavit was that the migrants who wanted to leave earlier have now decided to stay back as the state opened up employment opportunities and since May 1, around 3,50,000 workers came back to work in Maharashtra again.The bench said it is the responsibility of the state to find out which group of migrants are getting food, transport and other facilities or not getting them.Mehta said that whoever wanted to shift has been shifted and those who went back may not be getting jobs as per their skills, like a carpenter cannot work as a labourer in an agricultural field.“Your affidavit is not up to the mark... We cannot accept the State’s claim that there is no problem in the State of Maharashtra. They have treated this as an adversarial litigation. You (Mehta) must advise them to file a proper affidavit by next date of hearing,” the bench said.Mehta said he would do so and personally do the vetting of the State’s affidavit and ensure that more relevant details are provided on the issue.Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, appearing for Bihar government said that reverse migration has started happening in the state and most of the trains originating from Patna to other cities are running full. Mehta said that this is a healthy thing as the reverse migration is happening because industries and business are now opening up.Meanwhile, the top court tagged the PIL filed by NGO CPIL, seeking various reliefs including a national plan on Covid-19 management with the suo motu case.During the hearing of the PIL, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said that there is a theoretical national plan on Covid-19 management and want that Solicitor General Tushar Mehta place it on record. Mehta said that the national plan for Covid-19 management as averred for in the PIL filed by Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL) has already been placed on record in other matter.The bench accepted the contention of Mehta and told Sibal that this issue has come up earlier also and now they have placed the plan on record.Sibal said that they need a system in place which are in consonance with the Statutes, in this case it is a national plan.The bench asked Mehta to supply the copy of the Covid management plan to Sibal and senior advocate A M Singhvi, appearing in the matter.Singhvi added that he wanted to give some suggestions that help and rehabilitation should work in tandem and registration should not be the basis for availing government schemes as it excludes lots of people.He said that government can consider a constructive scheme for insurance for migrants and a work plan and centralised system to rehabilitate the migrants.Mehta told Singhvi that he should go through the reply affidavit as it contains all the relevant details.The bench posted the matter for further hearing on July 17.On June 19, the top court had asked the Centre and all the State to ensure that all stranded migrant workers willing to return must be sent to their native places without any fare being charged from them.The top court, on June 9 had directed the Centre and state governments to identify and send back within 15 days by train or bus the stranded migrant workers willing to return to their native place, and also asked them to help the returnees find jobs lost during the national lockdown.Noting there have been instances of “excess” by police and paramilitary personnel against the migrant workers, the court also asked authorities to consider “withdrawal” of criminal cases against some of them for violating social distancing norms. The suffering people without jobs have to be dealt with in a “humane manner”, it had said.A help desk should be set up for those who wanted to return to their old places of work, it had said while taking suo motu (on its own) cognisance of the “problems and miseries” of lakhs of migrant workers.The top court, which had on May 28 passed a slew of directions including asking the states not to charge any fare from the returning workers, had noted that fresh requests for 171 ‘Shramik Special’ trains have been made so far by the states from the Centre, and directed that any additional demand be fulfilled by the Railways within “a period of 24 hours”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-pulls-up-maharashtra-govt-for-claiming-everything-fine-on-migrant-workers-issue/story-u13fckb86iCicBfuHt64aL.html

09-07-2020||India||Rajnath Singh inaugurates 6 bridges in J&K||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday dedicated six major bridges to the nation via a video-conference link from New Delhi in a bid to ensure better connectivity of roads and bridges in sensitive border areas close to the 198-kilometre (km)-long India-Pakistan International Border (IB) and the 744-km-long Line of Control (LoC) in the union territory of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K).Singh congratulated the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) for completing the works of six bridges in record time and complimented them for contributing to nation-building by working in one of the most hostile terrain and weather conditions.He said that roads and bridges are the lifelines of any nation and play a vital role in the socio-economic development of far-flung regions.Reiterating the Central government’s commitment to prioritise development activities in J&K, he said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is regularly monitoring the progress of these projects and adequate funds are being provided for their timely execution.He said, “It is a pleasant experience to inaugurate these bridges that ‘connect people’, at a time when the world is insisting on maintaining distance, being isolated from each other (due to the coronavirus disease, Covid-19). I would like to congratulate them on completing this important task with great skill.”He added: “Continued construction of roads and bridges in the border areas of the country with total commitment by the BRO would help in realisation of the efforts of the government to reach the remotest areas. Roads are the lifeline of any nation,” he added.“Roads in the border areas are not only strategic strengths, but also, act to connect remote areas with the mainstream. In this way, be it the strategic necessity of the Armed Forces or other development work related to health, education, and trade, all these are possible only with connectivity,” he said.He hoped that the construction of modern roads and bridges would bring prosperity to the region.“Our government is committed to promoting infrastructure on our borders and the necessary resources will be provided for this. Our government has a keen interest in the development of J&K. Keeping in mind the need of the people of J&K and Armed Forces, many other development works are also in the pipeline, which will be announced in due time. About 1,000-m-long long roads are under construction in the Jammu region,” he said.The six bridges were inaugurated in the presence of Dr. Jitendra Singh, Minister of State (MoS) (independent charge) and MoS Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Department of Atomic Energy and Department of Space.

Interacting with representatives of various Varanasi-based non-government organisations via video link, he said Kashi has vigorously countered the unprecedented coronavirus crisis. Varanasi, which is also known as Kashi, is the prime minister’s parliamentary constituency. He recalled that a 100 years ago, a pandemic had struck. Though the population of India was much smaller, it was among the countries that had witnessed maximum deaths, he pointed out. This time too, during the outbreak of coronavirus, experts had raised concerns about India, he said adding that issues such as rise in virus cases due to movement of migrants and food for the needy were flagged. There were doubts and apprehensions about Uttar Pradesh too, with a population of 23-24 crore. With the hard work of the people and their cooperation, the apprehensions were overcome, he said. Modi noted that Brazil too has a population comparable to Uttar Pradesh but it witnessed thousands of deaths due to the virus. In Uttar Pradesh the deaths due to COVID-19 are reported to be nearly 800, he pointed out. He said the state checked the pace of COVID-19 spread and also those infected with the virus are recovering fast. The prime minister also hailed the role of people, authorities and NGOs of Varanasi in helping the needy during the COVID-19 pandemic, and urged citizens to strictly adhere to guidelines to prevent the spread of the deadly virus. He said Varanasi can emerge as an export hub and develop as a key centre of ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ campaign in the coming days. During the nationwide lockdown, the residents of Varanasi and members of social organisations, through their own efforts as well as by providing assistance to the district administration, ensured that food was timely available for everyone in need. More than a hundred organisations in Varanasi distributed almost 20 lakh food packets and two lakh dry ration kits through the food cell of the district administration, as well as through individual efforts during the lockdown period. Apart from food distribution, these organisations were instrumental in distribution of masks, sanitisers and other items. They have been honoured as ‘corona warriors’ by the district administration. During the event, Modi was briefed about the various steps and measures that the NGOs took to the help the needy, including distribution of free rations and cooked food, opening of mobile ATMs and proving assistance to those in need of medical care. Referring to the various schemes initiated by the central government to help various sections of the society during the lockdown, Modi said the Centre has made constant efforts to share the suffering of the common people and to reduce it.The poor get ration, have few rupees in their pocket, have employment and can take loan for their work, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-praises-up-for-containing-the-spread-of-covid-19-pandemic/story-siqZ2SwLWsYIgs2cAqEyfP.html

The attack happened right outside the Bandipore police station when the three were at the family shop.“It was an act of sheer cowardice carried out of sheer frustration at the behest of Pakistan. Since the Army and security forces have eliminated a large number of terrorists in Kashmir, Pakistan is desperate and frustrated. Sheikh Waseem Bari was a tiger. He, along with his brother and father, was killed in the dark of night”, an outraged J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina told HT from Bandipore.He further said, Bari was a true patriot and kept Tricolor aloft. “His perpetrators will have to pay a heavy price. I have spoken to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and party president JP Nadda. He was our lion, who challenged Pakistan and its proxies openly. We will avenge their killings”.“The wolves attacked them in the dead of night but they won’t be spared. We salute Sheikh Waseem Bari, his brother and their father for their supreme sacrifice. Pakistan, terrorists and separatists will have to pay a heavy price for this act of cowardice,” he asserted.Former deputy chief minister Kavinder Gupta said, “killings of our leader, his brother and their father are very painful and heart-wrenching for us. However, terrorists shouldn’t forget the fact that the history of the BJP is replete with sacrifices right from Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.”Gupta said that it was Sheikh Waseem Bari who was leading nationalist movement in Kashmir.“Their killings are a major set back to us, to the nation and the nationalist forces in Kashmir. Terrorists should not misconstrue that their killings will dishearten us and the nationalist movement will come to an abrupt end,” he said.The former deputy CM also avowed to avenge their killings. “We convey our heartfelt condolences and stand by their family. I also urge our party leaders and cadres in Kashmir valley to remain alert to the sinister designs of terrorists and their sympathizers because they are always on a lookout,” he said.J&K BJP vice president Narinder Singh said that the targeted killings may have demoralized party rank and file in Valley. He, however, added that the BJP was the only party carrying out political and social activities in Kashmir.“Certainly, security must be reviewed and accordingly enhanced and provided to party leaders and workers depending upon threat perception to them,” he added.“Sheikh Waseem Bari was also provided eight PSOs. How the attackers succeeded in their designs remains a subject of investigation but security certainly needs a re-look,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/act-of-sheer-cowardice-j-k-bjp-president-on-killing-of-party-leader/story-jeSaM5WE9HvOGPfdJr7xQK.html

The Centre has eased lockdown restrictions with a focus to lift sentiments and pull the economy out of the deep slumber that the lockdown had induced it into.“On one hand India is fighting a strong battle against the global pandemic.With an increased focus on people’s health, we are equally focussed on the health of the economy,” said PM Modi at the inaugural Global India Week, a virtual conference being organised in the UK.Themed ‘Be The Revival: India and a Better New World’, the event features 5,000 global participants from 30 nations and will be addressed by 250 global speakers in 75 sessions.Explaining that economic revival for India means a win-win situation both for people and the economy, the PM said the results of that effort are already visible in the country. “When India talks of revival it’s revival with care, with compassion, which is sustainable both for environment and economy. Indians have the spirit to achieve what is believed to be impossible. No wonder that in India, we are already seeing green-shoots of economic recovery,” said the PM.Over the last six years, the PM pointed out India has made gains in areas such as “total financial inclusion, record housing and infra construction, ease of doing business, bold tax reforms including GST, roll out of the world’s largest healthcare initiative - the Ayushman Bharat”.The reforms in agriculture, the PM highlighted, provide a very viable investment in storage and logistics and urged companies to come and invest directly in the hard work of farmers. Laying out the proverbial red carpet for the companies, the PM stressed that India is one of the most open economies of the world and invited them to come and invest in the country. “Very few countries will offer the kind of opportunities India does today,” said the PM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/story-of-global-revival-will-have-india-playing-leading-role-pm-modi-at-india-global-week/story-lDgqD01827uniT5QypxvXO.html
09-07-2020||India||Congress Working Committee may have to give extension to Sonia Gandhi||The Congress Working Committee (CWC) is expected to meet soon to take a call on extending the tenure of Sonia Gandhi, who completes a year as the party’s interim chief on August 10.A Congress functionary said the extension would be a technical requirement as per the party constitution because a regular president is yet to be elected. The party also has to inform the Election Commission of India (ECI) of its decision as a prerequisite condition.He said the process of electing a new president could not be initiated because of the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, and the nationwide lockdown restrictions enforced since March 25 to contain the pandemic.“Soon after her appointment, there were assembly polls in Maharashtra and Haryana in October-November last year, followed by elections in Jharkhand and Delhi. Then, the Covid-19 struck,” he added. The CWC had named Sonia Gandhi as the party’s interim chief on August 10, 2019, after Rahul Gandhi refused to take back his resignation.He had quit the Congress president’s post following the party’s humiliating defeat in last year’s parliamentary elections.The Congress had managed to win 52 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) tally of 303.At the fractious CWC meeting on May 25, 2019, Rahul Gandhi had slammed the veterans for “placing the interests” of their sons above the party and cited that some leaders had even lost the election from their strongholds. He had also criticised a section of the GenNext leaders for hankering after posts.Rahul Gandhi brought finality to his decision to step down as the party president on July 3, when he tweeted a four-page farewell note listing the reasons for his resignation.In the letter, Rahul Gandhi took a dig at his party colleagues for the electoral drubbing the Congress had received and spoke about the lack of support to him, saying he had stood completely alone in the fight against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS).“I personally fought the Prime Minister, the RSS, and the institutions they have captured with all my being. I fought because I love India. And I fought to defend the ideals India was built upon. At times, I stood completely alone and am extremely proud of it,” he had written.In the August CWC meeting last year, Sonia Gandhi had accepted to lead the party once again after repeated pleas by her colleagues and only on the condition that she would stay on as the interim chief till the election to choose a full-time president was held.The Congress’s highest decision-making body had taken the call out of deference to the sentiments of Rahul Gandhi, who was anointed the party president on December 16, 2017.Sonia Gandhi (73) had then said that her move would again give a handle to the opponents to attack the Congress on the grounds that the Gandhi family was unwilling to give up its hold over the party.She had also insisted that this point be included in a resolution that read: “Consequently, the CWC unanimously resolved to request Smt. Sonia Gandhi to take over Interim President pending the election of a regular President by the AICC.”The Congress constitution empowers the CWC to appoint a provisional president pending the election of a regular chief by the All India Congress Committee (AICC), the party’s central unit comprising around 2,000 members from across the country.There has been a renewed pitch for Rahul Gandhi to take over as the party chief once again, but at least four Congress leaders said on the condition of anonymity that he is still adamant about his decision and is unlikely to assume the reins of the organisation in the near future.The CWC would again make a last-ditch attempt to persuade Rahul Gandhi (50) and in case he refuses to relent, it would consider extending Sonia Gandhi’s term as the interim party president, said the party functionary quoted above.In her previous stint, Sonia Gandhi remained at the helm for nearly two decades from March 14, 1998, to December 16, 2017, when Rahul Gandhi took over from her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-working-committee-may-have-to-give-extension-to-sonia-gandhi/story-g8q7xnvLCKHKci0GSvT9KO.html

09-07-2020||India||‘Uninformed commentary’: Govt on row over cut in CBSE course||Union minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank on Thursday, in a series of Twitter posts, hit back at critics who alleged a conspiracy in reducing the syllabus of the Central Board of Secondary Education amid the coronavirus pandemic. The minister said those criticising were resorting to “sensationalism” and were “uninformed”. The cut has been made across subjects but what has run into controversy is the axing of concepts like federalism, social movements in India, colonialism, Partition, among other topics, in social sciences.“There has been a lot of uninformed commentary on the exclusion of some topics from CBSE syllabus. The problem with these comments is that they resort to sensationalism by connecting topics selectively to portray a false narrative,” tweeted the minister this morning. The Central minister urged the doubting Thomases to “leave politics out of education” and called upon them to make efforts to lift the political discourse by being “more educated”. While announcing the 30% cut in the CBSE syllabi for classes 9 to 12, the minister did say that core concepts will be retained.  It is our humble request: #Education is our sacred duty towards our children. Let us leave politics out of education and make our politics more educated. 🙏“It is our humble request, education is our sacred duty towards our children. Let us leave politics out of education and make our politics more educated,” said Nishank.Defending the charge against the government of being selective in dropping topics, the minister listed out in examples from other disciplines where topics have been excluded.“In Biology, portions of Mineral Nutrition, Digestion & Absorption have been excluded. It can be no one’s argument that these topics have also being excluded by malice or some grand design which only partisan minds can decipher.“Similarly, some of the excluded topics in Maths are Properties of Determinants, Consistency, Inconsistency, and Number of Solutions of System of Linear Equations by Examples and Binomial Probability Distribution,” the minister added.Nishank underlined that the exclusions were a “one-time measure” due to coronavirus. “While it’s easy to misconstrue exclusion of 3-4 topics like nationalism, local govt, federalism and build a concocted narrative, a wider perusal of different subjects will show that this is happening across subjects,” he added.The exercise has been carried out, the minister said, following the advice and recommendations of various experts and considering the suggestions received from educationists through the ministry’s “SyllabusForStudents2020 campaign”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uninformed-commentary-government-on-row-over-cut-in-cbse-course/story-Jvh8HAAhOmEZBDdOnXOADI.html

He had told reporters that the ED investigators had posed 128 questions to him over three sessions.“This is political vendetta and harassment against me and my family and I do not know under whose pressure they (investigators) are working,” Patel had said.  The Congress party treasurer has faced ED questioning for about 27 hours till now during sessions held on June 27, June 30 and July 2.Patel was allowed to be quizzed at home after he refused to visit the Enforcement Directorate (ED) office, citing the prevailing COVID-19 guidelines that discourage senior citizens from going out.The officials said the Congress leader’s statement is being recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).He is being questioned about his purported links with the Sandesara brothers, promoters of the Vadodara-based Sterling Biotech pharmaceutical company, and alleged dealings of his family members with them.The agency had questioned Patel’s son Faisal and son-in-law Irfan Ahmed Siddiqui in connection with the case and recorded their statements last year.The two were questioned in the context of the statement of one Sunil Yadav, an employee of the Sandesara group, which was recorded before the agency.In his statement to the ED, Yadav had said he bore the “expenses of Rs 10 lakh” for a party which was attended by Faisal, “arranged” entry into a night club for him and once delivered “Rs 5 lakh” to his driver in Delhi’s Khan Market on the instructions of Chetan Sandesara, one of the promoters of Sterling Biotech, sources had said.He had told the agency that the cash was “meant for Faisal Patel”, the sources had said.The ED was also told by Yadav that Siddiqui “occupied” a house in Delhi’s Vasant Vihar, which reportedly belonged to Chetan Sandesara.The money-laundering case pertains to the alleged Rs 14,500-crore bank-loan fraud, said to have been perpetrated by Sterling Biotech and its main promoters and directors -- Nitin Jayantilal Sandesara, Chetankumar Jayantilal Sandesara and Deepti Sandesara -- all of whom are absconding.Nitin and Chetankumar are brothers.The ED has alleged that this is a bigger bank scam in volume than the Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud involving fugitive diamantaires Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi.The amount involved in the PNB case is pegged at about Rs 13,400 crore.The Sandesaras are also facing separate probes by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Income-Tax department for their alleged nexus with high-profile politicians and charges of corruption and tax evasion respectively.At present, the Sandesaras are stated to be based in Albania in Europe. Efforts are on to extradite them.The ED registered a criminal case in connection with the alleged bank-loan fraud on the basis of an FIR and a chargesheet filed by the CBI.It is alleged that the company took loans of over Rs 5,383 crore from a domestic consortium led by the Andhra Bank, which later turned into non-performing assets, and the ED has alleged that the promoters laundered the money using shell or dubious firms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-questions-congress-leader-ahmed-patel-for-4th-time-in-pmla-case/story-xFU5rv3TddE85BLRmdx38H.html

Soon, a First Information Report (FIR) was registered against him and he was produced before a local magistrate for remand. The stipulated 90 days, prescribed by Section 167(2) of CrPC to file a charge sheet, lapsed on April 30 amid the nationwide lockdown restrictions.On May 2, he applied for bail in the special POCSO court, which was denied two days later, citing that the timeframe for filing a charge sheet has been extended because of the pandemic.The prosecutor opposed the bail plea on the ground that the police submitted the charge sheet thrice between March and April, but the special POCSO court didn’t accept it.The special POCSO court accepted the charge sheet on May 4 and rejected the accused’s bail plea on the ground that the timeframe for filing a charge sheet has been extended due to the prevailing lockdown restrictions.Justice Joshi, however, said it is imperative to ascertain whether the charge sheet was filed in the first instance in March and the reasons for the inordinate delay and beyond the stipulated timeframe.The HC granted bail to the accused because he had exercised his indefeasible right on expiry of 90 days to file a charge sheet and as a result, is entitled to the legal relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-no-reason-for-not-filing-chargesheet-hc-grants-bail-to-man-accused-of-raping-minor/story-aBgIr5lHTXXC51lAGkbOSP.html

The following day, three more persons, who had come in contact with the infected couple, tested Covid-19 positive.The report stated Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu are ranked after Maharashtra on the fatality count with 3,165, 1,977, and 1,636 deaths, respectively.The north-eastern states such as Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Sikkim have not reported a single Covid-19 death as yet.Gujarat tops the case fatality rate (CFR) at 5.26%, followed by Maharashtra at 4.22%.On Wednesday, state health minister Rajesh Tope said efforts are on to bring down the CFR by increasing the daily test count.“An increase in daily test count will help bring down the CFR and the positive rate can also be reduced to below 10%,” the minister said.At present, Maharashtra’s positive rate against total tests is at 18.77%, which is a worrying trend.Maharashtra reported 223,724 Covid-19 positive cases until Wednesday, including 91,065 active ones, according to the report.On Wednesday, hotels, and lodges that were shut for the past four months were opened as part of the state’s Mission Begin Again campaign to give a fillip to commercial activities and revive the economy.Mumbai reported 1,347 Covid-19 positive cases on Wednesday after the previous day’s count of 785 had broken a 57-day pattern with the lowest single-day spike.Health experts maintained a one-day low count is an aberration, as it needs to be sustained for a while to be considered a trend.“Though a single-day low Covid-19 positive cases in Mumbai are an encouraging sign, nothing can be ascertained from it. A trend can only be determined after analysing the data over a period of time,” Dr. Anant Bhan, researcher, global health, bioethics, and healthcare policy, had told HT in an earlier interaction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-months-on-maharashtra-covid-count-related-fatalities-continue-to-remain-highest-in-the-country/story-gIOuZg4VTHrKNRAadI5aoL.html

09-07-2020||India||Uttarakhand forest officials declare killer leopard ‘maneater’, wildlife experts unhappy||The leopard which killed a one-and-half-year old child in Udal village of Almora in Uttarakhand has been permitted to be tranquilised and caged, a forest official said.“We have been permitted, through an order issued on Tuesday by chief wildlife warden, to cage or tranquilize the leopard first which is posing threat to human life. In the condition of failing to catch the leopard, then we have been instructed to destroy it,” said Mahatim Singh Yadav, divisional forest officer (DFO), Almora.A one-and-half-year old child in Udal village under Bhaisiya Chhana block of Almora was killed by the leopard in front of his mother on Monday while he was playing in the courtyard of the house. Furious villagers staged a protest with the deceased body for 18 hours and demanded the leopard be shot down.Also read: Uttarakhand man booked for posting child pornography on social mediaMeanwhile, Yadav handed over a cheque worth Rs 90,000 as compensation to the family of the deceased child. Rest of the amount - Rs 2.10 lakh - will be provided later.Following the protest and pressure by villagers, the DFO informed the chief wildlife warden regarding the continuous threat to human lives by the leopard and sought permission to capture or kill it.Yadav said, “We have installed camera traps and a cage where the body of the child was found. Another cage is being installed in the village on Wednesday. Since this was the fifth incident of human killing in the last two years in that area by the leopard, we sought permission from the chief wildlife warden.”Also read: Heavy rains trigger landslides across Uttarakhand, one dead in car accidentForest officials who are experienced in such operations have been deployed in Udal village to catch the big cat. A hunter from Bijnore area of Uttar Pradesh is also reaching Almora to eliminate the leopard, said an official.The move, however, has been questioned by wildlife experts.AG Ansari, Ramnagar-based wildlife expert, said, “If five human beings have lost their lives in attacks by a leopard and it is posing a threat to humans, it is in law to destroy such a wild animal. But the bigger question is how can forest officials say it is the same leopard. They should focus on catching the leopard by caging or tranquilising it instead of killing it so that an animal’s life could be saved.”The increasing man-leopard conflict in the state often leads to protests by villagers whenever anyone, especially a child, is killed in a leopard attack. In June 2018, angry villagers in Harinagari area of Bageshwar set a forest on fire after a leopard killed a seven-year-old boy.Chief wildlife warden, through the invocation of Clause 11 (1) (a) of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, can declare any wild animal as a threat to human life and fit to be destroyed. The Act states that ‘chief wildlife warden of the state may - if he is satisfied that any wild animal specified in Schedule I has become dangerous to human life or is so disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery - by order in writing and stating the reasons, therefore, permit any person to hunt such an animal or have it hunted’.The power was limited through an amendment in the Act in 2003, with insertion in section 9 that states, “no wild animal shall be ordered to be killed unless the chief wildlife warden is convinced that such an animal cannot be captured, tranquilised or translocated”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-forest-officials-declare-killer-leopard-maneater-wildlife-experts-unhappy/story-tHUMhXutJSAGoIQdOwqOoM.html

The list of coal blocks that will be auctioned is being prominently displayed on the ministry’s website since January while categorising them as ‘high conservation zones’. The Centre should pay heed to the state government’s plea and take off these five coal blocks on environmental grounds,” said Shukla.He also called the Centre’s bluff to the media that eight rounds of consultations have been held with the state government on the auction list.“If that’s the case, then why does the state government have to write several letters to the Union government citing environmental concerns?” he asked.He alleged that minister Joshi could be trying to distract public attention because of non-compliance of norms and a raging controversy surrounding the auction of coal blocks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/auctioning-of-coal-blocks-near-hasdeo-arand-halted/story-YpTl1FQZPygRlVsu3H8RqI.html

09-07-2020||India||At top panel meet on China border, India reviews troop pullback and possible red flags||India’s top strategy group on China led by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval met on Wednesday to review the withdrawal of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers from the standoff points in eastern Ladakh and decide the government’s next steps.This was their first meeting after Chinese troops started withdrawing troops from three of the standoff points after Ajit Doval’s two-hour-long conversation with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on Sunday evening, people familiar with the development told Hindustan Times.Doval will have a second conversation with Qang Yi in about three weeks when the two sides will discuss the border situation again before the next step of de-escalation is ordered.Apart from the country’s top civil servant Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba, officials of the ministries of defence, external affairs and home, Wednesday’s meeting of the China Study Group was also attended by some special invitees including some senior ministers.Also Read: NSA Ajit Doval talks to China’s Wang Yi, troops pulled back along LAC: Read full statement hereGovernment and military officials said the Chinese troops are falling back from Patrolling Point 14 (Galwan Valley), Patrolling Point 15 (Hot Springs) and Patrolling Point 17 (Gogra) in Ladakh’s Galwan region. The Galwan Valley, or Patrolling Point 14, was the site of the violent scrap of June 15 that led to casualties on both sides. It is here that the Chinese PLA has withdrawn around 1.5km with its tents dismantled and armoured personnel carriers pulled back.The thinning out of Chinese soldiers is the slowest around the fourth standoff point near Pangong Tso, the saltwater glacial lake spread across 700 sq km. It is here that, according to the Indian assessment, the Chinese forces had an edge over Indian troops since they have built a road up to Finger 4 - the finger area refers to a set of eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range that overlooks the lake - and had set up bunkers, pillboxes as well as observation posts.Field reports have indicated that the Chinese PLA Air Force activity has declined considerably in the Ladakh sector but the PLA ground troops are fully deployed, and on high alert in the depth areas of both Tibet and Xinjiang region. There is also a build-up across the Arunachal Pradesh LAC.Also Read: ‘India on treasure hunt to find what happened in Galwan’: ChidambaramAt Wednesday’s meeting, government sources told Hindustan Times, the study group also made an assessment of the deployment of PLA troops close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC). A point made at the meeting more than once was that the PLA needs to withdraw from all areas along the 1,597 km LAC in Ladakh as well as along the 1,126 km LAC in Arunachal Pradesh.For one, government and military officials pointed that the Chinese troops continue to remain in an aggressive posture in the Depsang Plains at 17,000 feet or the Raki nullah area. The Raki Nullah near Burtse is key to Indian patrolling in the Depsang plains and has seen incursions by the Chinese side on more than one occasion. One such incursion that was quickly detected by the border guards in April 2013 also led to a face-off between two sides. This Depsang incursion at Raki Nullah was designed to prevent the Indian patrols from reaching Points 10, 11, 11A and 13. Patrolling Point 12 lies outside the patrol line.A top military commander said the army had also scaled up its presence in the area to match the adversary in troop numbers and support elements as a precautionary measure.Also Read: Analysts in Beijing link Doklam to Galwan, say India aggressor in both casesGovernment officials said it was on account of a gradual, and graded pullback of troops by the Chinese side that New Delhi had adopted a cautious approach and in the Ladakh sector, closely tracking troop movements around Pangong lake and Depsang plains as well.Some officials believe that the softening in Beijing’s stand, which came a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Ladakh visit, could have been influenced by Washington deploying its two US supercarriers for exercises in South China Sea and the need for Beijing to focus its energies on that side of its boundary dispute with ASEAN, Japan and Australia.There may not be a link between the American stepping up pressure over the South China Sea and the Ladakh standoff, an official said, “but it just turned out to be bad timing for the Chinese”.The official suggested it is possible that China may believe that there was a link between India’s stand in Ladakh and the US belligerence in the South China Sea and could calibrate its troop withdrawal from Ladakh in line with easing of tensions with the US in the South China Sea.The United States is working hard to mobilise support against China and will reach out to the European Union, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told a news conference on Wednesday.Pompeo referenced the large number of boundary and maritime disputes that China had opened with its neighbours to accuse it of practising a revisionist approach to enlarge its territory. “There aren’t many neighbours that can satisfactorily say that they know wheretheir sovereignty ends and the Chinese community party will respect that sovereignty. That is certainly true now for the people of Bhutan as well,” Pompeo - who referenced his conversations with Foreign Minister S Jaishankar - said, underscoring that the world will come together to respond to China “in a way that is powerful and important”.The Trump administration, who had earlier declared that the US was moving its military resources from Europe to focus on the threats from China, has already parked its two US aircraft carriers - USS Ronald Regan and USS Nimitz - to add muscle to its allies in southeast Asia. Analysts say that the US and PLA are using missions in the South China Sea to send a message to each other in the absence of any direct communication.US aircraft carriers Ronald Reagan and Nimitz are exercising full spectrum in the South China Sea and clearly laying down red lines for China on Taiwan. Of particular interest is the Bashi Channel, the waterway between the Philippines’ Y’Ami Island and Taiwan’s Orchid Island from where undersea internet cables run down to South East Asia, and Taiwan. The channel is also an important passage for military operations by the US and China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-top-panel-meet-on-china-border-india-reviews-troop-pullback-and-possible-red-flags/story-YUUf6GlXPzAB4OUKTXgjdI.html

09-07-2020||India||Is Covid-19 airborne? Indian experts react to latest finding, say there is no need to panic||A state of panic has overtaken people after the World Health Organization, earlier this week, was approached with a group of scientists with their finding, supporting the possibility of Covid-19 virus to be airborne. However, experts at India’s CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) say there is no need to panic. As per an expert, the latest finding could mean that the pathogen can be ‘at least temporarily’ in the air and does not mean it is flying all over and will infect everyone. “Those are good studies. Based on that, what is being communicated to WHO is that the virus can be at least temporarily airborne, which means it can travel in droplets of smaller size less than five micron which will mean that it will be hanging in the air for longer than bigger droplet which settles down in a few minutes,” director of the CSIR-CCMB, Rakesh Mishra, told news agency PTI. Also read: Remdesivir shortage hits Delhi as requirement soarsMishra calls for people to continue to take the same precautions and avoid close contact with people and large gatherings. The scientist said social distancing should be maintained at all cost and people must avoid rooms where multiple people are present, particularly those lacking aeration such as AC rooms.He added that very little is known about the virus and it would be too early to say that enough had been known about it. Over 230 scientists from 32 nations have written to the WHO, saying there is evidence that coronavirus is airborne and even smaller particles can infect people, a report in the New York Times stated. The global health body has long maintained that Covid-19 primarily spreads through coughs and sneezes and is not airborne. The virus has infected over 11 million across the globe while more than 5 lakh people have lost their lives to the deadly contagion worldwide.

09-07-2020||India||Uttarakhand fixes distance for setting up of stone crusher, hot-mix plants near Ganga, other rivers||The Uttarakhand government on Wednesday fixed the distance of setting up of stone crusher and hot-mix plants 1.5 kilometre away from the bank of river Ganga under its Stone-Crusher, Mobile Stone-Crusher and Hot-Mix Plant Policy, 2020. The decision was taken during the state cabinet meeting held in Dehradun which was chaired by chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat. Informing the mediapersons on the important decision, Madan Kaushik, cabinet minister and government spokesperson said, “Under the policy, stone crusher and hot-mix plants could be set up at a distance of 1.5 km away from the bank of Ganga, 1 km away from the banks of rivers in plain areas and 500 metres away from the banks of a rain-water fed river in the state.”“Apart from this, there were also some decisions taken regarding stone-crushers plants and storage of minerals under which the rights to grant permissions for the same will now be with the district magistrates and not administration. The applicant will now have to seek permission from the respective DMs and not the state government,” said Kaushik. He also informed that the license for retail storage of minerals would be given for five years instead of existing two years. “Similarly the license period for the Stone-crusher and hot-mix plants would be given for two years and not the existing one year. After two years he would have to renew the license,” said Kaushik adding “all the transactions in this will have to be made through cheque or demand drafts and not cash.”The minister also informed that the government has “put a complete prohibition on bringing in and taking out riverbed materials from the state”.Informing about other decisions made in the Cabinet meeting, Kaushik also revealed the fund collected in the Chief Minister Relief Fund (CMRF) during the pandemic period while taking a dig at Opposition Congress. “A total of Rs 154.56 crore was collected in the CMRF through donations from various sections of society from March 15 to June 26. Out of this, the government has spent a total of Rs 85.60 crore,” said Kaushik. He said, “Majority of the fund was spent in fighting the pandemic, developing quarantine facilities, providing food and ration to needy ones, arranging transport facilities for the migrants returning home and helping tourists stranded here.”Taking a dig at the Congress he said, “We decided to reveal the figures as the Congress has been raising questions on its credibility despite the fact that they didn’t contribute a single penny in it.”The Congress hit back. “Revealing the funds collected in CMRF is no big feat as it can be availed by a simple RTI application also,” said Suryakant Dhasmana, the vice president of Congress’ Uttarakhand unit.“As far as their claim of spending the fund in relief works is concerned, it’s all lies because nothing is visible on the ground. Instead of contributing to this dubious fund, we have helped the needy ones directly,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-allows-setting-up-of-stone-crusher-hot-mix-plants-near-ganga-and-other-rivers/story-2hnrlVrg5rjIBOwkxsLmZO.html

09-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||In a country riven by fractures, the coronavirus disease has introduced a new one. In the absence of a cure or a vaccine, masks and social distancing (even isolation) are the only ways to stay safe. And four months and a bit into the pandemic in India, it is clear that there are people who can afford this — they work remotely; their children learn remotely; they even socialise remotely — and those who can’t. I say “they” and “their” but it should be “we” and “our” — if you are reading this column, chances are you probably belong to the minority that has seamlessly (but perhaps not entirely painlessly) been pulled a decade or two into the future. This is the how-will-life-be-in-2030 school assignment (due in December 2019) in all its masked reality.In the first phase of their response to the virus, everyone rushed to lock down. This was the right decision, and backed by science. Countries that didn’t do this — Sweden is an example — have paid the price. In Sweden’s case, for instance, its number of deaths per million of population is much higher than that in many other countries (including the US), and the latest numbers suggest that its economy will contract significantly, indicating that its approach, once touted around the world, was flawed.In the second phase, as the infection curves began to flatten, or as countries became confident that their health care systems were primed to handle the pandemic (despite the number of cases continuing to rise), everyone rushed to open up. India is one example of the second — a country that opened up despite the number of cases continuing to rise (and quite sharply at that); in the first seven days of July, the country added 157,122 cases, 21.2% of its total case tally.This, too, was necessary. The economic costs of lockdowns were beginning to hurt. It was also clear that countries could open up, provided they ensured everyone wore masks, practised social distancing and hand-hygiene — and if they continued to test aggressively. India has continued to open up without doing enough tests (although it has increased testing significantly), and this column has repeatedly called for it to test more, something that experts say is possible. Many of them who spoke to Hindustan Times said that India could conduct a million tests a day if it put its mind to it.Science and data, this column has repeatedly pointed out, should drive our response to the coronavirus disease. If this isn’t always the case, blame it on the uncomfortable relationship between the two on one side, and politicians on the other. The President of the United States appears in public without a mask, and many of his followers, who know no better, emulate his example.Science now tells us that the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes the coronavirus disease can be airborne, especially in closed spaces. The World Health Organization finally accepted earlier this week that the virus may be transmitted over air; the New York Times quoted Dr Benedetto Allegranzi, the head of WHO’s committee on infection prevention and control, as saying that this was a possibility in “crowded, closed, poorly ventilated settings”.This is very different from what we knew previously — that the virus was largely transmitted by coughing or sneezing, exhalations and expectorations. It means the virus can stay for hours in the air in closed environments.This knowledge (which perhaps explains why the virus is highly infective) should form the basis of the third phase of our response to the coronavirus disease — yes it’s that significant. It calls for a review of what can be allowed to open, and what can’t (schools, for instance). It means offices that have just reopened, or are considering reopening, should have the right kind of air filtration and circulation systems, and also ensure that workers are socially distanced and masked. Yes, masked. Wearing them in the workplace may be the safest and surest way of getting back to work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-zxh5pIeYiHaMM7QTMCVRHM.html
09-07-2020||India||Onus of finding donor now on nodal officers||The Delhi government on Wednesday shifted the onus of finding a replacement donor for convalescent plasma from the Delhi Plasma Bank to nodal officers of each hospital. The government, in an order issued by principal health secretary Vikram Dev Dutt on Wednesday, directed all hospitals in Delhi – government and private — to appoint a nodal person to coordinate with the plasma bank at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS).According to the protocols of the plasma bank set up last Thursday, those in need of plasma have to provide at least three documents signed by the ‘nodal officer’ from the hospital where the patient is admitted.“For the sake of coordination, requisition and issuance of convalescent plasma from ILBS for treating eligible sick Covid patients, all the MS (medical superintendent)/ in-charge of hospitals in government sector and private/ corporate sector are required to nominate a nodal officer from their respective hospitals,” the Wednesday order reads.In addition, it says, “the nodal officer/hospital requisitioning COPLA (convalescent plasma) will be required to provide voluntary plasma donor, including replacement donors keeping in view the projected requirement of COPLA and scarce availability of the meagre resource.”So far, the onus was on the family of the patient in need of plasma to find a replacement donor. This comes a day after HT reported the teething troubles faced by those in need of plasma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/onus-of-finding-donor-now-on-nodal-officers/story-TfGg3e8TCZSrSR7cMe3FLI.html
09-07-2020||India||Science panel head opposes RS bar on online participation||Congress lawmaker Jairam Ramesh, who heads the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science & Technology, Environment & Forests, on Wednesday expressed displeasure over Rajya Sabha secretariat’s decision disallowing online participation of some of the panel’s members for a meeting to discuss Covid-19 pandemic.He called Rajya Sabha officials’ arguments against his proposal for the virtual participation “silly and bogus” and complained about the “disinformation virus”.Ramesh wrote to Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu saying some panel members be allowed to participate virtually as he feared a lack of quorum for the meeting. At a meeting under Naidu’s chairmanship on Wednesday, Rajya Sabha officials pointed out that quorum is necessary only for taking decisions and adopting reports and not for discussion. “Officials maintained that 22% of the meetings of science and technology committee had no quorum in last 3 years or during the tenure of the current chairman, Naidu,” said a functionary of the Rajya Sabha. “Details of meetings of committees without quorum were referred to only to bring out that committees used to meet without quorum even in normal times and it has been the case with all 8 committees of Rajya Sabha. This information has been widely shared so that MPs willing to attend the meetings convened in the next few days should not be in any doubt whether such meetings will be held or not, on account of quorum requirement,” added one official. Many opposition lawmakers have been demanding online meetings of Parliamentary panels due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Naidu and Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla have held meetings and asked officials to find out a solution, but permissions for digital discussions have not been forthcoming. Parliamentary panel meetings have always happened inside the House complex amid much secrecy.In a tweet, Ramesh said, “Since I took over as Chairman of the Committee on Science & Technology, Environment, Forests & Climate Change, we have held 11 meetings from September 2019 to March 2020 with quorum in all meetings.”He said the point was not about quorum alone. “It is about facilitating those MPs [members of Parliament] who want to attend & are unable to because of containment zone & quarantine restrictions in their home states. Very different from not attending due to other commitments in normal times...” He referred to the lack of quorum in earlier meetings. “On those occasions we did not have advance information always on who will attend and who will not. This time around MPs have informed before the meeting. Some have even requested for virtual meeting,” said Ramesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/science-panel-head-opposes-rs-bar-on-online-participation/story-JCwFkQCgLXCwW48FIpMi3L.html
09-07-2020||India||Govt sets up panel to probe 3 Gandhi family-run trusts||The Union government on Wednesday set up an interministerial committee headed by an Enforcement Directorate (ED) officer to investigate the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF), the Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust (RGCT) and the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust (IGMT) — institutions closely associated with the Nehru-Gandhi family and the Congress — for possible money laundering, income tax violations and foreign funding irregularities. Congress president Sonia Gandhi is the chairperson of RGF while other trustees include former prime minister Manmohan Singh, former finance minister P Chidambaram, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Sonia Gandhi also heads RGCT and oversees the work of IGMT as well. The Congress alleged this was an effort to intimidate the party leadership, which would not succeed, and asked the government to probe finances of organisations closely associated with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).  A home ministry spokesperson confirmed the creation of the committee in a tweet, adding that a special director rank officer in ED will supervise the probe. An official familiar with the development, who did want to be named, said officials of home and finance ministries as well as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will be part of the committee. CBI is empowered to investigate any violations under FCRA (Foreign Contribution Regulation Act), while ED and the income tax department, which come under the finance ministry, are responsible for investigations into money laundering and tax violations.The interministerial committee will verify if the three trusts run by the Gandhi family and other Congress leaders manipulated any documents while filing income tax, and laundered money received from foreign countries. “If it is found that there were irregularities, the concerned agency — CBI, ED or I-T department — will go ahead with a formal probe,” said the official who did not want to be named.RGCT was set up in 2002 to address the needs of the underprivileged, especially the poor, and primarily works in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Congress president Sonia Gandhi is the chairperson of the foundation and its trustees include former PM Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, P Chidambaram, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Suman Dubey, Ashok Ganguly and Vijay Mahajan.The decision comes in the backdrop of allegations by the BJP that RGF received donations from the Chinese government, which had influenced the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government’s economic and trade policy towards China to India’s detriment. BJP president JP Nadda alleged that money from the PM relief fund was diverted to the family trust, and that it also received funds from fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi. The Congress claimed this was a diversionary ploy adopted by the ruling party to cover up its own association with the Chinese Communist Party, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s deep relationship with the country from the time he was the chief minister of Gujarat.The trading of charges came against the backdrop of the situation on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Eastern Ladakh where Indian and Chinese soldiers were involved in a violent altercation that resulted in 20 casualties on the Indian side and an unknown number of casualties on the Chinese side. The Congress has been critical of the government’s response to the June 15 clash, and also PM Modi’s comments during an all-party meeting on June 19 that were ambiguous about the border transgression by the Chinese and were clarified by the Prime Minister’s Office the following day. The party has continued to be critical of the government on this front.On Wednesday, the Congress alleged there was a “new conspiracy” by the BJP, and the trusts had nothing to fear and would answer all questions and follow the law. Without specifically referring to the creation of the committee and announcement of the investigation, former party chief and member of Parliament Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “Mr Modi believes the world is like him. He thinks every one has a price or can be intimidated. He will never understand that those who fight for the truth have no price and cannot be intimidated.”Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi dared the government to deploy all its machinery in probing the financial sources of the trusts, and said that while they would answer all questions, the government needed to be “exposed” because it did not ask questions of its “many blue-eyed sanctified holy cows”. “You are harassing each opposition segment, individual and institutional, but not your holy cows. Whose special arc of protection they have?” he asked while referring to the Vivekananda Foundation, the India Foundation, Overseas Friends of BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological mentor of the ruling party.BJP general secretary Muralidhar Rao said: “Activities of the RGF is in the public domain. There are many aspects to it, related to FCRA, income tax audit, etc. The Modi government believes in transparency. We are committed to it, so it is natural to have investigation. No foundations are private, and the investigations are in public interest. If it (the investigation) was political (motivated) would we have waited six years?”Political analyst Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay said the BJP wants to revive the 2013-14 narrative of the Congress and the Gandhi family being corrupt. “The move is completely on the expected lines because they have always been looking for an opportunity to target and establish that the Congress and the Gandhi family are corrupt. This is also to overcome whatever setback and discomfort the people may be facing due to the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and will give another reason to cheer and jeer to BJP supporters,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-sets-up-panel-to-probe-3-gandhi-family-run-trusts/story-ITti0LTlMLbhAtDJBU0CzM.html
09-07-2020||India||Focus shifts to Finger 4 as pullback progresses||With the disengagement process between the Indian and Chinese armies making measurable progress in Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra, the focus of reducing tensions in eastern Ladakh has shifted to the sensitive Finger Area near Pangong Tso, which remains the “biggest test” and “hardest part” of the disengagement process, two officials familiar with the developments on the ground said on Wednesday.The Indian Army has observed a marginal thinning of troops, vehicles and removal of structures from a key spur there over the last 24 hours, said an official, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Some Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) elements have retreated from Finger 4 but it can’t, by any stretch, be seen as disengagement,” he added.“The Finger Area will now be at the centre of the stepwise disengagement process, which is underway at friction points in Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra. Temporary buffer zones between rival troops have been created there. The Finger Area will be the hardest part of disengagement,” said a second official who asked not to be named.  The Finger Area refers to a set of eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range overlooking the Pangong lake.The disengagement process began after military-level talks on June 30, and a subsequent conversation on July 6 between national security adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi. There is no clarity on the nature of discussions that took place on the Chinese presence in Pangong Tso — whether any decision was taken to disengage now, or to leave it for subsequent discussions after making progress in other areas. The army did not officially comment on the matter.Before the PLA grabbed positions on Finger 4 overlooking Indian deployments, the army would patrol right up to Finger 8 that New Delhi considers within Indian territory. The new positions held by the PLA have curtailed the scope of Indian patrols. Fingers 4 and 8 are 8km apart.The Indian claim line in this sector extends to Finger 8, while the Chinese claim is up to Finger 4 where the PLA has set up permanent bunkers, pillboxes, observation posts and tented camps over the last two months.Military experts, too, said the Finger Area will test the disengagement process.“Disengagement appears to be making reasonable progress in Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra. The Finger Area will now be the focal point of the disengagement process and will be a true test of China’s commitment and sincerity to resolve the situation,” said former army vice chief Lieutenant General AS Lamba (retd).But even as uncertainty persists on Pangong Tso, the army has begun a rigourous verification process to monitor the withdrawal of the PLA from Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra, where 4-km buffer zones between troops have come up, as reported by HT on Wednesday.While the PLA has withdrawn up to 2km from Patrolling Point 14 (Galwan Valley) and PP-15 (Hot Springs) over the last three days, a similar retreat is expected to be completed at PP-17 (Gogra) within a 24-hour time frame (by Thursday evening), said a third official. The Indian Army, too, is pulling back proportionately in these areas.The disengagement effort involves rival troops pulling back a specified distance from face-off sites, with further retreat taking place in phases as the complex plan progresses on a verifiable basis on the ground every 72 hours by both sides. It also entails the phased withdrawal of weapons and equipment to a mutually agreed distance, and finally the restoration of status quo ante (the situation as it existed in early April).The creation of buffer zones will temporarily restrict the patrolling activities of both armies in the region. While some experts saw this as a necessary step, others cautioned that the temporary curtailing of patrolling rights should not become a long-term feature undermining Indian presence and control.The army is also keeping a strict vigil along the contested border in the Depsang sector, where a 2013 Chinese intrusion blocked the access of Indian soldiers to several patrolling routes, including the ones leading to PPs-10, 11, 11A, 12 and 13.The military buildup in Indian and Chinese depth areas hasn’t thinned, with both sides keeping their guard up. The deployment of thousands of soldiers, fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, artillery guns, missile systems and air defence weapons continues in the region.At the June 30 meeting between delegations led by Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region, the Indian side reiterated its demand for the pullback of Chinese troops from friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and sought the restoration of status quo ante in Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang plains, apart from emphasising the need for thinning the military buildup in the region. The first part of this process is underway at the moment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/focus-shifts-to-finger-4-as-pullback-progresses/story-ghOkTWHadBF2fQXsZadoqO.html

09-07-2020||India||Kin among 23 booked for forging will of last ruler of Faridkot state in ’82||Relatives of the last ruler of Punjab’s erstwhile princely state of Faridkot were among 23 people booked for fraud on Wednesday for allegedly forging his will in 1982. The case was filed a month after the Punjab and Haryana high court ruled that Harinder Singh Brar’s will was forged in Maharwal Khewaji Trust’s favour.Members of the trust, including its chairman and the ruler’s grandson, Jai Chand Mehtab, are among those booked on the complaint of Brar’s daughter, Amrit Kaur. Mehtab’s sister, Nisha D Kher, who is vice-chairperson of the trust, has also named in the case. The other accused include the trust’s CEO Jagir Singh Sran.The property dispute dates back to 1989 when Brar’s will bequeathing his properties to the Trust, with his daughter, Deepinder Kaur, as its head, surfaced after his death.The court observed the Maharwal Khewaji Trust’s trustees conspired to create the will to take over the property. “The will is proved to be forged, fictitious, fabricated, and shrouded with suspicious circumstances,” the court said.The accused have been booked under the Indian Penal Code’s sections, including those pertaining to cheating, forgery, and criminal conspiracy.Senior police superintendent Swarndeep Singh said Amrit Kaur filed a complaint on the basis of the court order and they registered the case after taking legal advice. “She has stated, in her complaint, that the accused have committed forgery by preparing a fake will of the Faridkot ruler.”The court upheld a Chandigarh court’s order awarding the majority share in the ₹20,000-crore property of Brar to his two daughters —Amrit Kaur and Deepinder Kaur. Brar died in 1989 and left behind prime properties in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, and Chandigarh. Deepinder Kaur died while the legal battle was on. Amrit Kaur lives in Chandigarh. Brar’s son, Harmohinder Singh, died in a road accident in 1981. His third daughter, Maheepinder Kaur, is also dead.The property dispute reached the high court in 2018 after a Chandigarh court declared the trust void and gave the property to the daughters. In June this year, the high court upheld the Chandigarh court’s order.Jagir Singh Saran, chief executive of the Maharawal Khewaji Trust, said they were awaiting the details of the FIR. “There was no forgery... we have all record and facts. After the high court verdict, we got 90 days to move the Supreme Court. We are consulting legal experts and will soon challenge the high court verdict in the apex court. The FIR was lodged to put pressure on the trust before the proceedings start in the SC,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kin-among-23-booked-for-forging-will-of-last-ruler-of-faridkot-state-in-82/story-iwDpWexU3lwAYTj9HRw4JK.html
09-07-2020||India||Fake babas bring disrepute to real spirituality: SC||Fake babas and their illegal activities are spoiling the reputation of even genuine spiritual leaders, the Supreme Court observed on Wednesday, asking the central government to suggest measures to tackle phony religious gurus. A bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde was hearing a plea seeking action against ashrams (religious retreats) run by fake spiritual gurus, which have allegedly confined inmates, particularly women, in unhygienic conditions, risking the spread of the coronavirus disease. “There is a lot of money involved and criminal activities are happening. See what can be done? This kind of practice gives a bad name to everyone,” CJI Bobde told the central government’s second senior-most law officer, solicitor general Tushar Mehta. The petitioner, Dumpala Ramreddy, was asked by the apex court to provide Mehta with a copy of the petition so that he can suggest solutions to deal with the problem. Reddy approached the top court in April alleging that his daughter was confined in the Adhyatmika Vidyalaya Ashram at Rohini in Delhi founded by Veerendra Dev Dixit, who has been absconding since 2017 after being charged for raping a minor girl in 1999.Reddy submitted that central and state governments were not taking action against fake babas and were allowing such illegal ashrams to function, often from unauthorized premises. “Considering the urgent prevailing situation due to spreading of Corona virus in the country particularly in places where social distance is not maintained….the petitioner prays for the intervention of this Hon’ble Court for the rescue of the women/persons in the ashrams,” the petition stated.The petitioner also sought guidelines to be laid down to govern the establishment and functioning of such ashrams and to close down those run by people with criminal records.He also cited a list released by the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad, a body of Hindu religious ascetics, declaring 17 babas including Veerendra Dev Dixit, Asaram bapu, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh and Radhe Maa as fake religious gurus. Even so, ashrams run by the 17 people, Reddy contended, are continuing to function with thousands of disciples residing on their premises. “If this man (Reddy) says the Akhara has declared that there are 17 ashrams that are fake, it raises serious questions,” the bench remarked. Reddy sought the evacuation of inmates from the ashrams in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The authorities are not verifying the facilities available in the ashrams and the ashrams are in very poor condition. They do not have basic amenities and conditions are very unhygienic”, the petition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fake-babas-bring-disrepute-to-real-spirituality-sc/story-AbrszxUbqfdP60Zl5qKieP.html
09-07-2020||India||BS-IV vehicles sold after Mar 31 can’t be registered, says SC||The Supreme Court on Wednesday recalled its earlier order in which it allowed the sale of BS-IV vehicles for 10 days across India, except in Delhi-NCR, after lifting of a national lockdown, warning automobile dealers of not taking advantage of the apex court by “playing fraud”.A bench headed by justice Arun Mishra observed that its earlier directive from March 27 was violated and BS-IV vehicles were sold during the lockdown in the last week of March and even in the next month.When the bench was informed about the sale of such vehicles during the lockdown, it recalled the order by which it permitted automobile dealers to sell 10% of their BS-IV stock for further 10 days after the lockdown. The order was passed after dealers complained that they lost seven days from March 25 to March 31 due to the lockdown. “You cannot befool us. You cannot take advantage of this court’s order by playing fraud. How could you have opened for sale during lockdown? This is not just violation of the lockdown but violation of our order too,” said the three-judge bench of justices Mishra, S Abdul Nazeer and Indira Banerjee.The bench said BS-IV vehicles sold after March 31 this year and those whose details have not been uploaded on the e-vahan portal of the government will not be registered. In October 2018, the court said no BS-IV vehicle would be sold or registered in India from April 1, 2020. During the hearing on Wednesday, the bench observed that sale of BS-IV vehicles had increased in the last week of March, when the nationwide lockdown was in force, and there were online transactions also.The Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA) submitted a tabular chart to the court giving date-wise sales of two-wheelers, three-wheelers, passenger cars and commercial vehicles made by FADA members and non-members during March 12-31.The court was surprised to note that the bulk of sales took place during the lockdown. FADA members sold 61,861 BS-IV vehicles in the period March 12-31, of which sale of 33,328 vehicles pertained to the lockdown period. Similarly, non-member dealers sold 72,532 vehicles during the period of March 12-31, out of which the sale of 40,184 vehicles occurred during the lockdown week.Senior advocate KV Vishwanathan, who appeared for FADA, informed the court that most sales took place online during the lockdown.With inputs from PTI||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bs-iv-vehicles-sold-after-mar-31-can-t-be-registered-says-sc/story-Kgp3VTFxLz58ujTWB4Xm8L.html

09-07-2020||India||ITDC may get to run Parliament canteen; decision likely soon||State-run ITDC may soon replace Northern Railways in running the Parliament canteen. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and tourism minister Prahlad Singh Patel held a meeting with ITDC and parliament officials—described many as the first step for change of guard in the canteen that feeds up to 5,000 people daily during the sessions. Officials clarified that no final decision has been taken yet but the India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) made a detailed presentation on Wednesday to discuss its plans for the Parliament canteen. ITDC, the government’s tourism arm, runs the luxury five-star Ashok Group of hotels. The Northern Railway has been serving food in the canteen since 1968. The process to find a new vendor was started last year after concerns about the quality of food were raised. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla was personally looking into the issue. “A decision is likely to be taken in a week or two,” said a senior official. “We have had an in-depth discussion,” Union minister for tourism Prahlad Patel told Hindustan Times. “ITDC has presented the plan, we will have to wait to see how the tie-up works out.”Officials present at the meeting told Hindustan Times that Birla emphasised the need to ensure the “quality of the food.” “The Speaker wanted to ensure that the quality of food is maintained,” said an official on the condition of anonymity. “It is the most important factor but at the same time, the canteen will have to be run on a no-profit, no-loss basis.”ITDC, the above-mentioned official said, was also told that they will have to deal with both, ‘common people and VVIPs’, so a plan that suits all must be finalised. At present, the canteen serves a total of 48 food items for lunch and evening snacks, from boiled vegetables to kesari bath. But items such as poha, mutton cutlet or bonda are not available regularly. According to canteen officials, the vegetarian thali (Rs 40) and chapattis (Rs 2 each) are the most sought-after food in the Parliament complex.According to data available with Lok Sabha officials, out of the Rs 17 crore subsidy, only Rs 24 lakh was spent on account of the MPs. Visitors, security personnel, government officials, and journalists covering Parliament accounted for the rest. During a session, an average of 4,500 people eat daily at Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/itdc-may-get-to-run-parliament-canteen-decision-likely-soon/story-IJIWO18Fjr7N0lgMEY6cKI.html
09-07-2020||India||After spat with J&K top cop, MHA suspends officer for ‘misconduct’||Announcing the suspension of Basant Rath, the order stated that disciplinary proceeding is being considered in connection with “repeated instances of gross misconduct and misbehaviour”.The suspension order comes two weeks after Rath had filed an official complaint against director general of police (DGP) Dilbag Singh, and publicly criticised him on the microblogging site Twitter, setting of a social media storm.On June 25, Rath filed a written complaint against Singh at the Gandhi Nagar police station in Jammu, stating that Singh posed a threat to his safety and reputation. In the letter, written in what his colleagues call his trademark irreverent style, Rath referred to the DGP as “worthy worthy’’. “Requesting you to take note of my apprehension about my life, liberty and bald head the reason being certain activities of Sh Dilbag Singh, IPS batch 1987 batch, presently DGP,” Rath wrote.Rath further asked the Gandhi Nagar station house officer Gurnam Choudhary to make a note of the complaint and to not file a First Information Report (FIR).“I’m not asking you to lodge an FIR against the person mentioned above,” the letter read. “I’m just asking you to make this letter a part of the Daily Diary in your police station. Today. Now. In case something bad happens to me, you should know whose number you should dial. With due respect,” it stated.Since then, his twitter handle @KangriCarrier has openly criticised Singh, referred to him as “Dilloo” and made allegations about the latter running after “land at prime locations”. Singh, in turn, is reported to have dismissed these allegations and called him a “joker’’ in a WhatsApp group. With the order, the government has moved to put this public fight between the two officers to rest.Rath is known for his unconventional ways of reaching out to the public in Jammu and Kashmir. Over Twitter, he asks his followers to email him if they need books and study material, and his timeline is filled with messages of grateful students. Even as the story about his suspension was breaking, Rath tweeted on Wednesday: “Salaam, World. Only for MBBS students of J and K and Ladakh who find me trustworthy. If you want some of these books, please mail me the details ...” IPS officers and colleagues contacted by Hindustan Times were divided in their opinion of Rath. While one colleague called him “brilliant”, another described him as “playing to the gallery”. Both officers requested anonymity. During the period of his suspension, Rath will remain in Jammu. The order, issued on Tuesday evening, said the officer is immediately attached to the police headquarters in Jammu.“He shall not leave the headquarters without obtaining the permission from the DGP J&K Police Dilbag Singh,” it added. Rath didn’t respond to calls and messages seeking comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-spat-with-j-k-top-cop-mha-suspends-officer-for-misconduct/story-qWaAmfI4XGIImzTYXzcJZI.html
09-07-2020||India||Row after CBSE prunes syllabus, body says one-time measure||New Delhi: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE)’s announcement a day earlier that it has dropped topics like citizenship, secularism, federalism, and partition to rationalise syllabuses to make up for the academic loss due to the Covid-19 pandemic has triggered a political storm with Congress and other opposition parties condemning the move.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said she was shocked to know that these topics have been dropped in the name of course reduction. “We strongly object to this & appeal @HRDMinistry [Union human resource development ministry], GoI [the government of India] to ensure these vital lessons aren’t curtailed at any cost,” she tweeted.Congress spokesman Abhishek Manu Singhvi condemned the move saying secularism and federalism are pillars of Indian democracy. “What message are you trying to send?” Singhvi said. He added he was planning to move court.The Left parties accused the government of using the pandemic as an excuse to “advance” its agenda. “Atrocious. Using the pandemic, Modi government is deleting sections dealing with India’s diversity, plurality, democracy etc that uphold our Constitutional values from the Higher Secondary syllabus,” Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury tweeted.“All to advance the RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh] vision of an exclusivist, theocratic, intolerant, fascistic nation. This is nothing but the destruction of our Constitution. Unacceptable.”The Communist Party of India (CPI) condemned the syllabus reduction and called it a “nefarious attempt to implement the Hindutva agenda of RSS”.“The CPI strongly objects to the move to remove chapters on human rights, social movements, citizenship rights, etc. The party condemns the move to condition the minds of our youth so that fascist poison can be easily injected into them,” CPI said in a statement.“Ever since the RSS-BJP government came to power, they have been trying to communalise and commercialise education. The present move is part of their hidden agenda towards that purpose. There is already an attempt to centralise education in the name of New Education Policy.”The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) said the BJP wants to do away with democracy and secularism. “The BJP’s agenda is very clear. They want to do away with democracy and secularism. Hence the best way is not to teach it to the young. In the days to come, the BJP may even rewrite history in a different way and add it to the syllabus,” said NCP spokesperson Mahesh Tapase.CBSE secretary Anurag Tripathi issued a clarification, saying the issue had been interpreted “differently” and the syllabus reduction was only a one-time measure due to Covid-19 to reduce stress on students.“The rationalization of syllabus up to 30% has been undertaken by the board for nearly 190 subjects of class IX to XII for the academic session 2020-21 as a one-time measure only,” he said. Tripathi added the board has clarified that no question should be asked from the syllabus which has been removed.“Each of the topics that have been wrongly mentioned in the media as deleted has been covered under Alternative Academic Calendar of NCERT [National Council of Educational Research and Training] which is already in force for all the affiliated schools,” said TripathiBut many of the dropped topics have not been included in the calendar put out on NCERT’s website. But they soon may be part of it, as the council revises the calendar, CBSE and HRD officials said.NCERT website showed a four-week academic calendar. Secularism, nationalism, and citizenship do not feature in it. A CBSE official, who sought anonymity, said NCERT would come up with another alternative academic calendar for more months and more topics will be included. Another government official said NCERT was expected to soon release an eight-week calendar. “The NCERT is likely to include them [topics like citizenship, nationalism or secularism] as it expands this calendar. This is purely based on learning outcomes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-after-cbse-prunes-syllabus-body-says-one-time-measure/story-A39ASipqIK2orMHvs0HS9J.html
09-07-2020||India||2 cops named in case being probed for one more custodial killing||Chennai: Two of the Sathankulam station policemen arrested for the murder of father and son P Jayaraj (59) and J Bennicks (31) have been implicated in another case of alleged custodial torture that led to the eventual death of a 28-year-old man in June.The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Wednesday issued notice to the Tamil Nadu government, the state director general of police (DGP), home secretary and the superintendent of police of Thoothukudi, Jayakumar, to respond to the case filed by S Vadivu, the mother of S Mahendran, who died on June 13 reportedly due to injuries sustained while he was kept for a night at the Sathankulam police station in May. Jayakumar told Hindustan Times that a response will be filed after the inquiry into Mahendran’s death by additional superintendent of police, Selvam, is complete.Bennicks and Jayaraj died after they were reportedly beaten with lathis through the night of their arrest on June 19.Mahendran’s mother Vadivu (65) claimed in her affidavit that her son was picked up by sub inspector Raghu Ganesh of the Sathankulam police station on May 23 and tortured in connection with a murder case in which Mahendran’s brother, Durai, was a suspect. Her affidavit also names inspector Sridhar. Mahendran, a construction worker, was not an accused in the case, she added. Sridhar and Raghu Ganesh along with three other policemen are charged with the murder of the father and son duo and are currently lodged in the Madurai central prison.According to an affidavit filed by Vadivu, sub inspector Raghu Ganesh along with few other cops visited her house on May 22, searching for Durai as they suspected his involvement in the murder of a certain Jeyakumar on May 18 in Peikulam. On May 23 at 2 am, the police landed up at Mahendran’s aunt’s house. “They dragged my younger son Mahendran out and started to beat him brutally all over the body, including his private parts,” the affidavit said. “The policemen attacked him in his head also and he sustained head injury. Raghu Ganesh dragged him to the police station (Sathankulam) saying that he will not release him unless Durai surrenders and kept my son illegally.” Depending on his work Mahendran would stay in Peikulam (in Sathankulam) with his mother, or at his aunt’s home in Papanakulam, Thoothukudi. His father died in 2009 while his brother Durai, 35, and sister Santhanam, 30, are married and live in neighbouring villages.Mahendran was let off after a day in police custody and his mother took him to the Thoothukudi government hospital on June 11 after he couldn’t move his right hand and complained of headaches. A scan revealed that he had suffered brain injury, and he died two days later.“They are a very poor family and were too scared to go to the police to file an FIR or even ask for a post-mortem report,” Mahendran's paternal uncle M Perumal told HT. “As per medical reports the death of my son was due to a blood clot in his brain which happened only due to the brutal attack by Raghu Ganesh and Inspector Sridhar (who is also arrested for Bennicks’ murder),” Vadivu’s affidavit stated. The Crime Branch, Criminal Investigation Department (CB-CID) charged five policemen with the murder of Bennicks and Jayaraj, who died on June 22 and 23 respectively. Five more policemen were arrested on Wednesday for wrongful confinement, among other sections of the Indian Penal Code. The father and son were arrested for keeping their mobile repair shop open beyond the curfew imposed due to the lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). On Wednesday, the Central Bureau of Investigation sent a team to the state to take over the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-cops-named-in-case-being-probed-for-one-more-custodial-killing/story-bbI5i2YPEGJOZkwVYGdtEJ.html
09-07-2020||India||CBI takes over probe, files first FIRs in Tamil Nadu torture case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has taken over the probe into the alleged torture and custodial killings of a 59-year-old man and his son at a police station in Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi district late last month. P Jayaraj and J Bennicks, 31, were arrested on June 19 and allegedly tortured for keeping their shop open in violation of restrictions imposed in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. They were admitted to the Kovilpatti government hospital on June 22 after being allegedly tortured through the night in custody. Bennicks died on the same night, while Jayaraj passed away on June 23. The alleged custodial killings triggered outrage across the country.CBI registered two cases on Tuesday based on Tamil Nadu police’s First Information Reports in the case. “CBI has taken over the investigation of these cases... and constituted a team. The team is being proceeded to the said place [Tamil Nadu] for investigation,” said CBI spokesperson RK Gaur.The special team from Delhi will question the five police personnel arrested for the alleged murders and take them into custody. The five include an inspector. On Wednesday, five more police officials were arrested. They have been charged with wrongful confinement and disappearing of evidence, among other sections.CBI officials said that they will first collect forensic evidence from the police station with the help of experts and then collect the case documents.The federal agency took over the case days after Tamil Nadu chief minister K Palaniswami wrote to Union home minister Amit Shah and sought a CBI probe into the deaths amid the outrage.A policewoman is the only eyewitness in the case. She told judicial magistrate M S Barathidasan, who investigated the incident, that the two were beaten through the night on June 19. The Madras high court on June 30 said there are prima-facie grounds to book the policemen at the Sathankulam police station for Jayaraj and Bennicks’s murder. It made the observation after going through preliminary post-mortem reports as well as the judicial magistrate’s report. The magistrate’s report said the two were thrashed through the night with sticks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-takes-over-probe-files-first-firs-in-tamil-nadu-torture-case/story-YVMhFc9AYAGlTo3MiO6FUJ.html
09-07-2020||India||Kerala CM seeks central probe into gold smuggling as Oppn questions state’s role||Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi Wednesday seeking an investigation by central agencies on the large quantity of gold that was seized by Customs officials on July 5, even as the Union minister of state for external affairs urged the Kerala state government to clarify its role.“The fact that the attempt to smuggle huge quantity of gold was concealed in diplomatic baggage makes the matter extremely serious…The case has serious implications as this undermines the economy of the Nation. In fact, it has more than one angle warranting a thorough investigation. It is requested that an effective and coordinated investigation into this incident by all central agencies concerned is the need of the hour,” Vijayan wrote. On July 5, the customs department had seized the gold from an air cargo consignment from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to the country’s consulate in the state capital of Thiruvananthapuram. The action came after a green light from the ministry of external affairs.The Kerala government on Tuesday transferred its information technology secretary, M Sivasankar, a day after the dismissal of IT consultant Swapna Suresh, whom Sivasankar knew, amid allegations of her links to a gold smuggling racket.Swapna Suresh, who was working as the operational manager of the Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited under the state IT ministry, is said to be on the run after the seizure even as the Customs department has intensified its search for her.The transfer of M Sivasankar, a senior Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer who is also a secretary to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, came after opposition parties in the state stepped up pressure.Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan on Wednesday said there was a serious lapse on the part of the state government.“Our investigation is on. We will also bring to light those who helped smugglers. The main accused [Swapna Suresh] was given a plum posting when she was mired in another cheating case. Often she was treated more than a high-ranking diplomat and after her role came to light now the CM says he has no idea how she got the job,” he said.As the opposition BJP and Congress stepped up pressure seeking the resignation of the CM, state industry minister E P Jayarajan said this was a move to discredit the popularity of the CM and the state’s fight against the pandemic. “Opposition parties are worried over the popularity of the state. That is why they are raking issues to target the government,” Jayarajan said.Sarith Kumar, an accused in the case who had previously worked as a public relations officer (PRO) in UAE Consulate-General’s office in Thiruvananthapuram was arrested on Monday and remanded to 14 days.Earlier this week, Sivasankar had said that he was ready for any investigation and would share all information with the customs department.A petition was filed on Wednesday before Kerala High Court seeking a probe by central agencies into the case of gold smuggling through a diplomatic channel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-seeks-central-probe-into-gold-smuggling-as-oppn-questions-state-s-role/story-FwAXhtsn6Su5yTOPGJHU5M.html

His extradition proceedings are pending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-confiscates-nirav-modi-s-assets-valued-at-329-crore/story-WLr6JOXRWKeu15MgmbltaL.html
09-07-2020||India||Army directs soldiers to delete 89 apps over security concerns||The Indian Army has asked soldiers to delete 89 apps from their smart phones including Facebook, Instagram, SnapChat and several apps already banned by the government, people familiar with the developments said on Wednesday, speaking on the condition of anonymity.The apps, including dating apps such as Tinder, OkCupid and Couch Surfing, have been banned for security reasons, they said. The social media apps that are a no-go area for soldiers include messaging platforms, video-hosting sites, gaming and dating apps, and also some e-commerce options, the people said.The apps that are of bounds for the India Army now include WeChat, Viber, Zoom, Vigo Video, Cam Scanner and gaming app PUBG. “Such guidelines are issued periodically. These are more significant now in the context of the current border tensions and the need to secure information,” the officials said.The apps banned by the army are not limited to the 59 Chinese mobile applications banned by the government. The Chinese apps earlier banned are Club Factory, SHAREit, Likee, Mi Video Call (Xiaomi), Weibo, Baidu and Bigo Live. They have been removed from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store for India. China has strongly reacted to India’s move to ban 59 mobile applications last month, most of which are linked to China. The Indian government’s decision was based on security concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-directs-soldiers-to-delete-89-apps-over-security-concerns/story-dUi0qtcqjz8v2WTGU5yNRI.html
09-07-2020||India||India backs Bangladesh efforts to repatriate Rohingya home||India has acknowledged the urgency on the issue of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh and backed efforts for their early, safe and sustainable repatriation to Rakhine state in Myanmar.India’s position was conveyed in a letter written by external affairs minister S Jaishankar to his Bangladesh counterpart AK Abdul Momen on July 2. Jaishankar expressed India’s appreciation for the “humanistic spirit of the government and the people of Bangladesh in hosting displaced people from the Rakhine state of Myanmar”.“As a neighbour of both Bangladesh and Myanmar, we fully understand the urgency of this issue and an early, safe (and) sustainable repatriation of displaced persons from Rakhine is in the collective interest of all,” said the letter which was accessed by HT.India has maintained a cautious position on the Rohingya refugees in view of its good relations with both Bangladesh and Myanmar.In recent years, India has strengthened connectivity and trade with Bangladesh and also stepped up security cooperation. Bangladesh, on its part, has urged India to impress on Myanmar the need to begin the process of repatriating nearly one million Rohingya refugees living in massive camps at places such as Cox’s Bazar.India, which depends on security cooperation with Myanmar to curb the activities of militant groups in its northeastern states, has so far been reluctant to push the issue of the Rohingya refugees.Jaishankar wrote the letter in response to the congratulations offered by Momen for India’s recent election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the 2021-22 term. He also thanked Bangladesh for its support for India’s candidature.He also reassured Momen of India’s “steadfast and continued support to the government and people of Bangladesh” in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-backs-b-desh-efforts-to-repatriate-rohingya-home/story-md0slAvgkV9Yz7Dy9QvvYI.html
09-07-2020||India||Those fighting for truth are not intimidated: Cong on RGF probe||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday led the party’s counter-attack on the government for setting up a committee to look into the alleged violation of various laws by three Nehru-Gandhi family linked trusts, as he accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of “intimidating those who fight for truth”.Hours after the Union home ministry set up an interministerial committee to coordinate investigations into alleged violation of various legal provisions of money laundering act, Income Tax Act and foreign contribution act by Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF), Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust (RGCT) and Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust (IGMT), Gandhi took to twitter to attack the Prime Minister, without directly referring to the government decision. “Mr Modi believes the world is like him. He thinks every one has a price or can be intimidated. He will never understand that those who fight for the truth have no price and cannot be intimidated,” the former Congress chief tweeted.His party colleagues, earlier in the day, accused the government of carrying out a “blind witch hunt” against it and applying “double standards” by not questioning “holy cows” associated with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said the trusts have nothing to fear and will answer every question like law-abiding persons. He dared the government to deploy all its machinery in probing the financial sources of the three trusts, and said they would answer each question as “law-abiding persons”. Addressing a virtual press conference, Singhvi said, “You (the government) need to be exposed fully because you don’t even ask these questions of many blue-eyed sanctified holy cows. You are harassing each opposition segment, individual and institutional, but not your holy cows. Whose special arc of protection they have,” he asked while referring to the Vivekananda Foundation, the India Foundation, Overseas Friends of BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), the ideological mentor of the ruling party. Such entities are not asked questions about the 9th Schedule exemptions unlike the Gandhi-family run trusts, added Singhvi.Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan tweeted, “The greatest irony is that the Prince from the mega-factory of corruption whose ‘family’ put a price on everything they could lay their hands on and intimidated anyone coming in their way of power continues to sling mud on others. Introspection is not a lost art @RahulGandhi ji”.A second BJP leader said VIF does not accept any foreign donations and RSS is not a public foundation similar to the RGF.Earlier in the day BJP general secretary Murlidhar Rao said investigation is not politically motivated.“Activities of the RGF is in the public domain. There are many aspects to it, related to FRCA, income tax audit etc. Modi government believes in transparency. We are committed to it, so it is natural to have investigation. No foundations are private, and the investigation are in public interest. If it (investigation) was political (motivated) would we have waited six years?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/those-fighting-for-truth-are-not-intimidated-cong-on-rgf-probe/story-8fMbrHameYhWUQOuwJjy4H.html
09-07-2020||India||Pak forcing Jadhav not to file review petition: India||India on Wednesday accused Pakistan of coercing Kulbushan Jadhav, a former naval officer sentenced to death on charges of spying, not to file a petition seeking a review of his case and of not complying with the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) verdict to review his conviction.New Delhi’s response came hours after senior officials in the Pakistani capital claimed Jadhav had refused to file an appeal in the Islamabad high court against the death sentence given by a military court despite an offer to do so.Pakistan also offered consular access to Jadhav and to arrange a meeting between him and his father and wife, though there was no immediate response from the Indian side.Jadhav was arrested by Pakistani security agencies in Balochistan in March 2016 and charged with involvement in spying. In April 2017, Pakistan announced he had been sentenced to death by a military court.The ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan had violated Jadhav’s rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and stayed his execution while calling on Islamabad to take all steps for an “effective review and reconsideration” of his sentence, including “enacting appropriate legislation”.The Pakistan government promulgated an ordinance on May 20 allowing Jadhav, his legal representative or the Indian government to file a review petition in the Islamabad high court within 60 days, which will end on July 19, additional attorney general Ahmed Irfan and Zahid Hafeez Chaudhry, director general (South Asia) in the Foreign Office, told a news conference in Islamabad on Wednesday.“Exercising his legal right...Jadav refused to file a petition for the review and reconsideration of his sentence and conviction. He instead preferred to follow up his pending mercy petition,” said Irfan, adding Pakistan has written to the Indian mission to file a petition in the high court before the deadline.In New Delhi, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava described Pakistan’s position as an attempt to “mask its continuing reticence to implement the ICJ judgment in letter and spirit”.“Pakistan’s claim that Jadhav...has refused to initiate a review petition is a continuation of the farce that has been in play for the last four years. Jadhav has been sentenced to execution through a farcical trial. He remains under custody of Pakistan’s military. He has clearly been coerced to refuse to file a review in his case,” he said.Srivastava noted that Pakistan passed the ordinance in May to allow the high court to review the sentence after maintaining for long that its laws allowed for effective reconsideration.“Now, after almost a year, they have made a U-turn and issued an ordinance to ostensibly provide for some sort of review. We have already expressed our serious concerns at the content of the ordinance and how it violates the ICJ judgment. Pakistan is only seeking to create an illusion of remedy,” he added.India has pushed for the full implementation of ICJ’s judgment and sought “unimpeded access to Jadhav to discuss his remedies under the ordinance”, he said.Srivastava described the latest turn of events as a “brazen attempt to scuttle even the inadequate remedy under the ordinance” since Pakistan has “obviously coerced Jadhav to forego his rights” to seek implementation of the ICJ judgment.Despite India’s repeated requests, Pakistan has denied free and unimpeded access to Jadhav, he said. India has repeatedly asked for a lawyer from outside Pakistan to be allowed to appear for Jadhav in any review proceedings but Pakistan has denied this, he added.Since 2017, when the military court carried out its trial, Pakistan has refused to hand over any documents, including the FIR, evidence or court order. “Clearly, Pakistan is attempting to create a mirage of compliance with the ICJ judgment,” Srivastava said.Noting that ICJ has already said Pakistan is in “egregious violation of international law”, Srivastava said the Indian government will do its utmost to protect Jadhav and ensure his safe return home. “To that end, it would consider all appropriate options,” he said.The Pakistani officials referred to India’s request to allow an Indian lawyer to represent Jadhav and said only a lawyer holding a licence of the Islamabad high court can appear in the proceedings. An Indian lawyer cannot appear for Jadhav but may be allowed to assist his counsel, they said.The officials said Pakistan had allowed consular access to Jadhav twice and offered to do so again. It has also offered to arrange a meeting between Jadhav and his father and wife, they said, adding Jadhav’s mother and wife were earlier allowed to meet him in December 2017.Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesperson also said late on Wednesday that Jadhav’s mercy petition is a separate matter that isn’t connected to the review process. While Jadhav’s mercy petition is pending, “India is invited to file review and reconsideration petition to give effect to the judgement of ICJ”, the spokesperson said.After the Pakistan Army chief endorsed the death penalty for Jadhav in April 2017, he filed a mercy petition in June the same year. The current status of this petition is not known.India has rejected the allegations against Jadhav and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-forcing-jadhav-not-to-file-review-petition-india/story-iZFhdLu1w3IKiLVWZjfhHI.html
09-07-2020||India||Cong questions disengagement process along LAC||The Congress on Wednesday posed a set of questions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the disengagement process agreed to by the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA), and objected to the creation of a “buffer zone” on India’s side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.“Dear PM, National Security is sacrosanct. Territorial Integrity is non-negotiable. Pl answer-: 1. Is it correct that under the new protocol with #China, Indian Forces can’t patrol PP-14(Galwan Valley), PP-15(Hot Springs) & PP-17(Gogra)?,” the party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala asked on Twitter.He also tagged a Hindustan Times report, published on Wednesday, about the focus on patrolling in the area.“Is it not true that there has never been dispute with #China on alignment of LAC in these three areas of Galwan Valley, Hot Spring & Gogra? (See Gen DS Hooda’s comment),” Surjewala said in another tweet, referring to a comment by former Northern Army Commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd) in the report.The PLA has withdrawn up to 2km from Patrolling Point 15 (Hot Springs) and a similar retreat is expected to be completed at PP-17 (Gogra) by Wednesday evening, with the Indian Army pulling back proportionately.The disengagement is based on an understanding reached by top Indian and Chinese military commanders and the Special Representatives of the two countries, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and China’s foreign minister Wang Yi on a phased de-escalation of the ongoing border conflict in the Ladakh theatre, the report said.The Bharatiya Janata Party did not respond to Surjewala’s questions, and declined to comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-questions-disengagement-process-along-lac/story-UzuQShpHB2XiQXqfzQvE0K.html
09-07-2020||India||Fully prepared to deal with any rise in Covid-19 cases, says Goa CM||Goa has reported a surge in Covid-19 cases after doing well initially in checking the spread of the pandemic. Pramod Sawant, the Goa chief minister, spoke to HT about the pandemic, and opposition to approval of infrastructure projects in the state. Edited excerpts: Goa has low positivity and high testing rates compared to the national average and yet the cases are rising? What has gone wrong?Our testing rate is very high compared to the rest of the country and the recovery rate is over 50% with 936 patients having recovered. We are providing very good treatment. Symptomatic patients are being admitted to the [dedicated] Covid-19 Hospital, which has a capacity for 250 patients. Asymptomatic patients are being admitted to the Covid-19 care centres with 1,500 beds. We are creating awareness about wearing face masks and everyone including me, our administrative staff, health department officials, and police department officials are in the field. Is the government prepared for a bigger surge?We are fully prepared. ...there are facilities [to deal with] any rise in the number of cases. We have a capacity of 2,500 [hospital beds] and if necessary, we will increase them. We have ventilator and ICU [intensive care unit] facilities which can also be increased. If required, we will establish one more Covid-19 hospital in the state. The pandemic has hit Goa hard financially and forced it to go for unprecedented borrowing, (₹900 crore in the first quarter). How far have the austerity measures helped? Only time will tell how much. We are taking austerity measures and have reduced expenditure of all departments. How would you respond to criticism over clearance granted to three infrastructure projects, including a railway line double-tracking, in reserve forests?This [railway] project was sanctioned by the earlier government. It came before us for the no-objection certificate (NOC). For the state’s development, we gave the NOC. ...all the mitigation measures like underpasses for wildlife, wherever required, would be implemented.But now with the opposition mounting pressure, you also agreed to a resurvey...It is always so. When any development [proposal] comes, people have questions. We are not doing a resurvey but [ascertaining] what exactly the facts are…You inherited a cabinet, which included ministers senior to you. How have you been dealing with this?No minister is putting any pressure on me. Everything is going well in coordination with all ministers. They all are supporting me in whatever work I am doing either in the Covid-19 management or in other matters. In coordination with the health minister, we are doing a very good job with the management. Besides 2-3 ministers, who are senior legislators, the others became MLAs [members of legislative assembly] along with me. I have a good working relationship with all [ministers].||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fully-prepared-to-deal-with-any-rise-goa-cm/story-MDMa6HKmXEGSnNnyElx8hL.html
09-07-2020||India||AIIMS supports state docs through tele-consultation||Seeking to reduce the number of deaths among coronavirus disease patients, the Union health ministry has asked specialists from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi to guide doctors in state hospitals treating Covid-19 cases admitted in intensive care units (ICU) through tele-consultation.The first batch of doctors from 10 state-run hospitals, of which nine were in Mumbai and one in Goa, were trained by the specialists on Wednesday.“Tele-consultation is a critical component of the clinical intervention protocol for Covid-19. A specialist team of doctors from AIIMS, New Delhi shall provide guidance on effective clinical management of COVID-19 patients in the ICUs of different State hospitals through tele/video consultation. They will handhold the states in clinical management of COVID-19 patients to reduce the case fatality rate,” the health ministry said in a statement.The consultation will be conducted for select hospitals twice every week, on Tuesdays and Fridays. The hospitals selected for consultation will have 1,000 or more beds for Covid-19 patients, including isolation beds, oxygen-supported and ICU beds. Most experts say it is a good idea to be able to handhold peripheral hospitals in managing critical patients.“We do not have adequate number of critical care specialists in the country. Most of those managing critical patients, especially in case of Covid-19, are physicians, and it will work better if they get guidance from a specialist. At Medanta also we provide tele-consultation to peripheral hospitals and it works well. In countries like US also; e-ICUs is a growing concept,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, critical care department, Medanta Hospital. Dr Nikhil Tandon, professor, department of endocrinology, AIIMS, Delhi, said tele-consultation can help scale up outreach in a pandemic. “At AIIMS, we have started the facility quite effectively, especially for follow-up patients. In a lot of departments such as derma and medicine, it has worked very well,” he said. The first session of this exercise began on Wednesday afternoon, and was led by Dr Anand Mohan, head of pulmonary medicine department, AIIMS, Delhi. The hospitals that were chosen include Nair Hospital; MCGM Seven Hills; Mumbai Metro Dahisar Jumbo Facility, Jio Convention Centre Jumbo Facility; NESCO Jumbo Facility, P South (Phase II); and Government Medical College and Hospital, Panaji, Goa. The facility will be extended to another 61 hospitals with a bed capacity ranging from 500-1,000 on twice-a-week basis. A calendar of tele-consultation sessions has been drawn up to cover the states till July 31. A total of 17 such states will be covered: Delhi, Gujarat, Telangana, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Bihar, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Jharkhand and Maharashtra. Up to two doctors handling ICU patients from each hospital along with the director general of health services of the state concerned will participate in the sessions. Some experts cautioned that tele-consultation has its limitations. “To some extent, in dealing with smaller problems, it can work well, but can’t say the same for handling larger medical problems. There are limitations,” said Dr Arup Basu, senior consultant, chest medicine department, Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiims-supports-state-docs-through-tele-consultation/story-EJnnHpmOyQDOFU9RLvPS5H.html
09-07-2020||India||UGC issues detailed procedure for conducting exams amid Covid-19||The University Grants Commission (UGC) on Wednesday released a detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) on how to conduct tests in the midst of a global pandemic, stating that students with cold, cough, fever or other symptoms of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) should be given a chance to sit for their exam on another day, or at the very least be made to sit in another room to write the paper.The UGC, which has mandated that all varsities hold final year exams by September 30, said that a minimum distance of two meters between candidates should be maintained, and invigilators should wear masks and gloves.In a letter to all 40 central varsities sent out on Wednesday, the UGC said that the Human Resources Development ministry had formulated the SOP, and it has been vetted by the Health ministry.The SOP clarified that in areas where movement is restricted such as in containment zones, students’ admit cards or student identity cards could double as travel passes. States should issue instructions to ensure that invigilators are issued passes as well, it stated.Exam functionaries would have to submit a self-declaration form about their health status and thermo-gun checks should be made available at all entrances. In case any functionary fails the self-declaration criteria or the thermo-gun check, they should be asked to leave the exam centre immediately.There should be signs on social distancing in the campuses of exam centres, and the SOP recommended that everyone involved in the exam process use the Aarogya Setu app on their mobile phones.The SOP further said that all floors, gates, walls, doors, furniture, elevators and even staircase railings in an examination centre would have to be disinfected. Sanitisers and liquid handwash dispensers would have to be placed at the entrance and other places in the exam centre.Crowds must be avoided at entrance and exit points, the SOP said. It further stated that records of exam functionaries and students should be maintained in case contact tracing needed to be done in the future.COVID-19 has played havoc with the academic year. In a move backed by Human resources development minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, the UGC decided that exams were a must for all final year students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ugc-issues-procedure-for-conducting-exams/story-EsOd3EdLFjRxhWrZrGz3LO.html
09-07-2020||India||Demand for MGNREGS exceeds govt estimates||In the past two months, work granted under India’s flagship rural job guarantee programme has surpassed the government’s estimates, indicating immense demand and lack of alternative livelihoods following the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and the subsequent lockdown that forced an exodus of millions of migrant workers employed in the cities back home to the hinterland.From a tepid start in April—a large part of it was lost in sweeping lockdown measures—the generation of persondays under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) bounced back in May and June as the return of migrant workers caused demand for work under the programme to soar. The rural development ministry had made an early estimate at the beginning of FY 2020-21 on the generation of persondays of work under MGNREGS over different months. According to the official estimate, 679.8 million persondays of work had been expected to be logged at the end of May. But actual persondays generated until May stood at 709.4 million.Similarly, 1.255 billion persondays of work was done up to June as against the initial estimate of 1.102 billion, government data shows. According to senior officials,who requested anonymity, the trend underlines how the prolonged pandemic has led to delayed recovery of economic activities, forcing rural jobless to settle for work under the rural jobs scheme, which guarantees 100 days of work a year to at least one member of every rural household.The government’s estimate for July too, may be outpaced by increasing demand. Until the first week of the month itself, 1.257 billion persondays have been generated while the estimate up to July was 1.359 billion This massive pressure on MGNREGS may also lead to a shortage of funds for the programme, experts feel. The world’s biggest job guarantee programme has been allocated more than Rs 1 lakh crore for this fiscal year, with Rs 40,000 crore added as a part of the Centre’s Garib Kalyan package. A closer look at government data also shows that the surge in demand for jobs under the MGNREGS is directly related to the states that have received a large number of migrant labourers who left the cities. Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand have seen the number of persondays of work generated by MGNREGS soaring .In Bijhar, the number of persondays increased to 75.4 million up to June against an estimated 60 million. In Uttar Pradesh—home to the highest number of returnee migrant workers—the figure doubled to 146 million against an estimated 70 million. Madhya Pradesh has seen 17 million additional persondays of work and Odisha 23 million. An official maintained that it may not be feasible to pump all government resources into MGNREGS and the need of the hour is to open up more work opportunities. He also hoped that the recently announced Rozgar scheme,under which work worth Rs 50,000 crore will be is generated for migrant workers who have returned home would lessen the pressure on MGNREGS. “MGNREGS is anyway demand-driven and works of Swachh Bharat were already included. Creating job opportunities for unskilled workers is good but the main question is, where is the money? The government has hiked MGNREGS budget by Rs 40,000 crore but the budget won’t be sufficient for the entire year given the very high demand for work,” Himanshu,an associate professor with Jawaharlal Nehru University, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/demand-for-mgnregs-exceeds-govt-estimates/story-4HxRmbXDqnIhAQ4h315xGI.html
09-07-2020||India||Cabinet approves agri fund, rental scheme for migrants||The cabinet on Wednesday approved an agriculture infrastructure fund worth Rs 1 lakh crore, by far the National Democratic Alliance government’s largest federally funded programme in the farm sector, and green-lighted an affordable rental housing scheme for migrant workers, millions of whom left cities and returned home to the hinterland in the aftermath of the coronavirus disease pandemic and the lockdown imposed to stop its spread.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced both plans in May as part of the Rs 20 lakh crore economic stimulus and relief package announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to fight the slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown. The fund, in the form of special loans with discounted interest rates, is meant for farm entrepreneurs, aggregators of farm produce and for building infrastructure such as refrigerated storage, markets and farm supply chains. The scheme running the fund shall begin in this fiscal year and end in 2029.While announcing the fund, the finance minister said the loans would benefit private agricultural entrepreneurs and start-ups that aimed to buy the produce of farmers and aim to reach global markets, but which did not have the infrastructure. “This fund will immediately address the issue. It will be created at the earliest,” she said on May 15.The total credit will be disbursed over four years, starting with an initial sanction of Rs 10,000 crore in the current financial year and Rs. 30,000 crore each in the next three fiscal years.The Rs 1 lakh crore fund, aimed at boosting farm infrastructure and logistics, will offer medium to long term debt facility for investment in harvest management projects and community farming assets. It will work on a model of discounts on interest along with financial support, a Cabinet note said.All loans under the fund will have interest discount of 3% per year up to a limit of Rs 2 crore. This benefit of this discount will be available for a maximum period of seven years. Also, credit guarantee coverage – where loans are underwritten -- will be available for eligible borrowers under the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises scheme for loans up to Rs 2 crore. The infusion of Rs 1 lakh crore in the rural-agri infrastructure space will generate rural employment and reduce farm wastage, according to Arindam Guha, partner and leader, government and public sector, Deloitte India. The cabinet also approved the development of affordable rental housing complexes for urban migrant poor as a “sub-scheme” under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana -- Urban (PMAY–U) . Existing vacant government funded housing complexes will be used for the scheme through concession agreements for 25 years. The housing scheme for urban poor entails a funding of Rs 600 crore, which will be released for projects with innovative technologies for construction. The government hopes the scheme will benefit nearly 300,000 migrant poor.Existing and vacant government-funded housing complexes will be converted into such complexes. Concessionaires will make the complexes livable by undertaking repair and maintenance and filling gaps in infrastructure including water and drainage connections and roads. Special incentives such as permission to use existing vacant land, 50% additional Floor Area Ratio or Floor Space Index, concessional loans at priority sector lending rates and tax relief at par with those offered to affordable housing will be given to private and public entities to develop such complexes. According to internal ministry data accessed by HT, 1.2 million government houses are available; they were built under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), PMAY and housing schemes of state governments. Of these, Maharastra has the maximum number of dwelling units available ( 35,000) and Delhi has 30,000 houses, officials aware of the development said on condition of anonymity.The Centre will also be issuing model tenancy agreement guidelines which the states can follow, they added . Millions of migrant workers who either lost their jobs or were concerned about losing their livelihoods left the cities in an exodus to their homes in states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand and West Bengal after the post-Covid-19 lockdown’s enforcement on March 25. Many complained that they were under pressure from landlords to vacate their rented houses. “The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in massive reverse migration of workers/ urban poor in the country who come from rural areas or small towns for seeking better employment opportunities in urban areas. Usually, these migrants live in slums, informal/ unauthorized colonies or peri-urban areas to save rental charges. They spend a lot of time on roads by walking/ cycling to workplaces, risking their lives to cut on the expenses,” the ministry of housing and urban affairs said in a statement.“A large part of workforce in manufacturing industries, service providers in hospitality, health, domestic/commercial establishments, and construction or other sectors, labourers, students etc who come from rural areas or small towns seeking better opportunities will be the target beneficiary under affordable rental housing complexes ,” it added. The affordable rental housing scheme will strengthen the government’s commitment of Housing for All, said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-approves-agri-fund-rental-scheme-for-migrants/story-Cuy3H22YZNqzhhR3z1tXbK.html

Congress, Communist Party of India (CPI), Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI (M), Rashtriya Janata Dal and Trinamool Congress have all written to the chief election commissioner (CEC) to review the move. The controversy started last week when CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the amendment will “help the ruling party.” Following Yechury’s comments, Congress sent a representation to CEC Sunil Arora to review the decision.“The manner in which this decision has been taken demonstrates a complete non-application of mind and a shocking circumvention of any consultation process with the key stakeholders (i.e. any other political parties other than the ruling regime). Even upon a cursory examination, the numerous legal deficiencies in this decision become apparent,” the Congress said in its representation.Bihar is due to go to the polls later this year. The state is ruled by a coalition of the Janata Dal (United) and the Bharatiya Janata Party. In February, Delhi became the first state to experiment with postal ballots, extending the facility to those with severe disabilities or above the age of 80 years.Earlier, casting votes through postal ballots was an option available only to the armed forces and officials assigned poll duties.Yechury said that extending the postal ballot would give the ruling party an edge and that wider consultations with political parties were needed. The Commission responded to Yechury on Wednesday, stating that the chief electoral officer of Bihar had held consultations with various political parties before the decision was taken.EC officials told Hindustan Times that they had heard the parties’ representation with an “open mind”. “Everyone is entitled to a viewpoint,” an official had earlier told Hindustan Times on condition of anonymity. “State and district-level talks were held before the decision was taken. This is an enabling provision.”The official further added that same practice had been tested in the Jharkhand and Delhi elections. “No one opposed it then, why now,” the official had said. CPI General Secretary D. Raja said the digital propaganda during the election campaign will be extremely expensive, and it will deprive political parties of a level-playing field. “It (the postal ballot) will lead to malpractice and foul play by those parties that are in power and have resources. These two proposals, if accepted, will definitely jeopardise the democratic process of free and fair elections,” Raja wrote to the Commission. He asked the commission to hold wider and transparent consultations with all political parties.The Trinamool Congress also wrote to the Commission, saying the move of wanting those over 65 years of age to vote through postal ballots is arbitrary, mala fide, unconstitutional and ex-facie, a violation of secrecy of vote, right to free and fair elections and right to health. “Our party is of the opinion that this amendment, issued without adequate consultation with the political parties, is antithetical to a robust and inclusive democracy,” the party said in its letter.“This amendment seeks to effectively disenfranchise those above the age of 65 from exercising their right to vote while denying them a fair, equal and reasonable chance to participate in elections,” party general secretary Subrata Bakshi wrote. The RJD too joined the chorus, with spokesperson Manoj Jha writing to the CEC. “We primarily opposed the manner in which the decision was taken,” Jha said. “With the postal ballot for those over 65, the ruling party will get an edge. There is a grey area which shouldn’t be there.” Former CEC SY Quraishi, however, says that the secrecy of the vote will not be compromised because of the postal ballot. “People over the age of 65 are not allowed to move out {because of Covid-19}, so the decision to allow them to vote using postal ballots is reasonably justified. It is logical,” Quraishi said.“The Commission always works with the cooperation of political parties, they call them and explain the rationale behind their decision,” he added. Another former CEC, who did not wish to be named, said that the reason the postal ballot had become a bone of contention was because there is a “trust deficit” when it comes to this government. “Everyone is suspicious of any decision as they don’t trust government enough,” said the former CEC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-polls-5-parties-protest-postal-ballot-move/story-INKaWI68MQPN9D1wSyz93N.html
09-07-2020||India||Police arrest Vikas Dubey’s 3 aides from Faridabad||It was around 12.30pm on Tuesday that Vikas Dubey, now being hunted for the murder of eight policemen who went to arrest him on July 3, checked out of a hotel in Faridabad’s Badhkal Chowk, seemingly always a step ahead of the police.Missing since the July 3 gunfight, Dubey is believed to have reached Faridabad sometime over the weekend to escape police in Uttar Pradesh, where he now has a bounty of Rs 5 lakh. In the NCR suburb, the gangster is believed to have stayed at multiple location, including first at a residence in Sector 87, form where three people were arrested on Wednesday. Among them was a man identified as Prabhat, who also goes by Kartikey, and is one of Dubey’s close aides to accompanied him from Kanpur. The other two were residents of the house, including one person who has tested positive for Covid, and are now under arrest for harbouring a fugitive. We received a tip-off about Dubey’s presence after which raids were carried out, said Anil Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (crime), Faridabad. According to him, UP police too was alerted and had arrived to scan CCTV footage and question the hotel staff. “Dubey was seen leaving alone. We received another secret information and crime teams worked on technical surveillance and a raid was conducted in Indira Complex in Sector 87 following which three close aides tried to escape the spot while firing at police teams but were arrested,” he said.Romi Passi, the manager of hotel Oyo Shri Sasaram said a man resembling Dubey left the hotel before the cops reached. “They checked in around 12:45 am and gave a copy of Aadhar card of Ankur Mishra who accompanied him, though the copy was not clear and I asked him to give me the original copy but he was not carrying it. He said he will arrange by morning as it was already too late,” he said adding that the duo took room number 208, on the second floor.Passi said on Tuesday afternoon around 12:30 pm, both left the hotel. “We were shocked to see news channel flashing news and picture of our hotel on the television screen. Before we could react or understand the matter, police teams reached and started investigating. I had never seen any poster or picture of the gangster so how would I know he is one of the most wanted criminals,” he said.According to officials in Faridabad police, who asked not to be named, close to 250 security cameras has been monitored to determine where Dubey may have gone. Police identified the people arrested from the Sector 87 house as Prabhat, who comes from Dubey’s village and Dubey’s relatives Ankur and Shravan Mishra. “We have recovered 44 live cartridges, four pistols of 9 mm and Rs 3,000 from the possession of the suspects including two pistols which were looted from the UP Police,” said Yadav.“Dubey left for Delhi as he suspected police was tracking his locations and he was willing to surrender before the Delhi court as he feared for his life and he told his aide that police will kill him in an encounter,” he added, citing the questioning of the people.After watching the CCTV footage, police officers said it is likely Dubey was wearing padding around his abdomen to avoid recognition. He did not remove his face mask even once to ensure he was not recognised by the hotel staff, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-arrest-dubey-s-3-aides-from-faridabad/story-QjRnZEbcamP0APDIyyzSrO.html
09-07-2020||India||Search for most-wanted UP gangster reaches Delhi||A manhunt for Vikas Dubey, the Uttar Pradesh-based gangster sought for the July 3 ambush that killed eight policemen, shifted to the National Capital Region on Wednesday even as police teams separately shot dead one of his top aides and arrested eight others – including two policemen – for helping or sheltering him.On Tuesday, Dubey was spotted at a hotel in Faridabad, the first time his whereabouts was known in what has been a game of cat and mouse since his escape from the scene of the predawn gunfight in a village near Kanpur last week. Dubey has till now stayed a step ahead of the cops, who have discovered his hideouts and his getaway vehicles but only after he left them. On Wednesday morning, a team of UP Police engaged Dubey’s accomplice, Amar Dubey, in a gunfight in Hamirpur. Amar Dubey succumbed to injuries hours later.Additional director general (ADG) of police, law and order, Prashant Kumar told reporters in Lucknow that the state police will ensure the strictest action against Vikas Dubey, “which will be cited as an example in the future”.“Amar Dubey, who carried a reward of ₹50,000 and was a co-accused in the FIR registered in connection with the killings of police personnel, was killed in an encounter at Maudaha village in Hamirpur district,” Kumar said.The July 3 murder and the escape that followed brought the spotlight back on law and order in Uttar Pradesh, with the police discovering that some among its own were feeding information to the gangster, possibly even playing a role in how the eight policemen walked into a trap since Dubey was tipped off about his impending arrest by the group. On Wednesday, the police arrested two sub-inspectors posted in Kanpur and are believed to have alerted Dubey. An official involved in the manhunt in NCR, while asking not to be named, said it is likely that the suspect is still being fed information from inside the police since he seems to be leaving his hideouts shortly before raids are carries out. In the Capital, security was increased in Noida after reports poured in about Dubey planning to surrender at the studio of a TV news channel. This came hours after police disclosed that the gangster had arrived in Faridabad on Monday, at one point checking into a hotel where CCTV footage showed him dressed in a dark black T-shirt, a pair of jeans, and a mask.Police in Faridabad also detained an accomplice of Dubey’s who had been with him when the gunfight took place, as well as two relatives at whose residence the gangster stayed. “We received secret information and crime teams worked on technical surveillance and a raid was conducted in Indira Complex in Sector 87 following which three close aides tried to escape the spot while firing at police teams but were arrested,” said Anil Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (crime), Faridabad.Officials in Lucknow slowly pieced together how Dubey escaped Kanpur: he and his aides first took motorcycles, before they hitched a ride on sand-laden trucks to reach close to Delhi. Dubey has nearly 60 criminal cases against him including murder and attempt to murder. On July 3, when the police personnel were on their way to his house to arrest him, his men took position on rooftops and opened fire, killing eight of the group: a deputy superintendent of police, three sub-inspectors and four constables. The state has since then raised the bounty on Dubey’s head to ₹5 lakh, and put posters with his face at all highway toll plazas.After Dubey was spotted in Faridabad, checking of vehicles and commuters was stepped up on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway, said police in Noida. Authorities also put up barricades around Noida’s Film City area after unconfirmed reports suggested he would surrender in front of a news channel “Dubey left for Delhi as he suspected police was tracking his locations and he was willing to surrender before the Delhi court as he feared for his life and he told his aide that police will kill him in an encounter,” said Faridabad ACP YadavPolice in Faridabad said they scanned close to 250 CCTV cameras but were yet to discover leads on where Dubey may have headed. In the footage from the hotel, police officials said, Dubey was wearing some sort of a padding around his abdomen to alter his appearance. Throughout the duration when he has been seen on camera, the gangster did not remove his face mask.The three suspects held from the Sector 87 house in Faridabad were produced before a court and Prabhat – who had accompanied Dubey from his village - -was taken on transit remand by Special Task Force (STF) of Uttar Pradesh while the two otherss were sent to 14-days judicial custody. Shravan Mishra, one of the two, tested positive for coronavirus and was placed in an isolation ward before being sent to jail, said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/search-for-most-wanted-up-gangster-reaches-delhi/story-UvEuTnqzyYjNBm0D9np53O.html

The effects of that are being seen in terms of declining positivity rate, new cases and hospital bed occupancy. By working together with industry stakeholders, the Delhi government is keen to come out stronger from the economic shock caused by Covid-19,” said Jasmine Shah, the head of the 12-member committee.Shah, who is also the vice-chairperson of the Dialogue and Development Commission, an advisory body to the Delhi government, said, “In the next three to six months, the focus will be on ensuring the survival of businesses and various industry sectors by revisiting licensing norms, simplifying Covid related regulations and taking measures to revive demand… Several industry members expressed the urgency of undertaking measures to revive demand by taking industry-specific measures such as permitting outdoor sitting and extending hours of operations of restaurants.”“In three years, the committee agreed to focus on revival of the business environment by accelerating the pending reforms related to ease of doing business. Key pending reforms are needed to be taken up now that would further improve the ease of doing business in Delhi and ensure a full economic revival from the impact of Covid-19, especially for MSMEs,” he said.Brijesh Goel, a member of the committee, who represents trade bodies, said, “Proposals on rebate on commercial power bills, at least for the lockdown period, and automatic renewal of all licences and no-objection certificates, including those in the areas of trade, factory operation, fire and environment, till March 31, 2021, were tabled in the meeting.”The committee has representatives from the government, municipal corporations and trade and industrial bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-panel-on-economic-recovery-to-focus-easing-licensing-norms/story-Awz2rEDGBinSSGizVN7FKP.html

I was surprised to witness the new normal and now we have to live with this god knows for how long. Now we give shots and retire to our respective rooms. No bonding and having lunch together anymore. We reach the sets and get sanitized from head to toe and our temperatures are recorded. But it’s good at the same time to be back to work,” said Vishal over the phone.Vishal, who made his debut with Crazy Stupid Ishq, feels that he has been lucky to get different characters. “I truly consider myself lucky for playing characters with different shades. My debut as a lead happened absolutely by chance. Then getting roles like Baldev Singh of ‘Ek Veer Ki Ardaas...Veera’ and Sagar in ‘Gangaa,’ where stories are well written and characters well sketched. Also, as an actor I believe in polishing ones skills all along the journey as you always learn and unlearn in life. Keeping this in mind, I have been part of a couple of theatre workshops too.”Currently, Vishal is all set for the launch of his new show where he plays a grey character. “This was a surprise for me too but the conviction producer Mamta (Y Patnaik) maam had in me got me on board to play an antagonist for the first time in the show ‘Ishq Mein Marjaawan. The character of Kabir is so different yet so similar to me that I completely enjoyed playing him. The show was suppose to go on air in March but due to Covid crisis all went on hold. Only now we have started to shoot again for further episodes.”Vishal was all geared up to also start an OTT series but that too went on hold. “For me playing lead is not a priority. I want to play characters where I am strong part of the story. This is what this OTT series is about. Sad that it couldn’t materialise till date due to the ongoing crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/good-to-be-back-to-work-vishal/story-IVaoKEmt6YAfMA0bTvYlTN.html

The district administration recently issued a letter saying those not doing their duties will be replaced. The activists have complained that they are overloaded with work. The state has a total of almost 50,000 ASHA workers who get Rs 2000 every month (divided equally between Centre and state government) apart from incentives for different procedures.Sarswati Punetha, an ASHA worker from Champawat, said: “ASHA workers here have been working continuously for the past three months. There are Covid-19 patients also at the quarantine centres posing a risk to our health, yet the government is not helping us. We are overworked and work without sanitisers, masks or gloves.”“Despite working so much we are now learning that ASHA workers will be replaced if we do not work properly,” she added.Apart from working in quarantine centres, ASHA workers also ensure vaccinations, institutional deliveries of pregnant women, the surveillance work of people returning to the state among other duties.Kamla Kunjwal, state president of Uttarakhand ASHA Workers Union, said: “ASHA workers are the frontline warriors in the state’s battle against Covid-19. We are not just monitoring those who have been quarantined but also doing our traditional duties. We demand that Rs 10,000 monthly Covid-19 allowance should be given to us in such a situation.”Kunjwal demanded that outstanding payment for the past three months should be given to the workers at the earliest.ASHA workers from Nainital recently staged a protest supporting workers from Champawat district.Last week, a delegation of ASHA workers met the director general of health regarding their demands of being given a proper honorarium like aanganwadi workers or other government professionals involved in ground level Covid-19 surveillance.Shiba Dubey, state head of ASHA Swasthya Karyakati Union associated with Centre of Indian Trade Union (CITU) said that they gave a memorandum to the director-general of health with their demands of giving an incentive to ASHA workers for their duty during Covid-19.“We were assured by the director-general that ASHA workers would be given an incentive. We have also demanded that ASHA workers should not be removed from their posts in Champawat district,” said Dubey.Dr RP Khanduri, chief medical officer of Champawat district said that no ASHA worker has been removed from their posts in the district.“We have not removed any ASHA workers in the district. They are working a lot and helping the health department in its fight against Covid-19. We have just issued an order saying that those who are not working will be replaced, but no action has been taken yet,” said Dr Khanduri.On June 26, honouring ASHA workers for their role in the state’s fight against Covid-19, the state government announced that it will give Rs 1,000 to every Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) and Aanganwadi workers in the state.(With inputs from Ankur Sharma in Haldwani)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/work-sans-masks-sanitisers-uttarakhand-asha-workers-seek-covid-allowance/story-Woa7pWPhjf8C3aoDd1hjtI.html
09-07-2020||India||Ecologists ask Javadekar to stop rail line across Western Ghats||New Delhi: A 20-year-old rail line project in the Western Ghats in Karnataka, which was rejected by several statutory bodies in the past and remained shelved amid fears the extent of irreparable damage it could cause to primary forests and unique biodiversity, has got the State Board for Wildlife (SBWL) authorities’ nod March 20, reversing its rejection move 11 days earlier.The SBWL approval was granted after the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL), under the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), started reviewing the rail project and asked about the reasons behind the inordinate delay in implementing it, documents suggest. However, the SBWL’s approval has raised several serious environmental concerns that had held up the project for the past two decades.At least 101 scientists have endorsed a letter written by 11 ecologists and wildlife biologists to the NBWL member-secretary and Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar on July 2, raising several concerns about the Hubballi Ankola Railway Line Project (HARP) in Karnataka, including irreversibly damaging forests, fragmenting wildlife habitats in the Western Ghats, a global biodiversity hotspot and a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) world heritage site.The project is likely to cone for NBWL’s nod before other requisite clearances are sought.The proposed rail track will pass through a wildlife corridor between Bedthi Conservation Reserve (BCR) and Kali Tiger Reserve (KTR), a natural habitat for many species, including tigers and elephants. The project involves deforestation of around 1.9 lakh trees.The habitat of Great Pied and Malabar Pied Hornbills, both keystone species -- species critical for the survival of other species in the region -- are likely to have a major impact due to the project.It also passes through habitats that host many endemic and endangered species such as the Malabar Tree Toad, cited the letter that has quoted from various peer-review papers in a bid to bolster their argument.The letter and details of the project are also published on Conservation India website that is spearheading a campaign to protect ecology.“No amount of mitigation will compensate for the damage to the ecosystem that will be lost for good. Ultimately, the well-being of local communities will be jeopardised,” the letter said.The Western Ghats Biodiversity Hotspot has already lost 33,000 square kilometres (km), or up to 40% of its forest cover, in the last 100 years, according to scientists.A significant proportion of this forest loss is attributed to linear projects such as power transmission lines, highways, and construction of dams.“The existing railway line (Tinai Ghat-Castlerock), located around 50 km north of the proposed site, along with several state roads and power lines have significantly contributed to fragmenting forests of the region and creating edges. Implementing HARP will create many more edges by splitting 10 large forest patches of conservation significance into 15 smaller patches,” said the letter, endorsed by over a hundred scientists from various research organisations.They have argued that mitigation measures would not be able to counter the ecological impacts.Earlier, this project was rejected by the Supreme Court (SC)-constituted Central Empowered Committee (CEC) in 2015 and by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in 2018, according to documents seen by HT.The MoEFCC’s Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) had also raised several issues regarding the project.“The CEC is of the considered view that the project would cause huge and irreparable damage to forests, wildlife and biodiversity of the Western Ghats, which would far outweigh the actual tangible benefits of the project. The CEC report was based on a number of hearings, documents, and meetings with various senior Karnataka government officials,” the CEC had said while rejecting HARP.A MoEFCC letter to principal secretary (forests) Karnataka dated September 29, 2018, had stated that a site inspection committee of NTCA has rejected the project because out of the six tiger occupied landscapes in India, Western Ghats tops on habitat connectivity and contiguity counts.The project has come up, pending NBWL and other national-level approvals, despite a spate of rejections in the past.HT has seen the minutes of Karnataka SBWL meeting, which suggests that the project was rejected unanimously by board members and special invitees on March 9.The minutes suggest that a majority of SBWL members had opposed the project.The additional chief secretary (ACS), forests, Karnataka had said since the rail network is already strengthened between Tinnaighat-Castlerock-Caranzol, HARP is redundant.Karnataka chief secretary (CS), who was the special invitee in the SBWL meeting, cited the Centre’s enquiry regarding the delay in the project’s implementation.In the March 20 meeting, the Board contradicted its own decision.The minutes show that a number of special invitees attended the meeting, including the state minister of industries and the CS along with chief minister BS Yediyurappa.The Board recommended the project in view of development in north Karnataka region.Environmentalists have found holes in SBWL’s nod to the project.“The decision taken on March 9 to reject the proposal was in conformity with legal and statutory procedures. However, hand-picked Special Invitees with no expertise in wildlife were allowed to deliberate at a hurriedly convened meeting on March 20 violating all procedural norms. This smacks of arbitrariness. There is no legal provision under the Wildlife Act, 1972, that empowers the State Board to review its own decision taken after completion of a statutory process,” said Praveen Bhargav of the Bengaluru-based Wildlife First, a conservation advocacy group.“Supreme Court-appointed expert committees, senior government officials, ecologists and conservationists have repeatedly recommended against approving this project. They have questioned the very necessity of the project and raised serious reservations on impacts on tribal and other forest-dependent communities. Serious impacts on important wildlife habitats, tree and fragmentation of important corridors have also been raised. The state government’s decision to approve this project against such advice undermines the purpose of legally mandated expert appraisals. Mitigation measures are a feeble justification for a project of severe consequences and which has been in a regulatory tug of war for several years,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research.HT had sent queries on whether Javadekar had received the scientists’ representation on Monday but did not get a response till Tuesday evening.Another NBWL, member, however, said on condition of anonymity that all members had received the representation and it would be deliberated upon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ecologists-ask-javadekar-to-stop-rail-line-across-western-ghats/story-qmOGyFkPofmE4ZMe0l1QpN.html
09-07-2020||India||HT Salutes: Helping migrants during a crisis||Shortly after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the 21-day nationwide lockdown to fight the Covid-19 pandemic in March, Sanjay Singh, a 45-year-old resident of Mirzapur village in Jalaun district realised that there was a crisis in the making.Jalaun lies in the plains of Bundelkhand, a region from where several thousand men and women migrate to Mumbai in Maharashtra, Surat and Ahmedabad in Gujarat, Bengaluru in Karnataka and other metropolises, in search of work. When the lockdown began on March 25, Singh saw residents of nearby villages make frantic calls to their family members living as migrants in big cities, fearful of their survival. Within a few days, one of the country’s biggest reverse migration movements began, as migrant workers took to the roads, often on foot, to go back to their home states.Towards the end of March, such a group of migrant workers had reached Madhya Pradesh’s Datia district, but to enter their home state, permissions from top officials like the chief secretary and additional chief secretary (Home) in Lucknow were required. In the meantime, the police had a tough task controlling the workers who were impatient to cross into Uttar Pradesh. It was also an arduous task for the administration of districts to supply food and water. Watch | HT Salutes: UP man helping migrants labourers with food, work as they returnThat’s when Singh, who runs a voluntary organisation called Parmarth Samaj Sewi Sansthan which works on livelihood and water conservation in Bundelkhand districts across both states, approached the authorities with an offer to help. His volunteers —many of whom themselves had migrant family members — would have no problem in managing the crowd, Singh told the officers.As the crowd multiplied on the border, the Datia and Jhansi district administrations gave a green signal to Singh to set up a kitchen near the border at of these two districts, to distribute food and water among the migrants. He also set up a help desk to guide migrants to buses and shelter homes as well as transport those exhibiting symptoms of Covid-19, like cough or fever, to health centres.“The volunteers ran the community kitchen and the help desk till the end of May. They took the assistance of local residents of these districts, including adjoining Lalitpur in Uttar Pradesh, as well as traders and farmers who supplied grains and edible items to run the kitchen,” Singh said.Singh also ensured that the group of 18 volunteers wore personal protective gear as well as distributed masks and sanitizers among the migrants many of whom had returned from hotspots like Mumbai, Surat and Indore.From March 27 to the first week of June, around 3.5 million migrant workers have returned to Uttar Pradesh of which 1 million were from Bundelkhand’s districts of Jhansi, Lalitpur, Jaluan, Hamirpur, Banda, Mahoba and Chitrakoot. A majority of them have little money and no source of employment other than the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme (MNREGS). In Uttar Pradesh, already 2.5 million migrants have applied for new job cards under the scheme, but till mid-June, 1 million were yet to receive them.In June, Singh also began to motivate returned migrants to work in water conservation schemes. “We roped in some of the returning migrants to revive the ponds, lakes and rivers in the Bundelkhand region which is in midst of a water crisis. Work has already begun in Manpur pond in Jhansi district. A canal to connect the pond with nearby agricultural land is being repaired in time for the paddy crop,” he said.Paddy sowing begins from the end of June.“We told them that if they do not wish to migrate again, they need to revive and conserve the water bodies. Along with Lalitpur and Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh we have also organised similar revival activities of ponds and lakes in Tikamgarh and Chattarpur areas of Madhya Pradesh,” Singh said.“We were trapped in the lockdown. We faced hardship and hunger. Now, after returning to the native village we are working for the revival of the pond and the canal to ensure we don’t have to face this again,” said Meera Ahirwar, a migrant worker who returned to Manpur from Indore in May.Hindustan Times and Facebook have partnered to bring you 15 stories of HT Salutes.

09-07-2020||Editorials||Creating a genuinely free intellectual environment | HT Editorial||On July 7, Harper’s Magazine published an open letter titled A letter on Justice and Open Debate signed by renowned names in journalism, literature and academia, who are broadly progressive. The letter acknowledged the illiberalism of the radical right, the challenges to democracy and racism in the United States. But its real value was in the manner in which it cast an introspective glance at protest movements and the ideological resistance on the other side.The letter, broadly addressing liberals, questioned the growing constriction of free ideas, and hasty reactions to transgressions that leave no room for “considered reform”. It expressed concern about intolerance, in which the boundaries of what can be said without reprisal are narrowing in the quest for “ideological conformity”. It underlined that resistance must not harden into its “own brand of dogma or coercion”. The letter pointed to the vogue for “public shaming and ostracism”. It critiqued the “hasty and disproportionate” publishments that institutions have come to give in a “spirit of panicked damage control”. All of this, the signatories said, will harm vital causes, hurt those who lack power, restrict democratic participation; instead, it emphasised the importance of preserving “good faith disagreement”. The letter comes in the backdrop of growing political polarisation across the world, including India, and an increasing tendency to adopt a black-and-white prism of looking at the world. It has prompted criticism, by other prominent voices, that the fears expressed in the letter are unwarranted; that the bigger battle is with forces which refuse to even recognise the rights of the marginalised; and some of the signatories themselves have problematic political positions. This is a useful conversation, but the letter’s call for a genuinely free intellectual environment is much-needed in these times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/creating-a-genuinely-free-intellectual-environment-ht-editorial/story-ZPZyLWc57c5WH7LVCovcmN.html
09-07-2020||Editorials||The saga of Vikas Dubey | HT Editorial||Vikas Dubey — who led an attack on police officials, killing eight and injuring another seven, when they had gone to nab him in a Kanpur village last week — has finally been arrested. His story, and the story of the search for him, is a tale of the corrosive political culture of Uttar Pradesh, the mockery of the rule of law in much of the Indian hinterland, and the close — and ever deepening interlinkages — between politics and crime.The fact that Dubey has got away for so long is a reflection of the manner in which the political and administrative machine has worked in many parts of India. As the political scientist Milan Vaishnav has persuasively argued, those with criminal antecedents have the finances to enter the political fray, ensuring supply; their reputation as those who can “deliver” to constituents, in the backdrop of a patronage based political system, enhances the demand for them. Dubey clearly had close political links — and must have performed useful services for politicians — which ensured that he was protected. But how can a political dispensation protect a criminal? That is where the broken law and order machinery comes in. Till there are police reforms in India — ensuring autonomy to the police force, and insulating them from political pressures — local authorities will seek their own slice of the cake and be a part of this nexus. Regimes will change, but that will only change the nature, and in UP’s case, the caste-profile of criminals — crime will persist.The general consensus is that Dubey went too far this time — and no political regime can now protect him without political costs. He must, indeed, be brought to justice for the long and heinous list of crimes he has allegedly committed. But that cannot be the end of the story. His arrest must mark the beginning of a broader investigation into the trend of gang lords thriving with impunity, trigger a much needed process to change electoral incentives and tackle the criminalisation of politics, lead to the creation of a criminal justice system which can act independent of partisan pressures, and bring about a qualitative change in the political-security environment of UP. That will be true justice for the citizens in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-saga-of-vikas-dubey-ht-editorial/story-PCXJey7CdAHSWzh5w9CiNI.html
