Only a couple of weeks earlier, some Facebook executives publicly opposed CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s stance that social media platforms should “not play arbiters of truth”, implying that what appears on the platform has nothing to do with Facebook.As the boycott intensifies, Facebook — 98% of its revenues come from advertising — seems to have retreated a little. It has since said that it will flag all “newsworthy” posts from politicians and political groups that break its rules. The issue highlights the fact that, for the first time, companies are beginning to actively use their business spends to push for change.The world over, businesses have traditionally shied away from politics and protests, recognising that it may alienate some stakeholders. The view has always been that it’s better to stay away from controversy, focus on growth, steer clear of sentiments, and avoid offending anyone. Staying neutral and hedging political bets was the norm.While the lines between business and politics have largely stayed clear, increasingly businesses are being forced to take a position as they define for themselves a larger purpose, beyond making a profit. Younger consumers, particularly millennials, born between 1980 and 1996, a significant demographic across the world, want to know where companies stand on causes that matter. These range from sustainability, racism, discrimination based on religion, nationality, gender, sexual orientation and colourism, some of which are inextricably linked to politics.Many global companies are larger than countries in economic heft and scale of impact. Consequently, these corporations have become important elements in shaping culture. The brands they own play a big part in influencing consumer behaviour and moulding opinion. This puts the onus on them to proactively do the right thing, even though it may have short-term implications on their bottom line. Companies can put their weight behind key causes, and are increasingly being called upon to do so by a “woke” generation.Studies indicate that people want to work for a company that has a deeper reason for being, than only profit. A 2019 Deloitte study showed that “millennials would prioritise the sense of purpose around people rather than growth or profit maximisation”. Another survey by Gallup shows that people “look for work that fuels their sense of purpose and makes them feel important”. This, together with the pressure from consumers and activists, are making corporations rethink their views on “staying neutral”.Though mega corporations are not about to turn altruistic, they are recognising that purpose and profit are interlinked. Businesses that survive and thrive will be those that make a positive impact on the world and create greater prosperity through everything they do. Jim Stengel, a former Procter & Gamble executive, in his book, Grow: How Ideals Power Growth and Profit at the World’s Greatest Companies, shared the results of a 10-year study of 50,000 brands which found that the ones that defined their purpose around improving people’s lives beat their category competitors by significant margins. In the new context, corporate social responsibility (CSR), once relegated to the fringes of business, is now front and centre and integrates deeply into the company’s offerings.The killing of George Floyd in the United States (US) triggered off mass protests and culminated in the Black Lives Matter movement. Subsequent comments on social media by US President Donald Trump and Facebook’s refusal to flag them led to the #StopHateSpeech movement. Together, they have forced companies to take positions on these divisive issues. Many US companies and CEOs had come out openly in support of the black lives matter movement well before the current Facebook ad boycott. Companies that have remained silent are being called out on social media for their indifference to issues that concern their users. Neutrality is no longer an excuse.The Facebook ad boycott raises the question as to whether brands will, from now on, use their marketing budgets to make choices beyond commercial ones — comprising reach and the cost of a medium. Will it be appropriate for a brand to buy advertising on a publication, platform or channel that actively preaches hate or is aligned to a divisive agenda? Will a brand’s media choices reflect its intrinsic values and affect consumer choice? Will consumers look beyond just physical brand attributes to evaluate the moral choices a brand makes? These are some of the questions that will be asked of companies sooner rather than later.In an increasingly globalised world, protests quickly move beyond national boundaries, forcing change over larger geographies. The US-centric debate on racism soon spread to India where colourism is hugely prevalent, getting the country’s largest consumer goods maker, Hindustan Unilever, to announce a name change and revamp the proposition of its nearly five-decade-old fairness cream. A prominent matrimonial website shaadi.com was forced to take off its skin tone filter in response to objections from some users. While corporate-initiated change may not alter age-old prejudices immediately, these clearly are steps in the right direction.A February 2020 US study published by the Harvard Business Review threw up a surprising finding — that the previously held view of not mixing commercialism with politics may well be gone. In India too, many business leaders are being asked tough questions on where they stand on key issues, and are finding it difficult to look away. In this post-Covid world, where the trust deficit has soared, businesses that put purpose before profit will benefit in the long-run. Consumers will seek out brands that resonate with their values and will reward them with their loyalty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/for-companies-the-end-of-neutrality-opinion/story-KyC5Ez77ThA63Wb6A1al8K.html
13-07-2020||News||The five truths about the migrant workers’ crisis | Opinion||If anything positive has come out of the Covid-19 crisis, it is that the world’s most stringent lockdown revealed the plight of the vulnerable Indian migrant labour force. With no work and no way to feed themselves, removed from family support, millions had no choice but to defy the lockdown and return to their villages. One after another, they marched, carrying their belongings and children, walking thousands of kilometres, determined to find a way home, capturing the imagination of the world. Our research article just published by the Royal Geographical Society (Institute of British Geographers) reveals five issues that remain largely hidden behind their exodus.First, business and industry is dependent on migrant labour that is paid less, works longer and harder, and is more flexible than local labour. Though, in many parts of the world, such a precarious migrant workforce travels across national borders, in India, it is a huge internal migrant force traversing state borders for informal contract work in more developed parts of the country where they are treated as second-class citizens. Usually unable to speak the lingua franca of where they migrate to, rarely represented by any union or social movement, they are easily harassed by employers, government institutions and by other workers. This vulnerability makes them more easily controlled, cheap and dispensable. Second, in India, many of these migrants — about 100 million in total — work seasonally and circulate between their rural homes and faraway work sites for a part of the year. Third, workers treated the worst often come from regions of India like Jharkhand, Odisha or Chhattisgarh which have long suffered a form of internally oppressive structures as their indigenous wealth — minerals, forests, other natural resources — has been extracted by outsiders, leaving little but high levels of poverty for the locals. Fourth, the hardest work in the worst living conditions is done by India’s historically disadvantaged minorities. Dalits and Adivasis are overly represented as seasonal labour migrants; they make up more than 40% of the seasonal migrant workforce even though they are only 25% of the population. Whether in the tea plantations of Kerala, chemical industrial factories of Tamil Nadu or road-building in Himachal Pradesh, we found the cheapest and most exploited workers were low caste and tribal seasonal migrants from the central and eastern Indian forested belts, doing work that even local Adivasis and Dalits were moving away from. All these migrant workers are subject to the stigmas of caste and region, treated as jungli (filthy or savage), including by the local workforce. Fifth, these seasonal migrant workers are, in turn, supported by a further invisible economy — the household. Seasonal migrants can only be workers because of all the work undertaken across generations at home, including care provided by the spouse, children, siblings and elderly parents. This is the labour of kin who will care for the migrant workers in the seasons when there is no work, who will maintain the migrants’ home so they have a place to return to, and who will care for them when employers have overworked their bodies so they are no longer fit to work. Making these economies of care invisible allows employers — in factories, kilns and construction sites — to steal the value of both workers and their households, make them so cheap that they can accumulate from them. Seasonal migrant workers are, therefore, not just exploited, they are super-exploited.Rather than protecting migrant workers, the government is now making things worse as labour legislation is dismantled further in favour of business and industry. The obstacles to mobilising are many. Language barriers, treating migrants as second-class citizens and permanent transience lead to isolation. The rare individuals and organisations, which have organised and agitated for such precarious workers, have faced increasing State repression in recent years, with the Maoist or Urban Naxal label used to discredit and silence the most radical of labour activists.But there is also a silver lining to the impact of Covid-19. It brought together thousands to provide relief for stranded migrant workers, find temporary shelters, and provide basic amenities. Journalists, scholars and activists documented their flight. Labour migration appeared in mainstream policy discussions for the first time, and scholars and activists who had been working with migrant labour for years were, for once, listened to as online conferences, seminars and reports tried to understand what was going on.Now is the moment to harness all these efforts, unite them in a wider movement for social change that will better the terms and conditions for migrant workers. If there is anything that our long-term work on seasonal migrant workers in India has shown, it is the need to consider three things: First, better conditions and pay must be adopted, both for the workers’ households and for the workers in their place of work. Second, tackling discrimination against caste, tribe and region-based migrants is a must to lift oppression. Finally, the internal oppressive structures that drive countrywide uneven development, which forces people to move into such vulnerable conditions in places of work in the first place, must be reversed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-five-truths-about-the-migrant-workers-crisis-opinion/story-awTQUm2gnJx72UWbdPa5OM.html
13-07-2020||News||To deal with China, focus solely on economic growth | Opinion||Much has been written about China following the clash between Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley. These discussions have often suggested that the Indian corporate sector should in some way exact retribution on China. The government has, perhaps, with some merit, banned a number of Chinese apps. Others have encouraged consumers to boycott Chinese goods. Neither address the basic issue that needs to be fixed, which was more accurately pinpointed by in jest by a senior Chinese media figure. This gentleman commented that an economic dispute with China was farcical because there were no Indian goods that the Chinese could boycott. There is a deep resonance in this satirical remark. No mechanism to strengthen India’s influence with respect to China can be created without a unidimensional determination to become an economic superpower. There are choices to be made.India must also, as China has done, build up financial reserves through the creation of industrial powerhouse companies. This requires a combination of cheap financing for domestic companies and possibly a devalued currency. India must substitute the mental hang-ups that have prevented it from systematically adopting these practices if it is to gain greater economic relevance.Since great economic institutions require capital, we need to relook at the ease of business processes which attract capital. In the case of China, local governments have been incentivised to run their provinces in the manner most likely to attract foreign direct investment (FDI). Those who have done business in China speak of the overwhelming support they get from local governments. These include the identification of land, provision of ready lists of architects and contractors, free legal services, often to the point of providing dosa makers to encourage engineers to work there. The nature of factory inspections tends to be infrequent in contrast to the Indian licence-permit raj. International capital has choices and will naturally flow where it is made most welcome. China is simply easier to do business in. India has followed a different growth path. That path influences how vigorously we can respond to Galwan.Building economic powerhouses can also mean supporting national champion companies, as Japan and South Korea have done. India has been beset by concerns that such choices are prone to nepotism and the misuse of scarce national resources. It needs to enquire why these negative externalities of national choice were not equally applicable in Japan and South Korea. Even the United States (US), portrayed as a champion of market freedom, selectively awarded contracts for European/Iraqi reconstruction to a handful of chosen American companies. These policies did not result in the preferred companies falling to the lowest common denominator of quality. Instead, they often became world leaders in their chosen industries.China has systematically sought to develop its soft power through investment, aid to countries, influence over multilateral institutions and the provision of research funding to universities around the world. It has chosen to be the driver behind the creation of banking institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New Development Bank. While these banks or universities are all professionally-managed institutions, such largesse provides China with a degree of soft influence that others do not possess. Most meaningful infrastructure in Africa is today built by China with quid pro quos in play. These include preferential access to manganese, cobalt and other rare earth metals. China should not be blamed for this, as it is only copying the playbook used by European nations earlier. India is free to also make these choices. We need to introspect why, for instance, Indian apps could not become the world standard.An argument may be made that in a democratic country, other policy choices are also important. Social justice has its place and economic growth cannot be the sole criteria for decision-making. These choices are not mutually exclusive or unique to us. It is India’s resistance to common sense reforms in labour, land or judicial processes has also led to an attenuation of economic wealth and the concomitant inability to push back against China.India needs to want economic success as badly as China does. If this desire is too mitigated by its desire to address many other issues such as retribution for past injustices, regional or linguistic reaffirmation, or fears about elite domination, the country may fall short of its optimal economic potential.At a philosophical level, it is entirely possible for a country to be successful and satisfied, with the kind of balance India has apparently sought, between being a mid-level economic power while also a disorganised democracy. However, in a world where the metric of power is largely Gross Domestic Product per capita, such a nation will need to accept a position of lesser influence. These choices can cause the angst of seeing others whom we may consider the “bad guys” finishing first. This government, more than others in the past, believes in an aligned pan-national vision around a common goal. This dispute with China provides an opportunity for policymakers to introspect about the choices we have made, as a nation. The road to victory in Galwan runs through the choices made in bureaucracy, the judicial system and the legislature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/to-deal-with-china-focus-solely-on-economic-growth-opinion/story-W2rshmNZYFFu6bGbvE044O.html
13-07-2020||News||Custodial torture and violence is wrong. It is time for a stronger law||Custodial violence has not been clearly defined under any law. It is often tactically approved as a means of getting information regarding a crime, the names of accomplices or to extract confessions. Whenever questions are asked about the lack of strong laws on custodial torture in India, the standard reply is that existing laws are adequate to deal with this. The custodial deaths of a father and son, Jayaraj and Bennicks at the Kovilpatti sub-jail in Tuticorin,Tamil Nadu, have raised some serious questions. It is a case in which the police registered an FIR that puts the entire blame on Jayaraj and Bennicks. The FIR states that when the beat police asked them to close their shop, they abused and prevented the constables from discharging their official duty, and threatened dire consequences. It further said that they resisted arrest and started rolling on the floor, which caused their injuries. The Indian Evidence Act, 1872, provides that a judicial officer is supposed to draw the presumption that judicial and official acts have been performed in an appropriate manner. The allegations in this FIR appear to be false and manipulated.This is substantiated from the videos that have given a different picture of the place, time, and circumstances of the arrest.There are news reports that there were multiple injuries on the gluteal region, anus and the knee bones of both persons. The question then is: Should such presumptions of law continue in favour of official acts? While these videos are doing rounds, doubts remain whether these will become part of the charge-sheet.Will they be considered at the time of trial? In the past, many such pieces of evidence were either not included in the charge-sheet or were not relied upon during the trial. The law offers some protection against custodial torture. It mandates that the person arrested must be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of 24 hours of such arrest and that he cannot be detained beyond this without the authority of a magistrate. The purpose of this law is that the magistrate would examine the condition of the accused and decide whether there is a fit case to extend the custody. If the news reports are true, the role of the magistrate who remanded the two to judicial custody raises a lot of questions. The magistrate of Sathankulam allegedly did not meet the accused before remanding them to custody. He did not check if they were injured or whether they required any medical help. Reports also suggest that the magistrate passed the order for remand through video-conferencing during which he did not enquire about their condition. At the Kovilpatti sub-jail, a medical check-up of the two revealed serious injuries. Both were in a very bad shape but rather than sending them to hospital, they were sent to jail. It was only when their condition deteriorated that they were sent to Kovilpatti general hospital, where Bennicks died on June 22. His father Jayaraj died on June 23. Questions remain as to whether the doctors in jail were incompetent or whether they did not send the two to hospital in order to protect the police. Breaking the bones of persons in custody is an institutional method allegedly favoured by the Tamil Nadu police. Acting on a complaint against the Tamil Nadu police earlier, the National Human Rights Commission ordered a spot enquiry. The Commission’s investigation team found that 91 undertrial prisoners in Puzhal Central Jail had fractures on different parts of the body such as the forehand, forearm and knee at the time of admission. The team procured the health screening reports of these 91 prisoners at the time of their entry into prison. The matter is pending before the Commission.The Law Commission of India on the topic of injuries in police custody, in 1984, suggested that in case a man suffers bodily injury or death while in police custody, the court may presume that the injury was caused by the police officer having custody of that person during that period. For some reason, 36 years later, even this has not been followed upon. By not enacting a proper law against torture, the police have been given a free hand. No quarter can be given to policemen who behave like criminals. The two men in Tamil Nadu died not just because of the torture they suffered but also because of the apathy of the magistrate and doctors at the jail. The scene of the crime and other important facts appear to have been manipulated. Only a full enquiry into the sequence of events, without delay, can reveal the truth.Jyotika Kalra is member, National Human Rights CommissionThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/custodial-torture-and-violence-is-wrong-it-is-time-for-a-stronger-law/story-WT74l27NG6LfO32pj9keCP.html

13-07-2020||City||CBSE results: Northeast Delhi students say cancelled papers affected scores||New Delhi: Principals of most private schools in northeast Delhi said their pass percentage in the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class 12 exams had improved due to the revised assessment scheme. Students in the riot-hit area, however, said they could have performed better if they had appeared for their papers. Nupur Sharma, a student of Arun Modern Public School, which was damaged in the February riots, said she wasn’t satisfied with her marks. “I couldn’t appear for my English and Hindi papers because it was cancelled due to Covid-19 and the riots. The average marks I received in these two subjects were in the 70s. I would have scored better if I had appeared for these papers,” said Sharma, who has applied to study English (Honours) in Delhi University. “With the cut-throat competition in the university, securing a seat will be tougher for me.”The Class 12 results were declared on Monday.Due to the communal violence in various northeast Delhi in February, CBSE was unable to conduct papers on four examination days and “a very small number of students from and around this district were not able to appear in exams on six examination days,” the board had said in April. A revised schedule had been announced but the board was unable to conduct the exams due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation.According to the revised assessment scheme formulated by CBSE, students of northeast Delhi, who could appear in only one or two subjects, would have their results based on their performance in the appeared subjects and performance in internal/practical/projects assessment.Jyoti Rani, principal of Arun Modern Public School, however, said CBSE’s revised assessment scheme had helped improve the overall result. “Our pass percentage stands at around 90% this year, which is more than last year. This is because of the revised assessments scheme,” she said.Om Prakash, manager of MRL Senior Secondary in Karawal Nagar, said, “We haven’t been able to access the website since there were server issues so we do not have a detailed breakup of marks yet. Not all students have been able to access results. However, our pass percentage has increased up to five percentage points this year.”Though CBSE said these students will be allowed to write an improvement exam to be conducted when the situation is conducive, students remain uncertain about it.“Though I want to appear for the improvement papers, we don’t know when that will happen since Covid-19 cases are still continuing and the college admission process has already started. Waiting for the retest does not look like an option because I run the risk of losing a year,” said Muskan Sharma, a class 12 student from Yamuna Vihar.Mansi, a student of a government-run school in Brahmapuri, said she too does not plan to appear for the improvement papers due to the uncertainty. “I was not able to appear for English, Hindi, and Home Science — three of the most scoring papers. Marks scored in my History, Economics, and Political Science were used for aggregate, which is why my aggregate stands at 63%. I will not wait to appear for the papers and instead opt for web designing courses,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cbse-results-northeast-delhi-students-say-cancelled-papers-affected-scores/story-45yX72IRYmS2GEOopaTjRK.html

The pass percentage of girls was 92.15 and that of boys was 86.19. Divyanshi Jain, a student of Lucknow’s Navyug Radiance Senior Secondary School, didn’t lose a single mark in any of her six subjects scoring a 100 in each of them. “This is unbelievable. I am elated and surprised at the same time,” said a jubilant Divyanshi.Jain scored full marks in English, Sanskrit, History, Geography, Insurance and Economics.CBSE Regional Officer (RO) Shweta Arora said, “Divyanshi got maximum marks in the Prayagraj region. She appeared in five out of six exams.”The Dehradun region recorded a 9.65% increase in pass percentage compared to last year, said officials.Ranveer Singh, CBSE regional director, Dehradun, said, “The pass percentage of Dehradun region has increased by 9.65% compared to last year, despite the fact that areas such as Noida and Ghaziabad were removed from the region this year.”Devjyoti Chakrabarti from Shemford Doon School in Dehradun and Sagar Garg from DSB International Public School in Rishikesh scored 498 out of 500 marks each.Garg told local media that he aims to join the Indian Police Service and serve the nation. “I aspire to become an IPS officer and the credit for my result goes completely to my parents who kept me motivated,” said Garg.In Indore, Shubhra Jyotsana Singh of Delhi Public School scored highest marks in the city with 99.2% marks. “I am preparing for CLAT (common law admission test).

Kinjal Ajmera of Delhi Public School, Ruby Park, scored 98%.

13-07-2020||Chandigarh||Delhi high court dismisses petition challenging Haryana DGP’s appointment||The Delhi high court on Monday dismissed a petition challenging the appointment of Haryana director general of police (DGP) Manoj Yadava.Justice Jyoti Singh of the HC said the petition is not maintainable in view of a 1997 Supreme Court (SC) judgment and provisions of the Administrative Tribunals Act.“It would, however, be open to the petitioner to approach the central administrative tribunal for determination of his grievances on merits,” the HC order said.A 1986-batch Haryana cadre IPS officer, Prabhat Ranjan Deo, had sought quashing of the recommendation and empanelment of 1988-batch IPS officer Manoj Yadava by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) and his appointment as the Haryana DGP. Quoting a ruling of the constitution bench of the apex court, the Delhi HC said the SC had laid down that the tribunals created pursuant to Article 323-A or under Article 323-B of the Constitution are competent to hear matters entrusted to them and will continue to act as only courts of ‘first instance’ in respect of the areas of law for which they have been constituted. “It is clear that after the authoritative pronouncement of the apex court, this court cannot entertain the present petition and remedy lies only before the CAT,” the HC said. Deo’s counsel, however, said the fulcrum of the argument is that the Supreme Court had on March 25, 2019, granted liberty to the petitioner to approach the jurisdictional high court and as the office of UPSC is located within the territorial jurisdiction of this court, the jurisdictional HC is Delhi high court. The Delhi HC, however, said the contention that the apex court intended to confer jurisdiction upon this court, which it does not have, cannot be sustained. The argument that the petition has been pending in this court since March 2019 and should be entertained, no doubt appeals at first blush, but cannot be sustained due to lack of jurisdiction. No court can usurp a jurisdiction, it lacks and I am afraid, this plea does not take the case of the petitioner forward, Justice Jyoti Singh said.The petitioner had contended that Haryana government on January 25, 2019, had sent a list of 11 eligible officers, who had completed 30 years of service, to the UPSC for consideration and empanelment to the post of DGP. The petitioner said the UPSC had on February 18, 2019, empanelled three IPS officers to the post of DGP, but his name was not among them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/delhi-high-court-dismisses-petition-challenging-haryana-dgp-s-appointment/story-ZbthalSLwE38NVmt86HKWM.html

Also, in the present situation, it was be difficult to bring the answer books to India for evaluation purposes,” the official added.Girls outshone boys by nearly six percentage points in the CBSE Class 12 examination results on Monday based on an alternative assessment system adapted after some tests had to be cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cbse-results-marginal-dip-in-pass-percentage-of-foreign-schools/story-ZBY9osUDacq1wVL982gJaO.html

13-07-2020||Gurugram||92.36% of students in Haryana clear CBSE Class 12 examination||More than 90% of students of Haryana, who appeared for the Class 12 examination of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), managed to clear their tests, as per the results declared by the board on Monday. While no city-wise topper was declared by the Board owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, students in multiple schools in the city scored percentages above 90 with many obtaining a perfect score in multiple subjects.In Haryana, a total of 97,161 students appeared for the examination that included 54,790 boys and 42,371 girls. Out of these, 89,739 students cleared the examination. The number included 49,531 boys and 40,208 girls. The pass percentage for the state stood at 92.36%. Boys fared comparatively better than girls. While the pass percentage for boys was 94.9%, the same for girls was 90.4%. Earlier in March, the CBSE had canceled board examinations across the country in 12 subjects owing to the nationwide lockdown imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19. The pending examinations were scheduled to take place from July 1 but were eventually called off after protests from parents and state governments. The board later announced an alternative assessment formula, on the basis of which students were graded based on their performance in the subjects for which tests were held. At Delhi Public School, Sector 45, Disha Mukherjee was the school topper with 99% in Humanities. Mukherjee said that she was relieved with the results, given the uncertainty prevailing over the pending examinations. “I wasn’t expecting such high scores since there was a lot of uncertainty surrounding the assessment of papers. The result date was not being announced which added to my stress. Finally, the results came in. My teachers shared with me the happy news,” said Mukherjee, who plans to pursue an Honours course in Psychology from Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi University. She has secured a perfect 100 on the same subject.Aditi Misra, Disha’s principal, said that she was happy with the results that had come in a rather difficult academic year. “This is a landmark year. I want students to feel satisfied with their performance. They should learn from their mistakes and move ahead. At the end of the day, they should focus on what they have and not what they could have had. A year from now, these marks wouldn’t matter so much,” said Misra.At Amity International School, Sector 46, Dhruv Lowe and Kushagra Sahni scored 98.4% in Science stream, while Aakarshi Agarwal scored 98.4% in Humanities. The school’s average stood at 90.1% with 28 students scoring a perfect 100 and 42 students scoring 99. Satwik Ghildiya secured 98.2% at Amity International School, Sector 43. At Shiv Nadar School, Palak Modi was the school topper with 98.7% in Humanities. Ketaki Sarin topped her school, Heritage Xperiential Learning School, with a score of 98.8% in the Science stream. Around 3.6%, or 44 students of the school, scored 95% and above.Neena Kaul, the principal, Heritage Xperiential Learning School, said that students have done very well in a challenging year. “Our students have come out shining in the board exams despite the uncertainties due to the pandemic. I couldn’t be happier,” said Kaul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/92-36-of-students-in-haryana-clear-cbse-class-12-examination/story-AHvrJ3pp9aTuL41pbTqObP.html
13-07-2020||Chandigarh||PSEB to cut syllabus by 30% for classes 9 to 12 on CBSE pattern||Amid coronavirus pandemic, the Punjab School Education Board (PSEB) has decided to reduce its syllabus for classes 9 to 12 for the current academic session by up to 30% on the pattern of the Central Board of School Education (CBSE).A committee comprising subject experts from the PSEB and State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) set up by the school education department has finalised its suggestions for a reduction in the course load to ease the burden on students.School education secretary Krishan Kumar said the committee was set up under SCERT director Jagtar Singh last week to take into consideration the views of different stakeholders, including academicians, teachers, and parents, and suggest the reduction in the syllabus for the academic year 2020-21. The exercise will take another two to three days, he said.The CBSE had last week announced to reduce the syllabus of classes 9 to 12 by almost a third to make up for the academic loss that happened due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown. Earlier, the Council for the Indian Schools Certificate Examination (CISCE) had also revised its syllabus for the same reason.The panel comprising subject experts of PSEB and SCERT is going by the CBSE pattern for reduction of up to 30% in syllabus, according to two officials familiar with the committee’s proceedings. “The topics to be dropped from the syllabus have been selected for several subjects, but there is still some work left,” one of them said.PSEB uploaded the lists of “reduced syllabus topics” of several subjects for secondary and senior secondary classes on its official website on Sunday, but these were quickly removed the same day. As per the uploaded list of subjects for Class 10, three chapters, including those on the Anglo-Sikh wars and annexation of Punjab, and state’s struggle for freedom, are to be dropped from the history syllabus, besides map work. Similarly, two chapters each are reduced from geography and civics syllabus.Another PSEB official said the approval of the academic council will be required before any topics or chapters are reduced from the syllabus. Punjab, which was among the first states to impose a curfew on March 23 and shut its schools, has tried to give a push to online teaching, but there have been questions about its reach as a significant number of children enrolled in government schools belong to the economically disadvantaged families and do not have smartphones and connectivity required for accessing digital lessons.Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had on Sunday also asked the school education department to ensure equal educational opportunity and access for all students, including the poor and rural ones. The department also tied-up with television and radio channels to go ahead with the academic calendar, but there have been problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pseb-to-cut-syllabus-by-30-for-classes-9-to-12-on-cbse-pattern/story-cfu6U4lVODXTkiYjQC7QtK.html
13-07-2020||Delhi||CBSE results: Higher scores will lead to higher cut-offs, say DU officials||With a significantly high number of students scoring in the 90-95% range in the Central Board of Secondary Examination (CBSE) Class 12 examination , Delhi University (DU) officials and principals on Monday said the results are likely to push up the cut-off marks for admissions to undergraduate courses this year. Compared to last year, the number of students scoring 95% and above has increased by 118.6% and those getting 90% and above by 67.48% this year. “If the number of students scoring over 90% is high, cut-offs will be higher too,” a senior Delhi University official said, requesting anonymity. Asked about the likely date for cut-offs, the official said the university is waiting for the University Grants Commission (UGC) to issue the revised academic calendar.Last year, 94,299 students had scored in the 90-95% range, keeping the DU cut-offs high. Hindu College had the highest cut-off of 99% in 2019, only slightly higher that Lady Shri Ram College’s 98.75% in 2018.“There are a lot of interlinked factors. For instance, students who want admission in science courses are also likely to appear for the Joint Entrance Examination and the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test. If they get admission to engineering and medical institutes, they might drop out of the undergraduate courses. The entrance tests for DU courses are to be conducted by National Testing Agency, which will conduct other entrance exams as well. We will factor these in while planning the cut-off dates,” the official said.Registrations for various undergraduate, postgraduate and MPhil courses began on June 20 and will continue until July 18. A total of 237,117 students had registered for the undergraduate courses till Monday evening. Last year, 205,434 of 258,388 applicants in DU were from CBSE.Dean (Admissions) Shobha Bagai said the students who had already registered for admission and paid their fee could update their CBSE marks on DU’s website. “The tab to update the academic section is already available. They can update their marks till the cut-offs are announced,” she said. During a webinar conducted on Sunday attended by students, parents, and other stakeholders, Bagai had said that cut-offs were likely to be released in September.“Looking at the preliminary information, we don’t think we’ll be able to keep the percentage low. The results have been declared today and the data will emerge gradually once students start submitting it to the university. Once the university sends this data to the colleges, we can take a look at the courses and students who have applied for the courses and then decide the cut-offs accordingly,” Anju Shrivastava, principal of Hindu College, said.Though exams were not conducted for some subjects, including Geography, Computer Science, and Sociology, principals across DU colleges said it was unlikely to impact the cut-off for those subjects.Bijayalaxmi Nanda, the acting principal of Miranda House, said, “The cut-offs will only be slightly higher or the same as last year and students should not be despondent. However, the diversity that comes to Delhi might be different because of the Covid-19 situation. Parents will be nervous about sending their children away in such uncertain times.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cbse-results-higher-scores-will-lead-to-higher-cut-offs-say-du-officials/story-pHpEhX15zKycdcyWhatk1N.html

It has been 25 days since they boycotted their Covid-related duties in support of their demands.“Rural pharmacists have been working for the last 14 years for Rs 10,000 a month. The government hired us on contractual basis and our contracts were not renewed this time. We have been assigned emergency Covid-related duties at public places like the Golden Temple, Durgiana Temple, ICP Attari, Sri Guru Ram Das Jee International Airport, to medically screen people. Despite working in the emergency situations, the government is not regularising the contractual employees,” said Gurdeep Singh, district president of Punjab Rural Health Pharmacy Officers Association.“The government had promised us to increase our salaries but nothing was done. The government should increase the salaries of frontline warriors and provide us medical insurance so that we can work without any concern,” he added.Kamaljeet Singh Chauhan, vice-chairperson of the association, said, “We boycotted our Covid-19 duties on June 19, but the government is acting as a mute spectator. We will not resume our duties til the government assures us to regularise our jobs and increase our salaries. A similar protest is being held at all the districts of the state. We will intensify our protest if our demands are not fulfilled.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rural-pharmacists-seeking-regularisation-hold-protest-in-amritsar-refuse-to-join-covid-19-duties/story-7gXHd5gfEHnvSauy4v9zMK.html

13-07-2020||Chandigarh||SACRILEGE CASES: Cong govt framing followers to get political mileage, says Dera committee||The Dera Sacha Sauda’s state committee on Monday said the Punjab Police’s ongoing probe into alleged sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib was a conspiracy of the Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government to defame the sect to get political mileage. In a first press conference ever since the investigation into the 2015 desecration incidents started, members of the dera’s Punjab committee said the “government of the day” is carrying out a shady probe into the cases for reasons best known to it. “Maybe it’s the dera’s call to support the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in the previous elections that the sect followers are being implicated to get even with us,” said Harcharan Singh, a state committee member. “The successive governments have settled scores with the sect for supporting their rival parties. In 2002 and 2012, we supported the Congress but SAD came to power. At that time too, efforts were made to implicate the dera followers in false cases,” said Harcharan, who was accompanied by fellow member Kewal Brar and dera lawyer Vivek KumarThe committee members alleged that such was the desperation of the present government to frame the sect followers in the sacrilege cases that it was for the first time in India’s justice system that the police’s special investigation team (SIT) conducted a false and parallel probe when the CBI was already looking into the matter. “Case files and the FIRs are still with the CBI, which has given a clean chit to the dera followers. But the SIT ignored the probe and arrested our people to file a chargesheet in these cases. The SIT appears to have worked on flimsy grounds just to show the dera’s involvement in these cases,” said the dera lawyer.The CBI probe has found Mohinder Pal Singh Bittu, who was named as the main accused in the cases by the SIT, and other accused to be innocent, Vivek Kumar said. Bittu was murdered in a Patiala jail last year. “The sect followers were tortured in police custody and were compelled to give written statements claiming their involvement in sacrilege. But when the accused offered the CBI to conduct their narco test, the agency found them innocent. How can there be such difference in the probes conducted by the two agencies?” he questioned.The committee members said even the Ranjit Singh commission constituted by the Amarinder Singh government to look into the sacrilege case did not conduct an independent probe and instead relied upon fabricated theories of SIT.They claimed that the SIT’s recent move to name sect head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in the case was highly condemnable and shows that the government can go to any extent to show the dera in a bad light. “The government is trying to create a divide among different faiths and it will only spoil communal harmony in Punjab,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sacrilege-cases-cong-govt-framing-followers-to-get-political-mileage-says-dera-committee/story-rY7BJb7zGgzPOyNGdSR47O.html
13-07-2020||Lucknow||Never felt ashamed of being called ‘bhaiya’ from UP: Gopal||Former Test off-spinner Gopal Sharma has said he could have played many more Tests if he had agreed to represent Mumbai in the 1980s when he was given an open offer to do the same by Mumbai’s top cricketers who were calling the shots at the time.Sharma, who took 20 international wickets, 10 each in five Tests and 11 ODIs, was the first cricketer from Uttar Pradesh to play Tests in the post-Independence era. In the pre-Independence era, Pusapati Vijaya Ananda Gajapathi Raju (Maharajkumar of Vizianagaram) had captained India during the 1936 tour of England.“They (including a former captain) always wanted me to play for Mumbai, but I turned down the offer as I was keen to make a name for myself as well as for Uttar Pradesh. I faced many challenges during my career, but I never felt ashamed of being called ‘bhaiya’ from Uttar Pradesh,” Gopal Sharma said on Monday, 30 years after his retirement from the game in 1990.“I never lost my cool and always tried to live up to expectations. Even though my performance was up to the mark, I was dropped from the side,” said Sharma, who turns 60 on August 3.FAVORITISMKanpur’s Sharma said he also felt there was favoritism in Team India selection those days when he was denied the chance to play for India against New Zealand in New Zealand in the 1981 series.“I was named the first stand-by and I was supposed to leave for New Zealand the next day to replace an injured Shiv Lal Yadav, but the team management chose to call Ravi Shastri then,” he said, adding, “My name was announced by Raj Singh Dungarpur during commentary and I had my bags packed for the tour while playing in a Ranji Trophy game against Mumbai in Kanpur. But suddenly I came to know that Shastri, who took just one wicket in that game, was going in my place.”“Today, I feel that if I had accepted the offer to play for Mumbai, I would have played many more matches for the country,” said Sharma.As a member of the national selection committee from the Central Zone in the 2003-04 season, Sharma played a key role in getting at least four Uttar Pradesh cricketers drafted into Team India.The cricketers included RP Singh, Mohd Kaif, Suresh Raina and Piyush Chawla from UP and Railways’ JP Yadav, who made a comeback during Sharma’s tenure. “All cricketers selected by me did well for Team India and I still remember that the four other members in the committee, including the then chairman Kiran More, used to ask me ‘Gopi tu kahan se laata hai yaar such brilliant cricketers?’ (from where do you get such fine players?).”DEBUT MATCHSharma, who had to wait for four years to play his debut match in 1985 despite being selected for Team India in 1981, said he became a victim of a fight in the cricket board in 2004. “As soon as one group came to power in the BCCI, I lost my position in the selection panel. I am sure that if I had been in the committee for a few more years, many more cricketers from central zone could have played for India.”Sharma made his Test debut against England on his home turf at the Green Park Stadium in Kanpur, where he bowled long and hard, sending down 60 overs for 3/115.“It was always difficult to get into the Indian side as a spinner as I had to compete for the off-spinner’s spot with Shivlal Yadav and later Arshad Ayub. Other spinners of different varieties also in the fray were Laxman Sivaramakrishnan, Maninder Singh, Narendra Hirwani, Ravi Shastri and youngsters like Anil Kumble and Venkatapathy Raju, but I kept performing well whenever I got a chance.”For the record, Sharma did play in Sri Lanka in 1985-86 and then against Pakistan in 1986-87. When he bowled alongside Yadav against Pakistan at Jaipur, he was the more successful one, taking four wickets while Yadav took one. The next innings in the Ahmedabad Test, however, saw him pick up one and Yadav four. After that he was in the wilderness for three years.Sharma, who was very accurate, still recalls the day when he came to know about his selection for Team India. “It was announced on radio and I was told by someone. I could believe it only when I saw my name in the next morning’s newspapers. It was a dream come true,” said Sharma who took 353 wickets in 104 first-class matches, besides hitting two fighting centuries with the willow.FIRST A PACERIn fact, very few know that Sharma was originally a medium pacer and only a tricky situation forced him to become an off-spinner. In 1974, he was selected for the UP government’s first-ever cricket hostel in Lucknow as a medium pacer after doing well in the Under-19 team. Within a few days, he developed a backache and found himself unable to bowl quick at the nets.“I was just wondering what to do and I started bowling slow deliveries then and I felt no pain. My first coach Rohit Chaturvedi then advised me to stick to spin bowling and I did that,” he said.“I could have been kicked out of the hostel had I not changed my bowling style. After a year, the Lucknow hostel was shut down and I was shifted to Kanpur hostel (Mohd Kaif belongs to same hostel),” he said.DISAPPOINTEDHowever, Sharma sounded disappointed over the below par standard of government-run cricket hostels across the state. “Cricket is almost finished in the hostel and sports colleges. The concept of joint training is no more prevalent. Now, private academies have taken over the system,” he said.“There was competition amongst us when we were in the hostel. But now fata-fat cricket has become the key attraction for UP cricketers.”He said if UP cricketers won more matches at the national level, they would attract the national selectors’ attention. “UP cricketers need to play good cricket. Both the UP Sports Directorate and the UP Cricket Association should come out with a plan jointly so that the standard of state cricket could be raised. Once it is done, our cricketers would be an automatic choice in Team India.”“Through ‘jugar’ system, one can play up to the state level. But to play for India in any format of the game, you need to have a special quality. Infrastructure has been raised to top standards in the state. But we still need good coaches as well as dedicated cricketers,” he said.While Maharajkumar of Vizianagaram represented India only in Tests, Gopal Sharma and Mohd Kaif (2000-2006) did so in Tests and ODIs, Rudra Pratap Singh (2006-11), Piyush Chawla (2006-12), Suresh Raina (2005-18), Praveen Kumar (2007-12), Bhuvneshwar Kumar (debut in 2013) and Kuldeep Yadav (debut in 2017) have played in Tests, ODIs and T20s. Three others i.e. Rudra Pratap Singh Senior (1986), Gyanendra Pandey (1999) and Sudeep Tyagi (2009) have played only ODIs.CRICKET HISTORYThe team was formed in 1934 under the name of ‘United Provinces’. The team’s best performance in the Ranji Trophy in their early years came in 1939-40 when they finished as runners-up. In the 1950-51 season, the team’s name was changed to ‘Uttar Pradesh’.Uttar Pradesh have not been strong in the Ranji Trophy cricket for any prolonged period in their history. Their only victory in the Ranji Trophy Elite Group was in the 2005-06 season. The Ranji Trophy win was one of the most spectacular comebacks in cricketing history, since at one point of time in the season Uttar Pradesh were on the brink of relegation.They have finished runner-up twice before, once in 1997-98 against a strong Karnataka side, and once in 1977-78 against the same team under the captaincy of Mohammad Shahid and the team manager was Abdul Karim Chishti, former captain of Uttar Pradesh. They finished runners-up in the 2007-08 season, reprising a performance, similar to the one witnessed in the 2005-06 season, when they came back from the brink of relegation to win the championship. This time though, they lost to Delhi in the final.Their best performance in the Vijay Hazare Trophy came in 2004-05 when they were joint-winners with Tamil Nadu. In 2006 they won the Nissar Trophy, defeating Sialkot cricket team in Dharmasala. Their only appearance in the Irani Trophy came in the 2006-07 season in which they lost to the Rest of India team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/never-felt-ashamed-of-being-called-bhaiya-from-up-gopal/story-K4DCJJk5XGwB0hXo8YJKSP.html

13-07-2020||Lucknow||Former powerlifter trying to eke out a living by selling ‘vada-paav’||Former international powerlifter Shatrughan Lal is an inspiration for many. Even at the age of 50, he lifts a good amount of weights every day while coaching trainees at the Chowk Stadium here.He has also learnt the art of cooking ‘vada-paav’ from YouTube and has been running a small roadside shop in Durgapuri, Mawaiya for the last one week to make ends meet.A silver medalist at the Senior Asian Championship, Lal is among the 400-odd ad hoc coaches on the state government’s rolls, who have been facing a tough time for the last three months. Reason: No payments have been made to them in the absence of any sports events due to the Covid-19 pandemic.But the never-say-die attitude of Lal has helped him fight the odds.“That’s the only way for me in this crisis situation,” said Lal, a native of Lucknow, on Sunday. The former power lifter doesn’t mind letting people know that he has 12 international medals (10 silver and two bronze) and 35-odd medals at the national championships. “Seeing kids without food etc was very difficult for me. But I decided not to succumb to the situation and instead to fight against it,” said Lal, whose eatery fetches him a daily business of Rs 300-400. He bagged his first international medal (a silver) at the Senior Asian Championship in Taiwan in 1993.He is connected with his trainees even on phone (free of cost).“They (trainees) call me and ask for support and I help them. Some visit my shop to meet me and I don’t feel bad in doing this business as it’s the best way to live with honesty and dignity,” he said, adding, “It’s a slow start on the business front, but hoping to get people’s attention soon.”A graduate from Lucknow University, Lal had been an ad hoc coach at the Chowk Stadium from 1999 to 2001.“In 2001, I moved to Hindalco Industries in Renukoot in search of a good opportunity and stayed there till 2012. But I came back to Chowk Stadium as hoc coach in 2015 when I came to know about a better job here.”As an international player of his time, Lal gets Rs 25,000 per month for 11 months a year, as per government norms.“My daughter is pursuing graduation from Lucknow University while my son is in Class 9. But I don’t have money to spend on my son’s online classes. The school has asked for Rs 5,000 as first installment and I don’t have the money for this. Don’t know how things will unfold in future, but for now my family is hoping for better days,” said Lal, who has taken a loan of Rs 35,000 to start his business.“Friends and relatives helped me start this business, but I feel that something has to be done to help all ad hoc coaches. Many of them are running roadside vegetable and tea shops across the state as they have no other option left,” said Lal.It is learnt that last week, the district administration in Kanpur came to the rescue of 17 ad hoc coaches, giving them Rs 15,000 (at Rs 5,000 per month) as a special relief fund for the last three months from the ‘Khelkood Protsahan Samiti’. The coaches would continue getting Rs 5,000 per month till the resumption of sports activities in UP.“This system has to be followed everywhere in the state to help the struggling ad hoc coaches. When the government is distributing foodgrain and Rs 1,000 to labourers in the state, something has to be done for the ad hoc coaches also,” said a taekwondo coach.Though UP Sports Directorate authorities had been promising to help ad hoc coaches, nothing had so far been done on the ground level. “We are in the process of doing something for them… waiting for a green signal from the top,” said RP Singh, director (sports), UP.In view of restrictions due to the pandemic, there have been no sports activities. Stadiums are open but only for walk and yoga activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/former-powerlifter-trying-to-eke-out-a-living-by-selling-vada-paav/story-Adiz3Hsy6ADQQu1o1Mzi7L.html
13-07-2020||City||Three get bail in northeast Delhi riots cases, one denied relief||New Delhi: A Delhi court on Monday granted bail to three accused in different northeast Delhi riots’ cases, stating that there was no evidence on record and mere identification by constables is “weak evidence”. The court also denied bail to one person, observing that there is enough material on record to show that he had actively participated in the arson in which a book shop was completely charred.Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav ordered the release of Abdul Khaliq, an accused in a case related to the riots in Dayalpur, and Shyam Patel and Sonu Kumar in connection to the violence in Bhajanpura.Appearing for Khaliq, his counsel said his client was not named in the FIR and there was no CCTV footage where he can be seen. He said Khaliq was arrested just on the basis of being named by one constable, Piyush.Patel and Kumar’s lawyer Saroj Kumar Jha told the court that both the applicants were named in 10 cases and granted bail in eight. He said there was no CCTV footage in which they can be spotted.Appearing for police, the Special Public Prosecutor told the court that they had been identified by a constable named Yogesh and had been involved in the riots.Opposing the bail of Khaliq, the police said Piyush was the beat constable of the area and knew the accused as a resident of the same locality. The SPP said on March 7, his statement was recorded by the IO in the matter where he had named the accused and two other persons to be part of unlawful assembly.The court, however, found that in both the cases, mere naming of the accused by the constables was “weak evidence”. Granting bail to Khaliq, the court said, “ …naming of Khaliq by constable Piyush in the matter is prima-facie, a very weak kind of evidence”.The court said if Piyush was present at the spot and identified the accused (Khaliq) as one of the rioters, then he should have reported to the nearest police station, which he did not do.He ordered the release of Patel and Kumar, saying there is nothing on record such as independent witnesses, CCTV footage or any video recording to show the presence of the accused at the spot or that they were involved in rioting and chanting slogans against the other community.The court said identification by constable Yogesh, in absence of reason on why he did not report the matter to the police station when he saw the accused, is a weak piece of evidence.The same judge denied bail to Mohammad Furqan after observing that there was enough material on record to show that he had actively participated in the riots. The court said his presence has been duly seen in CCTV footage and his identification by one constable Pawan at this stage cannot be considered as weak evidence.Furqan was arrested for rioting and setting a book store on fire in Dayalpur. Appearing for Furqan, his counsel had contended that nothing had been recovered from his client and that he had clean antecedents. He said there was a delay of 10 days in the recording of FIR in the matter.The court said it is a matter of record that more than 10,000 PCR calls were received in the Dayalpur police station on the date of the incident and it was very difficult for police to revert or respond to all callers.“The atmosphere in or around the area was frightening and as such the complainant did not come forward to report the matter to the police. There is a clear explanation of the delay in recording the FIR,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-get-bail-in-northeast-delhi-riots-cases-one-denied-relief/story-X2nHmlQGk3PaG9xXqGYwqN.html
13-07-2020||Chandigarh||PU to request UGC to review decision on holding exams||Panjab University (PU) has decided to request the University Grants Commission (UGC) to review the final semester examinations this year because of the Covid-19 pandemic.This was unanimously resolved at PU’s syndicate meeting on Monday after members debated for hours before resolving that conducting examinations in the current situation would not be safe for students as well as staffers.“We have decided to request the UGC to review their decision to conduct examinations. There will be no sanctity of conducting exams during this situation,” said syndicate member Rabindernath Sharma.The Union ministry of human resource and development had said on July 6 that the final year examinations in the universities will be held in September.Though exams were not on the agenda, members discussed the issue at length given the students’ concerns.The syndicate also constituted a committee under the chairmanship of Professor Navdeep Goyal to figure out when the exams could be held in the next session.The committee, which has been directed to submit its report within a week or two, includes syndicate members HS Dua, DPS Randhawa and Anu Chatrath. They will draft a proposal on the feasibility of holding the exams and a likely time frame.Before the meeting, students affiliated with Students for Society (SFS), All India Students Association (AISA), Ambedkar Students Association (ASA), Punjab Students Union (PSU- Lalkaar) and Youth For Swaraj held a protest outside the University’s administration hall against UGC’s decision to hold the examinations. They also urged the University to resolve the issue of the final semester examination at the earliest.While taking a call on the admission guidelines for the affiliated colleges, the syndicate members decided to hold the Common Entrance Test for post graduate and BEd coursesentrance in affiliated colleges for the 2020-21 academic session. The syndicate also approved holding admissions in both online and offline mode in affiliated colleges this year.Professor SK Tomar’s tenure as dean students welfare (DSW) of Panjab University till May 2021 was approved on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pu-to-request-ugc-to-review-decision-on-holding-exams/story-zIppHTf6EyMa2vj848ClPI.html
13-07-2020||City||Free meals resume at Delhi homeless shelters||New Delhi: The Delhi government has asked all the shelter management agencies in the city to immediately resume providing two meals a day free of cost at all homeless shelters. While distribution of free lunch and dinner started from Monday, a few shelters were left out on day one. The Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) has about 200 shelter homes, including porta cabins and permanent buildings, where around 7,000 homeless people stay at present. The government has roped in various NGOs to run these shelters, which will also provide meals to occupants. The board in an order issued on Sunday asked all shelter management agencies concerned to provide free lunch and dinner to homeless people who stay at DUSIB shelter homes from July 13. The free distribution of cooked food had started during the nationwide lockdown when the government started feeding occupants of these shelters as well as migrants and others in need through its 2,500 hunger relief centres. The DUSIB had, however, discontinued free meals from July 1, triggering appeals from NGOs and activists to resume the scheme. The meals include khichdi for lunch and dal, chawal, chapatis and vegetables for dinner. “We started providing meals from today. The shelter occupants, who were really upset about the food distribution being stopped earlier, were more than happy to receive the meals. There are a lot of senior citizens in these shelters, who are sick and cannot go out for work and hence require daily meals,” said Prabhas Chaudhary of Safe Approach NGO, which has nine shelters in North Delhi under its supervision. At some other shelters, occupants complained of not being provided breakfast. A senior DUSIB official said on condition of anonymity said the free meal scheme had been resumed and food was provided at most shelters on Monday. The remaining shelters will be covered from Tuesday. “Since the order was issued just a day before, some NGOs could not arrange for the meals. The scheme was under assessment and in view of many homeless people still not getting jobs or enough money, it was decided to resume the meals till the situation improves,” the official said. He said the government plans to start community kitchens at some of the shelters, which are housed in permanent structures. “There are around 18 shelters, which are designated for families, and 17 others, which are only for women. We plan to start a kitchen in these complexes where dry ration and cooking equipment will be provided to occupants and they will be able to cook their meals. It is expected to start soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/free-meals-resume-at-delhi-homeless-shelters/story-r0zO5vMPDIHiQFaoIlRfBN.html

While 864 liquor shops in the city are currently operational, around 800-odd restrobars, hotels and clubs, have stayed shut since March 25, when a nationwide lockdown was put in place to contain the spread of Covid-19.Hotels, clubs and restaurant licensees are required to prepare an inventory of all beer stock with barcode, which is then to be transferred to licenced vendors, the excise department said in an order issued last week. “Beer has a shorter shelf life and the order was issued to give some relief to the owners of these establishments,” said a senior excise official.Vinod Giri, of the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverages, said: “We welcome the decision of the Delhi government to allow bars to sell beer that is getting old. This is what we had recommended to the government in May this year. The hospitality sector is under great stress and this may help recover some investment stuck in stocks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hotels-restro-bars-told-to-sell-beer-stock-nearing-expiry-to-liquor-vends/story-v8wB6aeyd36sIvOZnAwZ2O.html
13-07-2020||City||Jamia violence: Court tells cops to file reply on pleas seeking relief||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Monday gave two days to Delhi Police to file their replies to pleas seeking relief in connection with the violence that had broken out at Jamia Milia Islamia during the anti-CAA protests, after some of the petitioners said they had not received a copy of police response to all the petitions. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan told the counsels for Delhi police, advocate Amit Mahajan and Rajat Nair, to file the replies within two days after it was informed by the counsel for some of the petitioners that Delhi Police had filed its response only in a few petitions and not all. The pleas sought registration of FIRs against the erring police officers among other reliefs.“Respondents (Delhi Police) have filed consolidated replies in a few matters. We direct the respondents to file replies in all the matters within two days. Rejoinder, if any, be filed in four days thereafter,” the bench said.The court said copies of counter-affidavits and rejoinders should be supplied to all the parties before the next date of hearing on June 21.Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for some of the petitioners, said police had not filed the reply in three petitions seeking compensation for alleged injuries to students by police and action against the erring officials.The consolidated affidavit of the police was filed in six of the nine petitioners in the Jamia violence matter.Meanwhile, the petitioners filed a list of issues to be adjudicated in the matter. During the hearing, the counsel for one petitioner objected to the police filing the names of the victims and those arrested in sealed covers. She said copies should be given to the petitioners.Opposing a batch of PILs seeking setting up of a judicial commission to look into the violence, police termed the claim of brutality as utter falsehood.The police filed the affidavit in response to various petitions moved by lawyers, students of JMI, residents of Okhla in south Delhi, where the university is located, and the Imam of Jama Masjid opposite Parliament House, seeking medical treatment, compensation and interim protection from arrest for students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jamia-violence-court-tells-cops-to-file-reply-on-pleas-seeking-relief/story-J3JeSHicCfgDTJuhFA1iSI.html

We are speaking to local residents to help us with the identification,” the DCP said.The portacabin located near Delhi Gate was locked from the outside and never used as the Mohalla Clinic for which it was set up, the DCP said.The fire department said it received a call about the blaze a little after midnight and sent three fire tenders to douse the flames.“While the blaze was doused quickly, we recovered the charred body of a man in the remains. We informed the police about it,” a fire department official said.The DCP said that the window of the portacabin was open, and it was likely that the man used the opening to enter and exit the cabin.The police have registered a case of causing death by negligence and are investigating the incident even as the trigger for the blaze remains unknown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/unidentified-man-charred-to-death-in-fire-in-portacabin/story-7QlSZvwPDU3mCQt2lzAxeO.html
13-07-2020||City||Requisite info, maps to be submitted to delimitation panel in July: J&K CEO||Amid strong reservations of Kashmir-based political parties, especially the National Conference, Jammu and Kashmir chief electoral officer (CEO) Hirdesh Kumar Singh on Monday said the information sought by the delimitation commission is being compiled by all the 20 district commissioners and will be sent to the apex authority this month.BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav had said the legislative assembly will be formed in J&K after completion of the delimitation process. Also, J&K lieutenant governor GC Murmu had recently told HT that the assembly polls in the UT can be held after or before delimitation of parliamentary and assembly constituencies.The CEO said, “The commission has not visited J&K as yet but has sought substantial information from us in various formats like maps, statistics, 2011 Census figures, new tehsils, patwars and halqas. The information is being compiled district wise by all the 20 district commissioners and will be sent to the panel this month itself.”“After we send all the requisite information followed by a preliminary exercise, the commission will visit J&K to interact with political parties. It is not clear if the panel will meet people from both the regions. However, whatever is required by the commission will be done,” he said.The Union law ministry has constituted the Delimitation Commission headed by former Supreme Court judge Ranjana Prakash Desai to redraw Lok Sabha and assembly constituencies of the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir.Election commissioner Sushil Chandra and election commissioner of J&K and the four states are ex-officio members of the commission.All five Lok Sabha MPs from Jammu and Kashmir including Dr Farooq Abdullah, Hasnain Masoodi and Muhammad Akbar Lone from the National Conference and Dr Jitendra Singh and Jugal Kishore from the BJP have been nominated as “associate members” to assist the panel in redrawing parliamentary and assembly constituencies.However, in May, the National Conference had said that its MPs will not participate in the exercise as the party was unwilling to accept the events of August 5 last year.“The delimitation commission is a product of the J&K Reorganization Act 2019, which the party is challenging in and outside the Supreme Court,” the NC had said.Meanwhile, J&K Congress has announced a 10-member committee to deal with the issue. Former minister Peerzada Mohammad Sayeed was named as chairman of the committee and the members included former deputy chief minister Tara Chand, former MP Madan Lal Sharma, former ministers Taj Mohiuddin, RS Chib and MS Niaz, and former legislators Ravinder Sharma and AS Micky.According to Section 60 of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, the number of seats in the legislative assembly of Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir will be increased from 107 to 114. Out of these, 24 seats are in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The constituencies in the erstwhile state were last delimited in 1995 and the state assembly had then unanimously agreed upon putting a freeze on any such exercise till 2026.As per Census 2011, J&K has a population of 12,541,302.The erstwhile state of J&K that comprised Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh regions had six Lok Sabha seats—one in Ladakh, two in Jammu and three in Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/requisite-info-maps-to-be-submitted-to-delimitation-panel-in-july-j-k-ceo/story-xPZL1XGxA7XYeCrgUJIAkI.html

The Congress government should also deposit the admission and tuition fee of all children whose parents’ income has reduced during the lockdown,” demanded Romana.The YAD chief also pointed out that the Congress government had played a friendly match with the private school managements in court and had allowed them to have their way by putting up a weak defence deliberately. “Now, it is up to the government to take corrective action immediately or be ready for an agitation,” he warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/stop-private-schools-from-indulging-in-loot-yad-asks-capt/story-Yzb1pA95XCXuQHskKwhJXI.html

Members of Naroa Punjab Manch, a Faridkot-based NGO, have written to chairman of National Green Tribunal and Chief Justice of Punjab and Haryana high court, opposing the state government’s decision.Coordinator of the manch, Gurpreet Singh Chandbaja, said, “Only around 3.65% of the state’s area is under forest. If an industrial park is developed there, it will also add to pollution of the Sutlej river.”Earlier, members of another NGO, Ecosikh, had raised concerns over the same and demanded that the state government should reconsider the decision.A section of industrialists have also opposed the move stating that it will damage the forest area and the government should first upgrade existing industrial areas, which are in poor condition.Rajeev Jain, district president of Laghu Udyog Bharti, an industrial organisation, said, “The existing focal points and industrial areas are in bad shape. But, rather than improving existing infrastructure, the government is creating more industrial parks. The government will not be able to attract new industry until it upgrades existing infrastructure. Both Union and state government should help existing upgrade industry so that it can compete with China.”Managing director of GST Group, Ranjodh Singh, said, “Setting up an industrial park will ruin ecological balance of the habitat. Further, pollution will affect the Sutlej water and air. Mattewara forest is home to many birds and animals such as peacock, antelopes, deer and other old varieties of flora and fauna. The government should reconsider its decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ngos-industrialists-oppose-punjab-govt-s-decision-to-set-up-industrial-park-near-mattewara-forest/story-Q9WVU6yFkgRM3GX04iXqSK.html

May I remind you that you had promised to eradicate the menace of drugs within four weeks of coming into power by taking oath with Gutka Sahib in hand? After over three years of Congress rule, while the drug problem is far from solved, illegal distilleries have come up, causing a revenue loss of over ₹5,600 crore,” said Kalia.He added that during the assembly elections, a promise of complete debt waiver was made to farmers, which comes out to ₹90,000 crore, and out of it ₹4,700 crore stands waived till now as claimed by you, which is not even close to 80% fulfilment.The claim of industry-friendly initiatives includes investment proposals of ₹57,735 crore, but how many of them have been realised on the ground has not been mentioned, Kalia pointed out.“After coming to power, you promised to give employment to 5 lakh youths each year. By that count, it comes out to 17.5 lakh jobs to the youth. Your claim of employment to 13.42 lakh youth itself shows that your government has failed to meet the target,” the former minister said.Kalia added that Congress MLAs and MPs were not satisfied with Captain’s governance and have been raising their voice against the government from time to time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bjp-leader-seeks-details-of-promises-fulfilled-by-capt-govt/story-KqeHDjTdgasvVKO8qB9JRJ.html

The speaker dismissed the petitions against both the lawmakers saying they “lacked substance”, a Vidhan Sabha spokesperson said.Reacting to speaker’s ruling Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Aradhana Misra said a legal opinion is being taken on the issue.  “The Congress party had filed two petitions before the Assembly speaker under the tenth schedule for disqualification of Aditi Singh and Rakesh Singh from the a Assembly. I believe the evidence that we had presented and the rules were overlooked,” Misra said. “We have full confidence that on the basis of the evidence that we presented we will get full justice from the court,” she said. Misra has also filed separate petitions in a Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court. The bench of justices Dinesh Kumar Singh and Pankaj Kumar Jaiswal have listed the matter on July 14 with a direction to serve notices to the MLAs using their email ids and WhatsApp numbers.  The Congress party had earlier petitioned the Speaker seeking disqualification of its Rae Bareli MLA Aditi Singh and Harchandpur MLA Rakesh Singh. Aditi Singh was served a show-cause notice for attending the special session of the Vidhan Sabha on October 2 last year, defying the party’s whip. She had not responded to the notice. She was sent a reminder for her reply but she refrained from responding to it after which the party had filed the disqualification petition. Rakesh Singh and Aditi Singh, Congress MLAs from Harchandpur and Sadar respectively in Rae Bareli, won the 2017 Uttar Pradesh assembly election on Congress tickets. In the case of Rakesh Singh, the Congress leader in UP Assembly, Aradhana Misra, had alleged that he worked against the party during the 2019 general elections by working for the BJP candidate from Rae Bareli from where Congress president Sonia Gandhi was contesting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-vidhan-sabha-speaker-dismisses-pleas-to-disqualify-two-cong-mlas/story-MjWVbRzmXlc1OK6Oz7GcJP.html

The sudden decision to implement the lockdown has been taken in an attempt to hide the failures of the state government,” said Shirole.The legislators criticised the state government saying that it lacked the vision to prepare a long term plan to combat Covid-19 pandemic and it was unprepared for the worst-case scenario.MP Girish Bapat said that the lockdown decision is unilateral and will lead to chaos.“Why is the administration holding 96 per cent of the citizens to task when only four per cent of the population is Covid-19 positive? he said.“Merely announcing a lockdown is not the solution and won’t curb the Covid-19 positive cases,” said Bapat.“The elected representatives and people should be taken into confidence before going ahead with the lockdown,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-implemented-lockdown-to-hide-its-failures-bjp/story-1BdB59OU36Vi9derNRlvrK.html

13-07-2020||Chandigarh||Kashmir leaders allege govt imposed restrictions to stop Martyr’s Day celebrations||Leaders of mainstream political parties in the Valley have accused the government for imposing restrictions on Martyr’s Day to prevent leaders from going to Mazar-e-Shohda where a function has been held every year since 1948 in memory of those who revolted against the Dogra rule on July 13, 1931.National Conference spokesperson Inam ul Nabi tweeted that the party was not granted permission to hold a function. “The revolution started in 1931 will be never forgotten, undermined, tokenised,” he said. However, NC held a function at its party headquarters at Nawai Subh office where tributes were paid to the martyrs of 1931 revolt. Senior NC leaders were in attendance. Many leaders and common people paid tributes to the martyrs of 1931 on social media. Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party (JKAP) president Syed Mohammad Altaf Bukhari termed the restrictions imposed on the visit of political parties to Mazar-e-Shohda for paying homage to July 13, 1931, martyrs highly regrettable.‘UNJUSTIFIABLE CURBS’Bukhari said that the martyrs’ graveyard in Old Srinagar symbolises the legacy of those bravehearts and sons of the soil who sacrificed their lives to lay the edifice for democracy and natural justice in J&K.“Putting curbs on the visit of political parties to martyrs’ graveyard for paying homage to our heroes who laid down their precious lives against autocracy and oppression is unjustifiable,” he said in a statement.He said July 13, 1931 was a historic day for the people of J&K as the day marks the beginning of a struggle against suppression and inequality. Martyr’s Day will remain relevant for the times to come.While paying glowing tributes to 1931 martyrs, Bukhari cautioned that the suppression of democratic activities under any pretext does not augur well with the constitutional guarantees enjoyed by the citizens in this country. “The lives laid down by the martyrs on July 13 were principally meant to free the society from autocracy and lay edifice for a democratic set up.

And if he wants to contest again for the said post, the vice-president has to be the returning officer.Despite announcing his candidature, Ghuman violated the rules and instead of the vice-president, he appointed another advocate as the returning officer. After this, the bar council took suo moto notice and asked him to appear before a committee constituted to probe the matter.As Ghuman fails to appear and didn’t supply the requisite information, the committee found him guilty of deliberately violating norms and non-cooperation. “Outgoing president Ghuman has behaved in an irresponsible manner which is not expected from an elected president. He has done so because he is again contesting for the post of president in the ensuing elections,” read the orders of Karamjit Singh, chairman of the HC bar council.Meanwhile, Ghuman blamed his rival groups for his suspension. He said that he has done nothing wrong and had not appeared before the committee due to Covid-19 restrictions. “I am in touch with my colleagues and will challenge this undemocratic decision,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bar-council-suspends-license-of-patiala-bar-association-president/story-4L3BF0wIMRszENIoKdjUXP.html

Rathore said the party is not against reviving tourism and other sectors but there is a need to remain vigilant at present. “Even hoteliers and other businessmen are not in favour of this decision and the state government should reconsider it,” he said.He said the Congress will not let the state government turn Himachal into a Covid-19 destination. “There was a time when Himachal did not had a single coronavirus case but now the number of infections has reached around 1,150 and nine people have lost their lives. It is because people coming from other states were not tested properly,” Rathore said.The Congress also submitted a memorandum to chief minister Jai Ram Thakur through Shimla deputy commissioner Amit Kashyap. In the memorandum, the Congress demanded that the state government should take back the proposal of hiking bus fare by 25%, abolish anti-employee and anti-pension decisions, reel back Dearness Allowance (DA) of all employees, reduce diesel and petrol prices, include Above Poverty Line (APL) families who were struck off from ration subsidy, increase provident fund of employees which was earlier reduced and provide financial relief to youth who have been unemployed for the last four months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rollback-decision-to-reopen-himachal-borders-cong-to-state-govt/story-TOGcOGCedsONY1tCcRFN6L.html
13-07-2020||Chandigarh||5 from Dera Bassi recover, then test positive again for Covid-19||Five persons from Dera Bassi subdivision have been retested and found Covid-19 positive after recovering and being released from Gian Sagar Hospital in Banur 15 days back.The five persons were again tested positive in various hospitals in June, readmitted to Gian Sagar and then discharged later. According to the revised discharge policy , patients discharged from hospital were not retested and allowed to go home after 10 days if they were asymptomatic.That could be the reason why perhaps most of them might not have recovered completely or could still be carrying remnants of the virus, experts said.“I was discharged on June 20 from Gian Sagar Hospital and they did not do a retest, but when I applied for a fitness report on July 6 from the Lalru Civil Hospital, my samples tested positive,” said a patient from Dappar in Dera Bassi who did not wish to be named.Another person from Shivam Complex in Dera Bassi said he was discharged from Gian Sagar on June 21 and moved to Meritorious School in Sector 70 for institutional quarantine. “Doctors took a sample as a routine precaution and I tested positive on June 23,” he said.Reacting to the development, Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said he would be asking the district civil surgeon for a report. However, Dayalan added: “One case I remember is that a person was discharged and again came in contact with a positive person and tested positive. As per revised policy, there is no retesting as most of the patients are asymptomatic.” Dera Bassi subdivision in Mohali district, meanwhile, is struggling to shed the tag of a coronavirus hotspot, as it accounts for more than half of the Covid-19 cases reported so far. The first case was reported on April 4 in Jawaharpur village and since then the flow of patients has not stopped.Of the 423 cases reported in the district, the highest, 31, was recorded on Monday. In the last three months, 170 cases have been recorded in Dera Bassi .Dera Bassi subdivision comprises of Dera Bassi town, Zirakpur and Lalru with a population of around four lakh. All the towns are located on Delhi-Chandigarh highway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/5-from-dera-bassi-recover-then-test-positive-again-for-covid-19/story-b64r8XvsmUygzvE9tfw4LP.html

13-07-2020||Delhi||Let’s show some TLC for baby birds: Dos and Dont’s of bird rescue||Delhi is a haven for bird lovers as it is home to over 300 species of birds. And this is the time of the year when baby birds start to hatch. As is the law of the jungle, they are faced with hardships, the most common one being dislocation from their nests. Due to reasons that may range from storms or people sweeping away their nests in a bid to clean their houses, these baby birds find themselves in a state of shock, injury and hunger. Musician Manta Sidhu, who runs Angel Eyes Bird Rescue, released a video on her social media elaborating on how to save abandoned baby birds. “Our natural tendency to pick up a baby bird and bring it home is unnecessary in most cases. Immediate priority should be finding the nest, putting the babies back and reuniting them with their families,” she says in the video. Caution should be exercised when handling a fallen bird as there are chances the baby bird might be injured. “Put a towel over it so that it cannot see you. If a baby bird can’t see you, it won’t try to attack, nor would it try to flee, ensuring its safety. Put it in a cardboard box and make small holes in it. Try and locate its nest, but in case you can’t find it, contact a rescue centre,” says Muhammad Saud of Wildlife Rescue.Baby birds can be classified into two stages of development, and depending on their physical characteristics, they are called nestlings and fledglings. Nestlings are too young to leave their nests, have no or few feathers and have not yet learnt to hop, perch or walk, whereas, fledglings have grown all their feathers and are now learning to fly. “If you have found a nestling, remember that its nest will be directly above the area where it was found since it cannot fly or walk. If it is a fledgling, you must observe it from a distance for an hour or two hours; in most cases, the parent birds can be seen hanging around the baby. If after observation, the baby bird is still found on the ground, identify the species and the parents, and follow their movements to locate the nest. If the nest is too high to reach, place the baby at an accessible height that is as close to the nest as possible,” advises Sidhu.Birds of prey, as well as elements like traffic, pose a threat to the survival of these fallen baby birds. Then there are people who try and sell them, looking to make a quick buck. The recovery rate among fallen birds, then, depends on their age and nature of injury. “They weigh more when they are young and their feathers aren’t developed either. They fall with a thud, leading to fractures and internal injuries. If they are slightly older, their feathers help them glide as they fall, cushioning the impact. It is best to contact experts or bring them to a centre for proper medical care,” says Saud.“Rescued baby birds must not be force fed any food or water without consultation with an expert,” seconds Sidhu. With a little bit of patience, baby birds can be rescued and given a new lease of life. Every act of kindness goes a long way. How you can help:1. Learn about bird species so that identification becomes easier.2. Make provisions for nesting in your house. It could be safe corner or a hole in the wall, away from the prying eyes of crows and cats.3. Keep water in bowls on your terrace or balconies. 4. Grow vines and climbers at your house if possible. They help provide necessary shade and shelter.Interact with Etti Bali @TheBalinianFollow @htlifeandstyle for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/let-s-show-some-tlc-for-baby-birds-dos-and-dont-s-of-bird-rescue/story-Sf5gfSZb4AITZsb7uvtrJJ.html

13-07-2020||Chandigarh||Strict weekend curbs likely as Mohali logs highest Covid-19 spike in 2 days with 31 cases||The district administration was deliberating over strict weekend restrictions as Mohali recorded the highest number of Covid-19 cases for the second day running with 31 testing positive on Monday following 26 cases on Sunday. This takes the district’s count to 423.Of the 31 patients, 14 were women and two were minor boys. Concerned over the increasing Covid-19 cases, Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan on Monday directed the entire safety protocol enforcement team, including municipal corporation and municipal council officials and subdivisional magistrates to activate teams for stricter enforcing of social distancing and wearing of masks in critical crowding locations such as market areas, malls, restaurants/eateries, public offices and banks immediately.With the increased transportation/commuting relaxations in the ongoing unlock phase, a disease surge was expected because of which safety measures had to be implemented.Denying that authorities had been lax in imposing rules, Dayalan said, “the cases that have surfaced are not due to people coming on their own to flu centres/hospitals for checking. Rather, the administration is going for extensive sampling of target groups( contacts of active cases, travel history) which has led to surfacing of positive cases.”Those testing positive on Monday included five persons from Kharar, including a man, 82, a woman, 33, and a boy, 11, a 70-year-old man from Dashmesh Nagar and a 51-year-old man from Sunny Enclave.Others included a woman, 60, and a boy, 4, from Sector 116; a woman, 80, and a man, 59, from phase- 4; a woman, 22, from Kumbra; two women, 67 and 35,from Sector 97; a man, 40, from Balongi, three women, 55, 25 and 20, from Lalru; a woman, 50, from Sector 88; a man, 45, from Phase-3 B2 and another man, 64, from Phase-6.Six people, including three teenagers: two males, 16, and a female, 17, were among those infected in Peermuchalla in Zirakpur, where a woman, 36, and three men, 20 and 35, also tested positive. Five men, including two 19-year-olds and others aged 45, 50 and 53, were from Avinash Colony in Dera Bassi.Most of the patients were contacts of other Covid-19 cases and had travel history, said Dr Manjit Singh, civil surgeon, Mohali. “Most of the patients are asymptomatic and are responding well to the treatment.”All the patients had been admitted to Gian Sagar Hospital in Banur, he added.Of the 423 cases, 271 have recovered, 145 are active and seven persons have died.Dayalan also confirmed that Behda in Dera Bassi had been declared a containment zone as it had over 15 cases. The Majat village charcoal factory and Peermuchalla were now micro containment zones (with more than five but less than 15 cases). Sector 66 Mohali had been declared a cluster (with more than two but less than 15 cases).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/highest-covid-19-spike-in-mohali-in-two-days-with-31-cases/story-5tImgyQlq6WVkKGnVJ08qO.html

13-07-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM rules out quota in private jobs for state youths||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Sunday ruled out quota for the state’s youth in private sector jobs, saying Haryana’s decision to give reservations to local candidates in such jobs will not stand judicial scrutiny.The chief minister was responding to questions by several youngsters during a ‘AskCaptain’ Facebook Live session. The Haryana cabinet on July 6 had approved a proposal paving way for an ordinance to give 75 per cent reservation in private sector jobs to the youth of the state. The Constitution and the law bars any such discrimination in the matter of private jobs, Singh said when asked why his government could not follow the Haryana model of reservation in private sector jobs. The chief minister pointed out that Punjabis were employed all over the country, with no restrictions by any state. “We cannot stop youths from other states taking up jobs in Punjab,” he said.Singh added that he did not believe Haryana’s decision could be upheld in the courts.To a question on the encounter of gangster Vikas Dubey in Uttar Pradesh, the chief minister said he could not comment on the issue but the Congress was right in demanding an inquiry. The truth needs to be revealed, Singh was quoted as saying in an official release. To a concern expressed by a Amritsar resident on the tender for supply of ‘desi ghee’ to the Golden Temple by a Pune-based company instead of Milkfed, Singh said he was not in favour of this as dairy was the “second crop” for Punjab and had to be supported. Commenting that no ‘ghee’ is better than Punjab ghee, he hoped the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) would reconsider its decision. The SGPC, an apex gurdwara body, had allotted a tender worth Rs 60 crore for the supply of ‘desi ghee’ and skimmed milk for making ‘Karah Parshad’ and ‘langar’ to a Pune-based firm. Earlier, the religious body was purchasing these items from Punjab Milkfed (Punjab State Cooperative Milk Producers Federation Limited).            To a question on the slow pace of land mutations, he said he had directed the chief secretary to conduct a special drive to accelerate the process and clear pending mutations at the earliest.           On a point raised by a Khanna resident regarding the Punjab School Education Board certificate not recognised for international studies in some countries like Australia, the chief minister said he will take up the issue with the Australian government and urge it to give due recognition to PSEB school degrees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-cm-rules-out-quota-in-private-jobs-for-state-youths/story-xdKUlGaZ3Ih4UeOtm8gdbN.html

The information technology cell of the detective department has started a probe, said joint commissioner of police (crime) Murlidhar Sharma.The BJP has intensified its social media campaign against the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) on various issues.On July 9 and 10, the party posted three films on its official Twitter handle. The films are less than a minute long and show crime against women. One of these films portrays two minor children though their faces are not clearly shown. The film claims that the mother of the minors was raped and slashed with a broken bottle in Birbhum district. The messages say that people of the state will no longer tolerate crime against women. The videos in question have still not been taken down from the party’s Twitter handle.The commission, which is under the state women and child development and social welfare department, has written to Kolkata police commissioner Anuj Sharma that using minor children in such scenes is punishable under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and it also violates Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act. The commission has sought a report from the Kolkata Police.BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu said his party is not bothered by what the commission says. “It (the commission) has no credibility. People who head these bodies owe their allegiance entirely to ruling party leaders. They will do anything that they are asked to. We are neither worried nor bothered,” said Basu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bjp-s-bengal-poll-campaign-film-enacts-rape-scene-police-report-sought/story-KSkGSJZBbSGE6EBcgQdoII.html

13-07-2020||Patna||Plasma therapy a ray of hope as Covid-19 patient comes out of ventilator support||Plasma therapy as a cure to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has kindled a ray of hope after a doctor from Bihar’s Muzaffarpur was weaned off ventilator support, besides two other patients, at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Patna.All the three patients have recovered from Covid-19 and are now lined up for discharge in the next few days from the AIIMS-Patna, said its doctors.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageHowever, with clinical trials on plasma therapy still not over, doctors are reluctant to bet their money on its treatment.“As per scientific logic, plasma therapy should work on Covid-19 patients. However, we do not know its efficacy as yet. The evidence is still anecdotal,” said Dr Ravi Kirti, additional professor and head of medicine department at AIIMS-Patna.“The clinical trials are being done on the principle that any patient who is infected with a virus develops antibodies against it. We expect the antibody to fight the virus. Plasma therapy is collecting antibody from a person who has already recovered from the disease and transfusing it in another infected person. This is also called passive immunity,” he added. “The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is conducting big multi-centric trials in India. We have to wait for its results. Recovery trial in the UK is simultaneously testing several modalities. The interim reports suggest that hydroxychloroquin is ineffective whereas low dose corticosteroid is helpful in saving lives in moderate and severe cases,” he added.“Unless it is contraindicated, we are administering low molecular weight heparin (a blood thinning agent, which prevents clotting in the artery), Dexamethasome (a corticosteroid group of drug, which works as immunity suppressant) and giving oxygen therapy to all moderate and severe Covid-19 patients,” said Dr Kirti.He said Remdesivirm Toclizumab and plasma therapy were investigational drugs, which clinicians decided on a case-to-case basis after talking to a team of doctors and informing the relatives of patients.Dr Umesh Bhadani, professor and head of anaesthesiology who is handling the critical care unit at AIIMS, echoed Dr Kirti’s views.“We give two kinds of ventilator support — invasive and non-invasive — as part of the execution of treatment to very serious patients. As of now, we have 12 patients on invasive ventilator support and four on non-invasive ventilator support, through a mask,” said Dr Bhadani.“Plasma therapy has had good result, but it cannot be given to critical patients or those with multi-organ failure or in shock,” said Dr Neha Singh, blood transfusion officer who is also the principal investigator in the ICMR trial on plasma therapy at the AIIMS-Patna.“We have tried it on a few patients, who have recovered and will be discharged from our institute soon,” she added.Dr Devender Bhushan and Dr Neeraj Kumar, assistant professors and co-investigators in the trial, are part of the supportive team of medicine and anesthesiology department, besides senior residents and postgraduate students of the two departments under the guidance of their faculty members who provide 24x7 support at AIIMS-Patna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/plasma-therapy-a-ray-of-hope-as-covid-19-patient-comes-out-of-ventilator-support/story-wDfKvKlPQsE29XUq5YMbxO.html
13-07-2020||Delhi||India’s clinical protocol has kept death rate low: Harsh Vardhan||India’s clinical protocol has focused on early detection through widespread testing, surveillance, prompt triaging and clinical management of cases. This has resulted in one of the lowest case fatality rate of 2.66%, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said on Sunday after inspecting the 10,000-bed Covid Care Centre in Chhatarpur.Apart from inspecting the centre, the health minister also interacted with 12 patients admitted at the facility after donning a personal protective gear. He also reviewed the hygiene and sanitation conditions in the facility. The inspection was a part of a series of reviews that the health minister has been carrying out of various dedicated Covid-19 health facilities on Sundays for a few months now.“Our success can be seen in the recovery rate which is almost 63% with more than 5.3 lakh patients recovered,” said Harsh Vardhan.The facility that started on July 5 has 123 cases with mild symptoms.According to the staff members, only five patients were serious enough to be referred to a hospital for advance treatment.Out of 10,200 beds at the facility, 2,000 are currently in use.About 91 doctors are deployed at the centre, who work on a rotation basis in three shifts, and are available around the clock. The medical team is sent for quarantine after 8 days and new staff comes to replace them. Also, 10 per cent of medical personnel are kept as contingency reserve.In-house psychological counselling and psychiatry services are being provided by counsellors trained at the NIMHANS (National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences). Daily meditation and yoga sessions are also conducted for the patients, and the facility also follows naturopathy and protocols of Ayurveda to boost immunity. Telemedicine support is being provided by referral hospital, Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/india-s-clinical-protocol-has-kept-death-rate-low-harsh-vardhan/story-5DRRcTNMmRWv67AMJWtRGM.html
13-07-2020||Delhi||Live streaming now: Shravan puja takes a virtual detour during Covid-19||Like most things during the pandemic, puja rituals in the month of Shravan have also gone virtual. Quite a few temples in NCR are shut, including some in Delhi’s hotspot areas. To ensure social distancing, there’s limited entry allowed at most temples, even during the month dedicated to lord Shiva. This has led devotees to take to the virtual route to ensure that they don’t miss out on the essential puja and rudra abhishek. For many devouts, it’s a ritual to offer milk while worshipping Shivlinga in the holy month of Shravan, every year. What’s coming in handy in times of social distancing, is ‘virtual sankalp’ and thereafter a live streaming of the rudra abhishek. Indra Kumar Tripathi, a priest in Faridabad, says, “The temple premises are shut and we are not allowing anyone inside because of the corona scare. Doors are shut, but one can worship from outside. With no special physical ritual happening this year, we are taking orders for virtual puja. Someone from California has made a booking for rudra abhishek, and we will be live streaming the puja for her so that she can see and participate, from her home.” To put together the entire two hour rudra abhishek, there are various packages. “We are charging ₹3,100 for the ritual. Since no one will be available physically, we will take the sankalp (resolution) with their names and complete the puja here, in the temple itself. And not just from America, we are receiving queries from various parts of the world,” adds Tripathi. Besides the NRIs, devotees in India are also opting for virtual pujas to maintain social distancing. Pooja Maheshwari, a Kanpur-based homemaker, says, “Every year, in the month of Shravan, we organise a grand puja and worship lord Shiva. But, no temples are open near my house this year, and I have had to book for a particular puja in a temple in Noida. One of my relatives who lives in Noida told me that the temple in their society is open, and the pandit ji there was organising such live streaming of pujas for others as well, for which I have paid ₹5,100.” Situated in Noida, Gopal Panditji, who has been assigned the task to perform the ritual as requested by Maheshwari, says, “Is saal humare paas har baar se jyada bookings hai, but most of them are for virtual sankalp and puja. This used to happen at popular shrines earlier, but now during Covid-19 it has become a common practice to ensure puja paath doesn’t stop during the pandemic. Aur is time pe zaruri bhi hai, sabki achchi sehat ke liye.” Not just the pujas in Shravan, but even other rituals have found a never seen before dimension in these times. Quite a few devotees who couldn’t go to bring gagajal on kawars, due to the ban on Kanwar Yatra, have taken to charity for the entire month of Shravan. “It’s believed that one needs to bring the holy water of Ganga twice, and I’m supposed to go again this year but I can’t. So, I’ve thought of an alternative. For this whole month, I’ve decided to feed the stray dogs in my vicinity,” says Madhav Arora, a Faridabad resident. Now that’s another way to practise godliness while giving back to the society.

13-07-2020||City||India’s main opponent is China, not Pakistan, says Sharad Pawar||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief and former defence minister Sharad Pawar in an interview published by Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamna on Sunday said that India’s main opponent is China and not Pakistan, but New Delhi cannot afford a direct war with Beijing. He said that India must resolve all issues with China through dialogue and diplomatic strategies with the help of other nations and the United Nations (UN). Pawar, in the second part of the three-part interview to Sena parliamentarian and Saamana’s executive editor Sanjay Raut also said that the Modi government tried to take a “different stand” on foreign policy but it did not work. “We never changed our foreign policies and bilateral relations with other countries and they were in continuation since Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and even Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s regimes. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tried to take a different stand by calling Chinese President Xi Jinping on friendly visits and made him sit on a swing [at Sabarmati riverfront]. Modi tried to portray that he has forged ties of friendship with our neighbours. But these efforts have not worked,” the former Union minister said.Pawar said that China successfully wooed all the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka against India. “Modi’s first visit after taking over charge as the prime minister was to Nepal, which was considered India’s friend and the sole Hindu nation, but the neighbour now stands with China. Pakistan had already shifted its loyalty. India played a major role in the liberation of Bangladesh, but the latter recently inked an agreement with China. Same is the case with Sri Lanka. This means all the countries surrounding India have started talking against us. The disagreement in relationship with the neighbours is the latest contribution [of Modi government],” he said.The NCP chief said that the issues with China cannot be resolved by war. “Our military strength is just one-tenth as compared to that of China’s and in such a backdrop we cannot afford to have a direct war with them. It is true that we have readied our forces and can have a war and are ready to pay the price if the need be. But instead of that we should try to solve the issues diplomatically through dialogue. We lost our territory to China more than 50 years ago and the dispute over it still persists. We should build pressure with the help of other countries and the UN to regain the territory,” he said.Pawar said that though China’s first enemy, almost three decades back, was the United States and Japan, it has now started to pose a threat against India and this was its strategy all along. “When I visited China as the defence minister in 1993 and met the then president of China, he had hinted at this. He had said that his country did not want to have any clashes with its neighbours, as their prime rivalry at the time was the US. He had said that China will “look” at the neighbouring countries after about 25 years,” said Pawar in the interview.The veteran politician, while replying to a question on the country’s economic situation, said that the Modi government should consult with experts such as former PM Manmohan Singh to revive the Indian economy. “As the finance minister in the Narsimha Rao government, of which I was a part too, Manmohan Singh gave new a direction to the economy which was reeling under the crisis in the early 1990s. There is a need to take such similar steps with the help of economic experts. The Modi government lacks in dialogue with those belonging to different ideologies even during such challenging times when there is a pandemic. When Singh, Pranab Mukherjee and P Chidambaram were finance ministers, they would constantly meet experts and political leaders across the party lines and get a sense of the issues faced by the country. It does not happen now,” he said.When the former Maharashtra chief minister (CM) was asked what he thought about PM Modi calling him his ‘political guru’, Pawar said such statements are “convenient stands” taken by politicians and there was no concept of political gurus.Pawar also has praised CM Uddhav Thackeray for his performance in the first six months of the government and said that “though the written exam is over and practicals are pending, he will pass the exam”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/india-s-main-opponent-is-china-not-pakistan-says-sharad-pawar/story-G1jiHFDoT6o6AnMZoy983M.html
13-07-2020||City||Truant constable, two other Mumbai Police cops who marked him present suspended||Three constables attached to the local arms division were suspended from the force. One of the constables, Pravin Deshmukh, was suspended after the police discovered that he visited his native place at Nashik for around 45 days in April without taking an official leave, but was marked present for bandobast duty. “Two other constables, who were in-charge of assigning duties, helped him by marking him present at duty. They have been suspended as well and an inquiry is ongoing,” additional commissioner of police S Jaykumar said. The police said, prima facie it appears that the two constables, Pankaj Mali and Ashish Nerkar, reaped monetary benefits by marking the constable’s attendance.The incident was brought to light by a police personnel after he discovered that though Deshmukh was not reporting for duty, his attendance was being marked. Following this, an inquiry was conducted and it was found that Deshmukh never attended duty in April.On probing further, the police discovered that the duty chart was maintained by Mali and Nerkar. Based on the police’s inquiry, a disciplinary action was taken against the three constables and they were suspended till the completion of the probe, the police said.The police force is facing a staff crunch after the commissioner exempted all the personnel above the age of 55 years from reporting to duty owing to the Covid-19 outbreak. Consequently, the leaves of all the other personnel were cancelled, and those who went on leave or were absent from work were asked to report to duty immediately. Around a week ago, two constables were dismissed from the force for not reporting to duty despite several warnings. Both were suspended earlier and were asked to be present for an inquiry. However, after they failed to be present for the inquiry, their dismissal orders were passed. In June, a criminal case was registered against six personnel attached with Borivli police station for not reporting to duty despite several warnings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/truant-constable-two-other-mumbai-police-cops-who-marked-him-present-suspended/story-oeXGdwqutWhfvBvd9lSqVO.html

13-07-2020||City||Youth held from Gujarat for threatening comedienne||Vadodara police on Sunday night arrested a man for allegedly threatening to rape a stand-up comedienne over her alleged insulting remarks against Chhatrapati Shivaji and abusing her.The accused, Shubham Mishra, is booked under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Information Technology Act. Vadodara police commissioner Anupam Singh Gehlot said, “The accused is in our custody.”Earlier in the day, Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh directed the Mumbai Police to take action against Mishra after a video containing abusive language by the accused went viral.Deshmukh tweeted, “Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj taught us to respect women.But if someone is using/threatening the wrong language about women, then there is a law for them. @MahaCyber1 verify this video. @CPMumbaiPolice take appropriate legal action against the person in the video as per the rules.”The comedienne apologised on social media for her comments and deleted the year-old video in which she made comments on the upcoming memorial for the Maratha king. htc||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/youth-held-from-gujarat-for-threatening-comedienne/story-kIblRwKQoMdQuGNXVLh8bP.html
13-07-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Twice abandoned, now at home||He is only three years old but has already been with four different families, in four different cities — all of them in the National Capital Region. Leo was living in Delhi, Ghaziabad, and, until very recently, Greater Noida. He moved to his current address in Gurugram just 10 days back. He is a dog who has been abandoned twice.“He is part of our family now,” declares Sapna Khajuria, lawyer and home-maker, on WhatsApp video. The lady is out with Leo for their 4pm walk in the “dog park”—a fenced stretch tucked in the grounds of her apartment complex in Sector 30 that is reserved for the residents to walk their pets. Ms Khajuria is with Leo and her other dog, Cookie, who has been with her for three years.But Leo, it has to be said, is the one who is standing out, with his white conical post-surgery protection mask. It, at first, looks like a stylishly designed shield to prevent oneself from getting infected by coronavirus.Ms Khajuria shakes her head, explaining that Leo is recovering from a wound. “He had a boil that later got infected... it all happened before he came to us.”Leo has been with her family—husband and two sons—for only a few days so far but has grown attached to Ms Khajuria so much that her two boys tease him as “mamma’s poonch (tail).” Indeed, sometimes he starts to cry if he doesn’t see Ms Khajuria around. “This is because, I think, he is anxious that he might be abandoned once again.”The other day Ms Khajuria was in her room, and Leo was sobbing and scratching the door with great vigour.According to the information Ms Khajuria received from the dog-rescuer who helped her get Leo, he was initially living in a home somewhere in west Delhi where his family ejected him “after the birth of a (human) baby in the house.” Leo found a new home in Ghaziabad, where his second family decided to get rid of him “due to money problems arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic.” In fact, just as he was being pushed out, an acquaintance of the family appeared and was moved enough to take Leo temporarily to his residence in Greater Noida.That lucky chance saved Leo from living out his days on the road. Today, he is surrounded with love and companionship. Right now he is wagging his tail and looking very happy. His surgical mask suits him well, making him appear like a society snob in one of his Elizabethan collars.Ms Khajuria says she first spotted Leo in a photo put up for adoption in a WhatsApp group of pet owners, and “the heart of everyone in my family melted on looking at him.”After signing a declaration contract that she would never abandon Leo—with the dog rescuer who facilitated the adoption—she drove with her husband to pick up their new family member from Greater Noida. “We took Cookie with us so that she could get used to Leo in the long drive.”In the first two days of his arrival, Leo wasn’t eating anything other than milk and bread, probably the food he was used to in his foster home. Now he heartily dines on chicken, soup, and veggies.Not everything, however, is picture perfect. Ms Khajuria confesses that Cookie and Leo continue to squabble a lot. She explains it as a case of sibling rivalry. “They fight the way human siblings do, like my boys — who will eat first, who will exit the door for a walk first, who will get the toy first...”Meanwhile, it is time to return to the apartment— Leo’s fourth and, hopefully, final home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-twice-abandoned-now-at-home/story-RVGiblLW4XqzWQoUUF3l6K.html
13-07-2020||City||Mumbai-Vadodara Expressway gets CRZ nod, 1K mangrove trees to be lost||The state has granted coastal regulation zone (CRZ) clearances to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) to cut 1,001 mangrove trees for the eight-lane Mumbai-Vadodara Expressway, which will pass through the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).The details of the clearance came to light earlier this week when the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) published the minutes of its June 11 meeting, during which the proposal was discussed and accorded conditional clearance. It has now been recommended to the Union environment ministry.The 379-km greenfield expressway connecting Mumbai to Vadodara expects to reduce the travel time between the two cities to four hours instead of the current seven through national highway (NH)-8. Of the 379-km, 78.1km (phase II) extends from Vasai to Talasari across 4km CRZ area, encompassing 32.4 hectares (ha) crossing the Vaitarna River. Of this, 3.2ha is CRZ1A (the most protected coastal zone), which is home to 1,001 mangrove trees, while 2.68ha is mangrove buffer. The maximum mangrove losses would occur at Navghar and Vadiv villages in Palghar, falling under the Safale forest range. “As the project proponents (NHAI) have decided to build much of the road through the mangroves on stilts and considered the least damaging alignment to forest cover, the project was issued conditional clearance,” said a senior MCZMA official.On September 17, 2018, the Bombay high court (HC) had said that no development permission shall be issued by any authority in Maharashtra for any area under mangroves. “Regardless of ownership of land having mangroves, all constructions taking place within 50 metres (m) on all the sides [of mangrove stretches] shall be forthwith stopped,” the HC had said.According to Neenu Somraj, deputy conservator of forest and member, MCZMA, NHAI will need permissions from the HC to cut the trees. “Minimal mangrove areas will be affected. However, the planning body will need permissions from the HC, and apply for forest clearance under the Forest Conservation (FC) Act, 1980. An area for compensatory afforestation will be identified during the forest clearance process.”The exact loss of mangrove trees was identified by the Dahanu forest department, but NHAI has not been asked to obtain any clearances from the Dahanu Taluka Environment Protection Authority. According to the draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report for the project, which HT has reviewed, the project is likely to have an impact on a total forest area of 191.58ha across Vasai, Palghar, Talasari and Dahanu (including Dahanu taluka eco-fragile zone across 28 km) would lead to the diversion of 13% reserve forest, 2% mangrove forest, 71% protected forests and 14% private forests, and a total of 69,095 trees are expected to be lost. The expressway would pass at a distance of 1.28 km from the boundary of the Tungareshwar Wildlife Sanctuary and 0.45 km away from its eco-sensitive zone boundary, the EIA read.NHAI had applied for clearances under the FC Act for 94.5ha forest diversion for phase II in 2018 but retracted the proposal as a much larger forest area is involved.“We welcome the CRZ clearance. Based on the clearance, we will be applying for FC for the entire 191.58ha. All the conditions proposed by the authorities concerned will be followed. We are ready to ensure compensatory afforestation as much as 10 times the number for the mangroves lost,” said B Mukhopadhyay, general manager, environment, NHAI. Meanwhile, during MCZMA’s meeting on Tuesday, a conditional clearance was accorded to the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) to construct sea walls (anti-sea erosion bunds) at Gharapuri Island, Panje village in Uran, and a boat landing jetty at Nhava. The proposal was deferred last year by the coastal authority over concerns of mangrove loss.“Loss of mangroves is yet to be ascertained but JNPT needs to obtain the HC’s clearance,” said Somraj.Environmentalists were upset with the latest decisions. “At a time when we need to protect the remaining mangroves and wetlands in MMR, such clearances defeat the purpose of having an environment and climate change department,” said BN Kumar, director, NatConnect Foundation, a not-for-profit environment group.Debi Goenka, a petitioner before the HC in the matter of mangroves, said, “A short-sighted approach under the guise of creating artificial infrastructure is destroying natural carbon sinks without any realisation of how it will impact us in the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-vadodara-expressway-gets-crz-nod-1k-mangrove-trees-to-be-lost/story-AK3KlvS0K0G94zEiQUfefM.html
13-07-2020||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: Activist Gautam Navlakha’s bail plea rejected, NIA to get 10-day custody||The special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on Sunday refused to grant a ‘default’ bail to civil rights activist Gautam Navlakha in the Elgar Parishad case. The court also granted NIA his custody for 10 days for interrogation.The special court pronounced the order on the plea of NIA, in which the central agency sought an extension of the 90-day period to file a charge sheet against Navlakha and another accused, activist Dr Anand Teltumbde. The NIA claimed that its officers were unable to investigate properly owing to the Covid-19 outbreak. The agency also sought Navlakha’s custody on the grounds that they need to interrogate him to “unearth the conspiracy”.Navlakha sought a bail claiming that NIA failed to file a charge sheet against him within the stipulated period of 90 days. All the three applications were heard together by the court.Navlakha was arrested in Delhi by the Pune Police on August 28, 2018, but his arrest was quashed by the Delhi high court. However, after the arrest was challenged, Navlakha and some other accused were put under house arrest from August 29 till October 1, 2018. This year in April, Navlakha and Teltumbde were arrested again.Under the provisions of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the agency gets a total period of 180 days to investigate a case and file a charge sheet. However, after the completion of 90 days, the agency has to show the progress in the investigation to seek an extension of 90 more days.While seeking a default bail, Navlakha’s lawyers claimed that the period during which he was put under house arrest should also be considered as period of detention for calculating 90 days.The court, however, refused to accept the contention, observing that the period of house arrest cannot be included in the period of detention. The court also held that during the period of house arrest, Navlakha was never under the detention of police for investigation.After rejecting his bail plea, the court directed the Taloja prison authorities to hand over Navlakha’s custody to NIA from July 13 till July 22. The agency is directed to produce Navlakha before the special court on July 22. Meanwhile, the court also gave 90 more days to NIA to investigate the case and file a charge sheet against Navlakha and Teltumbde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-activist-gautam-navlakha-s-bail-plea-rejected-nia-to-get-10-day-custody/story-4USsdHE8lCycDQI5xzI2FM.html
13-07-2020||Admission||DU admissions: SRCC students roll out fellowship in finance to help aspirants||It wouldn’t be wrong to say that any talk in our lives begins now with a reference to the pandemic and the uncertainty of future that is dominating our minds. But, this hasn’t been able to impact the conscious efforts of the youth, who understand the relevance of being there for each other in such trying times. And the new Research Fellowship by Finance and Investment Cell (FIC) of Delhi University’s Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC) is an exemplary effort to bridge the gap between the process of learning and the seeker of knowledge. “Although the pandemic has posed major uncertainties, it also has also provided us with ample time to learn and grow. In times of such distress, students all over the country are looking up to their seniors for guidance and support. So we have come up with a fellowship that is a peer-to-peer model, which aims to create a holistic and intuitive learning environment, by giving students an opportunity to explore ideas beyond the horizon of school textbooks’’ says Rishabh Khetawat, secretary of the cell at SRCC.The fellowship program is for students who aspire to make a career in finance, in the years to come, by acting as a catalyst to develop their interest in the subject. This will be achieved through workshops and sessions with industry experts. Prakhar Tandon, a student of Ryan International School, Noida, who has enroled himself in this program, feels “This course will be the first step towards the world of finance and investment, for me. The selection process itself equipped me with clarity in my opinions. I hope to learn something extraordinary that our education system has failed to impart.”Devashish Miglani, president of the program, explains, “The mentors shall teach important concepts of finance and connect them to their practical application with examples. Lectures with industry experts for important topics such as technical analysis and bond valuation will also be conducted as part of the curriculum. The program will encompass interactive activities and competitions to break the boundaries of today’s classroom based education.” Explaining how the program will help the participants, Sai Lakshmi, research head, says, “Literate, yet uneducated, is not something the nation expects of its citizens. Our vision is to create an impact on student lives when they are young so that in every purchase they make, they understand the difference between ‘expense’ and ‘investment’ and in every endeavour they undertake, they know that the benefits of the ‘asset’ they create will be reaped by future generations! This initiative of FIC is a small step, which will hopefully yield some great dividends.”Besides gaining a chance to learn new concepts and grow, the participating students are happy that this platform will provide them a chance to spend time with their seniors. “It’s an amazing opportunity to go beyond the school curriculum and develop necessary skills to navigate an increasingly competitive world and strengthen my comprehensive ability pertaining to finance. But what’s more exciting is to be able to interact with the seniors at DU before I actually begin my college life there,” says Viraj Lohia, a student of Welham Boys’ School, Dehradun, who hopes to make it to DU for higher education.

13-07-2020||Mumbai||Education department set to train 40,000 teachers for online learning||As schools across the state have started their new academic year from June 15, the state education department has decided to train teachers in using various teaching tools for online learning. In a recent circular, the department announced that the Maharashtra State Council of Educational Research and Training (MSCERT) would train about 40,000 teachers of government and aided schools across the state in the first phase of training. “In the first phase, priority will be given to teachers from aided schools and junior colleges. The training will later be extended to teachers from private unaided schools,” reads the circular. Teachers who wish to enrol for the training in the first phase have to send their details to the department by July 16. The department has also planned to set up Google classrooms for every school free of cost. Officials at the education department said that training all the teachers and setting up online classrooms would bring in some consistency. Currently, schools in the state are using the means available to them for online teaching. “This is a new challenge for all of us, but we are prepared to overcome issues and ensure continuous learning for all students,” said an official. Teachers said that while the training is a welcome move, some steps also need to be taken to ensure good internet connectivity to students as well as teachers. “Currently, students and teachers are both struggling to get good connectivity. Not all students can afford internet. Some provision needs to be in place for those who cannot,” said the teacher from a civic school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/education-department-set-to-train-40-000-teachers-for-online-learning/story-OWEJZNdU5UojxexzvVaJrM.html

He had moved a plea for interim bail on May 15 amid the spread of Covid-19 in Mumbai jails. While the plea was still pending, Rao’s health condition deteriorated. On May 28, Rao was taken to JJ hospital after he fell unconscious in jail and was discharged after two days.In a conference organised through a digital platform on Sunday, Rao’s family –wife P Hemalatha and daughters P Sahaja, P Anala, P Pavana – alleged he was discharged in haste even when he had not recovered fully, a day before his plea for interim bail was scheduled for hearing. “It was done only to facilitate the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to oppose his bail plea before the special NIA court,” the family alleged. The plea was rejected on June 26, after which Rao has approached the high court for relief. The family claimed that Rao was hallucinating, primarily because of imbalance of electrolytes in his body.The family claimed they received a call from Rao from jail on Saturday evening, wherein Rao spoke about his father’s funeral. In the conference family clarified that Rao’s father had passed away when he was three. They claimed this indicated Rao was hallucinating. The family alleged that since his discharge from hospital, they have spoken to him four times and he has since been in a state of confusion. Rao’s daughters claimed the telephonic conversation in June was better, but this month’s two calls have been worrisome.The family claimed he needs immediate medical attention. “He did not answer direct questions on his health and went into a kind of delirious and hallucinated talk about the funeral of his father and mother, the events that happened seven decades and four decades ago, respectively. Then his co-accused companion took the phone from him and informed us that he is not able to walk, go to toilet and brush his teeth on his own. We were also told that he is always hallucinating that we, family members, were waiting at the jail gate to receive him as he was getting released,” the family claimed.The family said they will approach the Bombay high court for urgent relief to shift him to a multispecialty hospital. “His life is the topmost concern for us right now. Our present demand is to save his life...” they said.Following the plea, five prominent intellectuals – Romila Thapar, Prabhat Patnaik, Devaki Jain, Maja Daruwala and Satish Deshpande – have appealed to Government of Maharashtra and NIA to transfer Rao to JJ Hospital. Previously, in 2018, the same group had also approached the Supreme Court against the arrest of all activists in connection with the Elgar Parishad case. The statement read: “Rao poses no flight risk and has voluntarily submitted to all investigations for the past 22 months. There is no reason in law or conscience to hold him in circumstances that increase risk to his fragile health....To knowingly risk the life of a person in state custody by refusing proper medical treatment would amount to a form of encounter, an extra-legal punishment which the State institutions are duty-bound to forego.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/elgar-parishad-p-varavara-rao-hallucinating-we-are-waiting-for-him-outside-jail-claims-family-of-telugu-poet/story-os07kXNTzk2L4oTerTFfKM.html
13-07-2020||Mumbai||Students struggle to fund education: Survey||A large number of students in colleges and universities are finding it difficult to fund their education owing to the lockdown imposed to curb the Covid-19 pandemic, found a survey conducted by a professor from the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B).Almost 82% of the 38,108 students surveyed said they were anticipating difficulty in funding their education while 27% respondents said their chances of continuing education in the academic year 2020-21 were either low or very low. BN Jagtap, a professor from the department of Physics, IIT-B, and Anand Mapuskar, an educationist who has earlier served in the department of higher and technical education of Maharashtra, conducted the survey of 38,108 students from colleges and universities across Maharashtra to understand their perception of the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on higher education. Of the respondents, 73% said they would have to support their families financially. “This is expressed by 75% of male students and 70% of female students. The urban-rural divide is evident in the responses,” said Mapuskar. A higher number of students from rural areas expressed the need to help their family financially. For instance, 79% students from rural areas said they had to support their families as compared to 71% from metro cities.Taking students’ hardship in account, the University Grants Commission (UGC) — the apex body that regulates all higher education institutes — had issued a circular on May 27 asking all institutes to be sympathetic towards students while asking them to pay tuition fees. Soon after, the University of Mumbai (MU) had, in June, asked all colleges not to hike fees for the new academic year and to allow students to pay fees in instalments.Vinod Patil, officiating registrar of MU, said the decision was taken in accordance to UGC guidelines keeping in mind that families of students may have lost income due to lockdown.Of the total 38,108 respondents, 19,495 were female, 18,602 were male and four were transgender students. The survey was aimed at understanding the perception of students on four issues — economic hardship on students, online education, reopening of colleges and new academic year, and students’ perception of their degree courses.The survey found that 91% students have smartphones, 32% have laptop/desktop and 6% students reported to have no device at all. The survey also found that a majority of the students interviewed were accessing their academic activities online. In Maharashtra, 66% students were studying at least one online course during the lockdown. However, the urban-rural divide was prominent in this case as well. In metro cities, district headquarters and taluka headquarters almost 67%-70% were taking online classes as opposed to only 62% in rural areas. However, very few feel that online classes are useful. Around only 33% felt that the online course was useful while 26% were of the opinion that online courses cannot replace face-to-face teaching. The surveyors, therefore, suggested a hybrid model involving a correct mix of online and face-to-face education so that educational institutes can function with social distancing norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/students-struggle-to-fund-education-survey/story-EfX3ZPWigJNyUWT7T3CAUI.html

13-07-2020||City||After 2 different reports, woman tests negative in third test||The 44-year-old woman from Wagle Estate in Thane, who got contradictory Covid-19 reports from a civic-run laboratory and private laboratory, tested negative in her third test, validating the report of the private lab. The family has moved the woman home from the quarantine centre. The family claimed they had to go through a lot after the report from the civic laboratory showed her to be positive for Covid-19 when, in fact, she was not infected.The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), however, claimed it is common to get different results on different days depending on the viral load.Earlier this week, Rekha Pawar was tested at Chhatrapati Shivaji Hospital, popularly known as Kalwa hospital. The following day, she got another Covid-19 test done at a private laboratory. Her son Nilesh, 25, on Sunday said, “This morning we were told that my mother’s report is negative. She was in a quarantine centre for two days. We went through a lot since her report from the civic laboratory came positive. We are happy that she is not infected. However, there should be some inquiry into this as no one else should face the same thing.”Ganesh Deshmukh, additional municipal commissioner of TMC, said, “It is normal to get different results when the test is done on two different days. The result changes the next day as per the viral load.”He added that every person with Covid-like symptom is treated as a Covid case irrespective of results. “Even though the woman tested negative later on, she had symptoms and so was treated as a Covid case. It is a protocol we follow at present.”A month after the civic-run Kalwa hospital mixed up the report of a 34-year-old woman who was nine-month pregnant, she was reunited with her one-month-old baby. The woman, who was not infected at the time, was admitted to a Covid ward after the civic hospital mixed up her report with someone else. She, however, tested positive later and gave birth to a baby girl. The baby had tested negative and could not be kept with her mother.A family member of the woman said, “Samiksha Markande, a Thane resident, took up the responsibility of the baby who is now healthy. Her mother has now tested negative and is allowed to take the baby home after a month.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-2-different-reports-woman-tests-negative-in-third-test/story-MtwTgeGpN5nqmZH5IZc3fO.html
13-07-2020||Mumbai||Cops in 31-40 age group worst-hit: Report||An internal assessment report prepared by the Mumbai Police to understand the spread of Covid-19 among its personnel till July 1 has found that personnel ages between 31 and 40 years were affected the most. Of the total cases, 930 personnel fall under this age group, says the report, a copy of which is with HT.“Policemen above 50 years of age and those with comorbidities have been advised to stay home. Hence, the young lot of policemen are performing lockdown duties in containment zones and are comparatively more exposed to the disease. This has led to this age group reporting the maximum number of cases,” said Naval Bajaj, joint commissioner of police (administration).Since March till July 1, 2,821 Mumbai Police personnel tested positive and 42 of them died. Fatality rate, however, was the highest at 82% among those aged above 50 years.Mumbai Police, which mapped the 42 deaths, found that in 21 cases office locations of the deceased were near containment zones while in 19 cases the residences of the personnel were in containment zones. According to the report, 37% of the infected personnel did not have any prior medical history. Among the ones with medical history, high blood pressure and diabetes were the most common ailments. However, the actual number of people with prior medical records could be higher since the police do not medical history of many of the patients.A senior IPS officer said, “The department took all possible measures to protect the lives of its personnel, but was helpless in cases of infected policemen aged above 55 years or those with serious medical history. Reports of them losing the battle are coming quite regularly now.” Mumbai Police, in its assessment, also found that local arms division was the most-affected unit with 785 men testing positive, while the west, south and central regions of the force accounted for 372, 341 and 323 personnel, respectively. Of the total positive cases, 28% is in local arms division followed by 13% in west region, 12% in south and 11% in central region. Local arms division is the reserve police force of the city police. An IPS officer said that local police stations were manning containment areas during initial months and got exhausted due to continuous duty; hence in mid-May and June they were replaced by personnel from the Local Arms division.“Most personnel of local arms division contracted the virus in their own locality or while commuting in and out of the city. Most of them stay in slum pockets and travel from Badlapur, Kalyan, Dombivli and Navi Mumbai to Mumbai,” Bajaj said.LT Marg police station recorded the highest number of cases at 57, among all 94 police stations in the city.Fatality rate in the Mumbai Police force is 1.34% while that of the city is 5.83%, said Bajaj, who is also designated as a nodal officer for Covid management for Mumbai Police by the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cops-in-31-40-age-group-worst-hit-report/story-UxULLuuCGZ1La4VK7d3ivL.html
13-07-2020||Mumbai||Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek doing well: Nanavati Hospital||A day after actor Amitabh Bachchan, 77, and his actor-son Abhishek, 44, got admitted to Nanavati Hospital, after testing positive for Covid-19, two more members of the family – his daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, 46, and eight-year-old granddaughter Aaradhya – tested positive on Sunday. Four bungalows of the Bachchan family in Juhu-Vile Parle area have been sealed and declared containment zones.After Bachchan and Abhishek showed mild symptoms, all members of the Bachchan family were tested using rapid antigen kits on Saturday. Bachchan’s wife Jaya, 72, daughter Shweta Nanda, 46, Aishwarya and Aaradhya tested negative. Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar, too, confirmed it. However, according to the protocol, they were then tested using the RT-PCR method, in which Aishwarya and Aaradhya tested positive, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials said. Jaya Bachchan will be tested again later to overrule any negative reporting.Later in the evening, Abhishek tweeted: “Aishwarya and Aaradhya have also tested Covid-19 positive. They will be self-quarantining at home. BMC has been updated of their situation and are doing the needful. The rest of the family including my mother have tested negative. Thank you all for your wishes and prayers.” He also wrote: “My father and I remain in hospital till the doctors decide otherwise. Everyone please remain cautious and safe. Please follow all rules!”Vishwas Mote, assistant municipal commissioner, K-West ward of BMC, said, “The four bungalows – Jalsa, Janak, Pratiksha and Vatsa – have been sanitised and declared containment zones. We are conducting contact-tracing of all staff members.”BMC in a statement issued on Sunday afternoon said, “Thirty staff members working for the Bachchan family have been tested for Covid-19. In Jalsa bungalow, there is space for isolation and the staff members will be kept there. If any assistance/facility of the BMC is required, we will take necessary steps for the same.”Dr Abdul Samad Ansari, director of the critical care unit of Nanavati Hospital and treating doctor of Bachchan and Abhishek, said, “Both of them are doing well. We have given them symptomatic medicines.”Dr Pratit Samdani, internal medicine expert from Breach Candy Hospital, said considering Bachchan’s age, doctors have to be more cautious while treating him. “Data all across the globe have shown that patients above the age of 65 with co-morbidities develop complications after 10 days of getting exposed to the virus. They develop a cytokine storm when inflammation begins in organs, especially in lungs. This puts Mr Amitabh Bachchan at a higher risk than his son who is younger,” said Samdani.Bachchan was also diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2000, which weakens the lungs. Dr Samdani said, “It won’t be a problem as it happened two decades ago. His age will be an issue. Almost 15% of people above the age of 65 develop complications and need ventilator support,” he said.Meanwhile, BMC also sealed the Governor’s office and staff quarters at Raj Bhavan, after 16 staff members were found to be Covid-19 positive. The tests of 100 staff employed at Raj Bhavan were done on Saturday at the state-run Sir JJ Hospital. “Sixteen staff members of Governor House have tested positive until now. Of the 16, two had tested positive around eight days ago. After this, tests of around 100 staff members was undertaken by the Governor’s office on Saturday. Of the 100, 14 have tested positive, while reports of some samples are pending,’’ he said. Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, in a statement, said: “I am perfectly alright, and not in self-isolation. I underwent relevant tests, the result of which came in the negative. There are no symptoms of Covid-19 either. However, considering the Covid-19 situation elsewhere, I am discharging all my official duties strictly adhering to protocols like social distancing, sanitising, wearing of masks, etc.”Meanwhile, actor Anupam Kher tweeted saying: “This is to inform all that my mother Dulari is found Covid + (mildly). We have admitted her to Kokilaben Hospital. My brother, bhabhi & niece inspite of being careful have also tested mildly positive. I got myself tested as well & I have tested negative. BMC is informed.”Like reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), rapid antigen test detects the presence of molecular pathogens of coronavirus in people. But unlike RT-PCR which takes eight hours for results, the latter gives reports within 30 minutes. The antigen-based test uses nasal swab samples for testing. According to protocol, every positive report from the rapid antigen testing is treated as ‘true positive’, while negative samples are mandatorily re-tested by RT-PCR process, in case of symptoms. So, when the test reports of Aishwarya and Aaradhya came negative in rapid antigen tests at the hospital on Saturday, their samples were taken for RT-PCR test. On Sunday, their RT-PCR results came positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/amitabh-bachchan-abhishek-doing-well-nanavati-hospital/story-Q0EOk9Q2TllaNLvvYD5qSM.html
13-07-2020||Mumbai||Maha records 7,827 new Covid cases, 173 deaths; tally 254,427||Maharashtra on Sunday recorded 7,827 fresh Covid-19 cases, its third highest single-day spike, taking its tally to 254,427. Active cases in the state now stand at 103,615, while the recovery rate touched 55.15%, after 3,340 more patients recovered in the past 24 hours, pushing the tally of recovered patients to 140,325.The state also recorded 173 new fatalities, pushing the toll to 10,289. Mumbai recorded 1,243 new cases and 44 fatalities, which took its tally to 92,988 and toll to 5,288. Active cases in Mumbai stand at 22,540. After crossing the 1-lakh case mark on June 12, the state reported 153,286 cases at a daily average of 5,110 cases. In 30 days, state saw 6,572 fatalities at a daily average of 219 cases. Though the case fatality rate (CFR) has reduced during the period, the daily death rate has increased. There has been addition of 53,900 active cases in the past 30 days. Pune city continued to record the second-highest number of cases after Mumbai and reported 990 infections in the past 24 hours, taking its tally to 29,048. Pune district, including also the urban part of Pimpri-Chinchwad, recorded 1,749 cases in 24 hours, taking the tally to 39,145. Kalyan-Dombivli retained its second position in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), in terms of new infections and reported 779 cases as its tally rose to 14, 611. The MMR, which comprises nine civic bodies and semi-urban parts of Thane, Raigad and Palghar, reported 4,475 cases on Sunday (57.18 % of the state’s daily infections), taking the tally to 173,060. Thane city recorded 465 new cases, followed by 321 new cases in Navi Mumbai. Of the 173 fatalities , 44 were in Mumbai, 22 each in Pune city and Thane city, 10 each in Pimpri Chinchwad and Navi Mumbai. State’s CFR stands at 4.04%, much below 4.8% reported on June 16, after the state government added 1,328 deaths on a single day as part of the reconciliation of data. State’s CFR was 3.25% on May 25 and 3.37% on May 31. The national CFR is 2.67%.Aurangabad, Jalgaon, Nashik and Solapur continue to report high number of cases with addition of 222, 209, 182 and 277 cases. The rising number of cases in MMR has forced civic bodies to extend the stricter lockdown by a few more days. Bhiwandi-Nizampur civic body extended its ongoing lockdown by a week till July 19, after a similar order was issued in neighbouring Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli and Mira-Bhayander.The districts with a high number of cases, too, have extended their lockdown with stricter norms. The state government has asked civic bodies and district administrations to concentrate on reducing the number of cases and the CFR.“As seen across the globe, the peak of cases shifts from metropolis to smaller cities and then to towns and rural parts. After Mumbai’s infection stabilised, neighbouring cities and even Pune and Pimpri-Chichwad are witnessing the peak. We expect the spread to stabilise in next few weeks,” said an official from the state government. The government has set the target of bringing the infectivity (positivity) rate below 10% from current rate of 19.3% and the CFR below 1%, by going for aggressive tracking, tracing and treatment of suspected cases.“The rise in smaller cities and a few districts is constant because they do not have the required infrastructure and manpower has been exhausted. Civic bodies like Mira-Bhayander, Ulhasnagar, Bhiwandi or the districts in which the number is high have no health infrastructure in back-up. The spread of the virus is from big cities to smaller ones, because of the migration of the people after the lifting of lockdown. But it remains to be seen if these cities could contain it like Mumbai did,” said Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, public health consultant. State has 886,150 under home quarantine, while 47,801 are under institutional quarantine.Meanwhile, the state government has constituted a four-member committee to recommend the utilisation of rapid antibody test kits. “The committee headed by Dr Sudhakar Shinde, CEO, state health assurance society, will recommend the choice of test regimes and the kits suggested by the ICMR. It will also recommend whether to conduct the test on frontline workers from health services, police personnel, sanitisation workers or a particular class of people. The committee, which is expected to submit its report in ten days, will also draft the expression of interest for the test protocol and the kits,” the notification has stated.Meanwhile, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said that there will be laboratories in every district for RT-PCR tests in near future. After inaugurating a lab in Jalna, home district of state health minister Rajesh Tope, Thackeray said the temporary facilities being set up at the district level to treat the virus will be converted into permanent infrastructure. “With the help of the facilities, we will have to put in comprehensive and collective efforts to keep the mortality rate in check,” he said. Tope said that laboratories at district level help early detection of the viral infection, and in turn, it facilitates effective tracing and testing of the close contacts of patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-records-7-827-new-covid-cases-173-deaths-tally-254-427/story-oY8UiAiaZVBWuWatTcNuGJ.html
13-07-2020||Mumbai||IATA urges Mumbai ATC to implement new surveillance broadcast system for better communication with aircraft||The International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents 290 airlines globally, has written to the Mumbai air traffic control (ATC) to implement the Space-based Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (SADS-B) system sooner for effective communication with flights over the country’s oceanic regions. This comes after the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has successfully run trials of the system for the last six months. SADS-B is a technology that not only allows an aircraft to automatically send its location updates via satellites to traffic controllers but also assesses and allows requests from pilots to deviate from their original flight route in case of bad weather (cyclone like conditions) over the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean.HT had earlier reported about the safety advantages of the system that has also received positive feedback from both the Mumbai and Chennai ATC. When fully implemented, India will be the only South Asian country to adopt it.IATA, in its letter, accessed by HT, has stated that SADS-B can be utilised to identify flights that deviate from their path, which will result in establishing effective communication with the aircraft.IATA has also welcomed efforts by Mumbai ATC in assigning dedicated frequencies (line of communication) for enroute weather-related deviations and associated communication difficulties in the oceanic region.On its part, AAI is yet to finalise a date for running SADS-B technology in a full-fledged manner. “Initially, it was decided to run the technology on trial for a year. But since we have been getting extraordinary results, it’s been decided to commence the use of the technology soon. We are, however, yet to decide on a date,” said a Delhi-based AAI official.SADS-B is manufactured by Aireon, which is certified as an air navigation service provider for an automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast system by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). EASA is responsible for civil aviation safety. Aireon has been providing its service to NAV Canada (the country’s civil air navigation), Seychelles, and the United Kingdom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iata-urges-mumbai-atc-to-implement-new-surveillance-broadcast-system-for-better-communication-with-aircraft/story-2f21GlfhcGOZUzBhcaPtYL.html

District collector Rajesh Narvekar has permitted only warehouses which are providing essential services to remain operational.Narvekar held a meeting with Bhiwandi godown owners on Saturday. In view of the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in Bhiwandi, the collector said, “We have asked godowns to remain open only for essential services. The owners have to ensure that social distancing is maintained.”“Temperature and blood-oxygen level of all employees need to be tested through the day. Sanitisers should be kept in the godown and wearing masks must be made mandatory at work,” he said.“Around five lakh labourers working in these godowns travel from different areas of Bhiwandi, Kalyan, Shahapur, Thane and Mumbai; some come from rural areas as well. Hence, the chances of them contracting the virus are higher,” said Hiralal Chedda, a godown owner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/warehouses-must-adhere-to-guidelines-in-bhiwandi-thane-collector/story-EjRNSzp0ZweB1wi4S7fvnL.html

13-07-2020||Chandigarh||Activists oppose Mattewara industrial park, minister sees no ecological harm||Environmental and political activists have opposed the move to set up an industrial park on 1,000-acre land near Mattewara in Ludhiana, terming it as a threat to the forest area and the Sutlej river.Also, an online campaign titled “Save Mattewara forest and Save Punjab” has been started on Facebook and Twitter.Padma Shri awardee environmentalist Balbir Singh Seechewal said the Punjab government needs to review its decision to set up the industrial park which would be a direct threat to humans as well as wildlife.Parwinder Singh Kitna, an RTI activist, said the government the on the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak last year announced to plant 550 saplings in the every Punjab village, but failed to do the needful.“I will approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to oppose the move and protest against the government to save the forest at any cost,” he added.Hakam Singh, a lawyer, said he will file a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Punjab and Haryana High Court against the move.Besides, Bhai Ganahiya Cancer Roko Society led by Gurpreet Singh Chandbaja and AAP MLA from Kotkapura, Kultar Singh Sandhwan, have written an open letter to chief minister Amarinder Singh to reconsider the decision.On the other hand, state industries minister Sunder Sham Arora assured that the park won’t harm the ecological balance in the area. “We are planning to bring only green industries to the park. We are developing four such parks across the state to attract the industries for employment generation for the Punjab youth,” he said.In 2014, the then Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party government had mooted to develop the Mattewara forest as a nature reserve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/activists-oppose-mattewara-industrial-park-minister-sees-no-ecological-harm/story-oc8tN1ZG0YwbtUdU2Vf8NI.html

13-07-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab water regulatory body to oversee installation of new tubewells||To check further depletion of groundwater in the state, the newly constituted Punjab Water Regulation and Development Authority (PWRDA) has been mandated to oversee the installation of new tubewells. The body has the powers to restrict and impose conditions on digging of new tubewells besides making their registration mandatory. The Punjab Water Resources (Management and Regulation) Act, 2020, enacted by the state assembly in February this year, also empowers the PWRDA to shut down tubewells used for industrial purposes. Section 15 of the Punjab Water Resources Act says, “The authority may issue directions regarding development, management, or use of groundwater which may include construction and installation of any new structure for its extraction through energised means.” Also, the Act provides the authority the powers to frame rules for allowing new structures to extract groundwater. Nearly 14.5 lakh agricultural tubewells are continuously pumping out subsoil water across the state, even as the rate of extraction is much higher than the recharge rate. The extent of use of the subsoil water could be judged from the fact that thee-fourth of Punjab’s area under agriculture is dependent on it while the central groundwater board says the rate of extraction in the state is 166%.Due to steep fall in subsoil water levels, a large number of tubewells that go dry every year have to be dug again to continue pumping out water for irrigation. “It is good that the state government has decided to check the tubewells dug for extraction of water for agricultural and industrial purposes. Ultimately, we have to do it. There is a tubewell for every three hectares (7.5 acres) in the state,” said Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) vice chancellor BS Dhillon.Punjab is one of the few states in the country to have constituted a water regulation authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-water-regulatory-body-to-oversee-installation-of-new-tubewells/story-0yeWlmX5eLOyuDlALpR3GL.html

13-07-2020||Chandigarh||Amarinder for more stringent curbs to check spread of virus||In view of the rise in the number of Covid-19 cases, the Punjab government is set to impose more stringent curbs, including restrictions on social, public and family gatherings, as well as mandatory wearing of masks.Announcing this during his #AskCaptain session on Facebook, chief minister (CM) Captain Amarinder Singh said strictness was necessary to check the spread of the virus as he did not want Punjab to go the way of Mumbai, Delhi or Tamil Nadu. Asked why the state government was not going for weekend lockdowns, he said Sunday lockdowns were already in place and the government was keeping a close watch on the situation and will do whatever necessary.He exhorted people to adhere to all curbs, and even appealed to political parties to avoid gatherings to save the lives of Punjabis. “It is our joint responsibility to save Punjab. Politics can wait,” he said.Expressing concern over the rising infections, with several frontline workers and even government officials testing positive, the CM said with vaccine still not in sight, it was left to the people to fight the virus. ON INCREASE IN INFECTIONSIn response to a question, Amarinder attributed the increase in Covid cases in Punjab to increased testing and the large number of people coming from outside. “From 700 tests a day initially, testing had gone up to more than 10,000 a day,” he said, adding that in just four days, as many as 63,000 people had entered from other states, including Delhi.To a question on why Punjab was not making Covid negative certificates compulsory for those coming from hotspots like Delhi, as had been done by Himachal Pradesh, the CM said he could not comment on the decision of the neighbouring state but his government was taking its own steps to prevent influx of potential Covid suspects.The CM called upon the people to get themselves checked at the slightest symptom or doubt and not take any chances, as early detection of Covid was essential to preventing deaths. Amarinder assured a Sangrur resident that he would ensure that the faulty CT scan machine in the district government hospital is checked and the problem is rectified.The CM told a UK-based Punjabi wanting to come home to see his mother that the rule on seven-day institutional quarantine, followed by seven days of home quarantine, was mandatory.ON CONTRACTUAL EMPLOYEES Asked about regularisation of contractual employees, Amarinder said the cabinet sub-committee set up to look into the matter would submit its report and a decision would be taken by his government soon.ON GHEE IMPORT FROM PUNE To a concern expressed by a Amritsar resident on the need for Shri Darbar Sahib to buy desi ghee from a private Pune-based company instead of Milkfed, the CM said he was not in favour of this as dairy was the second most important produce in Punjab and had to be supported. He hoped that the SGPC would reconsider its decision.ON HARYANA’S JOB QUOTA Punjab chief minister (CM) Captain Amarinder Singh on Sunday ruled out quota for the state’s youth in jobs, on the lines of Haryana, and said he did not think the neighbouring state’s decision would stand judicial scrutiny. Responding to a question during the #AskCaptain session on Facebook, he said the constitution and the law barred any such discrimination in the matter of jobs. He pointed out that Punjabis were employed all over the country, with no restrictions by any state. ON A LIGHTER NOTE Responding to NDA instructor Naib Sub Harbans Singh’s grandson’s submission that the former remembers him fondly and wants to meet him, the Amarinder said “If he can travel please bring him here. One can’t forget old friends and brothers in uniform.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amarinder-for-more-stringent-curbs-to-check-spread-of-virus/story-LY7Riv2SIq6JnjD0h6IXZP.html

13-07-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai records 49,496 cases in 40 days of relaxations||Forty days of relaxation of curbs, which began on June 3, gave Mumbai 49,496 new cases and 3,871 deaths – 53.2% of the total cases in the city.The Maharashtra health department data shows that on June 3, Mumbai had 43,492 cases and 1,417 deaths, which went up to 92,988 cases and 5,288 deaths, on July 12. In the same period, the fatality rate increased to 5.68% from 3.25%. One of the reasons is the addition of 1,500 deaths by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) after reconciliation of figures. In this period, the recovery rate of the city, too, went up to 69%, from 40%.On Sunday, Mumbai recorded 1,243 fresh cases and 44 deaths. The number of discharged patients stood at 64,872 and active cases at 22,540. The city’s doubling rate is 50 days.Cabinet minister and Worli MLA from Shiv Sena Aaditya Thackeray on Sunday tweeted: “Mumbai at a doubling day rate of 50. That’s going to remain there only with the efforts of citizens, precautions we take for ourselves and others.”In Mumbai, 3.91 lakh tests have been conducted until Sunday, according to BMC data.Experts and officials indicated the authorities will continue to impose restrictions and give relaxations gradually in the coming days.Mumbai mayor and Shiv Sena corporator Kishori Pednekar said, “The numbers are increasing and we are getting new cases also from high-rises. It may be because of the relaxations, but we cannot afford to have Mumbai under lockdown forever. We have to relax lockdown norms and also be cautious at the same time. Also, citizens need to understand that they should not venture out if they have no valid reason.”Dr Shashank Joshi, expert member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force, said the scenario would depend on how the relaxations are implemented. “The absolute numbers have flattened in Mumbai, growth rate has gone down and doubling rate has gone up to 50 days. In Mumbai, the situation looks pretty good, but to be cautious, we should keep in place lockdown measures such as asking citizens not to travel long distance unnecessarily. Another two weeks, and the situation in the city will be much better.”Joshi said, “Our concern right now is towns in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) where cases are rising. We have to aggressively conduct testing and tracing in MMR…We will again start unlocking in future, but we have to be mindful, slow and gradual. We also have to maintain high hygiene. We have to keep locking and unlocking.”BMC has opted for aggressive testing in Mumbai and from July 7 allowed anyone to get tested without a prescription. BMC had also asked ward officers in the western suburbs to use antigen kits and conduct at least 250 tests using it daily. Owing to this, BMC had anticipated a little spike in the number of cases, however, the picture will be clear by month-end, said experts.Meanwhile, Dharavi,one hot spot that has shown signs of drastic improvement recorded only five cases on Sunday, bringing the area’s total case count to 2,375 of which 2,016 have been discharged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-49-496-cases-in-40-days-of-relaxations/story-wo41laFhtLcKsQTHq2qBII.html

13-07-2020||Lifestyle||Oops, we did it! Say denizens as #WFH life comes with a pinch of laughter||Who knew that the #WorkFromHome (WFH) life will come packed with its own dose of laughter from time to time. While balancing work from home and work for home, hilarious incidents (read accidents) have been reported by denizens on social media. In one of the funniest #WFH accidents, Gurugram-based Sunita Upreti accidentally created a master chef delicacy that she named Charcoal Paratha. Upreti recalls, “One morning while I was making paneer paratha for my daughter, she called me to fix some laptop problem as she was unable to attend her online class. I got so engrossed in it that while juggling to help her out and answering an official phone call, I forgot about the paratha I had put on the burner. I returned to the kitchen to see a perfectly and evenly burnt Charcoal Paneer Paratha! Managing affairs of the home, a kid and work has never been easy, however, these small and sweet #WFH incidents bring fun, laughter and memories to cherish.” Imagine being 10 minutes into a video meeting call, only to be called out by your boss for wearing a half pressed half crinkled shirt! This is exactly what happened with Gurugram resident Niranjan Sankar, who had to attend an emergency video conferencing call and didn’t get the time to iron his shirt as he was busy washing utensils. “Our RWAs have allowed house helps to come in, however, my house help had left for his village, so the entire load of doing the dishes and mopping the floor is on us. As I live alone in the city, I cannot seek help from anybody in these socially distant times so have to manage work calls along with the household chores,” laughs Sankar. Recounting his first-hand experience at WFH mishap, Sankar adds, “I was half way into the video call and my boss suddenly said that ‘One sleeve and part collar of your shirt is extremely crinkled and shrunken while the other is flawlessly ironed’. The entire team pinned my video screen on to their desktop and started giggling. I quickly apologised and tried to stammer my way out of this by trying my best to divert the topic!”A common problem most of us have faced in our #WFH life is of being inducted in numerous work related WhatsApp groups. Ruchi Shrivastav, a Noida resident, faced a precarious situation when recently she ended up sending a message to an incorrect WhatsApp group. “Before the pandemic, I used to head to the vegetable shop in my society to buy vegetables. Our RWA has now prohibited that we move about unnecessarily in public places as a Covid-19 positive case has come up in our society. Residents have now been instructed to WhatsApp their list of essentials to the vegetable vendor at the condominium. I usually engage in a friendly bargaining with the vendor whenever I place a WhatsApp order. Since I have been working from home, I’m part of innumerable office WhatsApp groups. Accidentally, I sent a text on my office group saying ‘Bhaiya dhaniya kitne bhav di? Aajkal aap zyaada mehenga dene lage ho. Is gareeb pe bhi daya karlo. Office walo ne toh zindagi kharab kari huyi hai.” Shrivastav adds, “Someone replied ‘Hum office wale itne bhi bure nahi hai yaar’. And that’s when I realised the mistake I had made... I sent dhaniya, aaloo list on my office group! I then quickly deleted the message and tried to pretent that it was a funny forward. But, I know that my cover was blown.”Work from home life is replete with phone calls and meetings to discuss updates on various projects. However, what denizens are unable to plug out is the background noise of their family members amid phone calls. Rishab Kumar, a Delhiite, sharing one such recent incident, says, “I have to be on work related phone calls and somehow that is the time my wife finds fit to excessively physically gesture and ask what will I have to eat at lunch. Even when I wave her away, she starts trying to clean the room. When I look at her with a blank expression because of all the noise in the background, she usually responds with a loud ‘Kya hua? Maine kya kiya!’ Life is all about taking things easy. Working from home can be tough and things will always go out of control. However, we must learn to roll with things. After I get over with my official phone calls, I spend the day with my family, playing games and laughing loudly while watching movies. #WFH isn’t all that bad.” Interact with the author @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/oops-we-did-it-say-denizens-as-wfh-life-comes-with-a-pinch-of-laughter/story-Te45z1W3LO9WMXt2lwOHfO.html
13-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi to use digital maps to spot areas with isolated Covid-19 cases||The Delhi government has engaged geospatial mapping tools to locate areas that recorded isolated Covid-19 cases, a senior government official said on Sunday.Geospatial mapping involves creating maps of an area and plotting required data- in this case isolated cases. This will provide information to the administration to understand spatial patterns and relationships.The Delhi government has engaged its company Geospatial Delhi Limited (GSDL) for the purpose. Similar mapping exercises had earlier helped the district officials in identifying Covid clusters and zonal allocation of home isolation cases, said the senior Delhi government official.“Effective steps are being taken to identify localities which recorded isolated Covid cases, in adherence to guidelines issued by the government. Use of technology will ensure more accuracy in this regard,” said Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Dev.Once the locations concerning isolated Covid-19 cases are identified, the district officials – under a government order issued last week – will create a databases of high-risk individuals and special surveillance groups in those areas. “These are areas in which cluster cases were never recorded and was not sealed as containment zones. Now, since the Covid-19 situation is slightly under control, the surveillance strategy can be expanded to cover such areas that record isolated cases,” said a senior official in the Delhi health department.While high-risk individuals include residents aged over 60 years, pregnant women, people with influenza-like symptoms and those with comorbidities. Special surveillance groups would cover domestic workers, self employed individuals such as plumbers, electricians, mechanics, etc, those engaged in sale and supply of essential commodities and taxi, rickshaw and autorickshaw drivers operating in the area, said the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the government in this regard.“Once the locations are ascertained, we shall be taking help of resident welfare groups, autorickshaw and taxi driver unions, etc to reach out to individuals who may come under special surveillance group in each such identified locality,” said a district magistrate who did not wish to be identified.Both high-risk individuals and those under the special surveillance groups would be screened and enlisted for rapid antigen tests in the nearest centre, the official added.Delhi government spokespersons did not comment on the developmentJugal Kishore, head of community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital, said: “It is important to locate areas that recorded isolated covid cases for better surveillance and the use of technology in this regard is a welcome move. The focus of the government should now be to trace maximum cases and engage focussed surveillance methods.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/geospatial-mapping-to-locate-analyse-isolated-cases/story-vuPm4za6v2BLC8OxXGcY0K.html
13-07-2020||Delhi||Most patients at home, AIIMS docs to generate e-prescriptions||The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi has developed a real-time telemedicine dashboard for the out patient departments (OPDs). With this, patients can access the teleconsultation facility and doctors can access test reports, conduct online classes and exams and generate e-prescription for patients.OPD services resumed in the hospital last week after a break of almost three months due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.“We have an in-house team of computer programmers that worked tirelessly to develop this dashboard to suit the needs of tele-consultaion services that AIIMS is providing to its patients. The online registration system at the hospital is also integrated with this dashboard so all doctors can see their complete list of appointments for the day,” said Dr A Shariff, professor anatomy, chairman, telemedicine facility, AIIMS.Through the new online registration system, a patient gets a username and password and a link to the video consult on the dashboard. For those patients who do not have an advanced phone, the audio consultation facility is also available on this dashboard. There will be no online walk-in consultations unless the doctors specifically asks for it, and only those patients with a prior appointment will be added to the list.“The patients can use the username and password to log in. The doctor then becomes the host for the tele-consultation. Doctors can use either a mobile phone or a desk to access the dashboard,” he added.Prescriptions generated on the dashbboard will be converted into a text message and sent to the patient’s phone. The team tested the dashboard initially with OPDs of three departments— geriatrics, orthopaedics, and paediatric surgery, before expanding it to eight more departments on last Monday.OPDs of about 11 departments are currently using the dashboard, and in next 10 days all the 45 departments will be moved to this tele-consultation module. AIIMS has nearly 45 departments, and runs scores of multi-speciality clinics on a daily basis.The dashboard is currently being evaluated for user feedback. From each department there is a doctor who will be a nodal member to put forward suggestions for improvement.“It is currently being tested for any glitches; every feedback received is being carefully studies and efforts are being made to rectify the problem and modify the dashboard to make it easy to operate by all, including patients and staff,” said Vivek Gupta, associate professor, ophthalmology, and assisting faculty for managing the computer and telemedicine facilities.The faculty has also been using the software to conduct online undergraduate and post-graduate classes, and also conducting exams.“I have used the software and it is a very smooth platform. I have conducted exams also on this and there were absolutely no glitches. This can be easily expanded and our expert team is working to further improve it,” said professor Nikhil Tandon, endocrinology department, AIIMS. The team plans to eventually move all departments and operations related to AIIMS on this platform. “It will be an integrated system that will house every function related to AIIMS,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/most-patients-at-home-aiims-docs-to-generate-e-prescriptions/story-lLseD0FRC7GId8JC6C5uMK.html
13-07-2020||City||With Covid rules, Delhi ready to begin sports training for school students||School students in Delhi will be able to resume training in the stadiums and sports complexes run by Directorate of Education (DoE), following the Delhi government coming up with standard operating procedures for resumption of sports.The DoE’s sports branch operates three stadiums --- Chhatrasal, Thyagaraj and Bawana-- and 32 sports complexes, including the ones in East Vinod Nagar, Ludlow Castle, Najafgarh, Mundhela Kalan, among others. These sports facilities were shut since March in view of the nationwide lockdown to stem the spread of the coronavirus disease. Dharmender Singh, Deputy Director of Education (Sports), said the Bawana stadium will not be used for sports training immediately. “The Bawana stadium is currently under the District Magistrate concerned so we will not be able to resume sports activities there. But we are ready to start sports training at the other two stadiums and sports complexes. We have already issued the SoPs, we have also procured masks and equipment to sanitise the premises. Formally, the stadiums and sports complexes are open now, he said.These sports facilities are mostly used by school students and private academies, clubs and coaches. DoE officials said more than 5,000 sportspersons, majority of them students from both government and private schools, were enrolled for training in these stadiums and complexes till March. According to the SoPs, the sports activities will resume in three phases, with only 5-10 people being allowed initially. It will be followed by larger groups and then full training by teams and sports competitions. “The SOPs have been made to ensure that sportspersons can utilise the facilities without compromising the health of the users as well as the community at large,” the SoPs stated.Depending on the extent of physical contact during the training, sports have been divided into three categories. For instance, in sports where there is minimal contact such as archery, shooting, cycling and athletics, there should be a social distance of 1.5 to 2 metres between the players and the staff, as per the rules.For football, volleyball, hockey and basketball there can a limited physical contact, sharing of equipment and a maximum of three can train together. The pitch will also be divided in three to four parts for different groups. “The players will stick to their groups in order to avoid spread of infection, in case anyone is tested positive for Covid-19,” the SoPs state. For maximum contact sports such as boxing, judo, wrestling and karate, the SoPs advise use of punching bags, sacks and choke dummies instead. Sharing of personal equipment has also been prohibited. However, the equipment which are bound to be shared will be sanitised after every use.The facilities are now open between 6.30am to 9.30am and 4.30pm to 7.30pm for all students above 10 years and private academies and coaches. “All those visiting the centres will be screened. There shall be a proper sanitising equipment at the main entrance. A written confirmation shall be submitted before entering the premises by every sportsperson declaring their Covid-19 symptom-free condition,” the SoPs stated.On being asked about the rules on wearing face masks during training, Singh said, “It will not be possible for the sportsperson to wear masks while training. It will affect their training.However, it’s mandatory to wear face masks at all times when a person is not playing/training. That’s why we have issued strict norms on maintaining physical distance.”Several teachers said that the resumption of sports activities was required since students and sportspersons have lost precious training time due to lockdown. Ajay Veer Singh, a physical education and sports teacher at a government school in Jhandewalan, said, “It’s been over three months that our students have not had any sports training. We are really excited to welcome them back on the field. However, it will be challenging to adhere to all the rules and regulations amid the pandemic. We will also prepare diet charts to boost their immunity in view of the prevalent situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-covid-rules-delhi-ready-to-begin-sports-training-for-school-students/story-xVUTYwu6zK592n7nrK6cTI.html
13-07-2020||Delhi||Three months later, five areas in Delhi still under containment||GTB Enclave’s Block E was among the first 23 containment zones announced by the Delhi government in April to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the city. But more than three months later, the northeast Delhi locality continues to be sealed off, and subject to stringent checks.Like GTB Enclave, there are four other areas — blocks K and G in Jahangirpuri, Majlis Park in Adarsh Nagar and Hauz Rani, which have remained containment zones for more than three months.While Savitri Enclave in Malviya Nagar figures in the Delhi government’s containment zone list, the south district administration said it has been de-sealed. Nearly 58 localities were declared containment zones in May. As on Sunday, Delhi had 652 containment zones. With new cases continuing to spring up in some of these areas, residents are beset by uncertainty, frustration and a longing for a return to a semblance of normalcy.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage District officials said there were still some major reasons because of which these zones have remained sealed for months. According to a district official, these include the presence of several medical professionals living in some zones, the 28-day rule for de-sealing a containment zone, and continuous movement of people within the zone despite strict curbs. District administration officials said they have raised the matter with the Delhi government. As per the Centre’s orders, a containment zone can be de-sealed 28 days after the last Covid-19 case has recovered or tested negative. Senior Delhi government officials said they are considering writing to the Centre, asking for this policy to be re-examined.A Delhi government spokesperson said, “We are adhering to the Central government’s guidelines for containment zones. We can’t modify it.”Divisional commissioner with the Delhi government Sanjeev Khirwar said, “We are thinking about writing to the Government of India to relook at the policy for de-sealing a containment zone with regard to length of the containment period. Our main aim is to control the spread of the infection. The decision to de-seal an area has to be taken as per the protocol set by the Union health ministry. Meanwhile, we have redrawn the boundaries of several containment zones to break them into smaller areas for better surveillance.”Also read: Scant space for social distance in Delhi’s congested walled cityIn a containment zone for 77 days, Naveen Jain (55), a stock market investor who lives in lane 3 in Majlis Park said he and other residents have approached district authorities to limit containment to houses where positive cases are kept in home quarantine.“One person was recently placed in home quarantine, because of which the entire lane continues to be a containment zone. The person has recovered 10 days back. We have been in containment for 77 days and district authorities say we will have to wait for another 18-20 days. What if another case is reported during this period? How long will we have to stay the containment zone? The government must revise its guidelines,” Jain said.These areas continue to be containment zones, though some are much smaller now, even after the Delhi government in June redrew the boundaries of containment zones, breaking them into smaller clusters for better surveillance and control of the outbreak. The number of containment zones in the city jumped from 280 to 421 on June 28 after the boundaries were reworked. In June, the Centre and the Delhi government had agreed to deploy a revamped strategy to fight Covid-19 and decided to remap the containment zones for improved scrutiny. A district magistrate who asked to stay anonymous said, “One of the main reasons we still see Covid-19 cases in these areas is because several medical professionals and health care workers live in these areas. But the 28-day rule should be re-examined, especially when we are reporting a large numbers of cases in these areas. By the time we are about to complete 28 days, a new case is reported in the containment zone, and we are not able to de-seal many of the old containment zones.”Several residents of GTB Enclave, which has over 1,000 flats, are medical professionals who work in nearby government-run facilities like Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital GTB, Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, Delhi State cancer Institute and Swami Dayanand Hospital. Similarly, south Delhi’s Hauz Rani, which was declared a containment zone on April 16, houses several nurses who work in nearby private hospitals and nursing homes, a senior south district official said.Another district magistrate, who asked not to be named, said, “They are part of essential services and most of them work in dedicated Covid-19 hospitals. Their movement can’t be restricted. But due to this, there are cases being reported in these localities.”With the Delhi government starting rapid antigen tests, with a focus on containment zones, from June 18, more people have tested positive for the infectious disease, said a Shahdara district official.MM Tripathi, general secretary of E pocket GTB Enclave said, “For doctors and other medical staff, we have fixed timings for the gates to be opened. Of the five gates in the pocket, three are permanently closed.”While the area is a containment zone, Tripathi said there are barely any restrictions on movement. “After mid-May, even residents not working in essential services, have been going to offices. But street vendors are not allowed to open their stalls in the colony and shops, apart from those selling essential items, are closed.”Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, said the containment zones are not serving any purpose now when Delhi has registered over 100,000 Covid-19 cases and most economic activities have resumed, under the Centre’s Unlock 2.0 plans. “The idea of containment zones was to contain the spread of the disease, especially in the initial stage when we were trying to ramp up our medical infrastructure. Now, when we have adequate hospital beds and alternative strategies such as home isolation in place, there is no need to have containment zones, especially when people’s movement within such an area is allowed,” he said.While these continue to containment zones, district administrations have redrawn the boundaries so that at least some parts of these areas can be de-sealed.For instance, the Hauz Rani containment zone is much smaller now than what it was on April 16, when it was first declared a containment zone, a senior district official said. “There were three containment zones initially, which were further divided into five last month. Now we have just one containment zone, which we are trying to de-seal,” a south district official said.Similarly, in Majlis Park, there were three lanes declared as one containment zone on April 26. While two lanes have been de-sealed, one remains shut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-months-later-five-areas-in-delhi-still-under-containment/story-rOcCbjx5kYb60CPaRtv8HL.html
13-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi airport to get automatic tray retrieval system; security checks to get faster||Security checks at the Indira Gandhi International Airport will be quicker September onwards, with the airport operator installing 10 Automatic Tray Retrieval Systems (ATRS), a roller-based set-up that will return luggage trays to the starting point after passengers collect their belongings from it. In effect, senior officers said, the system would reduce the need for human intervention to return the trays to the starting point, thus freeing up Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel to frisk almost double the passengers it does at present.The Delhi airport operator DIAL (Delhi International Airport Ltd) and CISF are together working on installing the systems.“At present, CISF personnel who conduct security checks manually collect the trays so they can be reused. ATRS will completely do away with the manual intervention, which will increase our efficiency by at least 60-75%. At present we clear around 180-200 passengers every hour at Delhi airport. After installation of the ATRS, we expect the number to go up by at least 330-350 passengers every hour,” said MA Ganapathy, special director general, CISF.The officer added that the ATRS will also end passengers’ hassle of looking around for trays and waiting for others to finish using them, as the system will continuously circulate the available trays.The trays will have radio-frequency identification tags and will be under constant surveillance of CCTV cameras, he said.All 10 ATRS are currently being installed at the Terminal 3 domestic area, DIAL said.“We will commission all 10 ATRS by the end of September this year,” the airport operator said in a statement.“It will also help keep the queues shorter, as four passengers can offload their belongings on the trays at the same time,” the spokesperson said.DIAL said it plans to install the ATRS in other terminals progressively. “After installing 10 lanes in the domestic side of Terminal 3, we have plans to install another 12 lanes on the international side of T3, and 24 lanes in Terminal 1 in a phased manner,” the spokesperson added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/expect-quick-security-checks-at-delhi-airport-with-automatic-tray-retrieval-system-this-september/story-fGJrkZaiIBuAwJ3QyACftJ.html
13-07-2020||Delhi||Scant space for social distance in Delhi’s congested walled city||Tell Khalil Ahmed that you want to come and visit him in the walled city and he will tell you to make sure you wear a PPE kit. “I am not saying it for myself; that is perhaps the only way for you to be safe here,” says Ahmed, who lives near Hauz Qazi, in old Delhi, which has always defied urban ideals of order.Social distancing, he adds, is an oxymoron in old Delhi , which has a population of about 12 lakh crammed in an area of 6 square kilometres. “Besides, the walled city has some of the country’s biggest wholesale bazars, attracting thousands of people from all parts of country. Call it a lack of choice or education, but most people here no longer care about corona.”World Health Organisation advises maintaining a distance of at least 1 metre (3 feet) from others to prevent contracting corona infection through droplets sprayed during speaking, coughing, sneezing, etc. Ahmed is not exaggerating. Like ever before, roads and lanes around Jama Masjid and many other parts of the walled city are jammed, with pedestrians, rickshaws, e- rickshaws, carts, jostling for space, leaving little room for social distancing.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Not that no one is trying. There are announcements everyday on loudspeakers in many markets and mosques, exhorting people to maintain social distancing. “This is aimed at making people understand the dangers of Covid- 19 and how it is the religious duty of everyone to keep themselves and others safe,” says Abu Sufiyan, a resident of the walled city who runs, Purani Dilli Walon Ki Baatein, a well-known walled-city blog.Sufiyan, who lives in Suiwalan, says while the walled city has opened, he tries to stay at home as much as possible, preferring to venture out only in the afternoons when the streets are comparatively less crowded. But finding those empty hours in the ever-bustling old Delhi is quite a challenge for those who are cautious of Covid-19.Forget the capital’s politics and pollution, the population, they will tell you is the biggest problem here, its density breaching all acceptable limits. “There are houses with as many as ten families. So, even if a fraction of the population ventures out, its congested roads and lanes become so crowded,” says Sufiyan.Also read: Most patients at home, AIIMS docs to generate e-prescriptionsAnother problem, many in Shahjahanabad , once a flourishing centre of art , culture, poetry, say, is that it has had its own socio-cultural mores, which have endured for over three centuries. “Everyone here has inherent sociability, and they are finding switching to social distancing pretty difficult,” says Mohammad Naeem, co-founder, Hazrat Shah Waliullah Library , who lives in Pahari Imli, near Choori Walan. “Used to abysmal lack of access to healthcare, people here have failed to appreciate the dangers posed by coronavirus. I believe that the government should set up a testing centre here.”The story is no different in other parts of the walled city. Many people are changing their workdays and hours. Take , for example, Ankit Agarwal who lives in west Delhi and has office in Chawri Bazar. Unlike in the past, when Sunday was a holiday, he now chooses to go to his office on Sunday—the only day, when, he says, he has some chance of maintaining social distance in the walled city. “Social distancing is an idea, which faces a test everyday in the walled city. The problem is that a lot of people here are out on the roads without any purpose,” says Agarwal , who was born and bought up in the walled-city. “Surprisingly, even now people here do not want to miss their daily dose of samosa and Kachori. Just go and witness the scene around Chawri Bazar Metro Station.”Also read: With Covid rules, Delhi ready to begin sports training for school studentsWell, Agarwal, is referring to the old Delhi tradition of breakfast congregations at confectionery shops, where one can catch whiff of steaming samosas and kachoris , with dozens of people crowding around food stalls. While the Metro station remains closed, the area around it retains its chaotic din, with labourers shopkeepers and shoppers going about their business.And not all wear masks as they walk in close proximity in crowded streets. “Sometimes it is hard to breathe in the mask while pulling the cart. I feel suffocated,” says Rakesh Kumar, a daily- wage labourer. Ask him about ‘social distancing’, and he looks at you bewildered.Dinesh Kumar Goyal, who runs one of the most famous camera shops in the Camera market in Chandni Chowk , says the walled city is a great leveller, and your socio-economic status does not make social distancing any easier. “ Here, everyone has to walk through the same crowded streets with all the attendant risks. Most people who live here do not have the choice of driving from home to office, because there are no parking spaces near their houses and cars have to be parked at Parade Ground at Red Ford, which could be a couple of kilometers away depending on where one lives in the walled city ,” says Goyal, adding that his business has taken a severe beating.“Sales are down by 85 per cent as most of my customers are from outside the walled city, who do not want to come here because they believe it will be crowded and dangerous here , though Chandni Chowk is relatively less crowded these days than other markets in old Delhi.”It is 8 pm, and Mohammad Naeem calls to say that he is returning to his home after performing namaz at Jama Masjid. He wants to show us what the scene is like in the evening around Jama Masjid, focusing his phone camera on the crowded road. He is walking in a zigzag motion, trying to maintain social distancing. “Even the most nimble of walkers cannot achieve this feat in this swarm of humans,” he says, ending the call.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-room-for-social-distancing-in-walled-city/story-dvA86o1jh1a5ZIdSscYlkI.html
13-07-2020||Gurugram||Qutub Plaza, one of the oldest market complexes in Gurugram, manages to obtain fire safety NOC||For the first time since its establishment in 1988, Qutub Plaza in DLF Phase-1 — one of the first market complexes in the city — has obtained a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the fire department.The Qutub Plaza was one of the first markets to come up in the newer parts of Gurugram, when the city started witnessing a surge in urbanisation.The plaza was facing the prospect of a closure in September 2019, after the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) got permission from the directorate of Urban Local Bodies (ULB) to serve a final notice to the market’s association for sealing the complex for failing to obtain a fire safety NOC.As per an inspection conducted by the fire department last year, barring a few fire extinguishers, the complex did not have any other fire-fighting equipment. Fire fighting tools, such as such as water hydrants, hose pipes, sprinkler systems, smoke detectors and sand buckets, were found to be missing, while the corridors of the market were also found to be heavily encroached by vendors.“Upon reinspection of the complex in March 2020, all the necessary fire safety norms, such as the width of the entry and exit passages, the presence of various types of extinguishing equipment, clear staircase and corridors were found at the site. Based on our report, the director-general of Haryana fire service, earlier this month, gave an NOC for a period of five years,” said Satyawan Samriwal, assistant divisional fire officer.Samriwal said that the complex was built almost 20 years before fire safety norms were properly introduced in the state through the Haryana Fire Service Act, 2009 which mandated all buildings above 15 metres need to obtain a fire NOC from the local fire department.“When the building was constructed, the present fire safety norms were not in existence. Hence, no heed was paid on placing any fire-fighting equipment. However, after the Fire Service Act was introduced all such buildings needed to upgrade and ensure the safety norms were being followed. We are working towards ensuring other such complexes, which were built in the city prior to 2009, also follow the necessary norms. Otherwise, we would seal them,” said Samriwal.While Block A of Qutub Plaza, which is one-storey in height, measures 9.25 metres, Block B, which is a four-storey building, measures 20.2 metres. Therefore, the entire complex needed a fire safety NOC, said fire department officials.“We were on the brink of getting sealed from the MCG in September last year. We then approached the district administration and requested them to give us time for installing the necessary fire equipment. Earlier, this year, we completed all the necessary installation and applied for the NOC in March. The NOC was approved earlier this month. We will continue to ensure that all shops in the complex continue to follow the requisite fire safety norms,” said Dr Satish Chillar, general secretary, Qutub Plaza Condominium Association, which manages the complex.There are around 480 different types of commercial spaces in various complexes across the city that include restaurants, banks, retail shops, offices, among others. On average more than 3,000 people visit the Qutub Plaza on a daily basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/qutub-plaza-one-of-the-oldest-market-complexes-in-gurugram-manages-to-obtain-fire-safety-noc/story-QAyiCyTj45wdshhKGRSN3J.html
13-07-2020||Gurugram||As humidity rises, frontline workers to get 2,000 ‘breathable’ PPE kits||The Gurugram district administration has placed an order for 2,000 ‘breathable’ personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, which are expected to arrive within the next two to three days.The new PPE kits, officials said, will spell relief for lab technicians and field staff , who at present drape deeply uncomfortable normal coveralls while they are on the field. Officials also insisted that an alternative solution to protect frontline workers was needed soon.The physical challenges of using conventional PPE kits — which do not have any ventilation — in this sweltering heat has forced field staff to rely on more skeletal means of protection, namely gloves, face shields and three-ply masks. “It is quite hard to work when you are wearing a full PPE suit. These days the weather has also become so humid. It slows you down so much, but we have no other choice,” said a lab technician at an antigen camp near Dundahera on Sunday. As per IMD data, average relative humidity in Gurugram rose from about 50% in May to between about 70% throughout the month of June. At present, maximum humidity (recorded at 8:30am) is in the range of 80-85% while minimum humidity (recorded at 5:30pm) is in the region of 60-65%. As the monsoon progresses, these numbers are expected to rise, creating difficult conditions for workers until the summer heat tapers off. On July 12, the maximum humidity was 84% while minimum stood at 62%. Maximum temperature was 35 degrees Celsius, and is expected to touch 37 Celsius toward the end of the week, according to IMD’s forecast for Gurugram.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Another lab technician who has been employed with the district health department since 2011, said, “Masks and gloves are adequate for personal use. But for frontline workers, where there is a much higher risk of exposure, it is not enough. On the other hand, wearing the PPE kit is impossible because it causes dehydration and leaves you extremely drained. There have been multiple instances since April when our own technicians have tested positive for Covid-19.” According to state health department data, frontline workers accounted for at least 12 percent of reported infections in Haryana, till June 28.Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, Gurugram, said, “The health department, through the deputy commissioner’s office, has requisitioned 2,000 units of ‘breathable’ PPE kits that will be made mandatory for all field staff. These kits will be both hydrophobic (water-repellent) as well as ventilated. The issue is that with Covid-19, transmission happens through water droplets, so PPE kits need to completely impermeable. But this makes them much more hotter to work in.”However, health department officials said that as PPE manufacturing in India has gone up in the last three months, vendors have also begun to offer various design related solutions, to improve conditions for frontline workers. “We have sourced a PPE kit which provides a high degree of breath-ability as well as resistance to fluids. While these suits may not be used in a hospital setting, they should be adequate for field use,” district surveillance officer Sharma added. “It is an important step that we are taking for our staff. If one of them contracts the illness, it slows down our work . The kits will arrive early next week and will be distributed among lab technicians and surveillance staff,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/as-humidity-rises-frontline-workers-to-get-2-000-breathable-ppe-kits/story-Ckq9kruVQ8yiwQXLITQYIO.html
13-07-2020||Noida||Family of missing sales executive alleges police inaction||More than a week after a 25-year-old man went missing from near his home in Greater Noida West, his family has alleged that the local police have not done enough to trace him.Sushil Kumar, a resident of Panchsheel Hynish, who works as a sales executive for a private firm in Sector 88 had went missing on July 4. According to family, a colleague had dropped him off near the society after work. “However, he never entered the society that night and there has been no trace of him since then. The family tried calling him, but his phone was not reachable initially and was later switched off. His older brother filed a missing person’s complaint with the Bisrakh police the next day (July 5),” said Alok Dwivedi, a family friend.Dwivedi said the family had checked will all their relatives and Kumar’s friends and colleagues, but no one had heard from him in the past week. There hasn’t been a ransom call either, but the family is worried that Kumar might have come in some harm’s way like another Greater Noida West resident Gaurav Chandel. Earlier this year on January 6, Chandel, who worked as a manager with a private firm in Gurugram, was killed during a robbery bid on January 6 a few meters away from his house in Gaur City. Kumar’s family has alleged that police officers simply checked his call data records one time. His last location was traced to Shahjahanpur in Uttar Pradesh, Dwivedi said, but the police allegedly have not done anything else to trace himThe police, however, said that a probe in the matter is underway.“We identified Kumar’s last location in UP. There have been two transactions of small amounts from his debit cards: one in Ghaziabad and another in Nagpur. We are waiting for CCTV camera footage from the two cities to verify who was behind the withdrawals. An investigation is on and we will have some answers soon. There has been no ransom call yet, and all angles are being probed,” said Munish Kumar Chauhan, station house officer, Bisrakh police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/family-of-missing-sales-executive-alleges-police-inaction/story-c7H9addh7VywKO8TegjiAO.html
13-07-2020||Noida||Noida, Ghaziabad traders welcome plan for markets||Ghaziabad/Noida The Uttar Pradesh government on Sunday announced a fresh set of guidelines to curb the rising Covid-19 cases in the state. As per the latest order, all markets in the state will be allowed to open from Monday to Friday and they will remain shut for two days on weekends for cleanliness and sanitization drive in order to break the chain of infection.However, traders in Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar on Sunday expressed their apprehensions over the implementation of the new order in the two NCR districts of UP. Markets in both the districts are presently operating on alternate days. Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home), said that economic activity will not be hampered during the weekend restrictions, but markets will remain closed on Saturdays and Sundays while they will open from 9am to 9pm on weekdays.Pradeep Gupta, convener of Vyapari Ekta Samiti, Indirapuram, said, “Although the government has given directions for opening markets on five days, we still have apprehension that local authorities may continue with the alternate day opening of markets. In case this continues, a set of markets which were scheduled to open on Saturdays will face major issues. Already, the traders are incurring losses due to restricted three-day opening.” “If the district authorities fully implement the government directions, it will bring relief to traders and shop owners. Five-day opening and 9am to 9pm timing will help traders run their businesses properly. So, we are waiting for directions from local authorities,” Gupta said.Traders in GB Nagar feel that five-day opening of shops will surely help their businesses, but they too are confused with no clear guidelines issued by the district administration.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “In the current system, we are open for three days a week. But five-day a week will definitely be an improvement. The timings of opening markets will be a critical factor in helping standalone businesses,” said Sushil Kumar Jain, president, Sector 18 market association in Noida.“The footfall has already been very less. Now, the weekend buyers will have to balance out their own work timings during a weekday. However, there is no clarity on the implementation of the new order in Noida,” he added.Suhas LY, GB Nagar district magistrate, said that he will wait for the orders from the state government and then take a call accordingly.Ajay Shankar Pandey, Ghaziabad district magistrate, said, “The Ghaziabad administration is waiting for the government order about opening of markets. Once we receive it, we will be implementing the directions.” Apart from alternate opening days, the markets in Ghaziabad remained shut on Sundays while traders had to deal with different opening and closing timings announced from time to time.On May 22, the Ghaziabad administration issued orders for opening of 34 major markets in different areas from 10am to 5pm. There were subsequent orders that all shops will be allowed to open from 9am to 9pm from June 8.On July 2, the administration further revised timings for shops (from 9am to 7.30pm) after the UP chief secretary on June 30 directed for imposition of night curfew from 8pm to 6am in six districts of Meerut division, which includes Ghaziabad and GB Nagar districts. However, the extended night curfew restriction (8pm to 6am) in Meerut division were applicable till July 10.The state government had directed for two-day weekend restrictions for the first time on Thursday.“The response of the two-day restrictions has been good. Now, the chief minister has directed that markets will open 9am to 9pm from Monday to Friday. The economic activity will continue with functioning of industrial units. Banks will open on Saturdays. However, there will be restriction on social activities,” Awasthi said.“There will be a weekend drive for taking up sanitization and cleanliness. Solid waste lifting and disposal will be ensured. This drive will also include anti-larvae treatment and fogging activities. The industries will also set up Covid help desks and follow protocols,” the additional chief secretary said.The weekend restrictions will remain in place till further orders from the state government, the officials said.The two NCR districts of UP have been witnessing a sudden spurt in number of Covid-19 cases since June. According to the state control room statistics, GB Nagar and Ghaziabad are the only two districts in UP where total Covid-19 count has surged past 3,000 cases. On July 11, the total number of positive cases in GB Nagar and Ghaziabad stood at 3,347 and 3,016, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-ghaziabad-traders-say-concerned-over-order-to-shut-shops-on-weekend/story-axoG6VyoX8JkPxF83GgnGN.html
13-07-2020||Noida||Noida residents demand immediate cleaning of Irrigation drain||Irked with the solid waste and silt accumulated in the Irrigation drain, several residents in the city have asked the Noida authority to de-silt the entire drain immediately. They claimed the authority had not cleaned the Irrigation drain—which carries most of Noida’s sewage and wastewater— on time leaving many residential areas prone to the risk of being waterlogged amid monsoon. The Irrigation drain begins in Ashok Nagar in Delhi and merges with the Yamuna river near Sector 168 after passing through multiple residential sectors in Noida taking along sewage that many smaller drains empty into it.“The drain is full of plastic waste and silt because the Noida authority did not carry out de-silting work on time. The waste accumulated in the drain can lead to waterlogging in many residential areas that include Sector 11, 34, 35, and 51 among others. On Saturday, we filed a complaint with the Noida authority demanding the de-silting of this drain and the authority should de-silt it on a priority basis,” said NP Singh, president, Gautam Budh Nagar district residents’ welfare association (DDRWA), an umbrella body of city’s RWAs.Residents said the drain, which was initially set up a few decades ago to provide water for irrigation in the region—should have been cleaned much ahead of monsoon when the risk of water-borne diseases is higher.“Many vendors, private establishments among other dump waste into the drain and the foul smell that emanates from it subsequently troubles the residents who live in sectors located along the drain. The stench is so strong that we have to keep the windows in our homes shut at all times. In the rainy season, when the risk of water-borne disease is high, the authority should have kept this drain clean. The authority should also install barriers, which can trap the waste material including plastic, over the drain to keep the water channel clean,” said Sanjiv Kumar, general secretary, Sector 51 residents’ welfare association (RWA).The Noida authority officials said that the de-silting of city drains had got delayed due to the coronavirus disease pandemic, but has started now. The authority had started de-silting of drains— 75 main drains and 44 small drains —on June 9 and had set a June-end deadline to finish the job.“We could not de-silt all small and big drains by the June-end deadline due to the pandemic. The de-silting of the Irrigation drain was also delayed as the tendering process was pushed back. But now all the process is over and the cleaning work has started. We have set a target of finishing the de-silting work within the next two days. No drains should be waterlogged as we are de-silting all drains properly,” said SC Mishra, senior project engineer, Noida authority and head of the health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-residents-demand-immediate-cleaning-of-irrigation-drain/story-831D94FiBDZnEl3pnLiv9K.html
13-07-2020||Pune||10K prisoners released as Covid tally in Maharashtra jails reaches 599||As various prisons in Maharashtra have reported 599 Covid positive cases, the jail administration has been able to free up space inside the prisons by realising over 10,000 prisoners in the past two months.The number of prisoners in 47 jails across Maharashtra is now 26,046 excluding the ones in temporary jails established in various districts, according to statistics provided by the prison department.While the decongestion process has led to a decreased population, it remains to be seen whether it has helped the overcrowding.Maharashtra has a total of 64 jails. The 64 jails include nine central jails, 28 district jails, four sub-jails, one women’s jail, one borstal school, 19 open jails, one special jail and one uncategorised jail.At the end of 2018, Maharashtra jail capacity was 24,095 - 22,830 male and 1,265 female - while the occupancy was 35,884 - 34,264 male and 1,620 female. Overall, the jails were 148.9% occupied. Therefore, the jails in Maharashtra were housing 11,789 more people than they are equipped to.Over crowding at Central JailsThe maximum overcrowding among all jails in Maharashtra was in central jails at 170.70% with 25,333 inmates residing in space meant for 14,841. Therefore, Central jails were housing 10,492 inmates more than its capacity. Which also means that major portion of the overall overcrowding was concentrated in central jails of the state.The nine central jails include Yerawada central jail, Aurangabad central jail, Arthur road Mumbai central jail, Taloja Navi Mumbai central jail, Nagpur central jail, Amravati central jail, Nashik central jail, Thane central jail, and Kolhapur central jail.To function at its capacity, the central jail population needed to decrease by 10,492. However, the nine central jails collectively managed to shed overcrowding by only around 6,500.“We are fairly relieved by the number of prisoners released. It has freed quite a bit of space. It will be heartening if more prisoners are released. After all, until a vaccine or a cure is found, everyone is vulnerable,” said Sunil Ramanand, additional director general of police, Maharashtra Prisons.Rejection of bail applicationsAccording to Dr Vijay Raghavan, professor, Centre for Criminology and Justice, School of Social Work, Tata Institute of Social Science (TISS) and project director of Prayas the problem of continued overcrowding is related to the rejection of bail applications by the judiciary, despite High Powered Committee (HPC) guidelines to consider releasing undertrials from certain categories. “If these bail applications had been passed, more than 17,000 prisoners would have been released. The prison department had forwarded the bail applications to the courts, but the discretion to release on bail lies with the courts,” he said.“The courts are responding to these applications as if these are normal times, but we need to realise that these are extraordinary times. There is a lack of sync between the directions given by the high court to maintain hygiene and social distancing in prisons, HPC guidelines to release prisoners and the lower courts passing bail orders,” he said.“Some of the reasons for rejection include issues like the assistant public prosecutor’s say not being on record, case papers not being available, as only 30 per cent court staff is available and so on,” said Dr Raghavan.“These releases are based on HOC recommendations which have two dimensions - temporary bail and government release for convicts. The rules are in black and white. The final discretion is of the courts. HPC can only suggest conditions and recommendations do not have the force of the law,” said Sunil Ramanand, additional director general of police, Maharashtra Prisons.District jailsThe overcrowding in central jails is followed by district jails which were housing 8,680 inmates in the space meant for 6,938 inmates - 125.11% capacity.In women’s jail, the capacity was overflowing at 159.16% with 417 women living in space meant for 262.The decongestion process helped in three phases - one for under-trials, one for convicts in cases under seven years jail term, and one for convicts in non-serious cases with more than 7 years jail term.The first process of releasing under-trials started after a state-level High Powered Committee (HPC) had laid down rules for choosing who should be released. The HPC was formed in each state based on the Supreme Court direction.The second decision was issued on May 8 and the third on May 11 by the same HPC.The topic of decongestion of jails has been in discussion for the past several years. A three-member committee led by Dr Sundaram Radhakrishnan, a retired High Court Judge, for prison reforms had suggested decongestion as an effort in its report in 2017-18.Two NGOs have also been working with the prison department to grant financial and legal help to prisoners who could be released from prisons.Three Covid-19 positive cases reported at temporary jail at Yerawada-Among the 599 Covid positive patients across the state, Yerawada jail reported three positive cases, all at the temporary jail established at BARTI hostel. -One of them earlier succumbed to the Sars-Cov-2 infection while two were found positive on Saturday.-“We are taking several measures such as regular health check-ups of inmates, following norms like social distancing and sanitisation in Maharashtra’s most crowded jail,” said UT Pawar, superintendent, Yerawada prison.-Yerawada jail is one of the five jails in the state which is under complete lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/10k-prisoners-released-as-covid-tally-in-maharashtra-jails-reaches-599/story-iwYTnfhg9FdMu4bLVBaOwM.html

13-07-2020||Pune||10 plasma donors in Pune city as of July 12||The repeated appeal by the district administration for plasma donation has been met with a lukewarm response, at best, in Pune. Pune divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar states that only 10 cured Covid-19 patients in the city have donated plasma, as of July 12.People who have fully recovered from Covid-19 have immunisers in their plasma that can combat the virus. This patient plasma is being evaluated as a treatment for patients with severe Covid-19 infection, or those found by a healthcare provider to be at high risk of improvement to critical diseases.Mhaisekar said, “Ten people have donated plasma and I am really thankful to them. Although this figure can change as we received more queries after my appeal to the citizens of Pune. The state government has a policy where the plasma will be used to treat critical as well as mild patients who are on the verge of recovery. I do not think that there is any need of having a fear of weakness within recovered individuals of Covid-19. If they come forward, they can save a life and they should not hesitate for plasma donation as it is just like blood donation. We have created a database in Sassoon hospital where we have categorised every blood type like a plasma bank for more organised records of these donations.”Plasma is the liquid remnant of blood that remains after red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and other cellular elements are removed. Donation can be made at Sassoon Hospital as well as Poona Hospital. A person who is fully recovered from Covid-19 is eligible to donate plasma after at least two weeks of recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/10-plasma-donors-in-city-as-of-july-12/story-kPz3s0zxzl4mlGtX0LR45J.html
13-07-2020||Pune||166 of 979 deaths reported within 72 hours of hospital admission||The Pune district reported 979 deaths in total as of July 9, among these 166 fatalities or 17 per cent of the total deaths were reported in just 72 hours of the patient being admitted in a hospital as opposed to 20 per cent reported in the first 72 hours as of June 12.While there has been a drop in the number of deaths reported in a shorter duration of time, a lack of awareness among patients to reach the hospital on time is resulting in the deaths in just a few days of admission. With less time for treatment, the hospitals are left with very fewer options to treat the patient resulting in an escalation of symptoms and eventually death. The Sassoon General hospital which reported the most deaths, 306 of the 800 reported from Pune city, received over 10 Covid-19 positive patients who were brought dead to the hospital. Sassoon hospital dean Dr Murlidhar Tambe was not available for a response despite repeated attempts.Dr Ashok Nanadapurkar, nodal officer, Pune district said, “One of the probable reasons could be lack of awareness among citizens regarding the symptoms. The earlier the symptoms are reported the treatment scope is wider. While earlier there was a social stigma associated with the infection but now it has subsided. People need to reach out to the hospital even if they feel the slightest symptoms, especially if they are moving around for work or other purpose or if they are living in containment zones. While there are newer symptoms being reported by the WHO, the latest additions being diarrhoea or lack of sense of smell and taste, cold, cough and fever are the most common ones. It is also seen that people often seek over the counter medicines to treat flu which suppresses the fever but then the infection continues to spread which leads to further complications by the time they reach out to a hospital.”In the 979 deaths in the district, 70 occurred in just 0-24 hours post-hospital admission, 54 deaths took place in 24-48 hours post-hospital admission while 42 deaths took place in 48-72 hours post-hospital admission. In the 979 total deaths, 834 or 85 per cent of the deaths had associated risk factors or were comorbid while the remaining 145 or 15 per cent had no comorbidities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/166-of-979-deaths-reported-within-72-hours-of-hospital-admission/story-MLp6vFymkSwiUk76wGmzSN.html
13-07-2020||Pune||PMC’s three-pronged strategy during lockdown - 100 per cent contact tracing, testing and increasing bed capacity||As the Covid-19 cases are surging ahead in Pune unrelentingly, forcing the state administration to announce stricter lockdown, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has devised a plan to tackle the situation in next ten days.As part of PMC’s three-pronged strategy during the lockdown, PMC has decided to go all out and carry out 100 per cent contact tracing given that there will be a complete restriction on any activity and movement of people. “Our main aim during the lockdown is to break the chain by identifying 100 per cent contacts and then testing them,” said Rubal Agarwal, additional commissioner, PMC. The PMC data till the first week of July suggested that the source of infection among 21.35% cases was unknown.The second part involves testing 100 per cent of those first contact traced by the civic body using a rapid antigen test. The PMC had recently procured one lakh antigen kits from a private firm and has begun testing. The results, according to PMC officials, have been good so far.According to state health department officials, rapid antigen detection tests are faster as they offer results within a maximum of 30 minutes as compared to minimum 24-hours for RT-PCR test and are non-confirmatory. Therefore, those tested negative will have to be tested again the RT-PCR test for re-confirmation while positive patients are considered “positive” and do not require a further test. Currently, the PMC is carrying out average 2,000-2,500 antigen tests daily. The third part involves adding 3,000 beds in existing and proposed Covid Care Centre across the city with 500 oxygen beds anticipating further spike by August. This will also include the jumbo facility being planned by PMC at gliding centre in Hadapsar and Sanas ground. The facility will have 1,500 additional beds beside the current 1,000 beds at Balewadi, which the civic body further plans to increase. The PMC has already issued tender and invited bids for developing jumbo facility and 600 oxygen beds. During the meeting with private hospitals on Sunday, it was decided that 150 more ICU beds will be acquired by PMC. To ensure higher success during the lockdown, PMC has identified two areas – Malwadi in Hadapsar and Upper Indiranagar in Bibwewadi – where 100 per cent contacts were traced and then tested.According to her, the PMC is currently testing between 4,000 to 5,000 swabs.“During the lockdown, we plan to take swab testing to 6,000 and then to 10,000 a day. This will, of course, increase the number of positives. But eventually, the number of Covid cases will fall as we will be able to isolate those tested,” said Agarwal, who is heading PMC’s health department.Phone calls made to newly appointed PMC chief Vikram Kumar did not receive any response.The outgoing PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said, “The plan for the civic body is to utilise the lockdown period at its optimum level.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-s-three-pronged-strategy-during-lockdown-100-per-cent-contact-tracing-testing-and-increasing-bed-capacity/story-muaZ1F55GKAw7J7vGoAoAM.html
13-07-2020||Pune||Multiple challenges before newly appointed PMC chief Vikram Kumar as he takes charge||A day after Vikram Kumar was appointed as PMC municipal commissioner replacing Shekhar Gaikwad, he took charge amid numerous challeges that civic body is facing.Kumar takes over from Shekhar Gaikwad, who has now been transferred as sugar commissioner after serving as PMC commissioner for six months. Kumar’s transfer comes at a time when Pune’s health infrastructure is facing serious challenges in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic; and the civic body also faces a revenue crunch.The biggest challenge that Kumar faces is to contain Covid-19 in the city. Sporadic cases of bed shortages and ambulances not reaching on time are now being reported. Despite adequate beds, the PMC has not been able to efficiently manage availability and to convince people to stay at the Covid Care Centres, instead of occupying critical care beds which are required on an emergency basis. Vikram Kumar said, “I have just taken charge and it is too early for me to comment on the same. I will have to see the current mechanism in place and then work accordingly. With regards to revenue, I will have to check on and then only I would be able to comment.” Former Pune civic chief Shekhar Gaikwad said, “There are mainly two challenges with regards to Covid-19 which is high contact tracing and heavy testing. Also building up capacity is required and encouraging home isolation while maintaining a mechanism for proper counselling is required. More focus could be given on critical care so that the case fatality ratio is controlled. With regards to the monsoon, the good thing is that most of the nullah de-silting work for big rivers and nullahs has been completed. With regards to revenue, the PMC awaits government funds and also boost recovery of property tax as much as possible.” On one hand, while Covid-19 has been draining the civic body exchequer, the income for the civic body has been heavily disrupted. The civic body has cancelled many ongoing projects mainly related to beautification, garden works and also road widening. In addition, the previous civic chief ordered all his departments that no new projects will be announced in the current budget. This has halted the city’s infrastructure progress mainly with regards to roads and de-silting works which are also equally important.Another crucial challenge for Kumar would be monsoon which has now arrived. The 2019 Pune flash floods which killed 22 people are still afresh in people’s memories. Maximum damage was caused to Ambilodha region where the wall collapse killed 21 people. What is closed?

13-07-2020||World||Antibody immunity to Covid-19 may be short-lived: UK study||Patients who recover from the novel coronavirus may have an antibody response that makes them immune to the deadly virus only for a few months, a new study in the UK has found.A paper titled ‘Longitudinal evaluation and decline of antibody responses in SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) infection’, by King’s College London researchers, analysed the immune response of more than 90 patients and healthcare workers at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, the London hospital which had treated Prime Minister Boris Johnson after he tested positive for coronavirus in March.Research, led by Dr Katie Doores of King’s College London, found levels of antibodies that can destroy the virus peaked about three weeks after the onset of symptoms then started declining.“People are producing a reasonable antibody response to the virus, but it’s waning over a short period of time and depending on how high your peak is, that determines how long the antibodies are staying around,” Doores told The Guardian.“Infection tends to give you the best-case scenario for an antibody response, so if your infection is giving you antibody levels that wane in two to three months, the vaccine will potentially do the same thing. People may need boosting and one shot might not be sufficient,” she explains.The study is the first “longitudinal” research to have monitored antibody levels in patients and hospital workers for three months after symptoms emerged. The scientists drew on test results from 65 patients and six healthcare workers who tested positive for the virus, and a further 31 staff who volunteered to have regular antibody tests between March and June.“Antibody (Ab) responses to SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in most infected individuals 10-15 days following the onset of Covid-19 symptoms. However, due to the recent emergence of this virus in the human population it is not yet known how long these Ab responses will be maintained or whether they will provide protection from re-infection,” notes the paper, which is yet to be peer-reviewed.The immune system has multiple ways to fight the coronavirus but if antibodies are the main line of defence, the findings suggest people could become reinfected in seasonal waves just like the common cold and other kinds of flu.“This study has important implications when considering widespread serological testing, Ab protection against reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and the durability of vaccine protection,” the paper adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antibody-immunity-to-covid-19-may-be-short-lived-uk-study/story-QnFEFmoVcsr4G6yj2OrnUK.html
13-07-2020||World||Body found in search of lake for ‘Glee’ star Naya Rivera||Authorities say a body has been found at the Southern California lake where “Glee” star Naya Rivera has been missing since last week. The Ventura County Sheriff’s Office says in a tweet that the body was found Monday morning at Lake Piru. There’s no information on whether the body has been identified but authorities plan an afternoon news conference. The “Glee” star disappeared July 8 after she took her young son out on a rented boat.A member of a team searching a Southern California lake for a missing TV star said Sunday that he’s confident his crew is getting a clearer idea of where in the lake to find her, a magazine reported.Robert Inglis of the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office Search & Rescue Team told Us Weekly that Naya Rivera sent to a family member a picture of her 4-year-old son, Josey, in front of a cove before she disappeared July 8 after diving into Lake Piru.“There was a picture sent to a family member that showed the boy on the boat by a cove,” Inglis told the magazine. “We found where that cove was.”A time stamp on the photo shows it was taken 90 minutes to two hours before the boy was found alone on the pontoon boat, the magazine reported.Inglis told Us Weekly that the area where the photo was taken and the spot where the boat was found were starting points for authorities before the search was expanded.“We did send our dive members to those two locations and searched those extensively,” he told Us Weekly.Rivera remained missing as of Sunday night.Authorities said Thursday they believe Rivera, 33, drowned. Her son was found the boat.The boy told investigators that he and his mother went swimming and he got back on the boat, but “his mom never made it out of the water,” Sheriff’s Sgt. Kevin Donoghue said.Rivera began acting at a young age, but she rose to national attention playing a lesbian teen on “Glee,” which aired from 2009 until 2015 on Fox.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/body-found-in-search-of-lake-for-glee-star-naya-rivera/story-MXSe3RDl3aGdkhqjHifg1I.html
13-07-2020||World||More than 200 schools back lawsuit challenging Trump’s foreign student rule||More than 200 universities are backing a legal challenge to the Trump administration’s new restrictions on international students, arguing that the policy jeopardizes students’ safety and forces schools to reconsider fall plans they have spent months preparing.The schools have signed court briefs supporting Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as they sue U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in federal court in Boston. The lawsuit challenges a recently announced directive saying international students cannot stay in the U.S. if they take all their classes online this fall.A wide range of colleges and state and local officials are standing up to the policy, which faces mounting legal opposition. Massachusetts filed a federal suit Monday that was joined by Democratic attorneys general in 16 other states and the District of Columbia. Other suits have come from Johns Hopkins University and the state of California. The University of California system has said it will sue.A judge is scheduled to hear arguments Tuesday in the case brought by Harvard and MIT. If the judge does not suspend the rule, colleges across the U.S. will have until Wednesday to notify ICE if they plan to be fully online this fall.The Department of Homeland Security and ICE have not yet responded to the suit.A brief filed Monday by 59 universities says the rule throws their plans into disarray with less than a month before some schools start the fall term. They challenged the policy’s legal grounds and say it forces schools across the nation to “choose between opening their campuses regardless of the public health risks, or forcing their international students to leave the country.”The group includes all of Harvard’s companions in the Ivy League and other prestigious schools including Stanford and Duke universities. They collectively enroll more than 213,000 international students.“These students are core members of our institutions,” the schools wrote. “They make valuable contributions to our classrooms, campuses and communities — contributions that have helped make American higher education the envy of the world.”The colleges are asking the court to block the rule as quickly as possible, saying it’s already being used to turn students away. Last Wednesday, a DePaul University student was prevented from entering the country after arriving in San Francisco, according to the filing. Harvard previously said one of its students from Belarus was turned away from a flight at an airport in Minsk last week.If the policy is upheld, schools could forced to reconsider their fall plans, the filing says. Princeton last week said first-year students and juniors could live on campus this fall, while sophomores and seniors would replace them during the spring semester. But that plan was based on the understanding that foreign students could continue remote learning from the U.S., the filing said.“Princeton now may be forced to reassess its plan, with just weeks to go before the fall semester, lest sophomore and senior international students be forced to leave the country — and potentially be unable to return for the spring,” according to the brief.A separate coalition of 180 colleges filed a brief saying colleges were “blindsided” by the policy. The group, known as the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, said it was a reversal of a March 13 directive from ICE that waived limitations around online education for foreign students “for the duration of the emergency.” They point to data suggesting that the number of new coronavirus cases in the U.S. is higher now than it was in March.“All seem to agree the emergency remains ongoing, but ICE’s policy has inexplicably changed,” the group wrote.The directive also stands to hurt colleges financially, the group wrote. International students typically pay the highest tuition rates and rarely are eligible for scholarships. The alliance said many colleges risk losing millions of dollars over the policy, including Northern Virginia Community College, which estimates it could lose nearly $10 million in tuition from foreign students.A separate brief filed by the Princeton Theological Seminary says the policy would bring “crippling consequences” from a funding perspective. The seminary said its international ties include many foreign donors who would find the guidance “such a shocking affront that PTS’ relationships with those donors may never recover.”The suit is also being backed by 26 cities and counties that say the policy would damage their economies. Those range from New York City, which says international students contribute $3 billion per year to its economy, to Iowa City, Iowa, which says its 2,500 resident international students contribute millions of dollars a year.Briefs of support have also been filed by scientific associations, student governments, education unions and 71 higher education associations.Under the new rule, international students will be forced to leave the U.S. or transfer to another college if their schools operate entirely online this fall. New visas will not be issued to students at those schools, ICE said, and others at schools offering a mix of online and in-person courses will be barred from taking all of their classes online.It would apply even if an outbreak forces schools to shift classes entirely online mid-term, according to the guidance.The policy was issued the same day Harvard announced that its first-years would be invited to campus but that all undergraduate classes will be held online. The policy faces other legal challenges from California and Johns Hopkins University. Massachusetts’ attorney general has announced that she also plans to sue.The suit from Harvard and MIT argues that ICE issued the policy without offering any justification and without allowing the public to respond. It also says the agency is breaking from its March 13 promise to provide flexibility during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-200-schools-back-lawsuit-challenging-trump-s-foreign-student-rule/story-WCbhJq35llVfRI035DktTL.html
13-07-2020||World||Justin Trudeau apologizes for not recusing himself from decision||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized Monday for not recusing himself from a Cabinet decision to award a contract to a charity his family did paid work for.Trudeau announced last month a grant for students having trouble finding work due to the pandemic.The almost billion-dollar program came under scrutiny after it was revealed that We Charity, an organization Trudeau’s family has worked for, was chosen to administer it. Trudeau’s wife, brother and mother have been paid a combined $300,000 Canadian (US$221,000) for speaking at a number of WE events.“I made a mistake in not recusing immediately from the discussions, given our family’s history. I am sincerely sorry for not having done that,” Trudeau said. “The mistake we made was on me. I take responsibility for it.”Trudeau said he knew his family worked with the charity, but said he was unaware of how much they had been paid.“I deeply regret that I have brought my mother into this situation. That is unfair to her,” he said.Canada’s ethics commissioner in investigating Trudeau over the matter. It is the third ethics investigation Trudeau has faced.Under pressure, the government and WE on July 3 terminated their deal, which had promised the organization up to $19 million Canadian (US$14 million). Students could volunteer up to 500 hours of work with community organizations to earn the maximum $5,000 Canadian (US$3,668) toward their postsecondary education costs.Canada’s federal ethics commissioner said Trudeau violated conflict of interest rules in 2016 when he vacationed over Christmas at the private Bahamian island owned by the Aga Khan. He was not sanctioned or penalized.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-apologizes-for-not-recusing-himself-from-decision/story-W4AUmBvh5UQae61K30gqsM.html
13-07-2020||World||New York braces for searing temperatures as heat shifts north||The oppressive heat blanketing the southern U.S. from California to Florida should start to wind down Tuesday. Unfortunately for other parts of the country, it’ll be shifting north and east over the next two weeks.New York will likely see temperatures above 90 Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) starting this weekend and continuing into next week, according to Bradley Harvey, a meteorologist with Maxar in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Washington will hit the 90s Monday and stay there through next week.“By next week the heat will be around full force” in the Northeast, said Paul Walker, a meteorologist with AccuWeather Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania. “It looks like it could be around for a while,”The searing temperatures have already knocked off daily records across the country. Excessive heat warnings currently cover large parts of California, Arizona, Texas and Louisiana, with advisories filling in the gaps and extending the sultry reach of the hot spell to Florida, the National Weather Service said.In the past seven days, 750 daily heat records have been broken or tied, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information. The temperature hasn’t dropped below 90 in Phoenix since July 7 and daily highs there have been 110 or more since July 4. Even Maine has seen record highs.“It’s bad when Maine gets in on it,” said David Roth, a senior branch forecaster at the U.S. Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.Texas ElectricityOppressive temperatures are expected to spur record electricity demand in Texas Monday, with usage peaking at more than 75,000 megawatts at about 4 p.m. local time, according to the state’s grid operator. That would top last year’s record of 74,820 megawatts in August.The heat is now expected to swing north and east, entrenching the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast from July 18 to 27 with temperatures reaching 5 to 8 degrees above normal, Matt Rogers, president of the Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland, said in a note to clients.That will bring stress to corn and soybeans across the southern Midwest, including parts of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio, said Don Keeney, a meteorologist with Maxar.For much of the U.S., including New York and the Northeast, July is the hottest month. New York’s Central Park has reached 90 degrees four times so far this month. The average since 1869 is 6 days at 90 or above and the record is 20 days set in 1993, according to the National Weather Service.As the Northeast braces for more sweltering weather, the southern states are ready to put it behind them.“Today is apparently the peak of it,” said Roth. “Tomorrow will be slightly less bad.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-braces-for-searing-temperatures-as-heat-shifts-north/story-ITjFOLAKuF6JMLP9R0euXO.html
13-07-2020||World||Fact-check: Donald Trump team’s false comfort on schools, coronavirus||President Donald Trump’s aides are misrepresenting the record on kids and the coronavirus as they push for schools to reopen.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Monday inaccurately characterized what the chief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said on the matter. A day earlier, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos also was wrong in stating that the research shows there is no danger “in any way” if kids are in school.No such conclusion has been reached.Their comments came as Trump continued to spread falsehoods about a pandemic that is taking a disproportionate hit on the U.S. and is not under control.A look at recent claims and reality:SCHOOLSMcENANY: “Just last week you heard Dr. Redfield say that children are not spreading this.” — Monday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox and Friends”THE FACTS: No, Dr. Robert Redfield, the CDC director, did not say that. He said officials don’t have evidence that children are “driving” infections at this point. But they have not ruled out that children spread the virus to adults.Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus coordinator, said last week the government doesn’t have enough data to show whether and to what degree kids can infect others.The bulk of data has been collected from adults and particularly from those who were sick, leaving questions about children still unanswered, Birx said. She said children under 10 are the least tested age group.The officials did not reach a conclusion that “children are not spreading this.” Nor does the evidence prove that they are.The government has counted tens of thousands of children who have been infected with the virus and in some cases hospitalized. Overall, public health officials believe the virus is less dangerous to children than adults.___DEVOS: “There’s nothing in the data that suggests that kids being in school is in any way dangerous.” — Sunday on “Fox News Sunday.”THE FACTS: Not so. Like McEnany, DeVos is suggesting certainty where none exists as she urged schools to provide full-time, in-person learning in the fall even with community transmission of COVID-19 rising in many parts of the U.S.It’s premature to claim that there are no risks “in any way” seen in data. How significant a risk has not been established.The CDC in April studied the pandemic’s effect on different ages in the U.S. and reviewed preliminary research in China, where the coronavirus started. It said social distancing is important for children, too, for their own safety and that of others.“Whereas most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious COVID-19 illness resulting in hospitalization still occurs in this age group,” the CDC study says.In May, the CDC also warned doctors to be on the lookout for a rare but life-threatening inflammatory reaction in some children who’ve had the coronavirus. The condition had been reported in more than 100 children in New York and in some kids in several other states and in Europe, with some deaths.The agency’s current guidance for communities on the reopening of K-12 schools says the goal is to “help protect students, teachers, administrators, and staff and slow the spread of COVID-19.” The guidance says “full sized, in person classes” present the “highest risk” of spreading the virus and advises face masks, spreading out of desks, staggered schedules, eating meals in classrooms instead of the cafeteria and “staying home when appropriate” to help avert spikes in virus cases.___VIRUSTRUMP: “Deaths in the U.S. are way down.” — tweet on July 6, one of at least a half dozen heralding a drop in daily deaths from the virus.THE FACTS: It’s true that deaths dipped as infections spiked in many parts of the country. But deaths lag sickness. And now, the widely expected upturn in U.S. deaths has begun, driven by fatalities in states in the South and West, according to data analyzed by The Associated Press.“It’s a false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Tuesday. He advised Americans: “Don’t get yourself into false complacency.”The new AP analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University shows the seven-day rolling average for daily reported deaths in the U.S. increased to 664 on Friday from 578 two weeks ago, as deaths rose in more than half the states. That’s still well below the lethal numbers of April.“It’s consistently picking up,” said William Hanage, a Harvard University infectious diseases researcher. “And it’s picking up at the time you’d expect it to.”___TRUMP: “For the 1/100th time, the reason we show so many Cases, compared to other countries that haven’t done nearly as well as we have, is that our TESTING is much bigger and better. We have tested 40,000,000 people. If we did 20,000,000 instead, Cases would be half, etc. NOT REPORTED!” — tweet Thursday.THE FACTS: His notion that infections are high only because the U.S. diagnostic testing has increased is false. His own top public health officials have shot down this line of thinking. Infections are rising because people are infecting each other more than they were when most everyone was hunkered down.It’s true that increased testing also contributes to the higher numbers. When you look harder, you’re going to see more. But the testing has uncovered a worrisome trend: The percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus is on the rise across nearly the entire country.That’s a clear demonstration that sickness is spreading and that the U.S. testing system is falling short.“A high rate of positive tests indicates a government is only testing the sickest patients who seek out medical attention and is not casting a wide enough net,” says the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center, a primary source of updated information on the pandemic.Americans are being confronted with long lines at testing sites, often disqualified if they are not showing symptoms and, if tested, forced to wait many days for results.___TRUMP on the coronavirus: “We have the lowest Mortality Rate in the World.” – tweet Tuesday.THE FACTS: This statement is wholly unsupported.An accurate death rate is impossible to know. Every country tests and counts people differently, and some are unreliable in reporting cases. Without knowing the true number of people who become infected, it cannot be determined what portion of them die.Using a count kept by Johns Hopkins University, you can compare the number of recorded deaths with the number of reported cases. That count shows the U.S. experiencing more deaths as a percentage of cases than most other countries now being hit hard with the pandemic. The statistics look better for the U.S. when the list is expanded to include European countries that were slammed early on by the virus but now appear to have it under control. Even then, the U.S. is not shown to be among the best in avoiding death.Such calculations, though, do not provide a reliable measurement of actual death rates, because of the variations in testing and reporting, and the Johns Hopkins tally is not meant to be such a measure.The only way to tell how many cases have gone uncounted, and therefore what percentage of infected people have died from the disease, is to do another kind of test comprehensively, of people’s blood, to find how many people bear immune system antibodies to the virus. Globally, that is only being done in select places.___ECONOMYTRUMP: “Job growth is biggest in history.” — tweet Wednesday.THE FACTS: Yes, but only because it is following the greatest job losses in history, by far.The U.S. economy shed more than 22 million jobs in March and April, wiping out nearly a decade of job growth in just two months, as the viral outbreak intensified and nearly all states shut down nonessential businesses. Since then, 7.5 million, or about one-third, of those jobs have been recovered as businesses reopened. Even after those gains, the unemployment rate is 11.1%, down from April and May but otherwise higher than at any point since the Depression.___TRUMP: “Economy and Jobs are growing MUCH faster than anyone (except me!) expected.” — tweet Wednesday.THE FACTS: Not really. It’s true that May’s gain of 2.7 million jobs was unexpected. Economists had forecast another month of job losses. But most economists projected hiring would sharply rebound by June or at the latest July, once businesses began to reopen. The gains kicked in a month earlier than forecast.Now, though, coronavirus cases are rising in most states, imperiling the climb back. In six states representing one-third of the economy — Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, and Texas — governors are reversing their reopening plans, and the restart is on pause in 15 other states. Such reversals are keeping layoffs elevated and threatening to weaken hiring.___TRUMP TEAM ON BIDENTRUMP campaign ad, playing out a scenario where a person needing help calls the police in a Biden presidency and gets a voice recording: “You have reached the 911 police emergency line. Due to defunding of the police department, we’re sorry but no one is here to take your call.” The ad closes with the message: “You won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.”THE FACTS: Biden has not joined the call of protesters who demanded “defund the police” after Floyd’s killing. He’s proposed more money for police, conditioned to improvements in their practices.“I don’t support defunding the police,“ Biden said last month in a CBS interview. But he said he would support tying federal aid to police based on whether “they meet certain basic standards of decency, honorableness and, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community, everybody in the community.”Biden’s criminal justice agenda, released long before he became the Democrats’ presumptive presidential nominee, proposes more federal money for “training that is needed to avert tragic, unjustifiable deaths” and hiring more officers to ensure that departments are racially and ethnically reflective of the populations they serve.Specifically, he calls for a $300 million infusion into existing federal community policing grant programs.That adds up to more money for police, not defunding law enforcement.Biden also wants the federal government to spend more on education, social services and struggling areas of cities and rural America, to address root causes of crime.Democrats, meanwhile, have pointed to Trump’s repeated proposals in the administration’s budget to cut community policing and mediation programs at the Justice Department. Congressional Republicans say the program can be effectively merged with other divisions, but Democrats have repeatedly blocked the effort. The program has been used to help provide federal oversight of local police departments.Despite proposed cuts, Attorney General William Barr last month said that the department would use the COPS program funding to hire over 2,700 police officers at nearly 600 departments across the country.___VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Biden “said that he would, quote, absolutely cut funding for law enforcement.” — remarks Thursday in Philadelphia.REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE email: “In the wake of rioting, looting, and tragic murders ripping apart communities across the country, Joe Biden said ‘Yes, absolutely’ he wants to defund the police.” — email Wednesday from Steve Guest, RNC’s rapid response director.THE FACTS: That’s misleading, a selective use of Biden’s words on the subject.The RNC email links to an excerpted video clip of Biden’s conversation with liberal activist Ady Barkan, who endorsed Biden on Wednesday after supporting Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primaries. A full recording of that conversation, provided by the Biden campaign to The Associated Press, shows he again declined to support defunding police.Barkan raises the issue of police reform and asks whether Biden would funnel money into social services, mental health counseling and affordable housing to help reduce civilian interactions with police.Biden responds that he is calling for increased funding for mental health providers but “that’s not the same as getting rid of or defunding all the police” and that both approaches are needed, including more money for community police.Asked again by Barkan, “so we agree that we can redirect some of the funding,” Biden then answers “absolutely yes.”Biden then gives the caveat that he means “not just redirect” federal money potentially but “condition” it on police improvements.“If they don’t eliminate choke holds, they don’t get (federal) grants, if they don’t do the following, they don’t get any help,” Biden replied.“The vast majority of all police departments are funded by the locality, funded by the municipality, funded by the state,” he added. “It’s only the federal government comes in on top of that, and so it says you want help, you have to do the following reforms.”___BIDEN ON TRUMPBIDEN: “President Trump claimed to the American people that he was a wartime leader, but instead of taking responsibility, Trump has waved a white flag, revealing that he ordered the slowing of testing and having his administration tell Americans that they simply need to ‘live with it.’’ – statement Wednesday marking the rise in U.S. coronavirus infections to more than 3 million.THE FACTS: To be clear, the government did not slow testing on the orders of the president.Trump at first denied he was joking when he told a Tulsa, Oklahoma, rally on June 20 that he said “to my people, ‘Slow the testing down, please’“ because “they test and they test.” Days later he said he didn’t really mean it.In any event, a succession of his public-health officials testified to Congress that the president never asked them to slow testing and that they were doing all they could to increase it. But testing remains markedly insufficient.___Associated Press writers Mike Stobbe and Nicky Forster in New York and Lindsey Tanner in Chicago contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fact-check-donald-trump-team-s-false-comfort-on-schools-coronavirus/story-KeQdsZbz1Qa2nY9Y3IbmaP.html
13-07-2020||World||Time to make masks mandatory? It’s not just a US debate||Amid pervasive backsliding on social distancing, Britain and France are weighing whether to require people to wear masks in public places.Scientists say the two countries’ governments should have done so ever since they started easing lockdowns — like many other European nations did – instead of exposing their populations to the risk of infections from mass dance parties and summer vacationers who think there’s no longer anything to worry about.Whether to make masks mandatory isn’t just a matter of debate in the United States, where infection rates are still climbing fast.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged U.K. residents Monday to wear face coverings in shops and other tight indoor spaces — but stopped short of making it compulsory.Critics have accused Johnson’s government of failing to provide clarity on mask-wearing in the days since he began backtracking on its previous advice that suggested face covers were not necessary. After the prime minister then was photographed wearing one in a shop, government ministers appeared on TV urging personal choice in the mask issue.Meanwhile, France’s government said Monday it’s considering requiring masks in all indoor public places amid signs of a small rise in confirmed virus cases – and a big drop in public vigilance. French scientists have pushed for such a requirement in recent days as families crisscross the country for summer vacations, but the government has remained cautious.Local mayors have already started requiring masks, notably in the Mediterranean city of Nice, where images of thousands of people dancing at an outdoor DJ performance this weekend provoked nationwide concern.Elsewhere in Europe, where the virus curve largely flattened out months ago, most governments made masks mandatory as soon as they started reopening their economies, requiring their use in shops and other indoor public spaces and on public transportation. Some nations have imposed mask requirements as new outbreaks emerged in recent days or weeks.Britain and France, which have reported some of the world’s highest numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths, took a more relaxed attitude, recommending masks but not requiring them.At least until now.“As the virus comes down in incidence and we have more and more success, I think face coverings are a kind of extra insurance we can all use to stop it coming back and stop it getting out of control again,’’ Johnson said. “To be absolutely clear, I do think that face coverings do have a real value in confined spaces and I do think the public understands that.”Mask requirements could help the government get the country back on track from the severe downturn — in March and April alone, the U.K. economy shrank 25%. Many economists think unemployment could more than double to over 3 million this year, levels last seen in the 1980s.Speaking with reporters during a visit to the London Ambulance Service, Johnson said people “should start to think about getting back to work” if their employers have made their workplaces safe against the coronavirus.Pressed on whether masks should be mandatory, Johnson replied, “We will be looking at the guidance. We will be saying a little bit more in the next few days.”In France, restaurants, schools and many businesses reopened weeks ago. While mask use and social distancing were relatively widespread during the country’s strict home confinement period and initially after it ended, many French people have since returned to the old normal — forgoing masks, resuming cheek-kissing and gathering in crowded cafes.While scientists were divided on mask use early in the pandemic, new knowledge about the virus has changed that.“A number of new studies and systematic reviews have persuaded most researchers and public health officials that they should be worn, including those who were skeptical a few months ago. Growing evidence on potential airborne transmission of the virus adds to the case for face coverings,” University of Edinburgh public health professor Linda Bauld said. “Suggesting it is ‘good manners’ to wear one is insufficient.”In the streets of Paris, many — but not all — welcomed the idea of requiring masks.The French government “should’ve made it mandatory indoors right away” like in neighboring Spain and Italy, said 50-year-old Paulo Lorenzo, who says he usually wears a mask when he leaves the house. “Now it’s going to be a bit complicated.”However, Tiago Rodriguez, 23, thinks wearing a mask should be a personal choice. “We shouldn’t be forced to wear something if we don’t feel comfortable with it or if we have trouble breathing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-to-make-masks-mandatory-it-s-not-just-a-us-debate/story-moStVAI5z2U5X2vTEPtq8H.html
13-07-2020||World||Pandemic could push tens of millions into chronic hunger: UN Report||The United Nations says the ranks of the world’s hungry grew by 10 million last year and warns that the coronavirus pandemic could push as many as 130 million more people into chronic hunger this year.The grim assessment was contained in the latest edition of the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, an annual report which was released on Monday by the five UN agencies that produced it.Preliminary projections based on available global economic outlooks suggest the pandemic “may add an additional 83 (million) to 132 million people to the ranks of the undernourished in 2020,’’ the report said.Also compounding the situation is what the report’s authors described as “unprecedented Desert Locust outbreaks” in Eastern Africa.The UN agencies estimated that nearly 690 million people, or nearly 9% of the world’s population, went hungry last year, an increase of 10 million since 2018 and of nearly 60 million since 2014.The report noted that after steadily declining for decades, chronic hunger “slowly began to rise in 2014 and continues to do so.”In terms of sheer numbers, Asia is home to the greatest number of undernourished people, an estimated 381 million, the report said. Africa has the most as a percentage of the population, UN researchers found, with nearly 20% of the continent’s people undernourished. That compares to 8.3% in Asia and 7.4% in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the report.With progress in fighting hunger stalled even before the pandemic, the report’s authors said that Covid-19 “is intensifying the vulnerabilities and inadequacies of global food systems’’ - defined in the report as all the activities and processes affecting the production, distribution and consumption of food.The UN agencies said a “staggering” 3 billion people or more can’t afford to acquire the food needed for a healthy diet.More most be done, including “ensuring all people’s access not only to food, but to nutritious foods that make up a healthy diet,” they said.As a result of the pandemic, food supply disruptions, lost livelihoods and the inability of people working abroad to send remittances home to their families mean it is “even more difficult for the poorer and vulnerable populations to have access to healthy diets,’’ the UN agencies concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-could-push-tens-of-millions-into-chronic-hunger-un-report/story-QbTMqrxX4tfmR0IWgt4gtM.html
13-07-2020||World||Journalists’ role crucial in Covid-19 pandemic: UK||The police, law officers, ministers, editors and journalists unions came together in the UK for the first meeting on Monday of a new committee to make sure journalists can operate without fear of violence or abuse, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic. Officials said that recent events in the UK such as attacks on journalists reporting on protests and threats to members of the press in Northern Ireland have exposed the fact that those who play an important role in the democratic process are not always safe.The committee, called the National Committee for the Safety of Journalists, brings together representatives from government, journalism, policing, prosecution services and the civil service to work in collaboration to make sure that journalists are free from threats and violence.Minister for media and data John Whittingdale said: “The UK has been at the forefront of the global campaign for media freedom but it is also essential that we protect the safety of journalists at home”.“The rise in misinformation during the pandemic has highlighted once again the valuable role played by journalists working for reputable news organisations who produce accurate and balanced high-quality journalism. We must do all we can to ensure that they can carry this out free from threats and intimidation,” he said.Members of the committee include representatives of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, Crown Prosecution Service, Reporters without Borders, Society of Editors, the BBC’s head of Newsgathering, National Union of Journalists (NUJ), and campaign group Index on Censorship.Observers of the committee’s process include UNESCO, BBC World Service, International Federation of Journalists and the Committee to Protect Journalists.Michelle Stanistreet, NUJ general secretary, said: “Attacks on journalists are on the rise in the UK and around the globe. Increasingly the press is harassed and singled out for attack while doing their job”.“Unfettered journalism is a vital part of our democracy and the NUJ looks forward to working with the committee to protect a free media and end the impunity of crimes against journalists.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/journalists-role-crucial-in-covid-19-pandemic-uk/story-3eNoALjZFZ1eDWtpKSSIaM.html
13-07-2020||World||World hunger worsening amid coronavirus pandemic; nearly 690 million people hungry: UN report||Nearly one in nine people in the world are going hungry, with the coronavirus pandemic exacerbating already worsening trends this year, according to a United Nations report published Monday.Economic slowdowns and climate-related shocks are pushing more people into hunger, while nutritious foods remain too expensive for many, contributing not only to undernourishment, but to growing rates of obesity in adults and children.“After decades of long decline, the number of people suffering from hunger has been slowly increasing since 2014,” read The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World annual report.Beyond ensuring enough food, food must be nutritious, the study underlined, citing costly “health and environmental consequences” of sub-par diets. Nearly 690 million people, or 8.9 percent of people around the globe, are hungry, the UN found. That number rose by 10 million people in just one year to 2019, and by 60 million in the past five years, found the study, which said eradicating hunger by 2030 - a goal set five years ago - will be impossible if trends continue.By 2030, over 890 million people could be affected by hunger, or 9.8 percent of the world’s population, it estimated. Five United Nations agencies co-authored the report: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Last year, the report estimated over 820 million hungry, but estimates were recalculated following revised data from China for prior years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-hunger-worsening-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-nearly-690-million-people-hungry-un-report/story-cthWjYMJgrKPAMiT40eWaO.html
13-07-2020||World||Taliban kill 11 in assault on Afghan intelligence compound||Taliban insurgents launched a complex attack on an intelligence compound in northern Afghanistan on Monday that began with a suicide bombing and killed at least 11 intelligence agency personnel, officials said.The attack took place in Aybak, the capital of the Samangan province. Sediq Azizi, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said another 63 people were wounded in the attack and the ensuing clashes.A suicide bomber struck the compound, followed by two insurgents who opened fire. Both were killed in the gunbattle, Azizi said. The blast from the initial bombing could be heard miles (kilometers) away and damaged several nearby buildings.Abdul Khalil Musadiq, a provincial hospital chief, said many of those wounded were civilians, including children.The Taliban claimed the attack. The insurgents have continued to regularly target Afghan security forces despite signing a peace agreement with the U.S. in February that was intended to pave the way for an end to decades of war.On Sunday, the Taliban attacked checkpoints in the northern Kunduz province, killing at least 14 Afghan security forces, according to Esmatullah Muradi, a spokesman for the provincial governor.The Taliban said they were behind the attacks but claimed government forces fired mortar shells in response, hitting civilian homes — a claimed dismissed by the Defense Ministry.The Taliban and government forces have been trading blame over a recent surge in violence across Afghanistan — even as efforts continue to try and bring about the start of direct peace talks between the government and the insurgents.President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack in Samangan and accused the Taliban of trying to strengthen their hand ahead of any negotiations.The Taliban accuse government forces of targeting them in their homes, with their families bearing the brunt of those operations.

13-07-2020||World||Coronavirus in 2 foreign arrivals raises alarm in Thailand||Health authorities in Thailand are seeking to trace the contacts of two recent foreign arrivals in the country who were infected with the coronavirus and may have violated quarantine rules.The two cases, an Egyptian military officer and the 9-year-old child of a diplomat from Africa, surfaced as Thailand marked seven weeks with no local transmissions of the coronavirus. With few foreigners allowed to legally enter the country, all other recent cases have involved Thai nationals repatriated from abroad.That recently arrived foreigners were cleared for entry despite testing and quarantine procedures meant to keep them isolated has caused concern as Thailand considers how and when to reopen on a larger scale to foreign tourists.The state Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration announced Monday that a member of an Egyptian military team that made stopovers last week at U-Tapao airport in eastern Thailand tested positive for the disease.The Egyptian group arrived in Thailand via the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan on the night of July 8 and flew to Chengdu in China and back on July 9.They were tested for coronavirus on July 10 and that same day members of the group visited several public locations, including a mall, in Rayong, the province where U-Tapao airport is located.By the time the results of the infected man’s test were processed on July 11, the Egyptian team had departed for home.Thai health authorities said they are tracing any contacts the Egyptian might have had during the visit, but have not announced any specific locations. The Bangkok Post newspaper reported that Rayong’s governor has ordered the floors of the hotel where the Egyptian delegation stayed to be sealed, and two hotel staff who delivered room service to them to be quarantined.The announcement of the case drew criticism on social media, both for the apparent laxity in enforcing isolation rules, and for failing to let the public know where the infected Egyptian visitor may have been.The announcement of the Egyptian case came after the daughter of a foreign diplomat who came with her family from Sudan tested positive for the coronavirus. The family left Sudan on July 7 and reportedly tested negative on arrival in Bangkok, but she was retested after showing symptoms and then tested positive.The family had been staying in a condominium in Bangkok where health authorities will now investigate any possible spread of the disease. Diplomats, unlike ordinary foreigners entering Thailand, do not have to stay at state quarantine facilities, but the rules guiding their quarantine condition are not detailed.Thailand in early April banned scheduled passenger flights from abroad, but last week began allowing in foreign visitors on a controlled basis, limiting entry to those with existing family or work ties to the country, students, technical experts for businesses, investors and specially invited VIPs.The number of foreign visitors allowed into the country each day is limited to 200, and they are supposed to travel on repatriation flights bringing Thai citizens home. All returnees, foreign and Thai, are subject to varying degrees of quarantine.Thailand has had 3,220 cases of the coronavirus, including 58 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-in-2-foreign-arrivals-raises-alarm-in-thailand/story-OAcHIUhijjOL47qLKDD6XI.html
13-07-2020||World||Italian banks most exposed to coronavirus-hit sectors, risking capital||Italian banks have the highest portion of loans to industries suffering the most from the coronavirus pandemic, making their capital buffers more vulnerable to any deterioration in asset quality.Credito Emiliano SpA, Banco BPM SpA, BPER Banca SpA and Unione di Banche Italiane SpA top the list of more than 100 European banks exposed to industries badly hurt by the crisis, according to a research conducted by Eric Dor, director of economic studies at the IESEG School of Management in Lille, France.“Loans to depressed sectors by several Italian banks are more than four times larger than their CET1 equity, so their capital would be wiped out if 25% of their loans default,” Dor said in a phone interview. The sectors suffering the most are wholesale and retail trade, construction, manufacturing, accommodation and food service, as well as transportation and storage, according to the research.A 10% depreciation of the loans to the vulnerable sectors would hit capital ratios very hard at Credito Emiliano, Banco BPM, BPER, and UBI, according to the research, which cites data from the European Banking Authority.RCI in France, Bankinter SA in Spain, Piraeus Bank SA, Eurobank SA and Alpha Bank AE in Greece and Hamburg Commercial Bank in Germany are the most exposed in their respective countries.While some of the banks are protected by fairly high capital levels, some have a much smaller margin of error. Those include Credito Emiliano, Banco BPM, BPER Banca, Bankinter and Piraeus Bank, according to the research.“Some banks may need to be recapitalized in such a scenario, but I think this is a manageable situation, because most of the largest lenders are well capitalized after the cleanups of recent years, and are able to face a big increase of loan loss provisions,” Dor said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italian-banks-most-exposed-to-coronavirus-hit-sectors-risking-capital/story-gJQft3ixXLt3qM1FFhGLIK.html

13-07-2020||World||China buying ‘practically zero’ Chilean salmon after Covid scare||Chinese demand for Chilean salmon is “practically zero” after Beijing raised concerns about Covid-19 risks in imported seafood, according to industry group Salmon Chile.Even though Chinese officials indicated there were no official restrictions on Chilean salmon, consumers in the Asian nation remain wary after authorities initially traced an outbreak of the virus to a chopping board used by a seller of imported fish.Those fears are set to grow after the detection this week of Covid-19 in Ecuadorian shrimp, Salmon Chile President Arturo Clement said. Most authorities and health experts say there’s no evidence that food can transmit the virus.“There has been a psychosis with the issue, therefore Chinese demand went to zero and hasn’t recovered,” he said in an interview Friday. “There’s confusion in the market, which causes people to stop consuming seafood.”Some shipments that Chilean producers had already sent to China are stuck there, while others were redirected to other markets. China typically buys about 40,000 tons of Chilean salmon a year, making it the South American country’s fifth largest customer, trailing the U.S., Japan, Brazil and Russia.Brazilian and Russian demand for Chilean salmon has also dropped in the pandemic, with prices sinking and producers facing losses, he said. U.S. demand is the one saving grace.“In the end, the only open market we have is the U.S., which is far bigger, but that has put enormous pressure” on prices, he said.Today, Chilean salmon farms are operating at 90% capacity after implementing a series of Covid-19 protocols. Still, volume in the first half of the year was 4% higher than the same period last year, Clement said. Chile is the second-largest producer of farmed salmon. Norway is the biggest.For Chilean producers, the second quarter was grim, with a 40% drop in prices signaling losses for all operators, he said. Fortunately, the industry is coming out of three or four good years, meaning farms are well positioned to absorb the blow, with a recent uptick in prices helping, Clement said.The Chilean salmon industry, which employs tens of thousands of people, has managed to keep Covid-19 cases to just two in farming centers and three at processing plants partly because it was already using masks, gloves and special clothing before the pandemic, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-buying-practically-zero-chilean-salmon-after-covid-scare/story-w3hMk7iPddqv1WSA0CoyOO.html
13-07-2020||World||China sanctions US officials including senators Cruz, Rubio over Xinjiang issue||China on Monday announced tit-for-tat sanctions against four US officials including senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio after Washington imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials over the treatment of the Uyghur community in the northwestern province of Xinjiang.“China has decided to impose sanctions on four US officials and an institution who have acted viciously on issues related to Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) as a reciprocal measure against relevant moves made earlier by the US,” foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said Monday.The spokesperson said the sanctions are against senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, US Representative Chris Smith, Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback and the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China.Tenuous at the best of times, ties between the US and China have been frayed with the two countries at loggerheads, most recently over the origins of the coronavirus. The other contentious issues between Washignton and Beijing include an ongoing trade war, Taiwan, the South China Sea – where Washington has dispatched two of its super aircraft carriers, the status of Hong Kong, the tit-for-tat visa restrictions over Tibet and the human rights situation in the remote northwestern province of Xinjiang.Rubio and Cruz, both from President Donald Trump-led Republican Party, have sponsored legislation that would punish China’s actions in Xinjiang while Smith has been a vocal critic of China on issues ranging from Xinjiang to the coronavirus.“The US actions seriously interfere in China’s internal affairs, seriously violate the basic norms of international relations and seriously damage Sino-U.S. relations,” Hua said at the regular ministry briefing on Monday.“China will make further responses based on how the situation develops,” she said without elaborating.Last week, Washington said the sanctioned Chinese officials included Chen Quanguo, the Communist party secretary of Xinjiang, and Zhu Hailun, who helped oversee policy in the province.The US sanctions also target Wang Mingshan, head of the Xinjiang public security bureau, and Huo Liujun, a former head of the bureau.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sanctions-us-officials-including-senators-cruz-rubio-over-xinjiang-issue/story-TOuUu79aKrEKsNVBUUKUpN.html
13-07-2020||World||New uniform, easier UK visa norms from January 1: Priti Patel||A new points-based immigration system that treats EU and non-EU citizens alike and creates new routes for talent and healthcare professionals to come and work in the UK was confirmed in a ministerial statement by home secretary Priti Patel on Monday.The system will take effect from January 1, a day after the Brexit transition period ends on December 31. The statement confirms post-Brexit plans announced earlier by the Boris Johnson government, many of which are likely to be welcomed by Indian professionals.Chair of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) UK India Business Forum, Jim Bligh said: “Indian businesses welcome the UK’s new points-based immigration. It’s positive that the UK is seeking to attract highly-skilled nationals from across the world, regardless of nationality”.“Across all sectors, Indian businesses bring in highly skilled nationals from around the world to help UK plc grow and compete. From high tech to haute cuisine, engineering to drug design, a smooth, skills-focused immigration system should help Indian companies across the economy to flourish in Britain in the years ahead”, he added.The immigration routes described by officials as “new, simplified”, include a new Health and Care Visa for key health professionals will make it easier and cheaper for health professionals to work in the UK; a new graduate route opening in Summer 2021 will allow international students to stay in the UK once they have successfully completed their studies: students who have completed undergraduate and master’s degrees will be able to stay for two years and those who have completed PhD can stay for three years; and the Global Talent Scheme will allow highly-skilled scientists and researchers to come to the UK without a job offer.Patel said: “The British people voted to take back control of our borders and introduce a new points-based immigration system. Now we have left the EU, we are free to unleash this country’s full potential and implement the changes we need to restore trust in the immigration system and deliver a new fairer, firmer, skills-led system from January 1, 2021”.“Britain is open for business and ready to welcome the best and brightest global talent”, she added.The details announced by the Home Office are expected to give British employers the time to prepare and the new immigration system will be implemented in phases to ensure smooth delivery.The new system will require those applying via the skilled worker route to accrue points by meeting a number of relevant criteria, such as have a job offer at the appropriate skill level, the ability to speak English and meeting the salary threshold.The system will also expand the skills threshold. An applicant’s job must be at the minimum skill level of A-level or equivalent, rather than degree level under the current system. This will provide greater flexibility and ensure UK business has access to a wide pool of skilled workers, officials added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-uniform-easier-uk-visa-norms-from-january-1-priti-patel/story-KkLrFXQJB2SmyAHj5XncPN.html
13-07-2020||World||In Egypt, volunteers make meals with love for coronavirus patients||Fatma Youssef stuffs rice, chicken or meat and vegetables into boxes spread on her dining table -- tens of them in the last few weeks. On some, she scribbles “Be well” in Arabic; on others, she writes “Together, we will get through this.”Youssef doesn’t know who will eat her food. Still, she says, she cooks it with love -- and purpose.She and other volunteers in Egypt hope the meals will help nurse quarantined coronavirus patients back to health and provide them with some respite. In different neighborhoods in Cairo and some other cities, they’ve enlisted to cook, donate food or make contactless deliveries to patients’ homes.“Good things come out of crises all the time,” said Youssef, 27. “I didn’t expect that there would be people who would drop everything to help others they don’t know, haven’t met and will not meet.”The effort took off in early June after Basma Mostafa, a 30-year-old journalist, wrote on Facebook that she was thinking of cooking nutritious meals for patients. She asked if someone would be willing to help with expenses or delivery or to connect her with those who are sick. She did not expect much.Messages flooded her inbox. Friends and strangers offered to pitch in. So, she decided to create the meals initiative.“I am amazed,” Mostafa said. “The idea exploded quickly probably because people felt alone ... and found something that says, ‘no, you’re not alone.’”Today, about 1,500 volunteers take part in the program, and thousands more have asked to join, Mostafa said. Others have created similar efforts in their neighborhoods, she added.The personal touch is the handwritten messages of support. Some are scribbled on heart-shaped notes or embellished with drawings of smiley faces.“We are all with you,” reads one. “Speedy recovery,” says another. After one volunteer wrote, “made with love,” it has become a favorite slogan.Mostafa said she got the idea of helping out when she was going through a particularly difficult time. “I thought that to alleviate my suffering, I can engage with the suffering of others and feel more for them,” she said. “I derive my strength and perseverance from the patients.”In their Facebook group, organizers offer two options: one with different categories for those wanting to help, another to request meals. Boxes are offered to patients, rich or poor, who are living alone or with other sick and quarantined family members.When some patients ask to pay for their meals, organizers encourage them to pay it forward instead by donating supplies after they recover, Mostafa says.Mai Ezzat says she was skeptical a stranger would make the trip to her home to deliver meals.The 20-year-old lives with her parents and two brothers. They all went into quarantine after her father contracted the virus, she said, and others showed symptoms. No one was able to go out to buy food. A volunteer brought cooked meals, vegetables and fruits to the family’s doorstep.The gesture made her feel like “there’s still good out there” and offered a morale boost, she said.Radwa Shalash, one of the organizers, says she is moved when patients who have received meals call to say they recovered.“I have seen people who are willing to volunteer everything they’ve got, literally,” she said. “It made me feel like if something happened to me, if I ever needed something, I would find many people -- so many people.”__Fam reported from Winter Park, Florida.__Associated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through the Religion News Foundation.

13-07-2020||World||IMF says mideast loses $270B oil income amid coronavirus, recession||The Middle East’s energy producers are expected to earn $270 billion less in oil revenue compared to last year as the region’s economic heavyweight, Saudi Arabia, sinks deeper into recession amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to the International Monetary Fund’s outlook released Monday.The international lender expects an overall economic contraction of 7.3% in Mideast oil exporting countries this year due to hits from the coronavirus outbreak and oil market turmoil. The contraction is 2% greater than the IMF’s initial projections in mid-April.“We are in a year like no other and therefore developments are very fast and coping with them is challenging for everyone,” Jihad Azour, director of the IMF’s Middle East and Central Asia department, told The Associated Press.The IMF had projected in April that Saudi Arabia’s economy would contract by about 2.3% this year. It has since revised that figure downward, saying the kingdom stands to see economic growth shrink by 6.8% before climbing to around 3% growth next year.In addition to lower crude prices and cuts to production, Saudi Arabia stands to lose billions of dollars in revenue because the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca is suspended due to the pandemic. For the first time in Saudi history, the hajj pilgrimage this month, which drew 2.5 million people last year, will not include pilgrims from outside the kingdom.To raise state revenue, Saudi Arabia tripled taxes on basic goods and services this month, increasing value-added tax to 15%.While the IMF has for years been urging Gulf states to introduce tougher austerity measures, “we did not recommend the specific measure here” for Saudi Arabia, Azour said.He said the IMF’s overall recommendation now is that governments that can afford to do so should consider the risks of a second wave of coronavirus and introduce measures that shore up the economy and protect the livelihoods of people.Meanwhile, oil-importing Mideast countries, which include Egypt, Jordan and Sudan, are expected to see an overall economic contraction of 1.1%, nearly unchanged from the IMF’s April projections. The overall level of inflation in these countries, however, is expected to reach 10%.There are massive challenges across the region, including in Lebanon, where inflation has mushroomed to 56% over the past year and where the currency has lost nearly two-thirds of its value. The most current IMF forecast predicts a 12% economic contraction this year in the small Mediterranean country, which hosts large populations of Syrian and Palestinian refugees.The IMF has held more than a dozen meetings with Lebanese authorities over a $10 billion loan request. The IMF says it is still working to assess the country’s financial losses as different arms of the government offer diverging figures.Additionally, Iran is struggling to manage the outbreak of the virus there as officials refuse to impose lockdown measures that would further rattle its economy battered by U.S. sanctions. In a sign of just how dire the economic situation has become, Iran requested a $5 billion loan from the IMF this year — the first such request made by the country in nearly six decades.Azour said the IMF continues to look into Iran’s loan request, which the Trump administration has publicly opposed.“This (coronavirus) crisis highlighted the vulnerabilities that exist in the system,” Azour said, especially in countries where there are high levels of informal workers and youth unemployment.“We are calling for revamping social protection, improving access to social services, and also increasing the level of financial inclusion to help and support those who are vulnerable,” he said.Since the start of the year, the IMF has approved about $17 billion in emergency loans to countries in the Middle East and the wider region, including $5.2 billion for Egypt and nearly $1.4 billion for Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-says-mideast-loses-270b-oil-income-amid-coronavirus-recession/story-s9TbQzg9vihKUJ2ykb9mcP.html
13-07-2020||World||Vladimir Putin pushes back $400 billion development plan, blames Covid pandemic||Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to push back completion of an ambitious $400 billion investment and development program, blaming the economic havoc wreaked by the coronavirus epidemic.“I ask the government with the participation of the State Council to adjust the national projects within three months,” Putin said at a televised meeting Monday with ministers and officials. “We must proceed from their realities.”The projects that were meant to be completed by 2024 require adjustment because “we will have to work in conditions of stricter budget restrictions” due to the coronavirus, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin told Putin. “It is possible to extend the time frame for achieving the national goals that you mentioned today to 2030.”Putin made the national projects the centerpiece of his election program for his fourth term when he won a landslide in 2018. He overhauled the government at the start of this year, installing Mishustin in place of long-serving ally Dmitry Medvedev, partly out of disappointment at the pace of progress in implementing the spending program designed to boost Russia’s sluggish growth and raise living standards.The Covid-19 crisis and the slump in oil prices within weeks after the new government’s appointment, however, has blown his plans off course as Russia battles to overcome the worst recession in a decade following a national lockdown to curb the spread of the virus.Russia’s budget has swung from a surplus in 2019 to a deep deficit this year, while the government envisages spending 8.7 trillion rubles ($123 billion) on an economic recovery plan over the next two years.While it’s unclear for now how much of the program may be delayed beyond the original deadline, Putin risks seeking re-election in 2024 without having fulfilled his promises to voters, after the July 1 referendum endorsing constitutional changes that may allow him to rule for two more terms until 2036.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vladimir-putin-pushes-back-400-billion-development-plan-blames-covid-pandemic/story-jobYvtys9yo8Sd976l0feJ.html
13-07-2020||World||Ready or not: Election costs soar in prep for coronavirus voting||The demand for mail-in ballots is surging. Election workers need training. And polling booths might have to be outfitted with protective shields during the Covid-19 pandemic.As officials prepare for the November 3 election, one certainty is clear: It’s coming with a big price tag.“Election officials don’t have nearly the resources to make the preparations and changes they need to make to run an election in a pandemic,” said Wendy Weiser, head of the Brennan Center for Justice’s democracy program. “We are seeing this all over the place.”The pandemic has sent state and local officials scrambling to prepare for an election like few others, an extraordinary endeavor during a presidential contest, as virus cases rise across much of the U.S.Covid-related worries are bringing demands for steps to make sure elections just four months away are safe. But long-promised federal aid to help cash-starved states cope is stalled on Capitol Hill.The money would help pay for transforming the age-old voting process into a pandemic-ready system. Central to that is the costs for printing mail-in ballots and postage. There are also costs to ensure in-person voting is safe with personal protective equipment, or PPE, for poll workers, who tend to be older and more at risk of getting sick from the virus, and training for new workers. Pricey machines are needed to quickly count the vote.Complicating matters is President Donald Trump’s aversion to mail-in balloting. With worrisome regularity, he derides the process as rigged, even though there’s no evidence of fraud and his own reelection team is adapting to the new reality of widespread mail-in voting.“As cases of coronavirus in this country rise, it’s vital that all voters be able to cast their ballots from home, to cast their ballots by mail,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.A COVID response bill passed by the House in May contains $3.6 billion to help states with their elections, but the Senate won’t turn to the measure until late July. Republicans fought a $400 million installment of election aid this March before agreeing to it.But key Senate Republicans seem likely to support more election funding, despite Trump’s opposition, and are even offering to lower a requirement that states put up matching funds to qualify for the federal cash.“I’m prepared not only to look at more money for the states to use as they see fit for elections this year but also to even consider whatever kind of matching requirement we have,” said Roy Blunt, R-Mo., chairman of the Senate panel with responsibility for the issue. “We can continue to work toward an election that produces a result that people have confidence in and done in a way that everybody that wants to vote, gets to vote.”The pandemic erupted this spring in the middle of state primaries, forcing many officials to delay elections by days, weeks and even months. They dealt with poll worker cancellations, polling place changes and an explosion of absentee ballots.Voting rights groups are particularly concerned with the consolidations of polling places that contributed to long lines in Milwaukee, Atlanta and Las Vegas. They fear a repeat in November.As negotiations on the next Covid-19 relief bill begin on Capitol Hill, the final figure for elections is sure to end up much less than the $3.6 billion envisioned by the House. That figure followed Brennan Center recommendations to prepare for an influx of absentee ballots while providing more early voting options and protecting neighborhood polling places.Even before the pandemic, election offices typically work under tight budgets. Iowa Secretary of State Paul D. Pate, who’s president of the National Association of Secretaries of State, said the group has been calling on the federal government to provide a steady source of funds, particularly to help address ongoing costs of protecting the nation’s election systems from cyberthreats.For Georgia’s primary last month, election officials spent $8.1 million of the roughly $10.9 million the state has received in federal funds. The money was used to send absentee ballot applications to 6.9 million active registered voters and print absentee ballots for county election offices. Some of it also was used to purchase PPE and secure drop-off boxes for counties.Meanwhile, the state elections division has seen a $90,000 reduction for the current budget year as Georgia — like the rest of the nation — deals with a decline in revenues due to the pandemic.The state’s remaining federal funds will be used to help cover the costs of developing an online system for voters to request absentee ballots, less expensive than sending ballot applications to every voter, and exploring whether installing plexiglass dividers around voting machines could allow more voters in a polling place at one time.In Colorado, a universal vote-by-mail state, the Denver election office has had to reduce its budget by 7.5%, nearly $980,000. Jocelyn Bucaro, Denver’s elections director, said the federal funds sent this year helped with purchasing PPE and other pandemic-related supplies.Iowa similarly spent its federal dollars on mail-in ballots and pandemic supplies, Pate said.Vote-by-mail veterans and vendors of the equipment, software, ballots and envelopes that will be needed in November say the window to buy them is quickly closing.“Right now, what I’m seeing in most places is just this kind of indecision. What are we supposed to be planning? Vote by mail or in-person or combination?” said Jeff Ellington, president of Runbeck Election Services, which prints ballots and the special envelopes used to mail them and supplies high-volume envelope sorters.“Decisions just need to be made so people can start to put a plan into place,” he said.BlueCrest, a Pitney Bowes spinoff, sells high-volume sorting machines that handle up to 50,000 ballot envelopes per hour. That’s the kind of crunch big counties can expect to face Nov. 3 in states including Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where Rick Becerra, a vice president at the company, said he’s been talking to officials. The machines average $475,000 each.“I tell them the time is now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ready-or-not-election-costs-soar-in-prep-for-coronavirus-voting/story-EdfAGddY3mXQJ9uaHXo3VO.html
13-07-2020||World||Worst floods in years hit China, 33 rivers flowing at levels highest in history||China on Monday issued flood alerts for 433 rivers in the country as torrential rain continued to wreak havoc in eastern, central and southern provinces, killing at least 141, rendering millions homeless and further battering a shrunk economy trying to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.At least 141 persons are missing or dead, dozens in mudslides triggered by heavy rainfall and overflowing rivers. Nearly 28,000 homes have been damaged, news agency Associated Press reported. Water levels in at least 33 of the 433 rivers crisscrossing several provinces have broken decades-old records, triggering fears that the current deluge could mimic the massive floods of 1998, which killed more than 3000 people and ruined the livelihood of millionsThe central Chinese province of Hubei and its capital Wuhan -- where the coronavirus disease outbreak first emerged late last year and was put under the most severe lockdown in China -- has witnessed some of the worst flooding with the Yangtze river flowing above the danger mark in the province. The province faces particular threat due to presence of numerous lakes and rivers, adding to the worsening levels of flooding. President Xi Jinping was quoted by the state media as saying that the “flood control situation was grim”.Parts of Sichuan, Chongqing, Shaanxi, Hubei, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, the metropolis of Shanghai and Zhejiang are forecast to receive rainfall of 100 to 180 mm over the next three days, according to a statement on the website of the national meteorological centre (NMC).“Average rainfall reached 403 mm in the areas along the Yangtze river from June 1 to July 12, the highest level since 1961,” the official news agency, Xinhua reported on Monday.The direct economic loss until now has been calculated at 82.23 billion yuan or $11.76 billion, according to state media. Key tourist destinations in China’s south have sustained flood damage, compounding financial stress caused by the massive drop-off in numbers of visitors.The state-run tabloid, Global Times, headlined a report on the raging floods as “China faces flood catastrophe”.One of the worst hit provinces is eastern China’s Jiangxi province where authorities have implemented “war time” measures following the water level in the Poyang lake, the largest freshwater lake in the country, crossing the 22.5 metres or 74 feet-mark, for the first time since 1998.The water level in Taihu Lake, the country’s second-largest freshwater lake, has risen above the alert level for 15 consecutive days.China’s ministry of water resources (MWR) has raised the emergency response to flood control to Level 11, the second highest in the system.Hubei has raised the flood alert level to the highest.The emergency management ministry (EMM) was quoted by state media as saying on Monday that a total of 37.89 million people in 27 provincial-level regions were affected, 141 people were killed or missing and 28,000 houses have collapsed.A total of 2.25 million emergency evacuations have been made, the ministry said.In a statement released to the state media, Xi has said the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and armed police troops stationed in flood-hit regions should actively participate in the rescue and relief work.China has entered the critical period for flood control, Xi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worst-floods-in-years-hit-china-33-rivers-flowing-at-levels-highest-in-history/story-Z7T4iaSqMkx6750jojHYjK.html
13-07-2020||World||‘Tax us substantially’: Over 80 global millionaires’ solution for tackling Covid-19||Stating that humanity is more important than money, over 80 millionaires on Monday called on governments to impose taxes on them substantially to raise funds to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, since charity alone will not resolve the problem.The millionaires, mostly based in the United States and the United Kingdom, say in the open letter that raising the taxes will adequately fund health systems, schools, and security through a permanent tax increase on the wealthiest people on the planet, ‘people like us’.They say: “No, we are not the ones caring for the sick in intensive care wards. We are not driving the ambulances that will bring the ill to hospitals. We are not restocking grocery store shelves or delivering food door to door”.“But we do have money, lots of it. Money that is desperately needed now and will continue to be needed in the years ahead, as our world recovers from this crisis. Today, we, the undersigned millionaires, ask our governments to raise taxes on people like us. Immediately. Substantially. Permanently”.The signatories include Abigail Disney, Tim Disney and Mary Ford.Labour leader Keir Starmer has asked the Boris Johnson government to consider imposing wealth tax: “We are saying to the government, look at the idea of a wealth tax, we certainly support the principle that those with the broadest shoulders should bear the greatest burden.”The letter goes on to say: “The impact of this crisis will last for decades. It could push half a billion more people into poverty. Hundreds of millions of people will lose their jobs as businesses close, some permanently”.“Already, there are nearly a billion children out of school, many with no access to the resources they need to continue their learning. And of course the absence of hospital beds, protective masks, and ventilators is a painful, daily reminder of the inadequate investment made in public health systems across the world”.The millionaires say that a huge debt is owed to the people working on the frontlines of the global battle, adding that most essential workers are grossly underpaid for the burden they carry.“Our interconnectedness has never been more clear. We must rebalance our world before it is too late. There will not be another chance to get this right. Unlike tens of millions of people around the world, we do not have to worry about losing our jobs, our homes, or our ability to support our families. We are not fighting on the frontlines of this emergency and we are much less likely to be its victims”.“So please. Tax us. Tax us. Tax us. It is the right choice. It is the only choice. Humanity is more important than our money”, the letter adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tax-us-substantially-over-80-global-millionaires-solution-for-tackling-covid-19/story-HW9Qwuzh9i1nbFpr3SSYwI.html

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.The officials said there were casualties but they could not provide the number of fatalities as the fighting was still underway. A provincial hospital chief, Abdul Khalil Musadiq, said at least 43 wounded — mostly civilians, including children — were taken to hospitals in the area.Mohammad Hashim Sarwari, deputy chief for the provincial council, said the bomber targeted the intelligence service department in the provincial capital of Aybak. He said the blast was so strong it was heard miles away and damaged buildings and homes within a wide radius.Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said the Taliban — who are active in the province and have recently stepped up attacks there — were behind the bombing.Samangan also has seen clashes between rival warlords in the area and some Islamic militants, mostly Uzbeks affiliated more with the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.On Sunday, the Taliban attacked checkpoints in northern Kunduz province, killing at least 14 members of the Afghan security forces, according to Esmatullah Muradi, a spokesman for the provincial governor.In Imam Sahib district, the Taliban killed eight policemen, while in the Chardara district they gunned down three soldiers and three pro-government fighters, he said. Reinforcement were sent late on Sunday and fighting continued until Monday morning.The Taliban said they were behind the attacks but claimed that government forces fired mortars in response, hitting civilian homes — a claimed that was dismissed by the Ministry of Defense.The Taliban and government forces have been trading blame over a recent surge in attacks across Afghanistan — even as efforts continue to try and bring about the start of direct peace talks between Kabul and the insurgents.The Taliban accuses government forces of targeting them in their homes, with their families bearing the brunt of those operations. Kabul, meanwhile, has accuse the Taliban of stepping up attacks against both civilians and the security forces.___Associated Press writer Tameem Akhgar in Kabul, Afghanistan, contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suicide-car-bombing-in-north-afghanistan-causes-casualties/story-EbK4tOcBD3RnERa62aCQ4O.html

Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying disclosed what she called “corresponding sanctions” against US Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, US Representative Chris Smith, Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback and the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.The commission monitors human rights and the development of the rule of law in China and submits an annual report to President Donald Trump and Congress. “The US actions seriously interfere in China’s internal affairs, seriously violate the basic norms of international relations and seriously damage Sino-US relations,” she told reporters during a daily briefing. “China will make further responses based on how the situation develops.” Hua did not elaborate on what the sanctions entail, but Washington’s measures against Chinese officials, including the Communist Party secretary of the troubled western region of Xinjiang, include freezing of US assets, US travel and prohibiting Americans from doing business with them.UN experts and activists say at least a million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims are held in detention centres in Xinjiang. China describes them as training centres helping to stamp out terrorism and extremism and give people new skills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-trades-sanctions-with-us-over-uighur-muslims/story-83uo8yihTAFwCRxDmC2nrJ.html

Preliminary results of the trial are expected to be released by the end of September, the university said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-pub-cluster-adds-to-second-wave-coronavirus-fears/story-rKy4nMf6u54Xp11KxuubKJ.html

Glenmark Pharmaceuticals had launched FabiFlu last month at a price of Rs 103 per tablet.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage In a regulatory filing Glenmark announced a price reduction of 27 per cent for FabiFlu. The new maximum retail price (MRP) is Rs 75 per tab, it said. “The price reduction has been made possible through benefits gained from higher yields and better scale, as both the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and formulations are made at Glenmark’s facilities in India, the benefits of which are being passed on to patients in the country,” the filing said. “Our internal research shows us that we launched FabiFlu in India at the lowest market cost as compared to the cost of Favipiravir in other countries where it is approved. And now we hope that this further price reduction will make it even more accessible for patients across the country,” Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Senior Vice President and Head – India business Alok Malik said. Further, the company has commenced a post marketing surveillance (PMS) study on FabiFlu to closely monitor the efficacy and safety of the drug in 1,000 patients that are prescribed with the oral antiviral, as part of an open label, multicenter, single arm study, the filing added. “We expect this post marketing surveillance study to shed more light on the drug’s clinical effectiveness and safety in a large cohort of patients prescribed FabiFlu,” Malik added. On June 20, Glenmark announced that it received manufacturing and marketing approval from India’s drug regulator for FabiFlu, making it the first oral Favipiravir-approved medication in India for the treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19. Glenmark has also completed the phase 3 clinical trial with Favipiravir (FabiFlu) in mild to moderate Covid-19 patients in India. The trial results will be available shortly, the company said. Glenmark is also conducting another phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of two antivirals drugs Favipiravir and Umifenovir as a combination therapy in moderate hospitalised adult Covid-19 patients in India. Shares of Glenmark Pharma were trading 1.34 per cent lower at Rs 421.00 apiece on BSE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/glenmark-pharma-cuts-price-of-covid-19-drug-by-27-percent-to-rs-75-per-tablet/story-qwttX4EOcz3FrWBHSYkIsJ.html

The province’s capital Wuhan was the epicenter of China’s virus outbreak, which appears to have largely been contained.The floodwaters have inundated towns across southern and central China and prompted emergency workers to shore-up embankments and dig channels to release overflow. Flood surges on 433 rivers have exceeded the warning level and 33 of them hit record highs, Zheng said. Apart from the Yangtze, other major rivers systems and lakes have been rising, including the Yellow River in the North, the Zhujiang in the south and Taihu, China’s largest freshwater lake just west of Shanghai.Flooding in some areas last week forced the rescheduling of portions of the crucial four-day national college entrance exams that had already been delayed for a month because of the coronavirus outbreak.Key tourist destinations in China’s south have sustained flood damage that is compounding financial stress caused by the massive drop-off in numbers of visitors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-141-dead-or-missing-in-flooding-since-june/story-TK0YkMeZkPewTzQtQlvyAM.html

About half were concerned about the city’s status as a global finance centre and the erosion of the high degree of autonomy it was promised 23 years ago.Other major concerns cited were data security, talent drain and retaliatory measures by other governments. The prospect of extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party, was considered a “game changer” by about 46%, with 17% saying it wasn’t.About 49% said the law would have a negative impact on their business, while some 13% said it would have a positive impact. Some 30% considered moving capital, assets or business out of Hong Kong in the medium-to-long term, while 5% said they consider doing so in the short-term.More than half of the respondents said they felt less safe about living and working in Hong Kong. Also about half said they personally considered leaving the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/majority-of-us-firms-in-hong-kong-concerned-about-security-law-says-report/story-DM56l4coj6nf2HOV1oMaaM.html

Italy has recorded 34,954 deaths and 243,061 cases. Mexico trails the United States, Brazil and the UK in total deaths.While Italy appears to have tamed the virus, the pandemic is showing few signs of easing in Mexico, where the government has faced criticism for reopening its economy too soon.Lopez Obrador said he was briefed on the pandemic this past week and was optimistic.“The report is positive, good. The conclusion is that the pandemic is going down, that it is losing intensity,” he said in a video message.Lopez Obrador also backed Hugo Lopez-Gatell, Mexico’s deputy health minister and coronavirus czar, after criticism of his handling of the crisis. Lopez-Gatell has kept revising his projections for total fatalities and as recently as June forecast up to 35,000 deaths through October. In early May, the estimate was 6,000.The coronavirus death toll per million residents in Mexico, whose population numbers about 120 million, is the 16th highest in the world, according to data by research firm Statista.But Mexican officials say the true toll is likely much higher due to limited testing. A Reuters analysis of funeral-home data in May indicated a toll more than double the reported figures.Several former officials have criticised Lopez Obrador’s administration for its management of the epidemic.Former Health Minister Salomon Chertorivski, who held the post from 2011 to 2012, said on Thursday the government had reopened the economy before meeting globally established criteria for doing so. He added that Mexico might need to impose a new lockdown.“There are three fundamental variables: a reduction in the last 14 days in the numbers of contagions, reduction in recent days in the number of deaths, and reduction in the number of hospitalized people,” Chertorivski told Mexican newspaper Reforma. “None of those three parameters were achieved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-surpasses-italy-to-post-world-s-fourth-highest-coronavirus-death-toll/story-gvpC9dXZZKUTqBR5bTXW9J.html

He didn’t provide additional details.Previously, officials said at least one person was treated for smoke inhalation.The cause of the fire was under investigation. It wasn’t immediately known where on the 840-foot (255-meter) amphibious assault vessel the blast and the fire occurred.The flames sent up a huge plume of dark smoke visible around San Diego.San Diego is the Bonhomme Richard’s home port, and the ship was undergoing routine maintenance at the time of the fire.About 160 sailors and officers were on board, Raney said — far fewer than the thousand typically on the ship when it’s on active duty.All crew members were accounted for, said Admiral Mike Gilday, Chief of Naval Operations.“We are grateful for the quick and immediate response of local, base, and shipboard firefighters aboard USS Bonhomme Richard,” Gilday said in a statement.The 23-year-old ship has the capacity to deploy and land helicopters, smaller boats and amphibious vehicles. Because of its age, a fire could be particularly destructive, especially if it reached the engine room and other tight spaces with machinery, said Lawrence B. Brennan, a professor of admiralty and international maritime law at Fordham University in New York.“The heat of a fire of this nature can warp the steel, and that can be a major problem for any ship,” said Brennan. “On an older ship, it’s even more of a problem.”Two other docked ships, USS Fitzgerald and USS Russell, were moved to berths away from the fire, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/21-injured-in-fire-aboard-ship-at-naval-base-san-diego/story-o1qqrGZCs2Htox9Ay7rBGL.html

Singhvi moved the application as part of the landmark case of DK Basu v. State of West Bengal in which the Supreme Court has from time to time issued directions for police reforms.Singhvi who is the Amicus Curiae (friend of the court) in the matter also sought setting up of Human Rights Courts envisaged by the Human Rights Act.The plea comes in the backdrop of the encounter killing of Uttar Pradesh gangster Vikas Dubey and alleged custodial killing of Tamil Nadu men Jayaraj and Fenix. Singhvi, however, clarified in his application that his plea is not limited or arising only because of the Tamil Nadu or Vikas Dubey incidents but the same have been used merely as illustrative examples to create the legal safeguards.He submitted that as per the data collected by the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) there was a sharp increase in the number of cases of custodial deaths and encounter killings in past 4-5 years.“There have been a total of 359 custodial deaths only in past 4 years. This translates into the fact that roughly every 4th day a person is killed in police custody and denied a fair trial,” the plea pointed out.Singhvi also said that there has been a normalization of custodial violence and encounter through their depictions in popular culture and there is a need to create an informed and compassionate citizenry.“In the recent past the custodial deaths/encounters have not seen the necessary push back from the citizenry that is accepted of it; on the contrary in few cases such incidents have had huge public support. This leads to an environment that breeds a police force that commits such acts with impunity and victims who do not see a conducive social environment to seek justice,” the application said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/singhvi-moves-sc-for-mechanism-to-probe-encounter-killings-custodial-deaths/story-BPVBWMA7r4yptYbMWVBw5J.html

Without taking his name, Vijayan said some people were deliberately raising wild allegations to portray the state in a bad light.“Let them first compare the state’s records with others. We have a proven strategy and it is doing well,” he said adding the case fatality rate of the country was 2.67 percent whereas in Kerala it was a mere .39%. “We don’t want to flaunt our records. But some people are forcing us to do it,” he said. He also rejected the BJP chief’s contention that the state’s testing rate was poor. “Our test positivity record is good,” he said.The state reported two deaths and 449 fresh Covid-19 cases on Monday. Out of the 8,322 total cases, 4,263 have recovered and 4,025 are active cases. With two more deaths, the toll went up to 34 in the state. This is the fourth day that the state has been reporting more than 400 cases. Among those infected are 77 ITBP personnel and five health workers, said the CM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bid-to-tarnish-kerala-s-covid-19-fight-says-pinarayi-vijayan-after-nadda-alleges-fudged-data/story-D2sDm68D6tbBSsusTt78yJ.html

Prior to Dr Edwin testing positive, two nurses at the state’s dedicated Covid-19 Hospital had also tested positive. Staff at the hospital are put up at accommodation arranged by the Goa Government and are not allowed to travel home for fear of infecting their families given the risk of contracting the disease they face.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-doctor-who-headed-state-s-covid-19-hospital-tests-positive/story-70Br7ljy5aVE0xM16MDHBN.html
13-07-2020||India||BJP legislator found dead in north Bengal||Kolkata / Siliguri: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker Debendra Nath Roy, 65, was found hanging with his hands tied near his house in Uttar Dinajpur,north Bengal, on Monday morning. The police said it appeared to be a case of suicide and Roy had left behind a suicide note, but his family members and senior BJP leaders alleged that he had been murdered.BJP leaders demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) enquiry and called for a 12-hour shutdown strike in north Bengal districts starting at 6 am on Tuesday. A team of BJP leaders also met governor Jagdeep Dhankhar in Kolkata and sought a CBI inquiry.“Prima facie it appears to be a case of suicide. The victim has left behind a suicide note in which he has named a few persons. They would be questioned. We are exploring all angles,” said Sumit Kumar, superintendent of police of Uttar Dinajpur. Roy’s body was found hanging from the ceiling of a shop, more than a kilometre away from his house in Bindole in Hemtabad. While the noose was tied around his neck with one end of the rope, the other end of the rope was tied to his left hand. The suicide note was found in his pocket, police said.Family members, including the victim’s wife and his nephew, alleged that Roy went out around 1 am on Monday after someone called him. The family could not identify the person who called, but said that he was riding a motorcycle as they had heard the sound. A few hours later his body was found in a market place. “I have never heard any person committing a suicide with his hands tied. There was no mud on his feet even though it was a kutcha road and it raining yesterday. He went out yesterday after someone called him around 1 am,” said Chadima Roy, the victim’s wife. Roy had won the assembly elections from Hemtabad in Uttar Dinajpir district in 2016 on a Communist Party of India (Marxist) ticket in 2016 and joined the BJP in 2019.“Incident has sent shock waves. Have impressed @MamataOfficial for fair investigation. Police Officials cannot be “law unto themselves” or politically motivated. Inappropriate and demeaning treatment of opposition MPs and leaders by police officials will not be countenanced. BJP Sr leaders MP Dilip Ghosh, Rahul Sinha and others called on me and sought CBI investigation of political murder of Hematabad MLA Debendra Nath Roy. Delegation expressed concern at postings of police officials tasked to harass and liquidate opposition leaders,” Dhankhar tweeted.Not willing to accept the suicide theory put forward by the police, the saffron party’s top leadership including the party president JP Nadda also tagged it as a heinous killing..“The suspected heinous killing of Debendra Nath Ray, BJP MLA from Hemtabad in West Bengal, is extremely shocking and deplorable. This speaks of the Gunda Raj & failure of law and order in the Mamta govt. People will not forgive such a govt in the future. We strongly condemn this,” Nadda tweeted.“Roy was murdered. The position in which his body was found hanging clearly suggests that it was preplanned. He was murdered and then the accused persons tried to pass it off as a suicide. The TMC {Trinamool Congress} is involved,” said Rahul Sinha, BJP’s national secretary.The state government has ordered a probe by the criminal investigation department into the case.“They have gone mad. They engage in so many encounters in other states that they demand a CBI enquiry even in a normal case. What will the CBI do? The local police solve more cases than the CBI. Whoever joins the BJP suffers from depression,” said Firhad Haki, TMC leader.Opposition parties including the CPIM and the Congress also demanded an enquiry.“Even MLAs are not safe in the present regime. Today it was a BJP MLA. Tomorrow it could be from another party. I don’t understand why is the Mamata Banerjee still retaining the post of home minister,” said Abdul Mannan, Congress leader who heads the opposition in the state assembly.BJP’s state president Dilip Ghosh claimed that more than 100 BJP supporters had been killed in political violence, but most of the cases were still pending and none had been convicted. He said BJP supporters would stage protests outside police stations on July 15 against the legislator’s killing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-legislator-found-dead-in-north-bengal/story-mgkQrtOm8RZQEyUVyDTMEI.html
13-07-2020||India||Sundar Pichai announces $10bn fund||New Delhi: Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced that his company will invest nearly $10 billion into developing digital infrastructure and for funding innovation in India over the next five to seven years, he said on Monday, shortly after holding an online meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.India-born Pichai made the announcement at the sixth edition of Google for India event, saying the tech giant will help expand the scope of digital payments using Google Pay, and develop low-cost smartphones and other products and services relevant to India. He hoped India will lead the next wave of innovation.“We spoke on a wide range of subjects, particularly leveraging the power of technology to transform the lives of India’s farmers, youngsters and entrepreneurs,” Modi tweeted earlier in the day, detailing his “extremely fruitful interaction” with Pichai.Modi said he and Pichai, who is the chief executive officer of Google’s parent Alphabet Inc, also discussed “the new work culture that is emerging in the times of Covid-19”, and the challenges the pandemic has brought. They also talked about the “importance of data security and cyber safety”.“I was delighted to know more about the efforts of @Google in several sectors, be it in education, learning, @_DigitalIndia, furthering digital payments and more,” Modi added, referring to a flagship programme of his government.In his reply, Pichai said: “Thank you for your time, PM @narendramodi - very optimistic about your vision for Digital India and excited to continue our work towards it.”Later, at the Google for India event held via video conference, Pichai said Google for India Digitization Fund will invest $10 billion (about Rs 75,000 crore) over the next five to seven years, stressing that the move is “a reflection our confidence in the future of India and its digital economy”.“We will work towards enabling affordable internet access to every Indian in their own language,” Pichai said. He added that special attention will be paid to empowering small businesses, and leveraging technology and artificial intelligence for areas such as health and agriculture.Ravi Shankar Prasad, Union minister for electronics and information technology, said the digital transformation of India has especially focused on “digital inclusion”.“We are working towards developing 100,000 digital villages across India and I would appreciate if Google could pick a cluster of these villages and make them model villages in terms of skilling and delivery of telemedicine,” he added.According to R Chandrashekar, former president of industry body NASSCOM and chairman of the Centre for the Digital Future — a policy research organisation — Google’s move is an endorsement of the potential of India’s digital economy.“The investment is pretty large and will help drive innovation that will primarily come from start-ups and the tech eco-system in the country,” Chandrashekar told HT. He added that the initiative will also help in job creation.RK Bhatnagar, former technical advisor at the department of telecommunications, said the tie-up shows that most of the major US-based companies, after turning away from China, are looking at India. “That they are looking to make India a manufacturing hub is a possibility that is now becoming visible,” Bhatnagar told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sundar-pichai-announces-10bn-fund/story-gp4VKreTJKCxtsGlfV5BLO.html
13-07-2020||India||Class 12 results: Pass percentage improves but no merit list announced||New Delhi: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Monday declared results of Class 12 examinations in a format aimed at reaching out to students hit by disruptions in test schedules and classes amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, with an overall pass percentage increase of 5.38 percentage points over last year.The board decided against releasing a merit list this year due to a change in the Covid-19-hit evaluation criteria, while also replacing the term “fail” with “essential repeat”. Education experts said the moves were aimed at a student-friendly format of the results amid extraordinary circumstances due to the Covid-19 pandemic.A nationwide lockdown necessitated by the outbreak, which began stalking the country in March, led to the cancellation of Class 12 examinations in 12 subjects, with classes at schools also being cancelled to prevent infections. Around 11 exams were cancelled in north-east Delhi, which was also hit by communal riots in February before the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen began spreading in the Capital. The students were evaluated on the basis of the average of marks in exams they took before the lockdown came into effect on March 25.Delhi’s government schools performed better than private schools for the fifth consecutive year. The overall pass percentage of Delhi government schools stood at 98%, highest ever and around 6 percentage points higher than that of private schools. “Feeling v proud to announce that the CBSE class 12 result of Delhi govt schools this year is 98% - highest ever so far. It’s historic. Congratulations to my Team Education, all students, teachers, parents and education officers. Proud of you all,” Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted.In all, 1,192,961 students from 13,109 schools across the country appeared for the CBSE Class 12 examination this year – 1,059,080 of them cleared the examination. The overall pass percentage was recorded at 88.78%, compared to last year’s 83.40%.Keeping with a trend that has persisted over several years, girls performed better than boys in the examination. While the overall pass percentage of girls stood at 92.15%, around 86.19% of boys passed the exam. The pass percentage of transgender students was recorded at 66.67%, down from last year’s 83.33%.Divyanshi Jain, a student of Lucknow’s Navyug Radiance Senior Secondary School, secured the perfect score of 600. “This is unbelievable. I am elated and surprised at the same time,” Jain said.CBSE’s controller of examination Sanyam Bhardwaj said: “The major reason behind the increase in pass percentage this year is the changes CBSE made in the examination pattern. For the first time, CBSE included 25% objective-type questions in all the subjects. We also gave 33% internal choice in the exams.”“The results were declared on the basis of the average of exams in which students appeared. The numbers of exams also vary from student to student. Keeping this unprecedented situation in mind, the board decided not to release any merit list this year,” Bhardwaj added.The board also decided to replace the term “fail” with “essential repeat” in the results this year. Several principals said the evaluation scheme adopted by CBSE amid the pandemic was student-friendly. Amita Wattal, principal of Springdales Pusa Road, said: “The board has given out very student-friendly results even without conducting exams of some subjects. The board’s decision of not announcing the merit list was also very appreciable because it’s been a very difficult year for students because of the pandemic.”According to a statement released by the board, the term “Fail” will also be removed from the documents. “The idea behind using the term essential repeat was to not to make students feel bad about their performance if they fail in any subject. The term means they have to essentially appear in the compartment exam,” a senior official said. The numbers of students who scored above 90% and 95% marks also increased significantly this year. A total of 38,686 students scored 95% marks and above in aggregate, up 118.6% from 17,693 in 2019. As many as 157,934 students scored 90% and above, 67.48% higher than last year’s tally of 94,299.According to officials at the Delhi University, this increase will have a direct impact on cut-off scores, since more than 70% applications for admissions received by the university are from CBSE students. “As per the preliminary trends, we are getting about the CBSE results, we won’t be able to keep the percentage low,” said Anju Shrivastava, principal of Hindu College.Among regions, Thiruvananthapuram recorded the highest pass percentage at 97.67%, followed by Bengaluru at 97.05% and Chennai at 96.17%. The overall pass percentage of the Delhi region stood at 94.39%.Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya outperformed others at 98.70%, followed by Kendriya Vidyalaya (98.6%) and the Central Tibetan School Administration (98.23%).“Some students have called us saying that they would have scored better on their pending papers if the exams had been conducted and the moderation marking scheme has affected their average score,” said Tania Joshi, principal of Indian School.The board has decided to conduct optional examinations for students who are not satisfied with their results and want to improve them. “The CBSE will conduct an optional examination in the subjects, whose examinations were scheduled to be conducted from July 1 to 15, as soon as conditions are conducive as assessed and decided by the Central Government.“Candidates whose results have been declared on the basis of the assessment scheme will be allowed to appear in these optional examinations to improve their performance if they wish so. Marks obtained by a candidate in these optional examinations will be treated as final for those who opt to take these examinations,” the board said.The declaration of results on Monday came as a surprise for most as the board did not announce the date in advance. Ishita Singh, a humanities student at DPS Vasant Kunj, said: “It was a surprise. We did not expect the result to be announced so randomly. Also, the website was not working properly. It took me an hour to access my result.” Shortly after the results were declared, Union human resource development (HRD) minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ tweeted: “We congratulate you all for making this possible. I reiterate, Student’s health & quality education are our priority,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/class-12-results-pass-percentage-improves-but-no-merit-list-announced/story-ZXrhEIz89cS1jqHpOXmFzH.html

13-07-2020||India||India, EU set to hold virtual summit; trade negotiations to get fresh push||The stalled negotiations between India and the European Union (EU) on a trade and investment pact could get a fresh push when the two sides hold their virtual summit this week amid efforts by both parties to build supply chains that are less dependent on China.Negotiations on the broad-based Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA) began a little more than 13 years ago though the two sides haven’t had very substantive engagements on this issue in the last few years, mainly due to differences over matters such as access to the Indian market for European products and the movement of Indian professionals in EU states.With new leadership taking over in the European Council and European Commission last year and the NDA government securing a second term, the two sides had decided to look afresh at BTIA and see if they could reach common ground and take things forward, people familiar with developments said on Monday.The 15th India-EU Summit, to be held via video conference on July 15 and co-chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, could give fresh impetus to these efforts, the people said on condition of anonymity.“This summit will be critical in terms of trying to find a meeting ground between the two sides and find a way forward,” one of the people cited above said.At a time when India has been taking a more critical look at trade and investment with China, EU states are examining the issue of “over dependence on some suppliers” and the European leadership has spoken publicly about economic sovereignty and strategic autonomy, which requires that countries shouldn’t be completely depend on the outside world for critical supplies, the person added.The leadership of both sides have also spoken of the need to diversify supply chains and to make them more secure.India and the EU will also focus on strengthening multilateralism during the summit amid uncertainty created by the Covid-19 pandemic and the rise of an assertive China.Besides charting a roadmap for the India-EU strategic partnership till 2025, the two sides are also expected to discuss the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and its fallout on the global economy and international organisations.Earlier this year, the European Parliament was critical of both the Indian government’s decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in 2019 and the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which cast a cloud on the overall relationship. There was clarity on whether these issues will figure during the summit.However, both sides are looking at greater cooperation in the economic field. The EU’s mission in India tweeted on Monday: “With EU-India bilateral trade crossing 100 billion EUR, and both sides having vast domestic markets and a strong entrepreneurial tradition, there is enormous potential for the EU and India to benefit from reinforced trade, economic and investment relations.”The EU is India’s largest trading partner, accounting for trade in goods worth about $100 billion a year and trade in services worth $40 billion a year, with a surplus for India in both. EU investments in India are worth about $91 billion.The EU is the second-largest destination for Indian exports (more than 14% of the total) after the US. However, India is the EU’s 10th largest trading partner, accounting for 1.9% of total trade in goods in 2019, and well behind the US (15.2%), China (13.8%) and the UK (12.6%).India also sees the EU states as a key source of technology such as artificial intelligence and 5G, innovation and investments for sectors such as infrastructure, climate and smart cities. The EU is also a leader in creating standards for emerging technologies that manage national interests while keeping things open for glaobal engagements, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-eu-set-to-hold-virtual-summit-trade-negotiations-to-get-fresh-push/story-w980ybKEzTZqjgSiLi60YO.html
13-07-2020||India||Amid political crisis, I-T raids on 20 locations of 3 groups linked to aides of Gehlot||As the political crisis intensified in Rajasthan following deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot’s revolt against the Chief Minister – Ashok Gehlot, the Income Tax department on Monday conducted raids on three business groups and individuals allegedly linked to the aides of Gehlot, people familiar with the development said.One of the persons whose premises were searched by the I-T sleuths includes – Rajiv Arora of Amrapali Jewels, who is also the Vice President of Rajasthan Congress. According to an official familiar with development - the main allegations against Arora’s company - the group is that a substantial part of its silver jewellery business is carried out outside the regular books of accounts. The company has business of trading of silver/gold jewellery and antique silver articles and has associate enterprises in various other countries like UK, USA etc., as well as properties and bank accounts in these countries. The I-T teams also raided - Om Kothari Group, which has engineering, construction, real estate, automotive dealership, manufacturing and other business interests as well as a third company - Mayank Sharma Enterprises.It is suspected that Mumbai-based Mayank Sharma Enterprises owns a hotel and one of its main investors – Ratan Kant Sharma - has close association with Vaibhav Gehlot, son of Ashok Gehlot. In fact, officials said, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is probing transactions of Rs 96 crore allegedly received by Sharma from Mauritius. BJP leader Kirit Somaiya had alleged in 2013 that a Mauritius-based company had purchased the shares, having value of Rs 100, of Trion Hotels and Resorts of Sharma, at an absurd amount of Rs 40,000 each while seeking a probe into the involvement of Vaibhav Gehlot. In all, 20 places were searched by at least 80 I-T sleuths in Jaipur, Mumbai, Delhi and Kota, officials said.The probe, they said, pertains to “tax evasion” and some benami transactions and raids were conducted after examining several documents over a period of time.A finance ministry officer, requesting anonymity, said – “Raids are being conducted by the income-tax department’s field formations based on inputs related to tax evasion. Such raids take place only after prolonged investigations and after finding discrepancies in the company or individuals tax returns. So, allegations of politically-motivated raids hold no ground. In fact, those indulging in tax evasion often term such raids as motivated to cover up their illegal activities. Tax evasion is a criminal activity and the law is same for everyone –unscrupulous companies or individuals - irrespective of their political affiliations.”The Congress questioned the timing of raids while targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah. “The frontal departments of the BJP – I-T and ED have come out in the field. When will CBI come?” Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala tweeted while taking a dig at the government. He added that such raids will not topple the Congress government in Rajasthan.Om Kothari’s flagship company – Om Metals Infraprojects Ltd, is listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and specializes in executing turnkey contracts for infrastructure projects covering power, roads, irrigation and real estate, according to the group website.Officials cited above said that the company was raided in connection with transactions related to a contract given to it to build a dam in Rajasthan. Interestingly, Om Metal’s joint managing director Sunil Kothari was raided by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in November 2017 in connection with the VVIP chopper – AgustaWestland scam.When contacted, a representative at Om Metals main office in Pushp Vihar, Saket – said, “I-T officials are still here”. He, however, was not authorized to talk to the media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-political-crisis-it-raids-on-20-locations-of-3-groups-linked-to-aides-of-gehlots/story-lnEnAnTuzPhBHUfm4ful6N.html
13-07-2020||India||BJP accuses KCR of taking a leaf out of TMC’s book and attacking political rivals||The Bharatiya Janata Party on Monday accused the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi led by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao of adopting the tactics of Trinamool Congress in West Bengal by engineering attacks on opponents with the support of police forces.The Telangana BJP gave a call to party leaders and workers to take up rallies and dharnas all over the state in protest against the attack on the vehicle of BJP MP from Nizamabad, Dharmapuri Arvind, allegedly by TRS activists in Warangal on Sunday.“Though BJP took up the protests strictly following Covid-19 guidelines, the TRS government unleashed a reign of terror. In Warangal, the police arrested hundreds of our party leaders and workers and booked them in various cases,” BJP state president Bandi Sanjay told Hindustan Times.He alleged that the TRS was adopting the strategies of the TMC in West Bengal and the CPI (M) in Kerala by terrorising political rivals. “But KCR has forgotten the fact that the BJP is a national party with a strong cadre. We are going to counter the TRS in every aspect. If they use police force to suppress us, we too, will retort with strong cadre force,” Sanjay said.The Telangana BJP, which has been going all out to emerge as an alternative political force in Telangana, ever since it had won four Lok Sabha seats in May 2019 Lok Sabha elections, has stepped up its attack on the TRS government for the last few days.On Sunday, TRS activists allegedly attacked the convoy of Arvind in Warangal in protest against his comments against KCR and his family members. “Anti-Hindu forces in TRS attacked me in Warangal, which I visited to address a press conference on ‘Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’. They also chased my vehicle on the highway to Hyderabad,” Arvind tweeted.The Nizamabad MP had earlier commented, while speaking to reporters in Warangal that the TRS government had miserably failed to control the Covid-19 situation in the state. He alleged that KCR and his family members were more interested in making money. “He and his family members will be in Chanchalguda jail after 2023 and special rooms are being readied for them in the jail,” he commented.Arvind also accused KCR of handing over the Telangana state to anti-Hindu forces. “He is a fake Hindu and Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen president Assaduddin Owaisi is his elder son,” the MP commented.Within hours of his comments being telecast on television channels, the TRS youth wing activists tried to barge into the BJP Warangal Urban office in Hanamkonda and attack the convoy of the MP with eggs. The police quickly entered the scene and took them into custody.In retaliation, the BJP activists tried to stage a dharna at the camp office of government Chief Whip Dasyam Vinay Bhaskar but they were dispersed by the police.TRS chief whip Dasyam Vinay Bhaskar condemned the allegations of the BJP MP. Stating that Arvind had no stature to make comments against the chief minister and the TRS, he alleged that the BJP leader had won the elections by making false promises to the people of Nizamabad.“He has no business to come to Warangal and make false allegations against the TRS and KCR,” Bhaskar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-accuses-kcr-of-taking-a-leaf-out-of-tmc-s-book-and-attacking-political-rivals/story-ddpZRWUmqcnHdPygjAGnRM.html

A taxpayer filing Income Tax Returns (ITR) electronically without digital signature has to verify it using either Aadhaar one-time password (OTP), or logging into e-filing account through net banking, or by Electronic Verification Code (EVC) or by sending a duly signed physical copy of ITR-V through post to CPC Bengaluru within 120 days of uploading the ITR. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) in an order said that a large number of electronically filed ITRs still remain pending with the IT Department for want of receipt of a valid ITR-V (Verification) form at Centralised Processing Centre (CPC), Bengaluru from the taxpayers concerned. It said non-filing of ITR-V within time can lead to returns being declared as ‘non-est’. As a one-time measure for resolving the grievances of the taxpayers associated with non-filing of ITR-V for earlier assessment years and to regularise such returns which have either become ‘non-est’ or have remained pending for non-filing or non-receipt of ITR-V form, the CBDT has permitted verification of electronically filed tax returns for assessment years 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 either by sending a duly signed physical copy of ITR-V to CPC Bengaluru through speed post or through EVC/OTP modes. Such verification process must be completed by September 30, 2020. It, however, clarified that “this relaxation shall not apply in those cases, where during the intervening period, Income-tax Department has already taken recourse to any other measure as specified in the Act for ensuring filing of tax return by the taxpayer concerned after declaring the return as Non-est.” Nangia & Co LLP Partner Shailesh Kumar said that in many cases, ITRs filed by individuals became invalid due to non-completion of verification process. Consequently, tax refunds, if any, claimed in those ITRs also got stuck. “By this order, the government not only relaxes the timeline allowing taxpayers to verify their past years’ invalid ITRs by 30th September but also allows processing of such past ITRs by 31 December, 2020. This order can benefit a large number of taxpayers, mostly being individual taxpayers, who could not verify their past ITRs inadvertently,” Kumar said. This order provides a good opportunity to them for regularising their past ITRs and not only solve the issue of past non-compliance but also receive past pending refunds stuck due to this procedural lapse, he added. AKM Global Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said, “This is a welcome measure as practically we have seen several cases where there were legacy issues in terms of non receipt of ITR V. Also, considering the consequences of non filing, this was a much needed relief.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-t-dept-asks-taxpayers-to-verify-itrs-for-ays-2015-16-to-2019-20-by-sep-30/story-9Z3xNLtesfa1kDdkxPMhTK.html

Over 60,000 people uprooted by floods are taking shelter in 480 relief camps. On Monday morning, a sub-adult male tiger came out of the park’s Agratoli range and took shelter in a goat shed in Kandolimari village located on the periphery of the world’s largest habitat for one-horned rhinos.“Due to the rise of water and to find a safe escape, a sub-adult tiger has entered inside a goat shed in Kandolimari village, Agratoli. Utmost care is being taken to ensure safety of both people and tiger,” P Sivakumar, director of the national park, informed.Photos and a video of the tiger taking shelter under the shed as water level rose and covered most of its body soon went viral on social media. Forest officials reached the spot and monitored the situation, allowing the big cat to rest at the spot without disturbing it.Later in the afternoon, the tiger moved out of the shed and went back towards the Agratoli range of the park.Every year, as annual floods inundate Kaziranga, many of the park’s wild animals leave the park and head towards the nearby hills in Karbi Anglong district by crossing the National Highway 37 that passes near the park’s boundary.On Monday, authorities closed a section of the national highway 37 between Kohora and Bagori ranges of Kaziranga national park due to inundation. Vehicles will have to use alternate routes till further notice.This season, nine animals including wild boar, swamp deer and hog deer have died due to drowning while 11 hog deer were killed after being hit by vehicles. Twelve animals died during treatment.Thirty five deer were injured due to flood and one by vehicle hit. Carcass of a rhino which died due to natural causes was found last month.Of the 223 camps used by forest personnel to patrol the park, 166 have been inundated and seven of them have been vacated due to rising water levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tiger-takes-shelter-in-goat-shed-as-assam-s-kaziranga-national-park-gets-flooded/story-9nixAzckp91XhLv9MSPe6O.html

The former PM also appealed to the people to cooperate with the government and follow the necessary norms to combat the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.Grocery shops, meat shops, and other essential but non-emergency establishments will be open only between 5 am and 12 noon. However, all other commercial private establishments would be shut for a week.On Monday, Karnataka registered 2,738 new coronavirus cases taking the state’s tally to 41,581 which includes 757 deaths and 16,248 discharges.Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa has made it clear that the lockdown in Bengaluru would be only for a period of one week and would not be extended. This clarification came after the Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry criticized the government’s decision to opt for another lockdown saying it would have a negative impact on industrial and economic activity which was just picking up. In spite of the CM’s assurance of lockdown being limited to just one week, thousands of migrant workers have begun moving out of Bengaluru to their native districts in the state.Earlier in the day, the CM held a video conference with DC’s of all districts across the state. The CM advised DC’s that they should give priority to rapid antigen tests as the state had procured and distributed one lakh test kits. Yediyurappa pointed out that the number of Covid-19 cases had increased heavily in Bengaluru Urban, Dakshina Kannada, Dharwad, Bellary, Udupi, and Kalburgi districts and asked officials in these districts to take extra measures to bring down the number of cases.Pointing out that the mortality (death) rate in Bidar district is one among the top five districts in the country; the CM instructed that measures be taken to control the death rate. The CM also directed officials to take action against private hospitals that were not cooperating with the government to treat Covid-19 and non- Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deve-gowda-demands-karnataka-wide-lockdown-as-covid-19-cases-cross-40-000-mark/story-VBra0Ptxu1CgQ824B1atsK.html

13-07-2020||India||India will revisit existing business models in post-Covid-19 world: Niti Aayog tells UN||Sustaining a high growth trajectory will be a challenge following the Covid-19 pandemic, however, India is revisiting existing business models in a post- Covid-19 world and exploring ways of developing relevant sectors of infrastructure and industry, such as the pharmaceutical and health equipment sector, Niti Aayog has said in its report to the United Nations.In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, India’s response includes a USD 279 billion economic package, comprehensive health coverage for front-line workers and direct cash transfers for the most vulnerable, including unemployment protection for job losses, and income support through the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, it said. The apex planning body presented India’s second Voluntary National Review (VNR) titled Decade of Action: Taking SDGs from Global to Local on the implementation of the SDGs before the United Nations (UN). VNR serves as a basis for an international review of the SDGs progress.India is a signatory to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and participates in the international review. The VNRs are presented at the UN’s High-Level Political Forums (HLPF), which have met annually since 2016. India submitted its first VNR in 2017.“Given the uncertainty in the global economy, especially following the Covid-19 pandemic, sustaining a high growth trajectory will be a challenge for India, as it will be for all nations across the world. However, the success of the economic growth strategy in the past five years and the learnings from the same will inform India’s growth plans for the next ten years,” the report said.“While the Covid-19 pandemic has put forth severe breaks on the momentum of global economic growth, India is fast exploring ways of developing relevant sectors of infrastructure and industry, such as the pharmaceutical and health equipment sector. It is also revisiting existing business models in a post- Covid-19 world by aggressive adoption of Artificial Intelligence and technology based products and services in education, health and financial services, among others,” it added.Niti Aayog also said developed countries have an intrinsic obligation to provide financial assistance to the developing countries, especially for global public goods such as climate change mitigation and control of pandemics, such as Covid-19.The report states integrated health labs in all districts including block level labs and public health units will need to be set up to deal with future pandemics adding that there should also be an increase in public health infrastructure.Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar in his opening remarks said Covid-19 pandemic has caused disruptions to plans and timelines for 2030 agenda on SDGs. “While we take satisfaction in our accomplishments, we are well aware of the arduous path ahead. Ours is a young population with rising aspirations. Fulfilling these aspirations of nearly 1.3 billion people, from different social, economic and cultural backgrounds is a daunting challenge. The Covid-19 pandemic has thrown up several challenges. These will be addressed in the shortest possible time,” he said.The transformation the world is striving for, is not only policy or programme-based, but also behavioural and social, which, looking back at history, had taken decades to accomplish. However, we must remind ourselves that we do not have the luxury of time. The Covid-19 pandemic has caused disruptions to plans and timelines. Therefore, we have every reason to double or triple our efforts for achieving the targets of the Agenda 2030,” he added.India will for first time include marginalised groups as key focus areas in assessing the impact of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) second Voluntary National Review, Hindustan Times had reported in January. The VNR report also highlights policy interventions for the LGBTQIA+ community. “The recent legislations in relation to the LGBTQIA+ community in India have no doubt been pivotal in addressing the exclusion issues of the community, yet, how the recognition of these rights are harmonised in different public systems, including data collection and enumeration, remains to be seen and will determine the way forward. Multifarious social challenges including and not limited to discrimination and stigma will not only require interventions by the state but also active involvement of the civil society and markets,” it noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-will-revisit-existing-business-models-in-post-covid-19-world-niti-aayog-tells-un/story-TeS6Uyo5dCblWAPSEOtOHJ.html

From tomorrow, I’ll be sharing my thoughts with you on video,” Gandhi tweeted.Over the past few weeks, Gandhi had interacted with former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan and Nobel Laureate Abhijeet Banerjee on separate occasions on video to discuss measures taken to fight the Covid-19 pandemic and economic strategy to move forward.In another tweet, the Congress leader said the media has been “captured by fascist forces” and a narrative of hatred and lies was “tearing India apart”. “Today a large part of the Indian news media has been captured by fascist interests. A hate filled narrative is being spread by television channels, whatsapp forwards and false news. This narrative of lies is tearing India apart,” he wrote.He is expected to talk on current issues confronting the country and tell viewers what he thinks about those, sources said.The Congress’ relationship with the media has not been smooth in recent times. In May last year, soon after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections the party decided not to send its spokespersons on television debates. The move was widely attributed to the party’s discomfiture caused by the leadership crisis after Rahul Gandhi quit as party president. But Congress functionaries had maintained that the decision was taken to register protest against the alleged “unfair treatment” meted out to its panellists in debates by anchors who “toe the BJP’s line”. Ten months later in April this year, the Congress rescinded its decision of not sending its spokespersons on television debates a week into the first phase of the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-to-launch-video-programme-to-counter-narrative-of-hatred/story-9TkJtBIHYdmKKW7SpQYdNI.html

13-07-2020||India||‘Taking a risk should be worth it!’||The coronavirus scare, actors testing Covid-19 positive and low budgets are leaving actors in two minds about shootings, said Flora Saini who played the ghost in film ‘Stree’.The ‘Inside Edge’, ‘Gandii Baat’ and ‘Aarya’ actor said, “I am excited that offers are coming my way but I am yet to say yes to any of them. Everything has to fall in place. Now, the budgets have gone down and people want to pay less. With so much risk involved, the money has to be worth the story, role, character and other things.”As the actor lives with her parents, she can’t put them at risk either. “We have to weigh the situation: how safe it is to shoot now! Eventually, laut ke ghar aana hai, aur ghar pe parents hain (I have to come back home, where my parents are). I being the only child, my parents are against me going out for the moment. For a paltry amount, my mother will surely not agree to me taking the risk.”After many actors tested Covid-19-positive she is more scared. “After Mr (Amitabh) Bachchan’s family, Anupam (Kher) Sir’s family and Parth Samthaan, it has become very scary. Manu Rishi (Chadha) sir also shared a video after recovering from Covid. So, I am also very confused, like others, how to go about things — ‘buri tarah fas gai hoon main’ (I am facing a dilemma).”Flora realises that letting projects go is also not an option. “Projects will happen with or without me! I am listening to every script coming my way. I am now looking forward to projects that will start in late August or September onwards, as honestly speaking, right now, it seems to be a bit risky.”“The release of ‘Aarya’ kept me busy for some time. Before that I dubbed for it from home itself. I made it a point to catch up with friends everyday, which keeps me busy and gives each other positivity. I am enjoying great food made by Mom, and during the lockdown, she has started cooking hotel-type food all thanks to the Internet. Besides, I am interacting with my fans.”Her film ‘Darbaan’ was about to be released when the lockdown took place. “It’s an adaptation of Gurudev Rabindra Nath Tagore’s story. I play Sharad Kelkar’s wife. Sharib Hashmi is doing the role of Darbaan. I hope it releases soon. Before the lockdown, I was shooting for the second season ‘City of Dreams’ which also got stuck.”She has also shot for season three of ‘Inside Edge’ which is awaiting release. “Earlier, I have shot for Ram Gopal Verma’s film ‘12 ‘o’ Clock’ which will be releasing soon. I play Manav Kaul’s wife in the horror film,” the actor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/taking-a-risk-should-be-worth-it/story-9JNIHAQ17jVNqwQ0ISs3TL.html
13-07-2020||India||Telangana doctor drives tractor to transport Covid-19 victim’s body for last rites||A doctor in Telangana on Sunday came forward to drive a tractor carrying the body of a Covid-19 victim to the cremation ground for last rites at a time when there have been instances of mishandling bodies .Dr Pendyala Sriram, who works as a district medical surveillance officer in Pedapalli district, was on duty on Sunday when the Covid-19 patient died. Since there was no ambulance available in the hospital and the driver of the tractor provided by the municipal authorities refused to drive, the 45-year-old doctor decided to drive the vehicle to the cremation ground.The incident came to light after a video showing Dr Sriram driving the tractor with the victim’s body was widely shared on social media.According to Sriram, the patient died at around 9.30 am on Sunday. It was the first death at Peddapalli government hospital, though the district has reported eight deaths till now.Watch: Doctor drives tractor to take Covid victim’s body to graveyard “Since it was the first case in the district, the hospital staff also did not know how to handle the body of a Covid-19 victim, including its packing as per the protocol. In fact, there was a lone woman medical officer and some nurses at the hospital. Unfortunately, the hospital does not have a mortuary to preserve the body at a temperature of 4 degrees Celsius for a long time and there was not even an ambulance to carry a dead body, let alone a Covid-19 victim,” the doctor said.On receiving a call from the hospital, Sriram reached the spot and understood the situation. “The hospital authorities were in a hurry to dispose of the body and the relatives were anxious. I immediately spoke to my superiors, police and the local municipal authorities to make arrangements for the disposal of the body,” he said.Since there was no ambulance, the municipal authorities sent a tractor to carry the body. In the meantime, Sriram got the body packed as per the Covid-19 protocol. The tractor arrived, but the driver refused to carry the body. He left the vehicle there and ran away.It was then that Dr Sriram decided to take the responsibility. He wore the personal protection equipment and asked the four family members of the victim to do the same. With their help, he placed the body in the tractor and then drove the body to the cremation ground, about two kilometres away and performed the last rites as per their customs.“Since I do practise cultivation during the weekends in Karimnagar, I know how to drive a tractor. That came in handy for me in carrying the Covid-19 body in the tractor,” he said.Dr Sriram said he was very much aware how much pain and agony the family members of a deceased person would undergo if there was a delay in handing over the body for cremation.“In July 2018, I lost my 18-year-old son in a road accident in Bengaluru. And I had to struggle for nearly 20 hours to get his body from the hospital mortuary after post-mortem. I could see the same agony in the faces of the family members of Covid-19,” he said.Disposal of bodies of Covid-19 victims has become a huge problem as many government officials and even family members in some cases have been refusing to handle the bodies for fear of contracting the virus. There have been at least three incidents of mishandling of bodies of Covid-19 victims in the recent weeks, all from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.On July 10, the Nellore district administration in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh ordered a probe into an incident of the local municipal staff allegedly carrying the bodies of three Covid-19 victims in an earth mover and then dumping them into a grave, at a spot adjacent to Penna river.On July 6, municipal authorities in Tirupati had also used an earth mover to lift the body of a Covid-19 victim from the ambulance and then dumped it into a grave.On June 26, the municipal staff in Palasa town in Srikakulam district used an earth mover to carry the body of a Covid-19 victim from his house for last rites, after the victim’s relatives refused to perform the last rites. On chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy’s instructions, the district authorities suspended six municipal employees over the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-doctor-drives-tractor-to-transport-covid-19-victim-s-body-for-last-rites/story-Z9WLnSJYjQ19wp6NQA6nnK.html

In the last hearing on July 1 his counsel had said since Jalandhar was a Covid-19 containment zone he was denied permission to travel to Kerala.To buttress his point the prosecutor produced documents obtained from Jalandhar which showed his contentions were wrong (HT has copies of the documents) and said he was avoiding appearance citing wrong reasons. He told the court that the Civil Lines area in Jalandhar where the former bishop is staying was not in the list of the containment zones.Mulakkal was not present on Monday either when his counsel said the former bishop had a detailed talk with his lawyer who had tested positive for Covid-19 and was asked to go into quarantine. But the court said since his first claim fell flat it can’t accept the latest one. Later the court cancelled his bail and directed the Kottayam police superintendent to arrest him and produce him before it. The court posted the next date of hearing for August 13.“Mulakkal had cited flimsy reasons to avoid his personal appearance many times. His men also tried to intimidate some of the witnesses. With his defiant attitude he was challenging the judicial system of the country,” said Felix J Pulludan, convener of Save Our Sisters, an organisation floated during the stir against Mulakkal before he was arrested for the first time.The spokesman of Jalandhar diocese Father Peter expressed shock over cancellation of Mullakal’s bail and said there was a concerted move to influence the judiciary with wrong information. “A section of the media said the bishop was absent 13 times, but there are only four occasions. We have submitted all documents to the court in this regard. It is sad his submission was overlooked,” said the PRO.Last week the Kerala High Court had rejected the former bishop’s plea to quash the case against him and directed him to face the trial. In March the trial court in Kottayam had also dismissed his discharge plea.The case surfaced in 2018 after a 43-year-old nun had complained to the police in Kottayam that Mulakkal had raped her several times between 2014 and 2016. The nun is a member of the Missionaries of Jesus congregation based in Punjab. But Mulakkal denied it saying he was implicated after he took action against her for financial irregularities in the convent.Later a special investigation team (SIT) was formed and it arrested him in September 2018. He was granted bail after spending 40 days in jail. He was removed from the post of the bishop later. The SIT had filed the charge sheet against him last year but he failed to appear before the court several times.The petitioner had also complained that some of the witnesses were threatened by Mulakkal’s followers. While opposing his discharge plea the state government had said in the High Court that evidence against him was strong and he was deliberately delaying the trial filing different pleas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-court-cancels-ex-bishop-s-bail-in-rape-case-issues-arrest-warrant/story-FhVdo7j8uLH4UsmRZxhxCM.html
13-07-2020||India||Ashok Gehlot aces 1st test, sequesters MLAs in luxury resort to prep for more||Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, who has been under attack from his deputy Sachin Pilot, on Monday shifted his 100-plus lawmakers to a luxury resort on the outskirts of Jaipur city to shield them from the pulls and pressures of politics that could jeopardise the survival of his 18-month-old government.The lawmakers were packed into buses on Monday afternoon, minutes after they signed off on a resolution expressing complete support for Gehlot’s leadership role in the state government and accused the BJP of efforts to topple the government. Their destination was Fairmont Jaipur, a 245-room luxury resort about 25 km from the chief minister’s official residence. The hotel, built in the tradition of grand Mughal palaces, has a published room tariff starting at Rs 8,500.A Congress leader claimed that the legislators were being shielded from rivals till the situation stabilises. It isn’t clear for how long this would continue.Congress leaders who attended the legislature party meeting at Gehlot’s official residence in state capital Jaipur’s plush Civil Lines locality said the chief minister had the support of 107 lawmakers. “The government has more than a comfortable majority,” a Congress leader said.While the Congress did not formally put out the number of lawmakers present, it did make public its resolution . The resolution, apart from extending support to Gehlot, blamed the BJP for the crisis and demanded action against legislators who were playing the BJP’s game. That was a dart aimed at Sachin Pilot, who is also the Rajasthan Congress president.Sachin Pilot’s camp, however, has made light of the resolution or the number of legislators backing it.The chief minister’s garden isn’t the place to prove the majority, the assembly is.”If they have numbers as claimed then why not do a head count, take them to the governor instead of moving them to a hotel,” sources close to Sachin Pilot said, according to news agency ANI.A Congress leader said the party and Gehlot were preparing for such eventualities. One option on the table, the Congress leader, is to parade the lawmakers before the governor. Since such a parade does not have any legal basis, there is a view that Gehlot should request the governor to convene a session of the assembly and move a confidence motion before letting the lawmakers at Fairmont resort head home.This is the second time in one month that the Congress has had to commandeer its lawmakers into a hotel. The first was right before the Rajya Sabha elections last month when Gehlot was worried that some lawmakers could vote against his two nominees.Also Read: Rajasthan govt in crisis as Sachin Pilot leads rebels outQuestions over the survival of Ashok Gehlot government peaked late last evening after Sachin Pilot’s camp claimed that he had the support of over 30 Congress and some independent MLAs.Gehlot, who had been primming for an all-out battle with his deputy for months, worked the phones through the night.At 2.30 am, the Congress in-charge for Rajasthan Avinash Pande announced at a press conference that they had secured the written support of 109 lawmakers. A meeting of the Congress legislature party was also convened for 10.30 am in Jaipur for a show of strength.The majority mark in the 200-member assembly is 101.The Gehlot camp, however, had some trouble ensuring their physical presence by the early Monday deadline and had to defer the meeting to afternoon. Before the meeting started, Randeep Surjewala and Ajay Maken, struck a conciliatory note, saying Pilot and the other MLAs could still attend the party meeting. The doors are open for them, Surjewala said. The resolution pushing for action against Pilot came later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashok-gehlot-aces-1st-test-sequesters-mlas-in-luxury-resort-to-prep-for-more/story-eMYy5ToFJl2tvrag9BmOiI.html

While on June 29 the city had 1,772 active cases, on Sunday the number was 3,568. The state has 10,500 active cases at present.While the state-government has prepared 10,862 beds in 80 Covid-19 designated hospitals across the state, in Kolkata there are 2,062 beds in seven state-run hospitals and hospitals that the government has designated as Covid-19 hospitals. In addition to this there are 1,414 beds in 32 private hospitals in Kolkata, including some of the city’s best known super-specialty hospitals, where Covid-19 patients are being treated. In North 24 Parganas and in the satellite towns of New Town and Salt Lake there are a few other private hospitals with around 336 beds.According to figures released by the government, in at least 13 of these 32 hospitals in the city there are no beds vacant as on date. In the rest, only around 218 beds were vacant as reported by the respective hospitals. “Government hospitals have more than 10,000 beds for Covid-19 patents across the state. Compared to this the private hospitals are limited and have less than 2,000 beds. Hence they are drying up fast. We still have a huge vacancy in government hospitals and the number of beds is also being increased,” said a top official of the state health department.In government hospitals 70% of the beds are vacant, while less than 20% of the private hospitals’ beds are vacant.“Most of the people living in cities like Kolkata and urban areas are more inclined towards private health care facilities even though the state-run hospitals in Bengal offer the best treatment at lower cost,” said an expert associated with the global advisory body that has been set up to advise the Mamata Banerjee administration.To cope up with the health crisis, many top private hospitals in the city have launched ‘home care packages’ for Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms undergoing treatment at home.“We have three packages ranging from Rs 4,500 to Rs 16,000. This includes tele-consultation, tool-kit comprising masks, PPE, gloves, pulse oximeter and vaporizer among others which are home delivered and emergency services such as free ambulance pick up. But the patient must be less than 58-years of age, must have mild symptoms and should not have diseases such as diabetes and asthma,” said a senior doctor of a hospital in south Kolkata.In June, the government had tied up with some private hospitals in Kolkata to start Satellite Health Facilities (SHFs), a variant of observation wards in healthcare units’ vicinity, where coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients with mild or no symptoms could be treated, while setting aside beds in the dedicated hospitals for critically-ill patients. Earlier, the state had come up with 106 “safe home centres” in Kolkata with a capacity of over 6,000 beds, where mild and asymptomatic patients could be treated.“Both these arrangements – SHFs and SHCs – were launched for the first time in India in a bid to keep hospital beds free for critically ill Covid-19 patients amid a daily spike in the number of positive cases,” a senior official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-vacancy-in-kolkata-s-private-hospitals-as-covid-19-cases-double-in-15-days/story-TQxhQfaU4AxVug1tWcQK6J.html

And they speak often and directly. They have great respect and affection for each other.”There has been no word on Twitter either from Rahul Gandhi on the Rajasthan crisis. The former Congress president tweeted twice on Monday. The first tweet questioned the government’s claim the fight against Covid-19 was going well and the second was about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s stand on the face off with China in Ladakh.This response came when HT asked for Rahul Gandhi’s response to whether he had been in touch with Pilot, who is said to have been furious after the Rajasthan Police’s Special Operations Group (SOG) summoned him for questioning after Gehlot claimed that the BJP was trying to lure Congress MLAs by bribing them with sums ranging from Rs 10 crore to Rs 15 crore.The SOG operates under Gehlot and although the chief minister was also summoned Pilot’s supporters claimed it was an eye wash.Pilot had claimed that the Ashok Gehlot government was in minority and that he had the support of over 30 MLAs in the 200-member Assembly.In the afternoon, the Rajasthan Congress Legislature Party passed a resolution in Jaipur supporting the Ashok Gehlot-led government in the state amid the tussle for power.It also recommended strong disciplinary action against any Congress MLA and office-bearer who conspires against the government.“This meeting urges that strict disciplinary action be taken against any office bearer or member of the legislature party who indulge in activities against the Congress government, party or gets involved in any conspiracy,” read the resolution.Party sources claimed that 106 MLAs, both from the Congress and those supporting it, were present in the meeting. Sachin Pilot and some of his loyalists did not attend it.The resolution expressed confidence in the leadership of national party president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi.Ahead of the meeting of the MLAs at the chief minister’s official residence, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala the party doors were still open for Pilot to sort out matters.“On behalf of Congress leadership, including Sonia ji and Rahul ji, I convey that doors of Congress party are always open for Sachin ji or any member,” Surjewala said.There has been no word from Sachin Pilot’s camp about his next step. The deputy CM’s aide told HT in the morning that the leader is not joining the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachin-pilot-always-in-rahul-gandhi-s-heart-says-congress-leader-s-office/story-zM9GFDIHcWTBCwnpvGIgqK.html

The NIA maintained that the smuggled gold was to be used not for jewellery but terror activities, ANI reported.The two key accused were earlier remanded to custody by the NIA court on Sunday, a day after they were taken into custody in Bengaluru.The two had been on the run since the Customs busted a gold smuggling racket on July 5 with the seizure of 30 kg gold from a chartered flight from the UAE that was carrying an consignment for the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram. The racket allegedly used diplomatic channels to smuggle the gold.Suresh, a former employee of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram, and Nair are among the four people booked by the NIA in the smuggling racket.The NIA which was ordered by the Union home ministry to probe the case, had on Friday registered an FIR under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. It said the case has international links with initial inquiries revealing the proceeds of the smuggled gold valued at Rs 15 crore could be used for terror financing in India.Suresh, Sarith PS and Nair of Thiruvananthapuram and Fazil Fareed of Ernakulam have been arraigned as accused. While Sarith was arrested by the Customs, Fareed is still at large.The gold smuggling racket has put the Kerala government under intense fire from the opposition with the Congress-led United Democratic Front on Monday deciding to bring in a no-confidence motion and seek Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s resignation alleging that his office was linked to the racket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-gets-custody-of-prime-accused-in-kerala-gold-smuggling-case-for-8-days/story-HA81gku0cXgsBvS4o3pItN.html
13-07-2020||India||Top Indian, Chinese generals to meet tomorrow as talks enter crucial stage||Senior Indian and Chinese military commanders are set to meet at Chushul in eastern Ladakh on Tuesday to negotiate the next stage of disengagement between the two armies along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), with the talks expected to focus on reducing tensions in the Finger Area and Depsang plains as well as pulling back weapons from friction points, people familiar with the developments said on Monday.This will be the fourth round of talks between the corps commander-ranked officers of the two armies who made previous attempts to reduce tensions along the disputed border on June 6, June 22 and June 30.Negotiations are expected to be far harder this time as the continued presence of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in the Finger Area and the Depsang sector could be the sticking point of the talks, said one of the officials cited above. The meeting is expected to begin at 11.30 am.In Tuesday’s talks, the two commanders are expected to discuss the step-wise withdrawal of weapons and equipment to mutually agreed distances from friction areas along the LAC and thinning the overall military buildup in the region, said a second official.This military dialogue will be followed by another meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs. The military commanders set the time-frame and method of disengagement while the WMCC monitors the process.The July 14 dialogue will be crucial as it will take up the Finger Area near Pangong Tso and the Depsang plains where there is Chinese intrusion across India’s perception of the LAC, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).“In both these locations, the Indian side should insist on restoration of status quo ante as anything less than this could leave us with a territorial disadvantage,” Hooda added.The military talks follow a series of steps taken by the two armies at friction points in Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra to implement a complex disengagement plan hammered out at the June 30 meeting between delegations led by Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region.The current disengagement process began after the June 30 military dialogue and a subsequent conversation on July 5 between national security adviser Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi. Even as uncertainty persists in the Finger Area and Depsang plains, the army is monitoring the withdrawal of the PLA from Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra, where 4-km buffer zones have come up.At the June 30 meeting, the Indian side reiterated its demand for the pullback of Chinese troops from friction points along the LAC and sought the restoration of status quo ante (the situation as it existed in early April) in the Finger Area, Galwan Valley, Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang plains, apart from emphasising the need for thinning the military buildup in the region.The disengagement effort involves rival troops pulling back a specified distance from face-off sites, with further retreat taking place in phases as the plan progresses on a verifiable basis on the ground every 72 hours by both sides.The creation of buffer zones has temporarily restricted the patrolling activities of both armies in the region. While some experts saw this as a necessary step, others cautioned that the temporary curtailing of patrolling rights should not become a long-term feature undermining Indian presence and control.The military build-up in Indian and Chinese depth areas hasn’t thinned, with both sides keeping their guard up. The deployment of thousands of soldiers, fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, artillery guns, missile systems and air defence weapons continues in the region.The PLA pulled back 2 km from Patrolling Point 14 (Galwan Valley), PP-15 (Hot Springs) and PP-17 (Gogra) last week, with the Indian Army withdrawing proportionately in these areas.The army observed some thinning of PLA troops, vehicles and removal of structures from a key spur in the Finger Area over the last week but it can’t be seen as disengagement, said a third official.The Finger Area, which refers to a set of eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range overlooking the Pangong lake, remains the biggest test and hardest part of the disengagement process, as reported by Hindustan Times last week.Before the PLA grabbed positions on Finger 4 overlooking Indian deployments, the army would patrol right up to Finger 8 that New Delhi considers within Indian territory. The new positions held by the PLA have curtailed the scope of Indian patrols. Fingers 4 and 8 are 8 km apart.The Indian claim line in this sector extends to Finger 8, while the Chinese claim is up to Finger 4 where the PLA has set up permanent bunkers, pillboxes, observation posts and tented camps over the last two months.The army is keeping a strict vigil along the contested border in the Depsang sector where the PLA’s forward presence is a matter of serious concern and where a 2013 Chinese intrusion blocked the access of Indian soldiers to several patrolling routes, including the ones leading to PPs-10, 11, 11A, 12 and 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-military-officers-meeting-to-be-held-tomorrow-at-chushul/story-32pS7EhdUEj3wJeyVM9fnI.html
13-07-2020||India||Former MP who led protests for Kapu reservations in Andhra, withdraws agitation||In a big setback to the politically-strong Kapu community in Andhra Pradesh, former MP Mudragada Padmanabham, who had been leading agitations for the last two decades demanding reservations for the community under Other Backward Classes (OBC) category, announced that he was withdrawing the agitation.The demand for provision of reservations for Kapus in education and employment under the OBC quota, on the lines of Jats in north India rocked Andhra Pradesh before and after the last assembly elections.Padmanabham, also a former minister and four-time MLA from East Godavari district, had been in the forefront of the agitations, including the one that turned violent at Tuni in January 2016, in which Kapu protesters set fire to Visakhapatnam-bound Ratnachal Express.In a statement on Monday, Padmanabham said he was withdrawing the agitation for Kapu quota as he was deeply hurt following a campaign against him by some community leaders through social and mainstream media.He was referring to the allegations that he had made big money during the agitations taken up during the Telugu Desam Party regime and had become silent after the TDP lost power in 2019.“I don’t know why they are making wild allegations. Are they under the impression that I have not given them a share in the money which I had allegedly received from industrialists and businessmen during the movement for Kapu reservations?” he asked.Padmanabham clarified that he had taken up the cause of the Kapus only because the previous Telugu Desam Party government led by former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu had gone back on its promise to include Kapus in the OBC list and give them reservations in education and employment.He clarified that he had never aspired for posts and positions or made big money through the Kapu agitation. “On the other hand, I have lost heavily both in terms of money and health. I always strived to uplift the Kapus,” he said.The former MP said though there were attempts by other Kapu leaders to hijack his movement, he had never felt bad about it. “I always welcomed the attempts of any leader who strived for Kapu quota. I never wanted the entire credit to myself,” he said.Kapus and their sub-castes of Balijas, Telagas and Ontaris, form a politically strong community in Andhra, constituting 15.2 per cent of the total population in the state. While they are spread all over the state, they are predominant in East and West Godavari districts which are considered as the Kapu belt.The Kapu community got politically polarized to some extent during 2009 elections when popular Telugu film hero K Chiranjeevi, who hails from the community, launched Praja Rajyam Party (PRP).The party, however, polled just around 17 per cent of the votes and won only 18 out of 294 assembly seats in the combined Andhra Pradesh. Subsequently, Chiranjeevi merged the PRP with the Congress.His brother Pawan Kalyan launched a separate political party Jana Sena in 2014, but his party did not contest the elections held for a divided Andhra Pradesh. Instead, he supported the TDP-BJP combine.However, in 2019 assembly elections, Jana Sena fought the elections independently and it was presumed that Pawan Kalyan would split the Kapu community votes to a large extent. But they voted largely in favour of YSR Congress party, which was evident from the way the party won 27 out of 34 seats in East and West Godavari districts.On the other hand, Jana Sena won just one assembly seat and less than 7 per cent votes. Pawan himself lost in both the assembly seats – Bhimavaram and Gajuwaka, which have considerable Kapu votes.After Jagan came to power, he ignored the Kapu quota demand. Instead, he recently launched YSR Kapu Nestham programme seeking to provide financial assistance to the economically weaker Kapus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-mp-who-led-protests-for-kapu-reservations-in-andhra-withdraws-agitation/story-Rdum1jR7lX1C4ZxlzxKE2J.html

The antiviral oral drug is marketed under the brand name FabiFlu and was formally launched in the country on June 21.The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) granted it approval for Covid-19 treatment under emergency use authorisation, which means since there is limited data available on the medicine’s performance on Covid-19 positive cases, doctors prescribing it would have to document the written consent of a patient.“The price reduction has been made possible through benefits gained from higher yields and better scale, as both the API (active pharmaceutical ingredient) and formulations are made at Glenmark’s facilities in India, the benefits of which are being passed on to patients in the country,” said the company in a statement.“Glenmark has successfully developed API and the formulation for FabiFlu through its own in-house R&D (research & development) team within the country, ensuring self-reliance with regard to long-term production and manufacturing. The API is manufactured at the Gujarat production facility which is USFDA (United States Food and Drug Administration) and MHRA-UK (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency – the United Kingdom) approved. The formulation product is manufactured at the facility in Himachal Pradesh, which is also USFDA and MHRA-UK approved,” it added.The company also announced that it has started a post-marketing surveillance (PMS) study on FabiFlu in a bid to closely monitor the efficacy and safety of the drug in 1,000 Covid-19 patients that are prescribed the drug as part of an open-label, multicentre, single-arm study.“We expect this PMS study to shed more light on the drug’s clinical effectiveness and safety in a large section of patients prescribed FabiFlu. Our priority from the start of this pandemic has been to offer effective treatment for Covid-19 patent and also ensure accessibility to the masses. Our internal research shows us that we launched FabiFlu in the country at the lowest market cost, as compared to the cost of Favipiravir in other countries, where it is approved. This further price reduction will make it even more accessible for patients across the country,” said Alok Malik, senior vice president, and head – India business, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd.Initially, FabiFlu was launched in India at Rs103 a tablet, while its equivalent price is higher in other countries such as Russia (Rs 600), Japan (Rs 378), Bangladesh (Rs 315), and China (Rs 215).“Most patients exhibiting mild to moderate symptoms can benefit from FabiFlu use. Glenmark has also completed the phase-III clinical trial with Favipiravir (FabiFlu) in mild to moderate Covid-19 patients in India. The trial results will be available shortly,” said the company in a statement.Glenmark is also conducting another phase-III clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of two antivirals drugs, Favipiravir and Umifenovir, as a combination therapy in moderate hospitalised adult Covid-19 patients in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/glenmark-pharma-drops-price-of-covid-19-drug-favipiravir-to-rs-75-tablet/story-VNVG3UWN0strJyqXkY1gTM.html
13-07-2020||India||SC turns down plea for restrictions on Amarnath Yatra for Covid-19||The Supreme Court Monday refused to entertain a plea which sought directions for restriction for the Amarnath Yatra in Jammu and Kashmir due to the Covid-19 pandemic.A three-judge bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud dismissed a PIL filed by Shri Amarnath Barfani Langars Organization. The Court left it to the local administration and refused to interfere with the steps they were taking by restricting pilgrims this year. The Court cited the principle of separation of powers and said the administration would take a call on it.The PIL by Shri Amarnath Barfani Langars Organisation had sought a direction to the Centre, Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir and Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board to restrict the access of pilgrims in the Yatra this year in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.The plea had also sought a direction for ‘live darshan’ of Lord Shri Amarnath Ji Shrine on the internet and television.The Jammu and Kashmir administration has already curtailed the Amarnath yatra to a 12-day affair and has limited the number of pilgrims who will be allowed to prooceed to the Amarnath caves every day. The pilgrimage is likely to be held from July 21 to August 3.A thousand pilgrims will be allowed to take a helicopter ride and another 500 will be allowed on foot through the shorter Baltal route each day of the pilgrimage.Earlier this month, Jammu and Kashmir chief secretary BVR Subrahmanyam said the pilgrimage would have to be undertaken in a restricted manner so that the SoPs to contain the spread of Covid-19 can be strictly enforced.Subrahmanyam said that in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the State Executive Committee constituted under the Disaster Management Act has issued SoPs which among other things prescribe 100% RT-PCR test for all persons travelling into Jammu and Kashmir. Anyone travelling to J&K will have to be sampled, tested and quarantined till they are reported to be negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-turns-down-plea-for-restrictions-on-amarnath-yatra-for-covid-19/story-x5uv5GReXYX7rG899dw2CK.html
13-07-2020||India||Not our victory, says ex-royal family on Padmanabha Swamy temple verdict||The erstwhile royal family of Travancore, whose rights on the administration of age-old Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple in Thiruvananthapuram were upheld by the Supreme Court on Monday, welcomed the verdict thanking all devotees and others who stood with them during the long years of legal battle.The state government made it clear that it has no plan to go in for a review or appeal and it will go by the verdict of the apex court even as devotees took to streets in large numbers to celebrate it by distributing sweets. Since lockdown was in place in the state capital they took care to avoid a big gathering outside the temple.“It is not the victory of the royal family. It is the victory of people and devotees. Finally, the will of the Lord Padmanabha Swamy prevailed. We dedicate this to the presiding deity,” said Aswathi Tirunal Lakshmi Bhai, a member of the ex-royal family. She thanked all devotees and others who stood with them in trying times.“It is a landmark judgment which upholds devotees’ rights. Under Article 25 &26, devotees enjoy every right to manage their places of worship. But in some communities the government holds this power. Let it be a pluralistic and uniform status,” said Rahul Iswar, an activist belonging to the tantri (head priest) family of Sabarimala hill temple. He said the latest verdict will have its bearing on similar cases relating to faith, including Sabarimala.In 2018 a five-member bench of the Supreme Court had allowed women of all ages to worship at the hill temple which led to a series of violent protests as women of child-bearing age were barred here citing the eternal celibate status (nishtika brahmachari) of the presiding deity. In an unusual move, the Supreme Court decided to take a relook and referred the issue to a larger bench.“The temple and its huge wealth existed because of the royal family. Had it been in the hands of politicians it would have been looted long back,” said a devotee Saradha M Thampi. “It is a welcome verdict. With this uncertainty over the custody of the shrine will be over,” said historian M G Sasibushan.Like in Sabarimala, the Congress-led UDF favoured a status quo in Padmanabha Swamy temple also but the CPI(M)-led government wanted a government-controlled body to manage the temple affairs on the lines of Guruvayur and Travancore Devaswom boards where chairmen are appointed by the government, always politicians. Former chief minister VS Achuthanandan had once said scions of the royal family were in a race to loot Padmanabha Swamy temple inviting enough criticism from many quarters. The opposition Congress and BJP also lauded the verdict.“It is another slap on the face of the government. It should apologise to devotees for trampling their rights,” said BJP state president K Surendran. “With his verdict we hope the government will respect age-old beliefs and customs of people,” said former chief minister Oommen Chandy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-our-victory-says-ex-royal-family-on-padmanabha-swamy-temple-verdict/story-7QlY6G6G36AeKVJEfNCmeP.html

Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot is also reported to have boarded the bus along with his legislators. Ashok Gehlot had called the legislature party meeting this afternoon to flaunt lawmakers supporting his government, smiled broadly for the cameras and even flashed the victory sign, a rebuttal to his deputy Sachin Pilot, who claimed last evening that Gehlot-led government had been reduced to a minority.Pilot’s camp had last night claimed the support of 30 MLAs. The messaging from Pilot forced the Congress to call for a press briefing at 2:30 am late last night saying it had the support o f 109 MLAs.In the 200-member house, the majority mark is 101. The Congress before Pilot decided to rebel, had a strength of 107 MLAs and support from other independents. The MLAs were seen boarding buses headed towards a hotel after their meeting at the chief minister’s official residence.The meeting endorsed the leadership of Ashok Gehlot and blamed the BJP for “ripping of the democracy” by trying to destabilise an elected government. It also called for action against those working against the interests of the party.“This meet urges that strict disciplinary action be taken against any office bearer or member of legislature party who indulge in activities against the Congress government, party or gets involved in any conspiracy,” read the resolution.“All is well,” minister Mamta Bhupesh told news agency PTI before boarding one of the buses. A few weeks ago ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls, the Congress had shifted its MLAs to a resort for about a week to ensure that they were not “lured” away before the voting. Before the meeting of lawmakers started at the chief minister’s official residence, Randeep Surjewala declared that the party hadn’t shut its doors on Sachin Pilot. The Congress leadership has spoken to Pilot a number of times over the last 48 hours and if anyone is upset in a family, they should be sitting together with other members to work things out.“On behalf of Congress leadership, including Sonia ji and Rahul ji, I convey that doors of Congress party are always open for Sachin ji or any member,” Surjewala said.There has been no word from Sachin Pilot’s camp about his next step. The deputy CM’s aide told HT this morning that the leader is not joining the BJP. At the state party headquarters, party workers had taken down posters and banners that had a photograph of the state unit chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-party-meet-gehlot-and-mlas-head-to-resort-as-sachin-pilot-holds-firm/story-h14XJbYMZma8i0QibE2uoI.html

On Sunday, Pakistan initiated cross-border firing in Nowshera sector of Rajouri and Kirni and Qasba sectors of Poonch.The 3,289 violations of the mutually-brokered a truce deal in November 2003 were recorded last year and were the highest in 16 years.“The COAS (chief of army staff) reinstated the fact of ‘zero tolerance’ against the ceasefire violations by Pakistan and infiltration attempts by terrorists,” Lieutenant Colonel Devender Anand said in a statement.“He further highlighted that all agencies of the services and Govt are working together relentlessly and will continue to do the same to defeat the nefarious design of proxy war being fueled by our adversaries,” he added.The comments came Gen Naravane visited the forward areas along India’s 198 kilometre-long international border with Pakistan to review the security scenario and preparedness of troops deployed in Jammu-Pathankot region.He interacted with the field formation commanders and troops during his visit.

13-07-2020||India||Moments before Gehlot’s show of strength meet, photo-op to make his point||Ahead of a meeting of Rajasthan lawmakers supporting his government, chief minister Ashok Gehlot invited the media into his official residence for a photo session to back up his claim that the rebellion by deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot hadn’t succeeded in reducing his government to a minority. Gehlot camp leaders have claimed that the chief minister had the support of more than 101 lawmakers, the majority mark in the 200-member assembly.Not everyone of the 107-plus lawmakers claimed by Gehlot’s camp was present. Gehlot’s supporters said some more MLAs were on their way to the chief minister’s official residence. The meeting, scheduled to begin at 10.30 am, was reportedly put off to enable more lawmakers to join in.Congress leaders Ajay Maken, Randeep Singh Surjewala and Rajasthan in-charge Avinash Pande were also present at the meeting.Ashok Gehlot will address a media briefing after the meeting of lawmakers is over.The Congress-led alliance in Rajasthan had the support of 125 lawmakers - 107 from the Congress - before Sachin Pilot, the party’s state unit chief and Gehlot’s deputy in the government, threatened to walk out of the party.Sachin Pilot, who had led the Congress’s campaign for the 2018, has been sore that he hadn’t received his due. Gehlot had agreed to have him as his deputy in the government at the end of negotiations running into several days but has been accused by Pilot’s camp of undercutting the 42-year-old ever since. Lately, Gehlot’s camp had been nudging the leadership to drop Pilot from the Rajasthan Congress chief’s post.Congress leaders have been on an overdrive to save the government after Sachin Pilot’s camp last evening claimed to have the support of 30 lawmakers, spending a sleepless night to reach out to each legislator and allies to get them to support Gehlot. At a 2.30 am press conference, Rajasthan Congress in-charge Avinash Pande claimed to have letters of support from 109 lawmakers. Some more, he said, would sign by morning.Before the meeting of lawmakers started at the chief minister’s official residence, Randeep Surjewala declared that the party hadn’t shut its doors on Sachin Pilot. The Congress leadership has spoken to Pilot a number of times over the last 48 hours and if anyone is upset in a family, they should be sitting together with other members to work things out.“On behalf of Congress leadership, including Sonia ji and Rahul ji, I convey that doors of Congress party are always open for Sachin ji or any member,” Surjewala said.There has been no word from Sachin Pilot’s camp about his next step. But the Rajasthan Congress appeared to be prepping to its future minus Pilot in the leadership role. At the state party headquarters about 7 km away , party workers had taken down posters and banners that had a photograph of the state unit chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashok-gehlot-puts-on-a-show-of-mlas-as-sachin-pilot-stays-back-in-delhi/story-1zQ8sbCjR31mzwAhTPhkSK.html
13-07-2020||India||Court denies bail to AAP leader Tahir Hussain in IB staffer’s murder in Delhi riots||A Delhi court on Monday denied bail to former Aam Aadmi Party Councillor Tahir Hussain in connection with the murder of IB official Ankit Tiwari during the north-east Delhi riots, adding that Hussain was present at the crime spot and used rioters as “human weapons, who on his instigation could have killed anybody”.Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav refused to grant bail to Hussain, who had been charge sheeted by the Delhi police for playing a “pivotal role in the incident”, while stating that there is “enough material” on record by way of witness accounts. “….There is enough material on record to presume that Hussain was very well present at the spot of crime and was exhorting the rioters of a particular community and as such, he did not use his hands and fists, but used rioters as “human weapons”, who on his instigation could have killed anybody.“It is again a matter of record that the investigation in the matter is still under progress as some other persons have to be apprehended. Statement of two more persons have been recorded by crime branch on July 7 namely Rahul Kasana and Girish Pal, who both have stated about the conspiracy of communal riots hatched at the residence of applicant on February 24,” the judge said in his 21-page order.The court said that the possibility of Hussain threatening the witnesses also cannot be ruled out if he is released at this stage. It said that the riots in the area of north-east Delhi were carried out in an organised manner and as part of deep-rooted conspiracy and Hussain’s involvement is being investigated with regard to his connection with members of PFI, Pinjra Tod, Jamia Coordination Committee, United Against Hate Group and anti-CAA protesters.Appearing for Hussain, his counsel Javed Ali had contended that there is no cogent evidence which is admissible in the eyes of law to connect his client in the alleged murder of Ankit Sharma. He said that there is a delay in recording the statements of the witnesses and Hussain was not present at the spot on the day of the incident.The court, however, said that “the statements of witnesses can be said to be delayed when the witnesses are known to the police and yet police do not record their statements; whereas, in a case of rioting, police hardly have any idea as to who were the witnesses”.“Further, people normally do not come forward and it is an admitted position on record that on the date of incident nearly 10,000 PCR calls were recorded in the area of PS Dayalpur. Thereafter, on the basis of these calls, police called back and traced out some of the witnesses. Therefore, at this stage, it cannot be said that there is delay in recording of statements of witnesses by the investigating agency,” said the court.Advocate Javed Ali for Hussain also submitted that there is no evidence by way of video footage or CCTV footage to prove that Hussain was present at the scene of crime at the time of incident.Further, there is no evidence of abetment or conspiracy to kill Ankit Sharma, Ali added. He also said that one of the co-accused Haseen had categorically admitted in his extra-judicial confession about murder of Ankit Sharma by him alone, which clearly exculpates Hussain.However, opposing the bail application, the public prosecutor told the court that several prosecution witnesses have clearly identified Hussain at the scene of crime, instigating the rioters of a particular community and exhorting them to kill the people of other communities.The PP said that the witnesses have deposed before the magistrate that Hussain had incited the religious feelings of rioters from a particular community, as a consequence the rioters killed Ankit Sharma.The city police’s crime branch had earlier filed a charge sheet against 15 people, including Hussain and his younger brother Shah Alam. The police had contended here was recovery of crates containing glass bottles having some liquid filled in them and their necks stuffed with pieces of cloth. It said that these were as “Molotov cocktails” while adding that a large number of bricks, stone pieces and three catapults were also seized from Hussain’s house. It said that this point towards the conspiracy and the extent of preparation for causing riots in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-denies-bail-to-aap-leader-tahir-hussain-in-ib-staffer-s-murder-in-delhi-riots/story-LWU0CppA7W13lu4TT3aLfK.html

The Congress had issued a whip to all its MLAs, stating that the attendance of the meeting at CM’s official residence was mandatory.Amid the backdrop of the high-voltage political drama in Rajasthan, a re-run of a similar rebellion in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh in March that had led to the toppling of the Kamal Nath-led government, the banners with Pilot’s pictures were removed from the boundary wall of the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) office in Jaipur on Monday morning. The state party office wore a deserted look on Monday morning.Pratap Singh, Jaipur district president of the Congress and state transport minister, took a potshot at the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders for their bid “to destabiliise an elected government” in Rajasthan, but stopped short of naming Pilot as the wrecker-in-chief.“People voted for the party (the Congress) and now they (the BJP leaders) are insulting the people’s mandate,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachin-pilot-s-posters-removed-from-rajasthan-congress-office-in-jaipur/story-tb4PDOhtgcpDkUo12tBsdP.html

13-07-2020||India||As Covid cases spike, half of Srinagar locks down||Lockdown restrictions returned in many parts of the Union Territory (UT) of Jammu & Kashmir’s capital, Srinagar, on Monday, as the authorities sealed several areas amid a surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive cases over the past week.On Monday morning, the authorities, including police personnel, can be seen roaming on Srinagar’s streets and urging the public to stay indoors.“People are requested not to come out of their homes. Only your co-operation can help in the containment of this viral disease,” said the announcements made via public address system fitted on the vehicles.Shops and markets are closed and intra-district movement of mini-buses and private taxis has also been suspended.The roads are nearly deserted amid a massive presence of J&K Police and paramilitary forces.“The police have erected iron barricades and sealed roads in the containment zones. There is hardly any vehicular movement, except those for emergency services,” said Javaid Ahmad of Nowpora, a containment zone in Srinagar.On Sunday, J&K administration had ordered a partial lockdown in Srinagar — the worst-affected district in the UT — by designating over 88 containment zones amid a surge in Covid-19 positive cases over the past week, officials said.The lockdown is being imposed in 88 red zones of the city and no movement would be allowed in these areas without permission, they said.Shahid Chaudhary, deputy commissioner (DC), Srinagar, said that penalties have been increased such as Rs 1,000 for not wearing face masks in public places and Rs 10,000 for violating social distancing norms.Srinagar’s main thoroughfares are open, but the by-lanes and interiors of the city are off-limits for the public.“It took me 45 minutes to reach Khanyar from Karan Nagar, which usually takes a maximum of 15 minutes because all interior link roads have been barricaded. All markets are shut and a few people are out on the roads,” said Mohammad Saabit, a businessman from Srinagar’s Old City.J&K has reported 10,513 Covid-19 positive cases until Sunday since the first viral outbreak case was reported in the UT on March 9. The death toll stands at 179, including 162 and 17 in Kashmir and Jammu divisions, respectively, until Saturday.Srinagar has recorded 1,708 Covid-19 positive cases, including 1,145 active ones and 44 fatalities.Some areas have been de-notified, where there is no restriction on the movement of people, but authorities are urging the public to compulsorily wear face masks and strictly maintain social distancing norms in these areas.DC Chaudhary said 24 existing containment zones have been partially de-notified after they didn’t report any fresh Covid-19 positive cases.“We are thankful to the public for their co-operation and observing norms to bring their areas out of it. Gratitude to field teams for all the efforts. Let’s continue to observe precautions,” Chaudhary said.Healthcare experts have warned that hospitals in Srinagar would “crumble under pressure” if the administration did not impose lockdown restrictions soon amid a spike in Covid-19 positive cases.The Kashmir Valley has reported more Covid-19-related deaths since June 7, which has recorded a 73% spike in the total fatalities and 78 people succumbed to their viral infection in the past 12 days alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-covid-cases-spike-half-of-srinagar-locks-down/story-bqSOVTpQPLwAmAKheDpgUJ.html

13-07-2020||India||Sanjay Jha wades into Gehlot vs Pilot in Rajasthan, faults Cong for turmoil||Sanjay Jha, the Congress leader sacked last month as party spokesperson last month for his critical comments, on Monday sided with Sachin Pilot who led the Congress campaign in the 2018 assembly elections but had to settle as the number 2 in the Rajasthan government. “I fully back Sachin Pilot,” Sanjay Jha said, expressing support to Sachin Pilot who rebuilt the party during the years that he was Rajasthan Congress chief.Jha, a familiar face of the Congress on television debates, was sacked as the party spokesperson’s post after a newspaper article that was severely critical of the party leadership.His tweets came around the same time that the Congress, after several phone calls from the party leadership to Pilot, decided to follow up with a public appeal. Congress spokesperson Randeep Sdustaurjewala told reporters that the party’s doors were open for him. The Congress-led coalition has 125 lawmakers in the 200-member assembly. The majority mark is 101.“Look at the facts,” Jha said, underlining that the Congress had reached its lowest tally of 21 seats in the 2013 elections when Ashok Gehlot was the chief minister. Sachin Pilot was appointed the Rajasthan Congress president the next year.In 2018 - when Pilot had a lead role in the election campaign - the Congress ended up with 100 seats and more than halved the BJP’s presence in the assembly, down from 163 in 2013 to 73.“One man slogged 5 years for it; Sachin. But who becomes the CM?” he said, crediting the Congress “spectacular single-handed comeback” in 2018 to Sachin Pilot. He also wondered if Gehlot, who had already twice been the chief minister, needed to become the chief minister for a third time.To be sure, Sachin Pilot and his supporters had tried hard to persuade the Congress leadership in the days after the 2018 elections that the 42-year-old should be given an opportunity to run Rajasthan. But Gehlot had been unwilling to back down. Eventually, the Congress attempted a balancing act by giving Gehlot a lead role and convincing Pilot to be his number 2.But the two clearly did not get along, particularly over the assessment in the Pilot camp that Gehlot had been trying to undercut him and appoint bureaucrats in ministries held by Pilot. A parallel campaign had also started within the party to seek Pilot’s removal as the Rajasthan Congress chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sanjay-jha-wades-into-gehlot-vs-pilot-in-rajasthan-faults-cong-for-turmoil/story-IhOjo3ZhC7sYRaLiXqc82H.html

13-07-2020||India||Maharashtra: Major cities under stricter lockdown till weekend as Covid cases surge||The growing number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive cases have led most of the civic bodies in Maharashtra to enforce stricter lockdown restrictions that have been extended until July 19.Besides the municipal corporations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad Aurangabad, and Solapur have also extended the lockdown restrictions.Thane, Kalyan-Dombivali, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Navi Mumbai – part of the densely populated MMR – have imposed a new round of lockdown restrictions until July 19.Similar steps have been taken by Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad Solapur, and Aurangabad municipal corporations.While Nagpur and Nashik civic bodies have warned the public of imposing similar lockdown restrictions if the overcrowding on streets goes out of control.Mumbai, however, has succeeded in stabilising the spike over the past few weeks, officials said.In Maharashtra, the Covid-19 positive cases have spiked amid the state government’s Mission Begin Again campaign that started from June 3 in a bid to open up commercial activities to revive the economy battered by the viral outbreak.On June 3, Maharashtra’s Covid-19 count and fatalities stood at 74,680 and 2,587, respectively.But, a month on, the corresponding tallies had risen to 1,92,990 and 8,376, respectively.The viral outbreak was pronounced in several densely populated urban parts of the state, including MMR, Pune Metropolitan Region, Nashik, Aurangabad, and Solapur, prompting civic authorities to enforce stricter lockdown restrictions by prohibiting the public from stepping out of their homes unless for essential services.“The state government was planning to roll out the next phase of Mission Begin Again campaign by allowing more employees to attend private companies and easing public transport restrictions from the first week of July. However, MMR civic bodies opposed the move because of a spike in Covid-19 positive cases owing to the increase in movement of the public between Mumbai and adjoining urban centres such as Thane, Kalyan-Dombiwali, and Mira-Bhayandar. The municipal authorities have demanded an extension in lockdown restrictions in a bid to rein in the viral outbreak. This is the crucial week as far as containment and the viral spread is concerned. We expect the viral scourge to stabilise soon,” said a state government official requesting anonymity.Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had held a meeting with the civic bodies last week, except the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), and directed the MMR chief to take a leaf of the BMC’s book by ramping up their respective healthcare infrastructure.Nashik’s guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal has warned the public that stricter lockdown restrictions would be imposed if norms are found to be violated.“The lockdown norms were relaxed in a bid to revive the economy. But, the public has stopped following the norms, triggering the spike in Covid-19 positive cases. We will be forced to impose stricter lockdown restrictions, if the public doesn’t pay heed to our advice,” Nagpur municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe had said on Saturday.Maharashtra has reported 2.54 lakh Covid-19 positive cases and 10,289 viral outbreak-related deaths until Sunday – the highest in the country on both counts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-major-cities-under-stricter-lockdown-till-weekend-as-covid-cases-surge/story-n2zV1biJzKgMhOMjtn5cGL.html

We will work to resolve it together and keep our government intact in the state,” Sujrewala added. Amid the ongoing political tussle in Rajasthan, a close aide of Pilot told HT that the deputy chief minister is unlikely to join the Bharatiya Janata Party.According to Pilot’s supporters, the deputy CM had raised issues against the functioning of chief minister Gehlot over the past fortnight. “His concerns were not addressed,” said a party leader considered close to Pilot. If anyone, be at any post or profile, has any problem, they must come forward and mention the issue on the party forum.

The BJP has 72 seats in the 200-member Assembly.As many as 30 Congress MLAs and some independent legislators who are in touch with Sachin Pilot have pledged their support to him. The Congress, however, has maintained that a total of “109 MLAs have signed a letter expressing their trust and support to a government led by CM Ashok Gehlot”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-political-crisis-in-rajasthan-cong-says-leadership-spoke-to-sachin-pilot-number-of-times-over-last-48-hours/story-gHB49xNjps8bRwjUb7qZ1N.html
13-07-2020||India||SC confirms Travancore royal family’s rights in running of Kerala temple||The Supreme Court (SC) on Monday upheld the rights of the Travancore royal family over the Padmanabhaswamy temple at Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, putting an end to the 11-year-old litigation.A two-member SC bench, headed by Justices UU Lalit and Indu Malhotra, allowed the appeal filed by the king of the Travancore royal family challenging a 2011 Kerala high court (HC) judgment that had given the rights over the temple to the Kerala government.The court held that the Shebaitship -- the right to maintain and manage the temple and the deity -- of the royal family over the shrine would not come to an end with the death of the ruler in 1991, who had signed the instrument of accession with the Indian government by which the erstwhile princely state of Travancore had merged with the Indian Union.The court ordered that for now, an administrative committee with the district judge of Thiruvananthapuram, as its chairperson, would manage the shrine’s daily administration.The temple had come under media glare when the apex court in 2011 had ordered an inventory of the temple and its properties. This led to the opening of five of the six vaults of the temple, leading to the discovery of treasure trove valued at around Rs 90,000 crore.One of the vaults, vault B, was not opened and it was later put on hold by the court. Now, the administrative committee will decide whether vault B should be opened.The temple was under the management of a trust headed by the king of the royal family, when a public interest litigation (PIL) was filed in 2009 in Kerala HC by a former Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, TP Sundara Rajan, praying that its control should be handed over to the Kerala government.This petition was entertained by the Kerala HC, which had held in January 2011 that after Chithira Thirunal Balaverma, the ruler, who signed agreement of the accession with the Indian government, passed away in 1991, the temple would stand vested with the Kerala government.The royal family then moved the SC, which, in 2014, constituted an administrative committee to manage the temple in the interim.In August 2012, senior advocate Gopal Subramanium was appointed amicus curiae (friend of the court) by the SC. Subramanium submitted a voluminous report before the court in April 2014, alleging serious mismanagement of the temple by the trust and indicting the royal family on various counts.The court after accepting the report set up an administrative committee on April 24, 2014, to manage the temple in the interim and also ordered a special audit of the temple and its properties by Vinod Rai, the former Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-confirms-travancore-royal-family-s-rights-in-running-of-kerala-temple/story-zs7raGS7I4e8P46KewXCgP.html

13-07-2020||India||Padmanabha Swamy Temple to be managed by ex-royal family, rules Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Monday sided with the erstwhile Travancore Royal family for the administration and control of the Padmanabha Swamy temple in Kerala. Settling the long-running dispute, the top court overturned the January 2011 judgment of the Kerala high court which had ruled that the state government should take over the control of the temple from a trust headed by the former royal family.“Great God’s will prevailed. Will say more about it after going through the whole verdict,” said Princess Gowri Lakshmibai of the erstwhile Travancore royal family soon after the judgment.Devotees came out in large numbers and distributed sweets before the sixth century temple, situated in the heart of the state capital Thiruvananthapuram. Some devotees were even seen crying before the temple. The Kerala state government welcomed the verdict.“We are bound to go by the verdict. We have always followed the apex court order in letter and spirit,” said state Devaswom minister Kadakampally Surendran. The temple shot into limelight after the top court in May 2011 ordered a detailed inventory of the articles in the temple vaults which had long rumoured to be holding immense riches.When five its six vaults, known as ‘Kallara’ in Malayalam, were opened in line with the court order, vast treasure of gold and other priceless objects were discovered. It was estimated that the intrinsic value of the treasure amounted to more than Rs 90,000 crore. One of the vaults, Kallara B could not be opened and the opening of the same was later kept in abeyance by the apex court.In August 2012, senior advocate Gopal Subramanium was appointed Amicus Curiae (friend of the court) by the Supreme Court. Subramanium submitted a voluminous report before the court in April 2014 alleging serious mismanagement of the temple by the trust and indicting the royal family on various counts.The temple was under the control of a trust headed by the ex-royals’ family until April 2014 when the top court by way of a crucial interim order handed over its management to a four-member administrative committee headed by a district judge.The legal genesis of the dispute lies in the agreement of accession (agreement) signed between the Kings of Travancore with the Government of India in 1949 by which the princely state of Travancore became a part of the Indian Union.Article VII of the agreement provided that administration of the Padmanabha Swamy temple shall be conducted, subject to the control and supervision of the ruler of Travancore, by an executive officer appointed by the ruler.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-upholds-the-rights-of-travancore-royal-family-to-administer-kerala-s-padmanabhaswamy-temple/story-0Ts5b1lxLfD5QOgPXGIYcM.html

Few more MLAs had telephonic conversation with CM and they’ll also sign a letter of support till morning,” said Pande at a 2:30 am press briefing.

My demand for a Rs 450-crore irrigation project for the region was accepted by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan two days back despite the state government facing a financial constraint,” Lodhi said after he joined the BJP. “Two other projects have been sanctioned for the region. I have joined the BJP for development of my region and BJP’s policies are public welfare-oriented,” he added.Soon after he joined the BJP, he was appointed the chairperson of the Civil Supplies Corporation.Lodhi, who is considered close to former chief minister Uma Bharti and Union minister Prahlad Patel, won the 2018 state assembly elections from Malhara seat in Chhatarpur district 19 months ago to enter the House the first time. Protem speaker of state assembly Rameshwar Sharma said on Sunday Lodhi tendered his resignation from the state assembly on Saturday. “I asked him to not to take such a decision in haste and consult others whoever he wanted to, before taking a final decision on the same. Today, he appeared before me and said his decision to resign from the state assembly was final and he didn’t want to work as an MLA. I have accepted his resignation and further proceedings have been initiated in this regard,” Sharma said.State Congress president Kamal Nath’s media coordinator Narendra Saluja accused the BJP of trying to kill democracy “as it doesn’t believe in democratic values and institutions.”“First, it dislodged democratically elected Congress government in Madhya Pradesh in March by indulging in a horse-trading and now it doesn’t want any opposition’s voice. That’s why it’s trying to poach the Opposition MLAs. But the public will give a befitting reply to the BJP in the by-polls,” Saluja said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-rajasthan-crisis-congress-suffers-another-jolt-in-madhya-pradesh-as-mla-joins-bjp/story-esAijJVd8SWbFqoA3ie3UJ.html

The majority mark in the 200-member assembly is 101.“A total of 109 MLAs have signed a letter expressing their trust and support to government led by CM Ashok Gehlot and leadership of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi.Few more MLAs had telephonic conversation with the CM and they’ll also sign letter of support till morning,” said Rajasthan Congress in-charge Avinash Pande late into the night at a press conference after a legislature party meeting at Ashok Gehlot’s residence in Jaipur.Pande said a whip has been issued to all party MLAs to be mandatorily present at Congress legislature party meeting to be held on Monday morning, adding strict disciplinary action will be taken against any MLA who is absent without mentioning any reason. The Rajasthan state-in charge upon being asked if he met Sachin Pilot in Delhi feigned ignorance about the latter’s presence in the national capital. Deputy CM Sachin Pilot, who has been camping in Delhi with his MLAs, has said he will not be attending the meeting. The Congress had rushed two central observers – Randeep Singh Surjewala and Ajay Maken – to Jaipur yesterday in a bid to iron out differences between Pilot and CM Ashok Gehlot, who have differed on a number of issues since the formation of the party’s government in 2018.“The Ashok Gehlot government is in minority after over 30 Congress and some independent MLAs have pledged their support to Sachin Pilot,” said the statement released by Pilot’s media office yesterday.In the 200-member assembly, the Congress has the support of 125 MLAs, including 107 of its own legislators.

The Congress sought to downplay it, saying a similar notice was sent to Gehlot as well. Leaders close to Pilot called it a “joke” since the chief minister is also in charge of the home department that oversees the police force. Pilot’s camp said the July 10 notice is yet another move to “humiliate” the deputy chief minister and “undermine” his authority.With Pilot rushing to Delhi on Saturday, some Congress legislators backing him and a few Rajasthan BJP MLAs are said to be staying in a five-star hotel in Manesar on the outskirts of Delhi.For the Congress, the developments in Rajasthan could be reminiscent of what happened in Madhya Pradesh in March, when 24 legislators owing allegiance to Jyotiraditya Scindia resigned from the party and the state assembly, reducing chief minister Kamal Nath’s government to a minority.

There is reportedly heavy concentration of Chinese PLA soldiers in the disputed area,” NSCN-IM said in a press release issued on Sunday.“After the Galwan incident in June, this Longding killing of 6 NSCN-IM personnel by Indian security forces may be understood to send the message across that Indian Army will not tolerate any forces who dare to come too close for comfort,” it added.The release was referring to the violent face-off between the Indian Army and Chinese People’s Liberation Army in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley during which 20 Indian soldiers were killed.The biggest of the Naga insurgent outfits, NSCN-IM has been in peace talks with Centre since 1997 and signed a framework agreement in August 2015. Also read: India to reduce over-dependence on Chinese pharmaceutical raw materialsThough peace talks with NSCN-IM and other pro-talks rebel outfits concluded in October 2019 a formal deal to end the decades-old Naga political problem is still awaited.Terming the encounter in Longding as an instance of “state-sponsored terrorism”, NSCN-IM stated that the outfit has been “driven to the wall after repeated provocation and aggression”.“The goodwill spirit of the ceasefire has been stamped to the ground. The ceasefire has lost its meaning because ceasefire can only make sense where there is mutual respect,” said the NSCN-IM release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/our-cadres-killed-in-arunachal-pradesh-to-send-message-to-china-says-nscn-im/story-3qpLwh7wiRfpwZV3EgPoPI.html

They are capable to protect the borders against any kind of enemy with all their might and efficiency,” the 1984-batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer said.“The morale of the troops of the army and border guarding forces is very high. Since independence, the security forces have made numerous sacrifices to protect the country’s borders and for security of the country whether is is external threat or internal security,” he said.“You can see our forces are quick and alert to ensure protection,” Deswal said.All the security arrangements are in place at the borders and we can say that the country’s security is ensured, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forces-have-full-possession-of-all-our-country-s-land-says-itbp-chief/story-LWSpcjdm0gQcvHZXQMcWIM.html

13-07-2020||India||US UAV, Israeli loitering bombs as Indian infantry gets lethal||The Indian army has set its eyes on acquiring hand-launched, remotely controlled unmanned aerial vehicle Raven from US and state-of-the-art Israeli Spike Firefly “loitering” ammunition to add lethality to its ground infantry apart from long-range precision artillery shells with a range of over 40 kilometres.While the army is sharpening the teeth of its infantry, the air force will get five Rafale multi-role fighter jets from Paris this month, with another four to be used for training in France. The five fighter jets will be based at Ambala.The Indian navy is all set to commission its second ballistic missile-firing nuclear submarine, INS Arighat, later this year.According to people in South Block aware of the development, the army is set to acquire 200 pieces of RQ-11 UAV, which can fly up to 10 kilometers at an altitude of 500 feet and speed up to 95 kilometre per hour, to help infantry troops conduct reconnaissance of the battle theatre ahead and placement of enemy troops. After the Indian army brought Spike Mark III anti-tank guided missiles from Israel as part of emergency purchases due to the Ladakh standoff with China, it is now buying firefly ammunition that can deliver a precision strike on enemy troops hiding within a range of one km. The latest Firefly ammunition not only has loitering capability to locate a target but also can be called back if the target has moved beyond range.While the IAF and Indian Army have been at the forefront of the Indian posture in Ladakh, the Indian Navy has been on the front foot in the Indian Ocean against Chinese warships.According to senior military officials, the Navy through its Fusion Centre at Gurugram, has kept a close watch on the Indian Ocean throughout the Ladakh crisis and has been able muscle out six Chinese warships from the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean region. “These ships were around Gwadar port in Balochistan. First three ships went back to China with Indian Navy closely watching them and then the remaining three also returned to their home country. Today, there is not a single Chinese warship in Indian Ocean,” said a senior military officer on condition of anonymity.While the senior military commander talks on disengagement in Ladakh will take place this week, the troop withdrawal exercise from all the four stand-off points is currently on with verification on the ground. While the Chinese People’s Liberation Army has tried to link the withdrawal with other conditions, Indian army commanders have made it clear that the disengagement is unconditional.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-looks-to-acquire-us-aerial-vehicle-to-strengthen-infantry/story-vY4Cn0fZDAofyij2b0LvbN.html
13-07-2020||India||Why Bihar lags in population control||The latest Sample Registration System (SRS) findings show that Bihar is a laggard when it comes to controlling population growth in India. Total fertility rate (TFR) for Bihar in 2018 was 3.2. This is the highest among the eight large states where TFR is greater than 2.1, referred to as the replacement fertility level. A comparison with previous SRS rounds shows that Bihar and Uttar Pradesh had the same TFR of 4.2 in 2006. Uttar Pradesh’s TFR came down to 2.9 in 2018, while Bihar’s still stood at 3.2. So, what went wrong in Bihar? Answering this question requires an understanding what drives TFR. The World Health Organization defines TFR as the total number of children born or likely to be born to a woman in her lifetime if she were subject to the prevailing rate of age-specific fertility in the population. A TFR of about 2.1 children per woman is called replacement-level fertility and represents the average number of children a woman would need to have to maintain the population (see https://bit.ly/2ZjgAB3).TFR is calculated by summing up age-specific fertility rates (ASFR) for women in the age groups of 15-49 years, broken every five years (thus, 15-19, 20-24, 24-29 toll 45-49). ASFR is the number of live births in a particular age group divided by the mid-year population in that particular age group multiplied by thousand.TFR is, thus, a function of two factors. First is the age of marriage. If women get married at a younger age, ASFR for the younger age groups will be higher, which will contribute to a higher TFR. The second is the use of family planning methods, which determines the ability to maintain a gap between children or limit child birth.A comparison of these two factors can throw some light on why Bihar has failed to bring down its TFR .  As can be seen, ASFR in the younger age group of 20-24 has declined in both Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. This is in keeping with the all-India trends, and suggests that the average age of marriage and child birth are rising in the country. In fact, Bihar has done better in reducing ASFR in the age-group of 20-24 than Uttar Pradesh. However, in the 25-29 age group, the ASFR decline has been lower in Bihar than in Uttar Pradesh and in the 30-34 age group, the ASFR growth in Bihar has been much higher than in Uttar Pradesh. To be sure, Bihar witnessed a large growth in the ASFR for the 15-19 age groups, but the overall ASFR for this category in Bihar was quite small (11.9) and less than the all-India average (12.2).The average age of marriage is almost the same in Uttar Pradesh (22.3 years) and Bihar (21.7 years) according to the SRS findings. This brings up the question of use of family planning methods in determining ASFRs, and hence TFR.The 2015-16 National Family and Healthy Survey (NFHS) ranks states by unmet need for family planning. This is a sum of two categories – unmet need for spacing of birth, and unmet need for limiting births. Among large states, women in Bihar reported the highest unmet need for family planning. In 2005-06 as well, when the third round of NFHS was conducted, Bihar ranked second among big states, after Jharkhand, in terms of unmet need for family planning.Unmet need for family planning is directly correlated with TFR levels across states. Bihar has the highest fertility rate among big states and also ranks first for the highest unmet need of family planning.  What explains the higher levels of unmet need for family planning in Bihar compared to Uttar Pradesh? NFHS also gives data on use of modern contraception methods.Female sterilisation, which can only work for limiting childbirth, is the most common contraception method in India. Male sterilisation is among the least used methods. Bihar actually fares better vis-a-vis Uttar Pradesh when it comes to female sterilisation. However, it lags behind Uttar Pradesh by 8.5 percentage points when it comes to current use of modern family planning methods. The biggest reason for this gap is a nearly 10 percentage point lead for Uttar Pradesh in the use of condoms. Uttar Pradesh was ranked eight among the 36 states and union territories when it came to the use of condoms. Bihar was ranked 32nd. Share of married women and men who use any modern method of contraception has largely remained unchanged in India between 2005-06 and 2015-16, according to NFHS. However, in Bihar, the share of currently married women and men who use any modern method of contraception has decreased by 5.7 percentage points (from 28.9% to 23.2%). The share of women, whose husbands used condoms has also decreased from 2.3% to 1%. On the contrary, the share of women and men who use any modern method of contraception in Uttar Pradesh increased by 2.4 percentage points (from 29.3% to 31.7%). And the share of women whose husbands used condoms has increased from 8.6% to 10.8% between 2005-06 and 2015-16.If the 2015-16 trends have persisted, the gap between Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, as far as use of modern family planning methods is concerned, must have grown by 2018. In 2015, TFR in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh was almost similar. If Bihar is interested in bringing down its TFR levels, it needs to learn how Uttar Pradesh has been able to encourage the use of condoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-bihar-lags-in-population-control/story-7CMDdLBNNNUgSdpNUj3xuI.html

The Food Security Act came into force in 2013 and enables eligible households/ people to avail subsidized food grains.“The judiciary has consistently endeavoured to align itself with the constitution’s underlying vision for a more just society. Parliament has similarly continued this aspiration by introducing social welfare legislations to ensure the RTI and the food security”, Justice Chandrachud said in his speech on ‘A changing society and Constitutional Continuity’.He was speaking at the celebration of birth centenary of his father, former Chief Justice of India late YV Chandrachud. The event was organized by the Indian Law society and ILS Law College, Pune.The judiciary, Justice Chandrachud said, has taken effective steps to adapt to the changing needs of society including the striking down of several colonial era provisions.“The social vision of the constitution was nothing less than revolutionary but the political vision was based on an orderly transition governed by the rule of law,” he added.In what he termed a “shrill discourse of polarized universe across the world”, Justice Chandrachud also issued a word of advice. “Humanity needs to gather together and remind ourselves of what we share. We may have myriad explanations to tell us why others are different from us but at the core of it all is our shared human identity,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-strove-for-just-social-order-supreme-court-judge/story-3wuYRdtpF0BhYw8Xt1SevN.html

13-07-2020||India||Army to get state-of-the-art US assault rifles amid border row||NEW DELHI At a time when India and China are locked in a border stand-off in eastern Ladakh, the Indian Army is laying the groundwork to buy an additional 72,000 Sig Sauer assault rifles for its troops from the United States, people familiar with the development said on Sunday.This proposed purchase follows an order for 72,400 assault rifles placed with the US last year, and is expected to be made by invoking a key clause in India’s arms buying rules that govern speeding up purchases to meet urgent requirements, said one of the officials cited above.India signed the previous order worth ₹700 crore in early 2019 and the deliveries of all the rifles have been completed. That order was also made through the fast track procedure (FTP) prescribed in India’s defence procurement rules.The Sig Sauer rifles are being bought to meet the army’s requirement of a total of 800,000 assault rifles, said a second official. The new assault rifles will gradually replace the flaw-ridden 5.56mm INSAS (Indian Small Arms System) rifles inducted around 22 years ago.The remaining requirements of the army will be met through a Make in India project for the local production of AK-203 assault rifles at Amethi’s Korwa, and this procurement is in its final stage with a committee ironing out pricing issues, said a third person, asking not to be named.The FTP can be invoked in cases where “undue/unforeseen delay” in buying weapons is seen to be adversely impacting the military’s capacity and preparedness.According to rules, weapons sought under the FTP should already be in the military’s armoury, have been trial evaluated or be in service in foreign militaries so that the time required for evaluation is minimised.India has also ordered more stocks of Excalibur precision guided munitions from the US for its artillery guns, while Russia assured swifter delivery of weapons and ammunition during defence minister Rajnath Singh’s visit to Moscow last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-to-get-state-of-the-art-us-assault-rifles-amid-border-row/story-AjypcjEm8rIK0yARcudVLJ.html
13-07-2020||India||Rajasthan govt in crisis as Sachin Pilot leads rebels out||The Congress government in Rajasthan stared at a political crisis on Sunday with a number of its legislators loyal to deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot camping in the National Capital Region amidst apprehensions over a possible split in its ranks.The Congress called a meeting of all its Rajasthan legislators on Monday and rushed two central observers – Randeep Singh Surjewala and Ajay Maken – to state capital Jaipur in a bid to iron out differences between Pilot and chief minister Ashok Gehlot, who have differed on a number of issues since the formation of the party’s government in 2018.In a late-night statement released on WhatsApp, Pilot’s camp said the deputy chief minister has the backing of about 30 legislators in the 200-member assembly. “The Ashok Gehlot government is in minority after over 30 Congress and some independent MLAs have pledged their support to Sachin Pilot,” said the statement released by Pilot’s media office.Also read: Amid political turmoil in Rajasthan, Sachin Pilot to skip key party meetBut the Gehlot camp appeared confident about the government’s stability. A large number of Congress and other legislators supporting the government met the chief minister at his residence amid hectic parleys. “There is no danger to the government. All our MLAs are with us,” said Congress legislator Ashok Chandana, who is considered close to Gehlot. Separately, five Congress lawmakers considered close to Pilot held a press conference at the chief minister’s residence in Jaipur, saying they are soldiers of the Congress even as they ruled out the possibility of leaving the party.“We have full faith in the leadership of CM Ashok Gehlot. Our identity is because of the party and we are committed to it,” said Congress legislator Chetan Singh Choudhary, one of the five MLAs.He was accompanied by Danish Abrar, Rohit Bohra, Pratap Singh Khachariywas (who is also the transport minister) and Harish Choudhary. “We are soldiers of the Congress party and we had gone to Delhi for personal issues,” Abrar said. In the 200-member assembly, the Congress has the support of 125 MLAs, including 107 of its own legislators. The party has the backing of 13 independents and five from other parties. The majority mark is 101. The BJP has 72 legislators and has the support of three of Hanuman Beniwal’s Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RPL).Pilot’s supporters said he has raised issues against the functioning of Gehlot over the past fortnight with the party’s state in-charge and general secretary, Avinash Pande, Congress organisation secretary KC Venugopal and senior Congress leader Ahmad Patel in Delhi.“His concerns were not addressed,” said a party leader considered close to Pilot.Another Congress functionary familiar with the developments said Surjewala and Maken have been given the mandate to bring about a “lasting truce” between Gehlot and Pilot, who is also the Rajasthan Congress president.“Worried for our party. Will we wake up only after the horses have bolted from our stables?” former Union minister Kapil Sibal tweeted.His views were echoed by the Congress’s Rajya Sabha member, Vivek Tankha. “Kapil ji your worry is every party member’s concern. It’s time to strengthen the party to fight forces, who have only 1 agenda - weaken Congress and our democratic values and institutions,” he said on Twitter.Also read: Sidelining of Pilot in crucial decisions behind the turmoil?Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, too, took a swipe at the Congress, saying talent and capability find “little credence” in the party. “Sad to see my erstwhile colleague Sachin Pilot, too, being sidelined and persecuted by Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot. Shows that talent and capability find little credence in the Congress,” Scindia, who quit the Congress earlier this year, tweeted.The ongoing crisis erupted after Pilot received a notice from the special operations group (SOG) of Rajasthan police to record his statement regarding the alleged attempt to topple the Congress government in the state. Though the Congress said a similar notice was sent to Gehlot as well, leaders close to Pilot called it a “joke” since the chief minister is also in charge of the home department that oversees the police force. Pilot’s camp said the July 10 notice is yet another move to “humiliate” the deputy chief minister and “undermine” his authority.Gehlot alleged on Saturday that the BJP is trying to topple his government, a charge vehemently denied by the opposition party.With Pilot rushing to Delhi on Saturday, some Congress legislators backing him and a few Rajasthan BJP MLAs are said to be staying in a five-star hotel in Manesar on the outskirts of Delhi. For the Congress, the developments in Rajasthan could be reminiscent of what happened in Madhya Pradesh in March, when 24 legislators owing allegiance to Scindia resigned from the party and the state assembly, reducing chief minister Kamal Nath’s government to a minority. Scindia resigned from the Congress and joined the BJP.As the Congress numbers in the Madhya Pradesh assembly dwindled, the BJP regained power with Shivraj Singh Chouhan becoming the chief minister for a record fourth time.Last month, the Congress in Rajasthan had to swing into action just before the Rajya Sabha elections to three seats from the state. At that time too, the ruling party alleged that the BJP was trying to poach its legislators.At that time, Gehlot himself supervised the efforts to guard the party legislators and the independents supporting his government. While the Congress won two seats, including the one by Venugopal, the BJP bagged one seat in the June 19 polls.Pilot is under pressure from his supporters to take his ongoing power tussle with Gehlot to a logical conclusion, people familiar with the developments said.A legislator close to Pilot said the Rajasthan police notice is “actually legitimising the official surveillance” on the deputy chief minister. “This is sheer humiliation and nothing else. Pilot can be called for questioning anytime on one pretext or the other,” said the legislator.Pilot’s supporters said Gehlot has been undermining his deputy’s authority to the extent of not involving him in the state government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and other important decision-making processes.They also said Pilot’s views are not being considered in political appointments in corporations and boards. Also, the CM has not held any meeting of the coordination committee set up by Congress president Sonia Gandhi to discuss issues of governance and implementation of manifesto since its constitution in January 2020, they said.Rajasthan Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Satish Poonia said there is intense infighting in the Congress and chief minister Gehlot is trying to hide his failures by blaming the BJP for trying to topple the government. “If government falls, it would be because of infighting in the Congress. We [the BJP] have nothing to do with it,” he said. Political analyst Narayan Bareth said it is a big political setback for any political party if a state president rebels. “I think the chief minister has anticipated this situation ...He might be having a Plan B to deal with this, but as of now the Congress in Rajasthan is in turmoil,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-govt-in-crisis-as-pilot-leads-rebels-out/story-Fd1Yc55EaYM63cuzgLhOnL.html

13-07-2020||India||State chief post one of many sticking points for Ashok Gehlot, Sachin Pilot||The differences between Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his deputy Sachin Pilot erupted soon after the 2018 assembly elections results that led to the ouster of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from the seat of power, according to political experts.Since then, the two leaders have had differences on several issues. The latest trigger was the post of the state Congress chief, said leaders close to both camps, on condition of anonymity.Pilot has been the Rajasthan Congress president since January 2014 and there’s talk of appointing someone else in that position. Leaders close to Pilot said he wants his supporter in the saddle or an important portfolio in the state government.Also read: Rajasthan govt in crisis as Sachin Pilot leads rebels outAt present, Pilot holds the portfolios of Public Works Department. Rural Development & Panchayati Raj., Science & Technology, and StatisticsThe buzz in the state bureaucratic circles is that Pilot has had differences with bureaucrats in his departments, especially in the public works department (PWD), where some key officers are not considered close to Pilot. After the election results, while Pilot’s loyalists credited him for the victory, the party high command made Gehlot the chief minister and Pilot the deputy chief minister .Before the municipal elections in October 2019, the state introduced a rule that even unelected members could stand for the post of mayor and head of municipalities. Pilot spoke against the move on many occasions, saying this will lead to “back-door entry” into civic bodies. Finally, the decision was rolled back.Also read: Amid political turmoil in Rajasthan, Sachin Pilot to skip key party meetOn the death of 107 of infants in Kota due to an alleged shortage of beds and lack of facilities in January this year, Pilot put his government in a spot, calling for fixing accountability. The health minister, Raghu Sharma, is considered a Gehlot loyalist.And after the Congress’s rout in the Lok Sabha elections in Rajasthan — the party won none of the 25 seats — Gehlot said Pilot should take responsibility for the defeat of his son, Vaibhav Gehlot, from Jodhpur because he was the party president.Pilot also appeared to be critical of the government after the accused in the Pehlu Khan lynching case were acquitted in August 2019. He said had the Congress government formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) earlier, the outcome would have been different.Also read: Sidelining of Pilot in crucial decisions behind the turmoil?The government formed the SIT  to probe the mob lynching of Khan on the suspicion of cow smuggling in April 2017, when the BJP government was in power.Political commentator Prakash Bhandari said the party has long ignored the crisis between its two leaders. Bhandari said the leadership should have sent KC Venugopal, general secretary in charge of organisation, to settle the issue. “He was the one who brokered peace between them earlier and got them on one table. At this time, when differences between its two leaders are threatening to pull down the government, the party should have used him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-chief-post-one-of-many-sticking-points-for-the-leaders/story-U7RhYA1cU3QLWd6jZnZtQL.html
13-07-2020||India||Investigation finds accused tried to contact 6 southern Rajasthan MLAs||The investigation of special operations group (SOG) into the sedition case registered on the basis of interception of two mobile phones has found that the two accused were eyeing six MLAs of southern Rajasthan and began efforts to contact them on June 10, said officials aware of the development.The names of the MLAs have not been disclosed.They also hinted that there could be more arrests in the case.The SOG arrested Bharat Malani of Ajmer and Ashok Singh of Banswara on charges of hatching conspiracy to topple the Ashok Gehlot government.Singh, a businessman, is a former member of Rajasthan BJP’s executive committee. Malani has been the state coordinator of one of BJPs state committees.SOG additional director general of police Ashok Rathore said that recording of a conversation over the phone in which Malani and Singh are reportedly talking about offering money to legislators to destabilise the government is the basis of the FIR. “Both the accused are been questioned. They have been booked under section 124 A (sedition), 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code,” he said.“During investigation, it was found that between June 10 and June 16, Singh contacted six MLAs from Banswara, Dungarpur and Chittorgarh,” the officials quoted above said.The accused also tried to lure two MLAs of a newly formed party in Dungarpur.Another top police official familiar with the development of this case said that there were four to five more people who were helping the two.“We have got some clues from the investigation so far that there were four more businessmen from different districts of the state who were indirectly helping these accused in arranging money. We are working on the clues and once we get sufficient evidence, we will arrest them too,” added this person who asked not to be named. Interestingly, the state Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) on Saturday lodged a complaint against three independent MLAs and the charges against them were that they were luring the MLAs of Dungapur, Udaipur and Banswara before Rajya Sabha elections to de-stabilize the government.“The complaint has been registered on the basis of inputs collected by intelligence unit of ACB. The charges against these three MLAs are that they were trying to induce some MLAs in Dungarpur, Banswara and Udaipur by offering money,” said an ACB official on the condition of anonymity.The three MLAs are Suresh Tank from Kishangarh constituency; Khushveer Singh is from Marwar Junction and Omprakash Hudla.“Malviya was cabinet minister in previous Gehlot government and is considered as a prominent leader of the tribal districts of state which Dungapur, Banswara and Udaipur. This tenure he was not given any post and he was dissatisfied with this fact. The rest MLAs are also ambitious as the supported Congress but didn’t get any strong return,” said a senior state Congress leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/investigation-finds-accused-tried-to-contact-6-southern-rajasthan-mlas/story-iqDI6v6CEwrHsdflARmpxJ.html

13-07-2020||India||Sachin Pilot flagged differences in meet with Ahmed Patel about a fortnight ago||Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot tried to warn the Congress leadership about the trouble brewing in the state government about two weeks ago, according to party insiders aware of the developments.Pilot, who is also the state Congress president, held a one-on-one meeting with senior leader Ahmed Patel in the national capital in June end to discuss his differences with chief minister Ashok Gehlot, leaders from both camps confirmed on condition of anonymity.In the meeting, Pilot told Patel, considered a close aide of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, that his differences with Gehlot had gone too far, according to one of the leaders cited above. “There was a long list of grievances that he spoke about.” It is not clear what emerged at the meeting as both Patel and Pilot were unavailable for comment. It is also unclear if there was any follow-up action by the Congress.Pilot also met other senior leaders such as KC Venugopal, general secretary in charge of organisation.That Pilot and Gehlot had differences was not unknown in the party circles. When the Congress won the 2018 elections, bagging 107 seats in the 200-member assembly, Pilot’s supporters credited him for the victory. But Gehlot dug in his heels. Rahul Gandhi, the then Congress president, made Gehlot the CM and Pilot his deputy. Also read: Amid political turmoil in Rajasthan, Sachin Pilot to skip key party meetHowever, as a second leader pointed out, this arrangement was more on paper than in reality. “The deputy chief minister had limited powers and wouldn’t be consulted on any decisions in the state. Most of the times he found out about cabinet decisions from media reports,” this person added, asking not to be named. And while Pilot was the party chief in the state, efforts were on to have him replaced. On Sunday, as the Congress stared at crisis, party MP and former minister Kapil Sibal tweeted: “Worried for our party. Will we wake up only after the horses have bolted from our stables?”Congress leaders say there may be a maximum of 19 legislators, perhaps fewer, supporting Pilot, who visited Delhi over the weekend. His supporters are believed to be in a hotel in Gurugram. According to one of the leaders backing Pilot, the number of legislators supporting him could increase. News agency PTI reported that Pilot claims there are 30 MLAs backing him and that the Gehlot government is already a minority one. Also read: Sidelining of Pilot in crucial decisions behind the turmoil?The crisis in Rajasthan surfaced when the state police issued notices to Gehlot, who is also the home minister, and Pilot over an alleged bid to destabilise the government. While the Rajasthan government said notice was also sent to the chief minister, the leader close to Pilot called that a “joke”.“This was taking humiliation to a different level...Is this how a deputy chief minister is treated?” the leader asked. “The chief minister also holds the home portfolio. So how can they question him?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilot-flagged-differences-in-meet-with-patel-about-a-fortnight-ago/story-RrJ4kVi6278xSTky11h7NL.html
13-07-2020||India||Congress trying to blame us for its failures: BJP||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said on Saturday that it was not trying to topple the Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan but suggested that it would like to keep all options open in the state -- depending on what the Congress does. Senior party leaders in Delhi said the allegations made by the Rajasthan chief minister, pinning the blame on the BJP for engineering defections, were an attempt to deflect attention from the Congress party’s own failings.There is speculation that Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, along with 25 other Congress MLAs, will either join the BJP or start his own party that could seek support from the BJP in the 200- member assembly, in which the BJP has 72 MLAs and the Congress 107. The Congress also has support from 12 independents and five members of other parties.“No meetings have taken place between Pilot and the BJP leadership. Everyone knows there are problems between the CM and the deputy CM; but they are trying to pin the blame on the BJP,” said a BJP leader in Delhi on condition of anonymity.On whether the party will stake its claim to forming the government if a faction of Congress MLAs does break away, the BJP leader said, “The outcome will depend on what decision the Congress high command takes. The BJP will only take whatever decision is required once there is a decision from the Congress’s side.”The leader also said that the party will not “shut its doors to those who want to partner with the BJP” in Rajasthan.Also read: Amid political turmoil in Rajasthan, Sachin Pilot to skip key party meetA second leader said the party is willing to consider a tie-up on the condition that the numbers stack up in their favour. The party is wary of a repeat of the Maharashtra situation,wherein a group of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLAs led by Ajit Pawar assured support to the BJP and then pulled back at the last minute. “If there are the required numbers (of MLAs) willing to partner with or join the BJP, we will consider offering support to such a combination,” said the second leader quoted above, asking not to be named. The BJP will need the support of at least 30 MLAs to reach the majority figure, which means it will need the support of not just the Congress rebels but also some independents.However, should the BJP consider partnering with Pilot, it will also have to address the issue of leadership in the state and whether it will have the rebel Congress leader in the chief minister’s seat. In Madhya Pradesh, the party did not change the chief minister even though it accommodated Congress leaders in the cabinet. Also read: Sidelining of Pilot in crucial decisions behind the turmoil?“The numbers are critical. The BJP is confident that if re-election happens in the state it will win with a comfortable majority. However, those who will join and seek re-election have to be equally confident of retaining their seats,” a third party functionary said on condition of anonymity.A Rajasthan-based BJP leader said the party was also wary of a Madhya Pradesh-like situation emerging in Rajasthan. Internal bickering has intensified in MP after the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government accommodated former Congress legislators in his cabinet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-trying-to-blame-us-for-its-failures-bjp/story-KcUTXXN4zxCC5ysjWukI0O.html
13-07-2020||India||3 contrasting scenarios in Rajasthan’s political future||The turmoil in Rajasthan’s Congress-led government on Sunday gave rise to contrasting political scenarios with experts and political leaders saying developments and negotiations over the next few days could determine the future of the two-year-old administration. In the 200-member House, where the halfway mark is 101, the ruling alliance currently enjoys the support of 125 legislators. The Congress has 107 legislators, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has two, the Bharatiya Tribal Party two, the Rashtriya Lok Dal one; there are 13 independents also backing the government. In the Opposition benches, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has 72 lawmakers and the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party has three seats. Also read: Rajasthan govt in crisis as Sachin Pilot leads rebels outTo be sure, there is no clarity on the number of legislators backing Pilot (the range of numbers doing the rounds is a wide one, from nine to 30); while ministers in the Gehlot camp insisted the government was safe. In this backdrop, experts said there were three broad scenarios.One, the Congress central leadership could swing into action, mollifying Pilot and instructing Gehlot to let his deputy work independently and not infringe on his portfolios. Pilot, who is also the Congress state chief, could come back into the fold if allowed to manage his portfolios independently. Already, senior leader Kapil Sibal’s tweet urging the party to wake up hints that efforts are on to mend fences. Key to this resolution would be the party brass convincing Gehlot to budge on some sticking points like appointment of bureaucrats in the four ministries held by Pilot and picking some of the younger leader’s associates to important positions in the party. Also read: Amid political turmoil in Rajasthan, Sachin Pilot to skip key party meetConversations with senior leaders in the Congress also threw up an additional compromise scenario that involved a key point of friction between Gehlot and Pilot: the position of the state party unit chief. A senior party leader told HT that over the past few months, leaders close to Gehlot have been pushing for the removal of Pilot, who has held the position for six years. In a compromise scenario brokered by the Congress central leadership, Pilot could vacate the position for a nominee of his choice, thereby retaining influence over election machinery and choice of poll candidates, added the leader quoted above. A central Congress leader confirmed that they were in touch with Pilot and lines of communication were open although another leader said that he had stopped taking their callsStill, this is an unlikely scenario, said people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named. It may have worked six, maybe even two months ago, but is perhaps too late now. Two, the rebellion within the Rajasthan Congress could grow with more legislators joining the Pilot camp and quitting the party, thereby reducing Gehlot’s government to a minority. In this case, these leaders could quit – which would bring down the strength, and the halfway mark, of the House – and subsequently join the BJP, . This is what happened in Madhya Pradesh in March. The BJP could step in and form the government with allies and independents, and bypolls to the vacant seats would be held within six months. Also read: Sidelining of Pilot in crucial decisions behind the turmoil?Author and political commentator Rasheed Kidwai said, “Perhaps, if a leader makes up mind to desert parent organisation, there is very little that can be done.”Three, negotiations in the Congress could break down with Pilot leaving the party along with his supporters and forming a third front. If Gehlot and his supporters manage to cobble together a majority along with independents and allies, the government might survive but could be weakened and be greatly dependent on smaller players. In this scenario, Pilot could seek to form a government supported by the BJP. But with his numbers, it is unlikely that the BJP will allow him to be chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-contrasting-scenarios-in-raj-s-political-future/story-51I0P0csYaaKxfIeXAbKPM.html
13-07-2020||India||Sidelining of Sachin Pilot in crucial decisions behind the turmoil?||The simmering tension between Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot reached a tipping point when Pilot was summoned by the police on July 10 in connection with an investigation into a suspected plot to destabilize the state government, HT has learnt.It underlined, according to a senior Congress leader, the deep distrust Gehlot had of his deputy and was a bid to marginalise Pilot in the party and the government that was formed December 2018. Although a similar notice was sent to Gehlot, asking him to record a statement, a Pilot loyalist said the deputy CM thought the probe was targeting him. Gehlot, after all, has retained the home portfolio and the police report to the home minister. There have been several bids to undercut Pilot in the past two years. The Congress central leadership chose to ignore the warning signals until it , finally, formed a coordination committee for Rajasthan in January but that panel, so far, has held just one meeting.Also read: Amid political turmoil in Rajasthan, Sachin Pilot to skip key party meet“Pilot was not very keen to assume an organizational post in Delhi. So, the party should have secured his position in Rajasthan. But that overt backing was missing for a long time,” said a central leader of the Congress.The Congress’s inability to nip such problems in the bud was articulated by senior party leader Kapil Sibal. Sibal tweeted, “Worried for our party..Will we wake up only after the horses have bolted from our stables ?” Just four months ago, the Congress lost its government in Madhya Pradesh in a similar script played out when Jyotiraditya Scindia left the party which similarly ignored both him and the warning signals in the state. On Sunday, Scindia, now a Rajya Sabha MP of the BJP tweeted: “Sad to see my erstwhile colleague @SachinPilot too, being sidelined and persecuted by Rajasthan CM. @ashokgehlot51. Shows that talent and capability find little credence in the @INCIndia.” To be sure, the start of the new Congress government in Rajasthan was not exactly a smooth affair. Pilot, who left his family in Delhi to sweat it out, led the Congress campaign as the president of the party in the state to victory, but Gehlot became chief minister primarily due to caste equations and perhaps because the Congress wanted someone from the old guard. Party insiders added that for the past few months, the Gehlot camp has been demanding a change of guard in the Rajasthan Congress in a bid to remove Pilot from the state party president’s post. They started lobbying with Congress functionaries in Delhi that a new state chief is required (Pilot has been holding the position for six years) before panchayat elections in the state.Another party leader, close to Pilot added, while he had four ministries under him as the deputy CM, Gehlot appointed bureaucrats in some of these ministries.Even as then Congress president Rahul Gandhi met the two leaders over several rounds to hammer out a solution, the uneasy equation between the Congress’s old generation and the new generation came to the fore.Last year, the chief minister’s son Vaibhav Gehlot lost the Lok Sabha election, and the senior Gehlot lost no time in blaming Pilot for the defeat. He publicly stated that “Pilot should take responsibility” even as many party leaders questioned the chief minister’s inability to ensure a victory for his son.Earlier this year, Pilot expressed concern about the deteriorating law and order situation in some areas of the state—seen as a comment on Gehlot who holds the home portfolio. A few months ago, the Rajya Sabha elections too, saw tension rising between the two. Gehlot fielded Neeraj Dangi, a secretary of the Congress party, for the coveted Rajya Sabha seat. Pilot wanted a bigger, well-known name but Gehlot stuck to his choice. And then, ahead of the polls, Gehlot alleged that Congress MLAs were being lured, indicating the party might lose a seat. The results proved to be otherwise and the Congress secured seats for both its candidates.Pilot, who was credited for the victory, said: “Any kind of doubts and suspicions spread around earlier were baseless.”A party insider pointed out that Pilot’s people were not being rewarded. Many posts for political appointment are lying vacant and Gehlot is in no hurry to accommodate Pilot loyalists in these posts.Last month, at a function at party headquarters to observe Sanjay Gandhi’s death anniversary, Pilot announced that as the party president in Rajasthan, he owes it to the Congress grassroots workers who had worked very hard for Congress and needed to be rewarded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sidelining-of-pilot-in-crucial-decisions-behind-the-turmoil/story-sRqXaQuA40jfbXqQdMZA6K.html
13-07-2020||India||Monsoon likely in northwest, central India this week: IMD||The monsoon trough (a low-pressure line), which had shifted northward to the Himalayan foothills bringing extremely heavy rains of over 20 cm to north-eastern and eastern states has started moving southward, the India Meteorological Department said on Sunday.With the moving of the monsoon system, active monsoon rains are likely to resume over northwest and central India between July 14 to 16, the IMD said.The western end of the monsoon trough is presently passing through Ganganagar, Delhi and Bareilly; while the eastern end continues to run close to the foothills of Himalayas, according to IMD. A cyclonic circulation is lying over east Bihar and neighbourhood. This, in addition with the convergence of south-westerly and southerly winds from Bay of Bengal in the lower tropospheric levels, is likely to continue over northeast and adjoining east India during next two days, the Met department said in its forecast. Widespread and very heavy rains will continue over northeast India, West Bengal, Sikkim, Bihar and adjoining east Uttar Pradesh for next five days, but the intensity of rainfall is expected to be lower than last week.Moderate to severe thunderstorm and lightning is likely over many parts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar over the next 12 hours, according to IMD’s Sunday bulletin. The deluge in Arunachal Pradesh (over 50 cm on Friday and Saturday) and Assam is likely to reduce further in the next 24 hours.Since the western end of the monsoon trough is running close to Delhi, light rain in different parts of the national capital is expected on Sunday, followed by more intense rains on July 14 and 15. “As the monsoon trough shifts southwards, rains are expected in Delhi also but it will be in light to moderate category. Overcast skies will continue. Wind direction, which has been largely westerly because of the trough shifting northward, will switch to easterly now,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.Since June 1, three subdivisions have received large excess (60% excess or above) rains; 12 have received excess rains; 15 are in normal while six are deficient. According to Central Water Commission as on July 11, 30 stations (one in Arunachal Pradesh, 14 in Assam, one in West Bengal, 10 in Bihar and four in Uttar Pradesh) were flowing in Severe Flood Situation and 20 stations (nine in Assam, five in Bihar, three in Uttar Pradesh, three in West Bengal, one in Daman & Diu and one in Arunachal Pradesh) were flowing in Above Normal Flood Situation. Teesta river in West Bengal, Kosi and Mahananda in Bihar, Siang at Passighat in Arunachal Pradesh and Brahmaputra in Assam continue to be in severe flood category.The country has received 14% excess rain this monsoon season -- 20% excess in central India, 16% excess in south Peninsula, 14% excess in east and northeast India -- and 3% deficient over northwest India. IMD scientists said the distribution of rains have been largely even this year. The standardised precipitation index (an index to measure drought) shows many districts in eastern, central and peninsular India are in severely wet category while others are mildly wet.“The western end of the monsoon trough has started shifting southwards from the foothills. Stations reporting extremely heavy rainfall in northeast India particularly Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya have reduced in the last 24 hours. All of these areas were flooding. But we have to watch for one more day as the eastern end of the trough is still in the foothills. One station in Sub Himalayan West Bengal has reported 43 cm rain (extremely heavy) on Saturday. Once the trough shifts southwards, monsoon rains will gradually resume over northwest and central India,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at National Weather Forecasting Centre.“This monsoon, the Arabian Sea has been unusually active starting with cyclone Nisarga which helped with monsoon onset. The moisture feed from Bay of Bengal in comparison is negligible. An intense low-pressure system also over Saurashtra last week which brought extremely heavy rains there. Another feature of this monsoon is that the monsoon trough is mostly north of its normal position this year so the northeast has got a lot of rain. Not many low-pressure systems have formed over Bay of Bengal which is a bit unusual,” he added.Last week, Okha in Gujarat received record 48 cm rainfall on July 7. On July 5, Khambala, Kalyanpur and Porbandar recorded 49 cm, 36 cm and 29 cm, respectively. Thane and Mumbai also recorded extremely heavy rains on July 3, with 17 cm in Mumbai’s Colaba and 38 cm in Thane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-likely-in-northwest-central-india-this-week-imd/story-IPSt9yDr43pw0Lb84xhbrL.html
13-07-2020||India||Supreme Court verdict on Kerala’s Padmanabha Swamy temple today||The Supreme Court will on Monday pronounce verdict on the long-standing dispute over whether the control of the Padmanabha Swamy temple in Kerala will vest with the state government or the Travancore royal family.The verdict, which will be pronounced by the court after nine long years of hearing the case, will decide the correctness of a January 2011 judgment of the Kerala high court which had ruled that the state government should take over the control of the temple from a trust headed by the royal family. The temple located in the state capital of Thirvunanthapuram shot into limelight after the Supreme Court in May 2011 ordered a detailed inventory of the articles in the temple vaults which had long rumoured to be holding immense riches.The verdict of the Supreme Court will be pronounced at 10.30 am by a division bench of justices UU Lalit and Indu Malhotra.When five its six vaults, known as ‘Kallara’ in Malayalam, were opened pursuant to the Supreme Court order, vast treasure of gold and other priceless objects were discovered. It was estimated that the intrinsic value of the treasure amounted to more than Rs. 90,000 crore. One of the vaults, Kallara B could not be opened and the opening of the same was later kept in abeyance by the apex court.The temple was under the control of a trust headed by the royal family until April 2014 when the top court by way of a crucial interim order handed over its management to a four-member administrative committee headed by a district judge.The case dates back to 2009  when TP Sundarrajan, a former IPS officer, filed a public interest litigation petition before the Kerala high court praying that the control of the temple should be handed over to the Kerala government from the royal family.The state government took a stand before the high court that the traditional and customary belief is that the temple belongs to the royal family head of Travancore palace and that the administration of the temple has not broken down nor is there any allegation of a major nature which forces the government to interfere with the administrative affairs of the temple.Despite that, the high court by its judgment rendered in January 2011 ordered the state government to take over the control of the temple. It also restrained the executive officer and the Maharaja of the royal family against opening any of the Kallaras or removing any of the articles of the temple.The Maharaja, Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma, appealed to the Supreme Court against the high court judgment. In August 2012, senior advocate Gopal Subramanium was appointed Amicus Curiae (friend of the court) by the Supreme Court. Subramanium submitted a voluminous report before the court in April 2014 alleging serious mismanagement of the temple by the trust and indicting the royal family on various counts.The court after accepting the report set up an administrative committee on April 24, 2014 to manage the temple in the interim and also ordered a special audit of the temple and its properties by former Comptroller and Auditor General of India, Vinod Rai.Legal genesis of the disputeThe legal genesis of the dispute lies in the agreement of accession (agreement) signed between the Kings of Travancore with the Government of India in 1949 by which the princely state of Travancore became a part of the Indian Union.Article VII of the agreement provided that administration of the Padmanabha Swamy temple shall be conducted, subject to the control and supervision of the ruler of Travancore, by an executive officer appointed by the ruler.The ruler at the time of Independence, Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma passed away in 1991 and Utharadom Thirunal Marthanda Varma assumed charge as trustee of the Temple.The question before the high court was whether the new Maharaja would fall within the definition of the term “ruler” used in the agreement. The agreement itself did not define the term “ruler” and the high court, therefore, relied upon the definition of “ruler” in article 366(22) of the Constitution of India.Article 366(22) states that ruler means any prince or chief who was recognized by the President of India as ruler of an Indian state before 1971, the year in which privy purse (payments made by the Government of India to royal families of erstwhile princely states for joining the Indian union at the time of independence) was abolished.Based on the definition in Article 366(22), the high court held that “ruler” is not a status that can be achieved through succession and after the death of the last ruler in 1991,there is no ruler in the erstwhile state of Travancore.In such a scenario, the present “ruler” is the state of kerala and the administration and control of temple will, therefore, vest with the Kerala government, the high court had ruled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-verdict-on-kerala-temple-today/story-AvSSwo9CZzA4L1T9PMLw3M.html

A huge number of migrant workers returned to their home states, with their families, after the announcement of a nationwide lockdown that was imposed on March 25 to curb the spread of coronavirus pandemic. The ministry document, accessed by HT, states, “Some states may see a reduction in numbers of children enrolled in their schools or they will be reported as absent, while others will see a surge in children requiring admissions. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Children of migrants, who have returned to their native villages and towns, should also be provided mid-meals, the document states.

13-07-2020||India||Not the time for polls... Prez rule could be stopgap step: Tejashwi Yadav||Leader of Opposition in the Bihar assembly, and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)’s young face, Tejashwi Yadav will encounter his biggest political challenge in the upcoming state assembly polls he has to contest in the absence of his incarcerated father, Lalu Prasad. He spoke about the political landscape in an interview: Is the ground situation conducive for free and fair polls in Bihar, given the pandemic? On Covid-19, I have been requesting the government since March that testing be done on a larger scale and the capacity of institutional care be enhanced. However, it fell on deaf ears. The abject failure of the Nitish government in handling the pandemic and the migrant workers issue has led to chaos and insecurity among the people. There seems to be no containment and mitigation strategy in place. In my opinion, this is not the appropriate time to conduct elections considering the alarming spread of this disease. I will be the last person to have an election on dead bodies. If Nitish Kumar acknowledges that Covid is still a crisis, elections can be postponed until the situation improves but if he thinks Covid is not a problem, elections must be conducted with traditional means of electioneering. Let there be a fair ground for all parties, and allow rallies, door-to-door and full-fledged campaigns. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Janata Dal (United) are parties of capitalists and have immense resources. (So) restricting the medium of campaign would be antithetical to the very purpose of election in a democracy. President’s Rule could be a stop-gap interim arrangement if constitutional obligation requires it.Is the RJD ready to contest if elections are held on time? How prepared are you to reach out virtually to the electorate?RJD’s campaign will not be about spending big monies. We will enter the election with principled politics that speaks to the marginalised and the poor in a down-to-earth manner. Our campaign will not be a spectacle, it’ll be based on genuine communication of our plans rooted in the aspirations of the people. We shall go to the people with a robust blueprint for transforming Bihar in education, health, agriculture, employment and industrialisation. Also read: Time to fight Covid-19, not polls: Prashant Kishor to Bihar CM Nitish KumarThe political wisdom of the people from my state is unmatched. They are fed up with the ever-rising corruption, crimes, unemployment, inflation and flip-flops of Nitish ji. Yes, it’s going to be a challenge to switch to virtual canvassing. For poor parties like us and others, who don’t have money to pay for such huge expenditures to counter them, it would be unfair and amount to robbery of democracy and mandate. Sensing defeat, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has started tweaking the rulebook of Election Commission (EC). Postal ballots for Covid patients, virtual rallies and all should be seen in that context. The RJD-led alliance in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls could win only one seat, and that was in the Congress quota. So there are questions about the combine’s viability. Parliamentary and assembly elections are two different things. Assembly elections are fought on local day-to-day governance issues concerning the people’s basic needs: education, migration, infrastructure development, job creation, and of course, health. Despite the machinations at the BJP-JD(U)’s disposal, our alliance will sweep this election. They have pushed Bihar further into backwardness in their 15 years of rule. Everyone in Bihar knows how the mandate was hijacked in 2017 (when Nitish walked out on RJD). The BJP is in power with Nitish ji without any reason and vision.Some of your smaller allies including Jitan Ram Manjhi have reservations about your projection as the combine’s chief ministerial face. You also have detractors in the Congress’s state unit.This is not the time to be bogged down with such considerations. We must have credible plans for a historical alternative for Bihar. Democratic politics is nothing without such pushes and pulls. Only a delusional person can think that he has no opposition or no detractors. My eyes and mind are all open. In any alliance, it’s a settled principle that the party having a larger presence is chosen its leader.Also read: ‘Preparations for Bihar assembly elections on time’, says CEOHow confident are you of keeping the alliance intact?Consultation and deliberation on seat sharing and common minimum program are underway. I am confident of bringing together a credible, committed and progressive alliance. Anyone familiar with the history of RJD knows that we have a stellar record of building alliances. But it’s important to note that the RJD has been equally comfortable in the opposition. You recently sought forgiveness for mistakes, if any, during the 15 year rule (from 1990-2005) of your father and mother. Is that your way of reaching out to forward caste communities? The question is pertinent as Raghuvansh Prasad Singh recently quit as vice president of RJD.No person or regime can be perfect. Our 15 years took governance to the doorsteps of the poor and marginalised. That’s why the people rewarded us for 15 years. I wasn’t around then, still I don’t hesitate to accept shortfalls if there were any.One needs to understand the history of Bihar which has been a victim of chronic neglect. Laluji and Rabriji privileged social justice in a deeply feudal society. A sense of equality, a possibility of egalitarian governance was communicated to the people.We are committed to reaching out to all sections of the society. Bihar cannot progress if all communities do not participate. Raghuwansh Babu is a senior leader and a fatherly figure to me. He is there in the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-the-time-for-polls-prez-rule-could-be-stopgap-step-tejashwi-yadav/story-RPZ7S5DW3BNdmSGGwnI8vN.html

They would remain open from Monday to Friday, as per a state government statement quoting the CM, after a review meeting of Covid-19 and unlock 2.0 on Sunday.The Uttar Pradesh government, last Thursday, had ordered a 55-hour weekend restriction across the state, directing all establishments — government and private offices, commercial establishments, markets, urban and rural haats and public transport (barring UPSRTC buses ferrying passengers from railway stations) — to stay shut during the period. Only essential services are allowed to operate.“During the weekly closure (on Saturday and Sunday) the government will run cleanliness and sanitisation drives in the markets. Even the industrial establishments would undertake their own sanitisation drives on the two days,” Adityanath said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage State medical education minister, Suresh Khanna, state health minister, Jai Pratap Singh, chief secretary, RK Tiwari, infrastructure and industrial development commissioner, Alok Tandon, agriculture production commissioner, Alok Sinha, additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi and director-general of police, HC Awasthi, were among those who attended the meeting. He said that the construction work at ongoing projects, such as expressways, dams and flood control constructions, would continue with social distancing on all days. Elaborating on Covid-19 arrangements, the CM called for uninterrupted supply of oxygen to all dedicated hospitals and oxygen backup stock there for at least 48 hours. He also asked the officers concerned to continue extensive publicity and awareness drives for protection from Covid-19. “Tell people to make masks an essential part of life and get into the habit of washing hands with soap frequently,” he said.The CM said that so far, 77,000 revenue villages had undergone cleanliness drives and fogging, besides fogging in 9,000 urban municipal wards . “Establish a dialogue with village heads to guide them about regular cleanliness drives in their respective villages,” Adityanath directed officials. The CM reiterated that the state must scale up its Covid-19 testing capabilities to conduct 50,000 tests per day. He directed the Gorakhpur divisional commissioner to do effective monitoring for Covid-19 as well as prevention of vector-borne diseases in all the districts of Gorakhpur division.

13-07-2020||India||JP Nadda takes aim at Kerala govt, Rahul Gandhi at virtual rally||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda on Sunday launched an attack against the Pinarayi Vijayan government of Kerala, accusing it of corruption and nepotism and messing up data related to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. He also attacked former Congress president and Wayanad MP, Rahul Gandhi, for allegedly holding a secret meeting with the Chinese ambassador during the Doklam military standoff in 2017.The BJP president, who was addressing a virtual rally after an online inauguration of the party’s district office in Kasargod, said the Kerala government needed to come clean on the recent gold smuggling that led to the transfer of a senior bureaucrat.scandal. The transfer of M Sivasankar, a senior Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer who was also a secretary to chief minister Vijayan, came after opposition parties in the state stepped up pressure following the seizure of 30 kg gold from a diplomatic consignment. A former information technology consultant to the state government is the prime suspect in the case. “What is the relationship between that IT officer and the personal secretary of the chief minister?We can see the heat in CM’s office also. He wrote to Prime Minister saying no stone should remain unturned as far as the investigation is concerned. We have a saying ‘chor ki daadi mein tinka’, it means the office of CM is also involved somewhere,” the BJP chief said.“Misappropriation of funds, crimes against women, nepotism in political appointments, political patronage and several other things are prevalent under this Pinarayi government,” he said.The BJP leader also criticised the Kerala government for its handling of the Covid-19 crisis, He said the CM had made claims that the state is equipped to cater to over 150,000 people, but when the Vande Bharat flights to bring home stranded Indians from abroad were started, the situation turned out to be different. “They tried to suppress the data. Even when the Indian Medical Association (IMA) said we should increase the tests, the attitude of the state government was negative,” Nadda said.He went on add, “The Kerala house in Delhi was offered to anti-CAA {Citizenship (Amendment) Act} protestors} but not to the brave Malayali nurses who needed help. I also know that during the crisis, the health data of individuals was compromised. Migrant workers in Wayanad had to stage a protest against the government. There is political patronage to private companies,” the BJP leader said.Nadda claimed that the support for BJP in the state had been growing in the last decade, with its vote share rising from 6% to 16% and its membership growing from 1.1 million to 2.5 million. He urged the people to shun the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Democratic Front and the Congress-led United Democratic Front, which he said were two sides of the same coin.“To keep BJP out, the Left and the Congress joined hands at the last moment. If the BJP had not protested against the Sabarimala issue (of allowing women of all ages to visit the shrine), they would have destroyed the faith of people,” he said.Shifting his attack to Rahul Gandhi, he said, the Wayand MP had not disclosed his meeting with the Chinese ambassador during the Doklam stand-off.“These days he is asking questions about China and shows desh prem (love for the country), but the people of India know when the Doklam standoff was on he secretly met the Chinese ambassador and did not tell anyone. India got to know only when the Chinese Ambassador broadcast the picture with him online,” he said.On Sunday, Gandhi again attacked the government over the June 15 clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers, in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed in eastern Ladakh, alleging that the Chinese have captured Indian territory.“What happened {was} that China took away the sacred land of Mother India during Modi ji’s tenure?” the former Congress president tweeted on Sunday morning.The Kerala government brushed aside the BJP president’s criticism. “The whole world is praising the state’s Covid’s management system and we have the lowest mortality rate: records speak. In gold smuggling case we don’t have anything to hide. Our CM was first to call for a central agency probe. People know truth and that is our strength,” said state industry minister E P Jayarajan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nadda-takes-aim-at-kerala-govt-rahul-at-virtual-rally/story-gXieP3iR93rjhMCeiaFxAJ.html

He added that there was no sense of panic in India over the outbreak. Shah was speaking at an event organised by the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), or central paramilitary forces, for a mega plantation drive with a target of planting 13.7 million saplings by end of this month across the country. “The battle against Covid-19 is being carried out under the leadership of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi with people’s participation. Today India is leading a successful fight in managing the pandemic in the country. At a time when the health services of even the most developed countries were collapsing under its impact, the whole world was concerned how would India, - such a big densely populated country with a federal structure -- fight this pandemic, but today the most successful fight against this pandemic has been fought in India under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Shah said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage He added: “We are on a strong pedestal in the fight against Covid-19 under the leadership of the Prime Minister with the motto ‘One People, One Thought, One Nation’.”Unlike in other parts of the world, where only the governments are fighting the pandemic,in India, 1.3 billion citizens and state governments in India are united in fighting the threat, Shah said. “Nowhere across the country is there is a state of panic, in fact we are committed in facing this challenge and are resolute in overcoming this pandemic,” Shah added. The home minister lauded CAPFs for the role they were playing in fighting Covid-19.

13-07-2020||India||Farmers using cash scheme well: Study||A study of the impact of PM-KISAN, the Modi government’s income transfer scheme for farmers, has found that poor cultivators don’t squander the free money they receive, but invest it “efficiently” in modern farm technologies, apart from education and health.However, the extent to which farmers were likely to invest the free cash in agriculture was influenced by the availability of farm knowledge sessions imparted by the country’s network of institutions called Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVK), technically called agricultural extension services, the study found.How farmers utilised the money also depended on the very timing of cash release, according to the study, which is part of a larger project of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).Also read: After vigorous monsoon rains, crop planting gathers pace in IndiaThe study found that beneficiaries were diverse and there was no “statistical evidence” of any bias in selection of farmers on the basis of caste, community or faith.Under PM-KISAN, the government provides income support of Rs 6,000 a year to farmers with a valid enrolment, paid in three equal cash transfers of Rs 2,000 — one every four months. It was launched on February 24 last year, when the first instalment was paid.The cash is unconditional, i.e. nearly 80 million recipients are free to spend the money as they want, but it is expected that they utilise some part of the cash on farming.Farmers tend to invest substantially in agricultural technologies, such more productive seed varieties, when the cash release happens close to sowing seasons and KVK field officials are available to tutor farmers on latest methods of farming and use of better seeds, the study found. Also read: PM spotlights economy’s health at global event, says green shoots visible“So, what are the lessons? The lessons are that it is important to synchronise the release of the cash with that of farmer-training activities of Krishi Vigyan Kendras,” said Pramod Kumar Joshi, one of the authors of the study.The researchers studied two instalments for spending patterns. In one instalment, the results showed that 52% of those who received the first instalment spent it on agriculture and 26% on consumption, 7% on education and health and the remaining 15% on other incidental expenses such as festivals and marriages. The study showed that PM-KISAN has increased adoption of modern cultivars (crop varieties) for farmers with access to KVKs by 36 percentage points as compared to those who were not covered by KVK’s field scientists.More than 60% of farmers who received the money in the off-season spent it on consumption, education and medical purposes, suggesting that farmers are most likely to invest larger sums in agriculture when the money is released just before the sowing season.Also read| Cleaners to farmers: Higher risk of knee osteoarthritis linked to certain jobsJoshi collaborated with colleagues Deepak Varshney, Devesh Roy, Anjani Kumar at the IFPRI to sample 1,406 farmer households who got money under PM-KISAN and segregated them as those having access to government training in farm technologies and those who did not. Their findings were published in the IFPRI journal as well as in the EPW journal.In the last instalment of PM KISAN, the government paid nearly Rs 17,000 crore to about 80 million enrolled farmer households in April 2020.“PM-KISAN shows a potential to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty and low income of farmers through investment in modern technology,” the authors said in the study.KR Mani, an economist with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural Technology, said: “This study essentially demonstrates that it is not enough to give farmers cash, but the government must ramp up the numbers of farmers covered by KVKs, which are present in every district of the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-using-cash-scheme-well-study/story-aiNcR3s515IiYHEZxlb03M.html

SBWL’s approval has resurrected the serious environmental concerns that held up the project for the past two decades.At least 101 scientists have endorsed a letter written by 11 ecologists and wildlife biologists to the NBWL member-secretary and MoEFCC minister Prakash Javadekar on July 2, raising several concerns about the Hubballi Ankola Railway Line Project (HARP) in Karnataka, including irreversible damage it could do to forests, fragmenting wildlife habitats in the Western Ghats, a global biodiversity hotspot and a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) world heritage site.The project is likely to come up for NBWL’s nod before other requisite clearances are sought.The proposed rail track will pass through a wildlife corridor between Bedthi Conservation Reserve (BCR) and Kali Tiger Reserve (KTR), a natural habitat for many species, including tigers and elephants. The project involves entails of felling of around 190,000 trees.The habitat of Great Pied and Malabar Pied Hornbills, both keystone species -- species critical for the survival of other species in the region -- are likely to have a major impact due to the project.It also passes through habitats that host many endemic and endangered species such as the Malabar Tree Toad, said the letter written by ecologists that quoted from various peer-reviewed papers in a bid to bolster their argument.The letter and details of the project have also been published on the Conservation India website that is spearheading a campaign to protect ecology.“No amount of mitigation will compensate for the damage to the ecosystem that will be lost for good. Ultimately, the well-being of local communities will be jeopardised,” the letter said.The Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot has already lost 33,000 square kilometres, or up to 40% of its forest cover, in the last 100 years, according to scientists.A significant proportion of this forest loss is attributed to linear projects such as power transmission lines, highways, and construction of dams.“The existing railway line (Tinai Ghat-Castlerock), located around 50 km north of the proposed site, along with several state roads and power lines have significantly contributed to fragmenting forests of the region and creating edges. Implementing HARP will create many more edges by splitting 10 large forest patches of conservation significance into 15 smaller patches,” said the letter, endorsed by scientists from various research organisations.They have argued that mitigation measures would not be able to counter the ecological impact.The project has in the past been rejected by the Supreme Court (SC)-constituted Central Empowered Committee (CEC) in 2015 and by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in 2018, according to documents seen by HT.The MoEFCC’s Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) had also raised several issues regarding the project.“The CEC is of the considered view that the project would cause huge and irreparable damage to forests, wildlife and biodiversity of the Western Ghats, which would far outweigh the actual tangible benefits of the project. The CEC report was based on a number of hearings, documents, and meetings with various senior Karnataka government officials,” the CEC had said while rejecting HARP.A MoEFCC letter to principal secretary (forests), Karnataka, dated September 29, 2018, had stated that a site inspection committee of NTCA has rejected the project because out of the six tiger-occupied landscapes in India; Western Ghats tops on habitat connectivity and contiguity counts.The project has come up, pending NBWL and other national-level approvals, despite a spate of rejections in the past.HT has seen the minutes of Karnataka SBWL meeting, which suggests that the project was rejected unanimously by board members and special invitees on March 9.The minutes suggest that a majority of SBWL members had opposed the project.The additional chief secretary (ACS), forests, Karnataka had said that since the rail network had already been strengthened in the Tinnaighat-Castlerock-Caranzol area, HARP was redundant.Karnataka chief secretary (CS), who was a special invitee to the SBWL meeting, cited the Centre’s enquiry regarding the delay in the project’s implementation.In the March 20 meeting, the Board reversed its own decision.The minutes show that a number of special invitees attended the meeting, including the state minister of industries and the CS along with chief minister BS Yediyurappa.The Board recommended the project because of the need for development in the north Karnataka region.Environmentalists have found holes in SBWL’s approval for the project.“The decision taken on March 9 to reject the proposal was in conformity with legal and statutory procedures. However, handpicked special invitees with no expertise in wildlife were allowed to deliberate at a hurriedly convened meeting on March 20, violating all procedural norms. This smacks of arbitrariness. There is no legal provision under the Wildlife Act, 1972, that empowers the State Board to review its own decision taken after completion of a statutory process,” said Praveen Bhargav of the Bengaluru-based Wildlife First, a conservation advocacy group.HT had sent queries on whether Javadekar had received the scientists’ representation on Monday but did not get a response till Tuesday evening.Another NBWL, member, however, said on condition of anonymity that all members had received the representation and it would be deliberated upon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rail-project-gets-k-taka-board-nod-as-experts-raise-concern/story-pjdvMZFTAJIYfwDPduvCeM.html

13-07-2020||Today's||Indians deserve more greenery, cities must change||The last four months have been traumatic for most Indians. Economic issues apart, the social pain has been almost unwatchable. We’re all traumatised. Many of us need mental health relief.Being one with nature is an important way to heal mental health. Most of us have to walk a fair distance for a patch of grass with a few trees — an urban Indian park, an apology for nature. A lot of us nurture a few plants in our tiny balconies. Our cities must change. Let’s first redesign housing so that trees, creepers and balconies for houseplants are part of the colony space. Even a little humble gardening is known to make people happier. We deserve more greens in our commons. The earlier vatika-type spaces stand replaced with passive parks, concrete walking trails and boring flower beds with occasional shrubs touted as outdoors. Let’s transform these into active interactions where one can smell the flowers and mud, the trees drop their flowers and leaves around you, where earthworms come out on a rainy day with red velvet beetles.This won’t happen just like that, because existing designers are often stubborn. We require specifications — on native plants, diversity, and many other aspects. We also need exposure to what is a great local park can be like. Most important, we have to stop cutting down our trees, choking ponds and replacing them with infra. The fundamental human need for proximity to nature is undeniable, and cities must figure out how to provide it to everyone, rich or poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/indians-deserve-more-greenery-cities-must-change/story-J33xDNvgCdOQapOnKz0nUI.html

But, more fundamentally, it marks a sharp move away from the secular nation founded by the father of modern Turkey, Kemal Ataturk, to an Islamic one.The site is rich in history. It was a Byzantine church, converted into a mosque after the Ottomans overran Constantinople (present-day Istanbul) in 1453. It was made a museum in 1934 when Ataturk began to make Turkey a secular republic. Mr Erdogan’s recent move has been criticised by many, including Pope Francis, as an attempt to rewrite history. For Christians, Hagia Sophia holds significance as an orthodox Christian monument. Since 2002, when Mr Erdogan came to power, he has chipped away at the Kemalist State and Islamised it. Civil liberties have been eroded, the media is under fire, and criticisms of his regime are often met with disproportionate responses. Also, his dangerous foreign policy interventions in Syria and Libya have strengthened radical Islamists in both countries.Mr Erdogan is now trying to push, under the garb of restoring past historic glory, majoritarian political measures. What worked for the Ottomans cannot work today. There is a delicate weaving together of history, heritage, culture, which explains symbols of each nation — and nations must embrace it rather than overturn it. This is a lesson that many, who are set on righting the real or perceived wrongs of history, would do well to remember in Turkey and beyond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/why-erdogan-is-wrong-on-hagia-sophia-ht-editorial/story-I1sntjXWp46DD9WZPRf2zN.html
