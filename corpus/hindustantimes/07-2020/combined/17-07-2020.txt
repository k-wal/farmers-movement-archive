Yet, what is little known is that these projects are financially unviable and are likely to burden India’s financial institutions with non-performing assets, while adversely affecting the health of state electricity distribution companies.First, thanks to sustained investments, increased efficiency and attractive pricing in the solar and wind energy sector, and recently-commissioned power assets, there is a supply glut in the energy market. The market for energy is saturated and there is a negligible shortage in peak demand (which was only 0.7% in the last 18 months). This is likely to continue in the future, well beyond the current decade. Over the years, hydropower has been justified as being necessary to provide power at night, when demand peaks and solar energy is absent. This rationale is no longer applicable for new projects, as hydropower loses ground to hybrid solutions — a mix of solar and spare thermal capacity, for instance — that offer round-the-clock power and are priced at low, competitive rates. Power storage — specifically battery technology — is rapidly evolving. A report by McKinsey & Company, The New Rules of Competition in Energy Storage, predicts: “The total cost of energy-storage systems should fall 50 to 70% by 2025 as a result of design advances, economies of scale, and streamlined processes”. Second, the proposed hydropower projects in the Northeast are financially unviable and it is likely that most of them will end up as stranded assets. An analysis of the Etalin Hydropower (3,097 Megawatts) project shows cumulative cash flow during the loan life-cycle of 23 years to be negative, despite a highly favourable levelled tariff of Rs 4.32 per unit. At prices being offered in auctions for round-the-clock power supply today (prices are likely to drop further in future), the project will be unable to even service its loan of Rs 17,500 crore. Third, there is a high risk of geological accidents: Arunachal Pradesh is categorised as Zone V (maximum risk) in the mapping of seismic zones in India, and there is a recent history of numerous quakes above five on the Richter scale. In 2011, an earthquake at the Teesta Dam site left 16 people dead and damaged the project. Regular landslides in the monsoons have also been disruptive. A study by the Institute of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Potsdam, Germany, estimates that at least 25% of hydropower projects in the India, Nepal and Bhutan’s Himalayas are likely to face severe damage from quake-triggered landslides. Then there are risks from glacial melt and lake bursts due to the unpredictable nature of the volume and velocity of the water. Fourth, long gestation period: A hydropower project in Arunachal Pradesh will, realistically, take eight to 10 years or more to be operational, after considering the terrain, monsoon activity and the clearance of forest cover. The economics of power generation are likely to change substantially in favour of consumers in this decade, which will affect revenues and profitability.Fifth, hydropower projects will lead to further deterioration in distribution companies (discom) finances. If the government supports the Etalin Hydropower project, for example, by mandating a Power Purchase Agreement at Rs 4.32, the estimated implicit taxpayer-funded subsidy (considering the current opportunity options available) would be about ~11,480 crore. This does not consider the inevitable power transmission losses from a remote location in the Northeast to its user destination. In a recent interview with the Mint, the chief operating officer of the Indian Energy Exchange predicted that, in future, the discoms would emphasise more on lowering costs and increasing consumer choices, which imply a lowering of tariffs and consequent increase in financial losses.Sixth, hydropower projects in India have a notoriously poor record in engaging with local communities and their concerns of livelihood and displacement; these concerns have been met with indifference and, at times, force. The existing projects in the Northeast are no different and do not pass even the most basic tests in the social responsibility checklist that financial institutions seek from their borrowers.Hydropower projects in the Northeast are today a poor financial investment and need to be shelved for the larger common good. Instead of providing subsidies to the power-generation value chain, the urgent imperative is to encourage power conservation (by introducing, for instance, a variation of surge pricing during peak hours), reduce distribution losses, promote optimum utilisation of existing energy infrastructure and popularise rooftop solar energy.

Then we took my father to Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), where doctors declared him brought dead,” the complainant added.DSP Shamsher Singh Dahiya said they had registered a case under sections 302 (murder), 34 and 452 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 25 of the Arms Act against the unidentified assailants, who are at large.“We have launched a manhunt to nab the accused. The motive behind the murder could not be known,” the DSP added.HOODA SEEKS IMMEDIATE ARRESTSReacting to the sarpanch’s killing, former Haryana chief minister and leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said law and order have completely collapsed in the state. He has demanded immediate arrest of the assailants. “The situation has worsened in Rohtak, Sonepat , Jhajjar, Bhiwani and Jind, where criminals are targeting public representatives and common citizens. I have spoken to Haryana DGP Manoj Yadava and Rohtak SP Rahul Sharma demanding immediate arrest of the sarpanch’s assailants,” Hooda said, adding that the government should compensate the victim’s family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/75-year-old-dalit-sarpanch-shot-dead-in-rohtak-village/story-JLv1Cyr8T4QSVHYL5z5m5H.html

Both of them had attended wedding ceremonies lately.”Temples to remain open till 10pm on SundayThe state government on Friday ordered that temples in Haryana, except Gurugram and Faridabad, will remain open from 5am to 10pm on July 19 in view of Shivratri observed during the month of Shravan. Additional chief secretary (ACS), home, Vijai Vardhan said temple managements have been advised to follow the standard operating procedures (SOPs), including allowing only individual prayers and sanitisation of premises at regular intervals. “To prevent overcrowding, temple managements have been told to issue tokens and ensure that not more than five persons are allowed to worship inside the temple,” said the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/795-fresh-cases-detected-in-haryana-tally-nears-25-000/story-fA6upmWprLiXnww2q9JveO.html
17-07-2020||City||Slum women taught to make rakhi, handicrafts to sustain themselves||New Delhi:Kumari Jyoti, 21, had lost her job in April this year after a garment factory where she used to work decided to wrap up its operations due to Covid-19 pandemic. After being without work and money for over two months, Jyoti is now part of a group of women undergoing skill training to make items such as rakhi and handicrafts under the aegis of the New Delhi district administration.The New Delhi district administration has from Thursday started a skill-development programme to empower people, especially women from economically weaker sections living in slum areas and battling for survival. The initiative named as “Ummeed Ki Rakhi” aims at generating a source of employment for those families who lost their job due to the impact of Covid-19 on society. “I have a family of six people, including my parents and all used to work before Covid-19 outbreak. Now everyone is sitting idle at home so it was difficult to survive without money and work for two months. A few days back I came to know about skill training being given by the government. I’m being trained to make rakhis as the festival of Rakshabandhan is approaching. With such initiatives, many needy persons will not only get money but also become self-reliant,” Jyoti, a resident of Budh Nagar near Narayana said.According to officials, under the initiative, a self-help group of around 50 people, mainly women, is being trained about making Rakhi ahead of the festival of Rakshabandhan.They said local NGOs have been roped in to provide raw material and for sale of Rakhi.Tanvi Garg, district magistrate New Delhi, said “Ummeed Ki Rakhi” is a self-help group project under which effort is being made to generate employment by rakhi making for those who lost their jobs due to the pandemic.She said that under this project, different self-help groups of around 50 people each, mainly women, are created from the slums of Budh Nagar, Inderpuri and other areas in the district.“These SHGs are being trained about Rakhi making with the help of volunteers and various NGOs. Once the Rakhi making project is successful, we will provide them training to make homemade items, handicrafts, etc., so that a self-sustainable model of employment generation can be established,” Garg said.Most of SHG members in the programme are women who used to work at factories and shops.Nitin Shakya, the district’s coronavirus nodal officer who is supervising the initiative, said only one centre has been set up at a primary school where aspirants have imparted skill training of Rakhi making and product generation. He said that four more such centres will come up at Vasant Vihar, Nangal Raya, Narayana and Chanakyapuri slums.He said the target is to make 10,000 rakhis and those will not only be sold in the open market but also stalls will be set up in the government offices in the district. “The district administration will promote the sale of rakhi for their own staff and also motivate others to help these self-help group. Proceeds from the sale of Rakhis will be given to the self-help group after deduction of the cost of raw materials,” he said.Shakya said that all safety standards with respect to social distancing, mask, sanitisers among others are ensured while imparting training to aspirants and preparing Rakhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/slum-women-taught-to-make-rakhi-handicrafts-to-sustain-themselves/story-YW24LHsePZ46wGq8ZHv7XI.html
17-07-2020||City||Human trial of Covaxin begins at Rohtak PGIMS||Haryana health minister Anil Vij on Friday announced that human trials to fight coronavirus with Covaxin — the country’s foremost vaccine candidate for Covid-19 — have started at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) in Rohtak. “Three subjects were enrolled for this purpose today (Friday). All three have tolerated the vaccine very well. There were no adverse effects,” he tweeted. Covaxin has been developed by the Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical company Bharat Biotech in collaboration with National Institute of Virology (NIV) and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) earlier approved the biotech company to initiate the phase 1 and 2 human clinical trials. PGIMS has become the second facility in India after All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Patna, to begin the human trials. Dr Savita Verma, principal investigator of the trial, said they had administered the first dose of vaccine (0.5ml) to three volunteers on Friday. “These volunteers were kept under observation for three hours. They tolerated the vaccine very well. Later, the volunteers were sent back home and a team of doctors will now examine their health everyday. PGIMS, along with three other medical institutes, will conduct human trials on 50 volunteers in the first phase. The second phase will commence 14 days later after seeing the result of the vaccine in these volunteers,” she added. Dr Verma said 17 individuals have undergone rigorous medical scrutiny so far to check whether they have been previously infected with the virus or suffered from any liver, lungs or kidney ailments and any other infectious diseases.“Three of these volunteers, who were found eligible, were administered the vaccine today and the report of 13 is awaited,” she added.Co-investigator Dr Ramesh Verma said, “If any of these volunteers experiences adverse effects, Bharat Biotech will compensate them. We urge more volunteers to register themselves for the human trials,” Dr Verma added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/human-trial-of-covaxin-begins-at-rohtak-pgims/story-BT385QzniBwie1Av5isJnM.html
17-07-2020||India||Unlock 2.0: Pet salons and vets call for caution, avoid crowding||Pet parents living in zones where the access to pet parlours and veterinarian services are allowed, had started thronging the parlours as soon as they reopened post lockdown. But then the influx of pet parents lead to overcrowding of these places. Now, most of the pet clinics and grooming salons, which are operational, have decided to take to strict precautionary measures. “To avoid over crowding, we have been asking all our clients to make prior appointments. No walk in is being entertained, unless it’s an emergency. Additionally, it’s also the responsibility of people to check their temperatures and ensure that they don’t come out from a hotspot just to visit a groomer,” says veterinarian Santosh Kumar who has clinics in Gurugram and Delhi. In the present phase of unlock, when most are expected to stay indoors and avoid the spread of Covid-19, many pet parents — who are tired of grooming their pets by themselves in the last three-four months — are visiting pet salons in desperation. The grooming salons that are open, have resorted to strictly practising social distancing. Akshay Mahendru, owner of a pet salon, says, “We are doing grooming on appointment basis only, and allotting slots for each pet parent, who can get the service done and move out without coming in contact with another person. Only the pet goes inside, and the parents can wait in the car or go buy groceries. We don’t want them to wait in the facility.” Pet groomers have also been advising pet parents to clean their pets clean before they venture out for a salon visit. “When you leave your home, wipe your dog’s collar and leash with an antibacterial wipe or soapy water and then make them get into your car. When you reach the salon or clinic for your dog’s appointment, ensure that you are the only client being allowed inside. Avoid getting inside if there are customers waiting for the place to be vacant. Ensure that you and the clinic staff are wearing masks and gloves at all times, and sanitizer is available for use,” advises Preeti Sood, a Delhi-based pet groomer, adding, “For grooming, it’s advisable to leave your dog in the care of your groomer and come back to pick up once the grooming is over. Upon returning, don’t go inside the salon and wait for the staff to get your dog to the car. Use digital payment options to avoid contact.”Kumar opines, “Dogs haven’t been proved as biological carriers of coronavirus. However, we need to ensure to dab a little bit of sanitiser and run it through our pets’ body and their paws, each time you are back from your visit to the vet or groomer. Ensure that you also wipe down the leash and the collar again.”Follow more on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/unlock-2-0-pet-salons-and-vets-call-for-caution-avoid-crowding/story-YXBQ1AGGkXu59MkN8I6cdP.html
17-07-2020||Gurugram||Serological survey: 24 out of 360 people found with antibodies in Gurugram||Out of the 360 people selected randomly from different occupational backgrounds for the ongoing serological survey in the city to study the prevalence of Covid-19 infection, 24 were found to have developed antibodies, according to officials of the district health department on Friday.A serological survey is an epidemiological tool used to understand the prevalence of Covid-19 infection. It looks for antibodies to SARS-CoV2 — the virus that causes Covid-19. The survey helps in identifying individuals who have developed an immune response to the virus. It may be due to an active infection or a prior one. Antibodies are the proteins generated by the body to fight infection. It remains in the body for a long time, even after a patient has recovered. A serological survey, therefore, enables health officials to detect unreported cases of infection and understand its prevalence within a community. The district health department conducted the first round of serological survey on June 24 at the CMO office in the old Civil Hospital. At least 182 blood samples were collected mostly from police personnel, healthcare workers, etc. A total of 32 people tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Following the guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the health department took blood samples from people involved in different occupations, such as health workers, shopkeepers, vendors, sanitation workers, among others. As shared by the health department on Friday, out of the 360 people tested, 24 people had developed antibodies against Covid-19. These included five health workers, five shopkeepers, four workers of Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), two policemen, two drivers, a vendor, an immunocompromised patient, a person from a containment zone, an industrial worker, a media professional and a person from a rural area.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), Gurugram, said, “To estimate the proportion of the population exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the IgG Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) test is being conducted as a part of the serological survey. The test looks for antibodies developed in an individual for the coronavirus, and is highly sensitive and specific.”“For this, Gurugram received 460 antibody testing kits. Up to 100 kits have been used in people who had got their Covid-19 tests done earlier and were found to be either true positives or negatives. For the remaining kits, blood samples of only those people were taken who have a higher exposure to contract the infection. Out of the 360 kits used on such people in different parts of the city out, 24 had developed antibodies,” he added.As reported by HT earlier this week, the health department is increasing the sample size of the serological survey to 2,000 for which a private health consultant company is likely to be hired. The matter is currently awaiting a nod from the district administration. According to Yadav, the plan is to conduct more than 400 people for the survey in a month. “To cover 2,000 people, the survey will take nearly four to five months to be completed,” said Yadav.New Cases in GurugramMeanwhile, Gurugram on Friday reported 133 new Covid-19 cases. With these fresh infections, the total count of persons infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus reached 7,483. Out of these, 1,053 are active cases and 6,318 have recovered. In the last 24 hours, two Covid-19 deaths were reported. The total toll now stands at 112, out of which 75 are due to co-morbidities, while 37 have died without any known co-morbidities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/serological-survey-24-out-of-360-people-found-with-antibodies-in-gurugram/story-znxto5TVAqSixOoCs6JkBK.html
17-07-2020||City||Police come up with centralised system for deployment of personnel||Gurugram: To keep a check on criminal activities, the district police have come up with a centralised system for deployment of police personnel, officials said on Friday, adding that over 2,500 policemen would be deployed under the new plan. The move comes after the police department conducted the crime mapping exercise for identifying areas from where maximum cases of theft, burglary, and robberies were reported. As part of the new deployment plan, 79 police control room (PCR) vans, 123 patrol bikes and 61 check posts would be deployed in inner and outer cordons of the district.Subash Boken, police spokesperson, said that on the directions of police commissioner, a thorough crime mapping exercise was conducted over the past fortnight in which the police identified the crime prone areas from where maximum thefts, burglaries, and robberies were reported and the major routes used by the criminals to escape. “Accordingly, a deployment plan has been prepared in which both inter-district and inter-state check posts would be set up and police personnel would be deployed in three shifts of eight hours each. Earlier, the deployment of PCR vans and riders (patrol bikes) was from respective police stations and the policemen would also assist in other duties. As per the new plan, the personnel deputed with PCR vans, riders and nakas (check posts) would only be assigned specific patrolling duties,” Boken said in a statement.The personnel deployed on these duties would get one weekly off, he added. The police said the deployment plan was prepared in a way to ensure that the police teams (PCR vans, riders) are able to reach a spot in the least amount of time. All the PCR vans and riders have been provided with GPS and wireless communication system, they said. The police commissioner also issued directions to crime branch units to prepare a roster of most wanted criminals, proclaimed offenders and history-sheeters in a bid to reduce crime rate in the city, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-come-up-with-centralised-system-for-deployment-of-personnel/story-loD80VkEiHL7jmUG1Y6mAK.html
17-07-2020||Gurugram||Three months on since spit ban, not a single fine issued||Despite a municipal corporation of Gurugram (MCG) order three months ago banning spitting in public, the civic body is yet to issue even a single fine in this regard. Either the people had taken the order seriously or officials had not.Suspecting the latter, the MCG has now asked its sanitary and enforcement wing officials for an explanation.“Officials tasked with issuing such fines will be directed to start fining people for spitting in public on an immediate basis. The MCG is committed to ensuring that the spread of coronavirus is limited to the greatest extent and engaged in various initiatives towards this cause,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.On April 15, the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) had banned spitting in public fearing that it could spread the coronavirus disease, which is transmitted through respiratory droplets through the nose and mouth.On April 22, commissioner Singh had issued a public notice that said spitting in public spaces will invite an on-the-spot penalty of ₹1000 to violators under the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994.As per MCG officials privy to the matter, the fact that the civic body had not issued a single fine was only realised when officials were compiling data on fines issued for people not wearing masks in public.“It seems that after the direction issued in April, officials simply forgot about the directive and as such did not fine a single person for spitting in public. It was only when the weekly report on masks fining was being compiled earlier this week that a senior official also asked to include figures of public spitting. When officials said that not a single fine has been issued in this regard, did they realise about this,” said an official privy to the matter.Until June 17, MCG had issued fines for violations in mask-wearing to 308 people and collected fines worth ₹1.54 lakh.Bijendra Sharma, senior sanitary inspector (SSI), MCG, distanced himself from the matter.“My sanitary inspector is not present in the office today (Friday). I’ll ask him for the latest update on the issuance of fines for spitting in public spaces on Saturday,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/three-months-on-since-spit-ban-not-a-single-fine-issued/story-N9VwqtlhtCyOHOEB06TuqN.html
17-07-2020||Gurugram||Increased testing is turning the Covid tide in Gurugram, says admin||A sharp increase in testing, a declining test positivity rate (TPR), and an all time high recovery rate of 84.7 percent — these were the three main numbers that officials from the district administration and health department cited at a press conference on Friday, as evidence that Gurugram had turned the tide in its response to the Covid-19 pandemic.As per data furnished by the district chief medical officer, Dr. Virender Yadav, Gurugram has (till July 16) conducted at least 69,354 tests, of which 26,125 were rapid antigen tests, conducted in the last three odd weeks. The remainder constitutes RT-PCR tests (recognised as the gold standard in testing for the virus) done by the health department and private labs together. While dis-aggregated data for RT-PCR tests was not provided, Yadav said that the health department is now conducting close to 540 RT PCR tests per day in Gurugram, at par with private labs. “In all, the district is now conducting over 2,000 tests per day, as opposed to about 600 in June. The improvement stems largely from this increase in testing, followed by tracing and isolation,” he said.Yadav also added that the district’s overall TPR was just under 10 percent, while the number of new positives each day is within range of daily new recoveries. The World Health Organization (WHO) had suggested a TPR of 5% over two weeks, while increasing testing.“The TPR in June 23 ws nearly 14 percent, and we were getting close to 150-200 new cases daily. Our aim is to continuously reduce TPR while increasing tests. We are still getting about 100 new cases every day but that’s not worrying because our positivity rate is low, around nine percent,” he said. An analysis of health department data shows that the rapid antigen method now makes up a bulk of the district’s tests. Since they were first deployed in Gurugram on June 24 26,125 antigen tests have been conducted, while only 18,522 RT PCR tests were conducted during the same period. However, despite being the primary strategy for containment — as confirmed by multiple officials in the health department — antigen tests have not picked up a significant amount of positive cases, when compared to the RT PCR method. Within Gurugram, the two have a large discrepancy in their respective positivity rates, which experts say is expected, given that the Indian Council Medical Research (ICMR) validated antigen kits are fundamentally less sensitive and every negative case had to be followed by an RT-PCR test for confirmation. Of the total antigen tests conducted, 2,470 samples were retested via RT PCR (as people were showing symptoms), which found 283 individuals positive. It also raised concerns if whether Gurugram was effectively containing the the virus.As per numbers given by Yadav at Friday’s press conference, 679 positive cases in three weeks were detected via antigen tests (indicating a TPR of 2.5 percent). During the same period, 1909 positives were detected via RT PCR tests (indicating a TPR of 10 percent). “This is worrying, because a fundamentally less reliable test is being adopted as the district’s primary testing strategy. It is very likely that antigen tests, despite being able to identify several positives at once, are also letting an equal number of false negatives slip through the cracks, which does not really help with cutting chain of transmission,” said Dheeraj Singh, a city-based data scientist tracking state and district trends.Dr. Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, responded, saying, “Antigen tests are not as targeted, whereas an RT-PCR test is done only when there is a higher likelihood of infection. The discrepancy between their positivity rates is not worrying.” Until July 16, the district had seen 110 deaths, with a case-fatality ratio (CFR) of 1.5%. CMO Yadav said that, by Monday, they are expecting the district’s mortality rate to dip below 1.5% for the first time in at least six weeks. The mortality ratio came down to 1.49% on Friday itself with two more deaths and total cases at 7,483. “By Monday, we expect the mortality rate to settle at somewhere around 1.47% percent. Of 110 deaths (till July 16), about 10 deaths have been sudden, where the patient couldn’t be isolated in time. This hasn’t happened in July.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/increased-testing-is-turning-the-covid-tide-in-gurugram-says-admin/story-cebVVffcfrR2FWUQgXu9oO.html
17-07-2020||City||Health department to tie up with RWAs to hold Covid-19 testing camps in residential societies||To ramp up Covid-19 testing in the city, the health department, along with the district administration, will hold antigen testing camps in gated societies and condominiums in the coming weeks. Officials said that the proposal is at an initial stage and they plan to approach the residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) for coordination. “The plan is to conduct antigen detection tests in high-rise buildings, condominiums and gated colonies during the evening hours. The test will be conducted from 4pm to 7pm or 8pm, depending on the suggestions put forward by the RWAs,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer(CMO), Gurugram, while addressing a press meet on Friday. “We are yet to tie up with the residential societies for holding these Covid-19 testing camps in their areas,” he said. The rapid antigen diagnostic test detects the proteins attached to the coronavirus by testing a sample collected from the nasal cavity of a patient using swabs. The test delivers result within 30 minutes.Dhruv Bansal, media spokesperson for the DLF RWAs, called health department’s initiative an excellent move. “The RWA will coordinate with the health department in holding the testing camps in the evening. Two Covid-19 testing camps have already been organised in DLF Phase-I and Phase-2 with the help of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram(MCG). We want to conduct the camp again so that more number of people could turn up for the tests,” said Bansal. Vijay Chopra, president, The Ivy condominium, Sector 28 said, “The health department has said that they will be conducting antigen tests of more than 150 people in our society. Dates are yet to be finalised as we are still circulating the message regarding the testing camps. The health team has already taken 51 samples from the society for the Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test this week. Out of them, 30 have tested negative and results of 21 are awaited. Next week antigen tests will be conducted on residents, estate staff and house helps.”Testing camps are currently being conducted for rapid detection of the virus in various Covid-19 clusters across the city. Till now, more than 26,000 people in the clusters have been tested using the antigen detection kits manufactured by a South Korean company based in Manesar. Out of the 26,125 tests conducted so far, 697 had tested coronavirus positive and have been asked to isolate at home.Yadav said that following the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) guidelines, those who tested negative for the antigen test, were asked to give oral and nasal swab samples for the RT-PCR test for final confirmation. “It was found that 280 were Covid-19 positive, out of the 25,428 people who tested negative for the antigen detection test,” said Yadav. RT-PCR is considered to be the gold standard of Covid-19 testing as it detects the genetic material of the virus and helps in diagnosing active Covid-19 infections.He said that within the next 16 days, 154 antigen testing camps will be organised in parts of Rajiv Nagar, Nathupur, Palam Vihar, Laxman Vihar, Firoj Gandhi Colony, Mullahera, Patel Nagar, Om Nagar, Manesar and Sohna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/health-department-to-tie-up-with-rwas-to-hold-covid-19-testing-camps-in-residential-societies/story-2LV6R1WIH9jlICt6gML1TM.html
17-07-2020||Chandigarh||Clinical trials for Covaxin start at PGIMS-Rohtak; 3 given doses||The Phase-1 of human clinical trials for Covaxin — one of the two indigenous vaccine candidates for Covid-19— started at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS)-Rohtak on Friday. Haryana’s health minister Anil Vij took to Twitter to break the news on Friday afternoon.“Human trial with Corona vaccine (COVAXIN) of Bharat Biotech started at PGI Rohtak today. Three subjects were enrolled today. All have tolerated the vaccine very well. There were no adverse efforts (sic),” wrote Vij on Twitter.Covaxin is an indigenous Covid-19 vaccine, which is being developed by Bharat Biotech and ICMR’s National Institute of Virology, Pune. It is one of the two Indian vaccine candidates that have received the Drug Controller General of India’s nod to proceed with the Phase-1 and Phase-2 human clinical trials. In Rohtak, the sample size for Phase-1 trials is expected to around 8 to 10 people, officials said. In the past 10 days since PGIMS-Rohtak began enrolling subjects for trials, close to 100 individuals from Haryana have registered to be a part of the study.Officials at PGIMS Rohtak said that 22 of these volunteers have already been screened for their medical history, and three of them received the vaccine on Friday.Human dosing began at 10:30am, when one of the three subjects was first given a 3ug dose of Covaxin, via an intramuscular injection. After observing the subject for 30 minutes, the remaining two subjects received their vaccine doses between 11am and 12pm. “The subjects are in the age group of 22 to 35. They were kept under observation at PGIMS for three hours before being sent home. During follow-up calls in the evening, the subjects were not showing any adverse reactions. We are quite relieved and happy at today’s progress,” said Dr Savita Verma, principal investigator of the Covaxin clinical trial at PGIMS-Rohtak.The subjects will now be given a second dose of the vaccine in 14 days, provided no adverse reactions are reported prior to the date. Blood samples, to check for the presence of antibodies, will also be taken from the subjects at 14 days and 28 days, officials at PGIMS confirmed. “There are two proposed doses of the final vaccine — 3ug and 6ug. These are extrapolated from data obtained from pre-trial tests on animals. We have administered the lower dose today,” Verma added. Doctors at PGIMS explained that, at this point in the double-blind trial, it is unknown whether any of the three subjects received a placebo. “The vials we received are not marked. There is a 4:1 ratio, where for every four persons who receive the vaccine, one person gets a placebo, but as the administrator, we will not know who gets what. We may know in 14 days, depending on seroconversion,” Verma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/clinical-trials-for-covaxin-start-at-pgims-rohtak-3-given-doses/story-44P8pRFxn9u9gSh70iiK3N.html

The east civic body had demolished 56 houses constructed on a service road of the Master Plan Road following a court order.The directions were issued after Kejriwal on Friday visited the area and met affected people. Kejriwal said directions had been issued to arrange immediate temporary shelters in tents on nearby plots or in schools.“Many jhuggis have been demolished here on the directions of the Delhi High Court. I directed the officials to begin an in-depth study of the order of the Delhi High Court, and on how a court order for demolition can be issued in these times of the pandemic. After analysing the court order, we will explore all options and try to find a permanent solution. We will arrange temporary shelters to people by either erecting tents on nearby land, or providing lodging facilities in schools, where all necessary arrangements such as food, water, lodging, and sanitation will be made,” Kejriwal said in a statement.According to EDMC officials, the matter related to the construction of houses on a service lane along the nullah road in east Delhi had been on in the high court since 2011, and those who had encroached upon the service road were given proper hearing. The action was taken after high court gave an ultimatum to the civic body to remove encroachments before August 17, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-offers-shelters-to-people-evicted-in-demolition-drive/story-nTQ8wYSoPtoU0CWg3oqTgO.html
17-07-2020||City||Government allows penal interest waiver of six months if pending amount paid by September 30||The Uttar Pradesh government has offered to waive six months’ penal interest on pending dues of people who have bought property from their respective area development authorities, provided they pay the pending amount by September 30, 2020.Ghaziabad development authority (GDA) officials said that the order will help the cash-strapped body generate revenue. Since the Covid-19 hit, the authority has been losing cash as the state leveraged its resources to fight the pandemic.The order defines six months as from March 1, 2020 to August 31.“At present we have provision of 12% of simple interest and 3% additional penal interest in case of pending payments. According to the government order, if the pending payments are cleared by September 30, there will be no levy of penal interest on pending amount for the six months,” said Asheesh Shivpuri, authority’s chief architect and town planner.According to officials, the new provision under the government order is likely to benefit about 7000 property owners who have pending payments to be made to the authority.“In case there is any other waiver applicable on residential/commercial properties, such as if one-time payments are made within 45-60 days, then the computation of the waiver will not take into account the period of March 1 to August 31. The provisions of the government order will not amount to any concession or change in terms and conditions of the agreement,” the government order said.According to officials, the repayment period in case of economically weaker sections is 10 years, three years in case of middle income group flats and two years in case of higher income group flats. It is five years in case of commercial properties.“The allottee has to repay within the time frame specified for each type of property and has to repay in monthly instalments. In normal course 12% simple interest is charged on monthly instalments. In case of default of single instalment, the component of penal interest, which is 3% above the simple interest, is charged accordingly,” Shivpuri added.Developers feel that the order should be more relaxed.“We feel the present order should be more accommodative in terms that it should be rolled out for a period of at least one year in wake of the pandemic. Since many states are enforcing lockdown again and eight days in a week (two days of Saturday and Sunday) are also under weekend restrictions in UP, the real estate will hardly see people coming in to look for property which they usually arrive during the weekends,” said Gaurav Gupta, president – Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI - Ghaziabad). “Further, the construction works have also suffered during the lockdown and full workforce is still not available. So, people will have no big liquidity available with them in present times to pay up entire pending amount by September 30.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/government-allows-penal-interest-waiver-of-six-months-if-pending-amount-paid-by-september-30/story-YQ7MBAbGSYoZBnBwsemLEI.html

The vegetable vendor, Durgesh, was shot at on July 9 at his shop outside a housing society. He died during treatment on July 14. His family had allegedly blamed the son of a policeman posted with the fire department for the death, as the cop’s son had been booked in May by the Surajpur police after he allegedly assaulted Durgesh when he refused to pay extortion money to him. The police had also taken him in custody to question him.However, around 1am on Friday, the police, while checking at the FNG road near Sector 144, waved a Brezza car to stop. But the car’s occupants tried to flee and fired at the police team chasing them.“Both the suspects were injured in the retaliatory firing. They were identified as Yogesh Bhati and Kapil Bhati who carried rewards of Rs 50,000 and Rs 25, 000 on their heads, respectively. Yogesh is one of the top 10 criminals of the district and works as a sharpshooter for the Sunder Bhati gang. They were also involved in several extortion cases,” said Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Zone 2.Police officials said that the car had been stolen by them from Dadri on February 5. From the vehicle, Rs 50,000 was also recovered which was part of the loot from a previous robbery. Two country made pistols were also recovered from them, the officials said, adding that they were taken to the district hospital for treatment.The duo was allegedly responsible for the shooting of Durgesh as he had refused to pay extortion money to them, said the police. Chander said that a probe is on for the connection between the two extortion bids and the role of the previous suspect in this murder.“Yogesh was also responsible for the murder of another criminal Nandu, a native of Noida, in police custody in Bijnore upon instructions from Sunder. Kapil was involved in the murder of his own father with whom he had issues,” said DCP.The police have identified at least 16 criminal cases, including that of murder, against Yogesh while Kapil also has several murder cases against him, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-wanted-men-held-for-murder-of-vegetable-vendor/story-DXJlpOpmuMRwWM2vU39S3O.html

Dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the massacre on April 13, 1919, the Union culture and tourism ministry is executing the project to transform the historical monument at a cost of Rs 20 crore. Work started last year.A group of media persons got a preview of the work completed till now with the garden being opened for them. The facility is otherwise closed for the public. The garden has acquired a new look and has been given a modern, contemporary feel. Newly-constructed slopes under the landscaping on both sides of the stretch that leads to the flame-shaped memorial of those killed in the massacre, enhances its solemn grace. The Amar Jyoti has been relocated. Rajya Sabha member and Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust member Shwait Malik had arranged the preview. Though the bullet marks have been preserved properly, the “Shaheedi Khu” (Martyrs’ Well) and the historic narrow street leading to its entrance have been modernised totally, amid controversy with some social activists claiming that the heritage character of the monument was being destroyed in the name of giving a facelift. The well has been plastered and painted from the inside. Glass has been fitted on the windows of the new see-through canopy built on it.Pertinently, the narrow street which was used by the British troops to enter the premises to fire at the Indians, who had gathered there peacefully, and carries heritage value, has been given a new design with sculptures depicting ordinary men and women of that age on newly-plastered walls of both sides. The galleries depicting the history of the massacre and other episodes of Indian freedom struggle are ready. Speakers for light and sound show have been installed. Malik added that the rest of the work will be finished within two months and the memorial will be thrown open for public soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jallianwala-bagh-gets-facelift-with-80-redevelopment-done/story-ar6r4Ib6ov3ca8Z1tyZrRN.html

According to the department officials, they have so far updated 11,184 contacts of 2,434 patients even as the district has a total of about 3,765 Covid-19 cases till July 16.The Ghaziabad district has adopted a new system for speedy contact tracing, increased testing and faster referral of Covid patients to hospitals, with a view to break the chain of infections. For contact tracing, the administration had roped in the services of the district police about a week ago and 18 police officers from across the district were assigned the task along with officials from the administration and the health department.Health department officials said they have finished uploading contact details of about 65% of the total Covid-19 patients in the district. The officials said there was slight lag in the process as cases have been rising at an average of 134 new cases per day since July 1.“Our teams are already on job of updating the contact tracing details on to the state portal and about 97% of this data is in our manual records. Under the revamped system, I have asked them to finish the work within a week. Once that is done, it will help us track contacts and carry out testing and referrals as needed,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, Ghaziabad.The Ghaziabad district currently has a score of about 4.6 contacts per patient. The district, as of July 10, has 189 Category 1 zones ( areas with a lone Covid-19 case) and 173 Category 2 zones (areas with more than one Covid-19 case). “The rise in number of category-2 containment zones means that the infection is being spread by positive patients to family members, relatives or acquaintances nearby. So it becomes imperative that we trace all contacts of a patient at the earliest,” said an official from the health department, on condition of anonymity.“In the past one week, after police were made a part of contact tracing, we have traced about 500 contacts of 250 Covid-19 patients. We are helping the health department and have also traced about 90 of 120 missing patients,” said Kalanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police.The contact tracing is also being done with the help of a team of six doctors -- three who are assigned to speak to patients over the phone and three to visit them. The team is stationed at a dedicated control room at the district headquarters.“Now, for better referral of patients to the appropriate Covid hospital, we have assigned three police station areas to each of the six doctors. It will now be their responsibility to track and send ambulances so that referrals is faster. Under the earlier system, referrals were getting done over 12 to 36 hours, which is now done within 12 to 24 hours,” said the health official quoted above.The rise in the number of Covid-19 cases is also a result of increased testing. From March 5 (when the first case was reported) to June 30, the district could conduct only 12,160 tests. During the last week of June, the district started rapid antigen testing which increased testing capabilities and also expedited results.Until Friday morning, the total sampling/testing figures had touched 60,000 in Ghaziabad and included 27,000 rapid antigen tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-plans-to-clear-backlog-of-contact-tracing-of-covid-19-patients-within-a-week/story-p29UpUyT5kLDhnB7OwoIlJ.html

17-07-2020||Chandigarh||No syndicate meeting at Punjabi varsity for 11 months; action on inquiry reports delayed indefinitely||Punjabi University has not held a syndicate meeting for the past 11 months, raising questions over the administration’s working. The last syndicate meeting, in which administrative issues were taken up, was held on August 21, 2019, under the chairpersonship of vice-chancellor professor BS Ghuman, whose tenure was renewed for three years by the Punjab government last month. In March this year, only a special annual budget meeting that was attended by syndicate members was held. The delay in holding the syndicate meeting has delayed action against officials and employees on the basis of the findings of inquiry reports related to allegations of corruption, nepotism and misuse of funds during 2007-2017.FINANCIAL CRISIS NOT DISCUSSED’A senior professor, who did not wish to be named, said, “Apart for fixing responsibility on those found guilty in inquiry reports, the administration has failed to discuss key issues concerning the varsity, primarily the acute financial crisis, by not holding a syndicate meeting. Over the past 11 months, appointments and key decisions have been made hoping that they will be approved by the syndicate, which is illegal.” It may be mentioned that in June, the higher education department had given directions to hold a meeting. The directions have not been adhered to so far.V-C Ghuman said “Though the meeting was held in March but only the annual budget was listed in the agenda. For other key administrative issues, the meeting will be held sooner.”He added that the discussions were on with the newly appointed registrar to finalise the agenda.“The probe reports will be discussed prominently in a meeting that is expected to be organised online,” he said.

Though the number of Covid-19 cases are relentlessly rising across the district, a large number of people could be seen pouring into the Ludhiana head post office situated at Ferozepur Road. The post office receives an average 44,000 articles daily, of which 18,000 are rakhis these days, say officials. Last month, the head post office received 7,000 ordinary mails, 6,500 registered articles and 12,000 speed post orders. With the festival a fortnight away, the post office received 10,000 ordinary mails, 11,000 registered articles and 23,000 speed post requests.Ludhiana post office senior superintendent Amanpreet Singh said, “Ordinarily, we receive 25,000 mails a day. Ahead of rakhi, the volume always increases. However, this time, perhaps due to the growing number of Covid-19 cases, people are avoiding travel and sending rakhi via post.”‘SECURITY MEASURES IN PLACE’ We have taken all precautionary measures and boxes have made to ensure people maintain social distancing . At every counter, a board instructing people to wear marks and maintain social distancing have been propped up, said Amanpreet. “All the articles received are properly sanitised and sorted at the National Sorting Hub office based at the Ludhiana railway station. The hub receives mail from 11 districts,” he said.Ask him if the rakhis will reach on time amid the pandemic, he says, “All the mails will be delivered at the same time as earlier and in the states where few areas have been declared hot spots, there the articles will reach but may take more days then usual,” he said. Ankita Khosla, a resident of Ghumar Mandi, said, “I have sent the rakhis to Canada and Delhi through speed post. I want to visit my parents, but due to spike in number of Covid-19 cases, I decided to stay at home. The coronavirus pandemic has affected all services and I hope my brothers will receive the letter before rakhi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-rakhi-round-the-corner-ludhiana-s-post-office-is-back-in-vogue/story-1OshGWLKd34QBUlGKvUEkM.html

Senior officers said the gold was smuggled in from Myanmar and was being transported to Delhi via road from Assam, in the absence of international flights.According to the DRI officials, the operation was executed on Tuesday and arrests were made simultaneously in Delhi, Mujaffarpur and Siliguri in west Bengal.Deputy director Nilesh Rai said based on intelligence inputs, the Delhi unit of DRI acted and intercepted two men at Jewar toll plaza when they were headed to Delhi in a roadways bus from Guwahati via Siliguri. “Gold bars weighing 4.98kg were recovered from them,” Rai said.“Simultaneously, on further information, our teams in Siliguri intercepted two passengers at a bus station when they were about to board a bus to Patna, Bihar. Their luggage was checked and 30 gold bars weighing 4.98kg were recovered,” Rai said.The officer said teams kept building intelligence and in yet another operation in Patna, they intercepted two other passengers who had arrived there in buses from Guwahati. “Twenty-four gold bars weighing 3.982kg were recovered from the duo,” he said.“Further inquiry revealed that all seized gold bars were smuggled into India from Myanmar. These were being taken to Delhi by road from Guwahati, via Siliguri and Patna. The gold bars were found concealed in the handles of stroller bags, inside inner wears and in specially modified waist belts,” Rai said.He said the arrested men were using the road route, probably believing that the checking would be less stringent on highways as compared to airports.DRI and other agencies have started cracking down on gold smuggling after a similar racket came to fore in Kerala on July 5. The customs had seized an air consignment bound for the UAE consulate at Thiruvananthapuram and found 30 kilos of gold, valued at ₹15 crore. The smuggling of gold using diplomatic channels triggered a political firestorm in the state with the opposition accusing the state government of abetting the racket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/six-held-for-smuggling-in-14-kilos-of-gold-valued-at-7-crore-from-myanmar/story-jzV49sd0D086WuKMowLFsM.html

This is how it began. Initially there were calls from coaching centres and some fake companies but after a few days I started getting many objectionable and lewd messages that were not acceptable at all,” says Rashi Sahu, a Delhi University student who is one of the many girls who is facing a tough time since the incident of a massive data breach of students’ details has been reported. The struggles for Sahu, and many others like her began when DU reportedly issued students admit cards for exams on its website. Soon phones of students, specifically girls started ringing, and unknown numbers raised eyebrows. “I shared this concern with my friends who told me that this is not only happening to me but there are many other students who are facing the same issue. We eventually realised that these lewd calls and messages were a result of data theft from DU’s website,” adds Sahu. Some students say they have been receiving threat calls as well. “People call and say either you talk to us or we may do something that will ruin your future. These calls are all from unknown numbers. I also got many WhatsApp messages and e-mails that were explicit in content. I feel so unsafe. Who should I go to?” asks Diksha Yadav, another DU student. Recently, some girl students, who had opted for online exams, took to social media to complaint about their harassed state due to non-stop calls and messages from unknown numbers. Elucidating on how this all began, Arun Hooda, a student of LLM at Faculty of Law, says, “When I tried to log in, to access my admit card, I noticed that it’s very easy for me to access the admit card of any other student by just changing a few numbers on the URL. Even the gateway password that we got for downloading our admit card was quite easy to guess, as it was a combination of certain college codes, and the year of admission along with other generic details. In the previous years, the printed admit cards that we used to receive never had students’ phone numbers. However, that’s not the case with the online admit cards issued this time, and we are can’t even think about the repercussions this can have if confidential data gets exposed to those who thrive on cyber crimes!” “In this case, students can file a police complaint as the leakage of data is a breach to their privacy and sensitive information disclosure,” says Mukesh Choudhary, cyber crime consultant with Jaipur Police, adding, “If the website is managed by a private body, the victim can ask for a compensation of upto ₹5 crore as per section 43A of IT (A) Act 2008. But, it’s not applicable if government body is involved in its complete management. Timely Security audit for the website and servers of government departments are necessary to maintain privacy and security averting such threats.”Hooda, who escalated his concern to the DU authorities, after seeing a possibility of a larger breach due to unlocking of admit cards online, adds, “Through unlocking the admit cards, anyone can also access the original admission form that a student would have filled at the time of his or her admission, which contains details such as Aadhaar card, bank account number, address, etc.” Akshay Lakra, an LLB student at the Campus Law Centre, escalated his concern through social media, and tells us that “As soon as I voiced my concern on social media, many female students approached me confirming that they were receiving calls and obscene messages from unknown numbers. When we linked the course of events, that’s when we understood that this was happening due to the online admit cards. DU then issued a unique key password to all students. However, that has also been breached in no time!”Hooda and Lakra had then filed a police complaint regarding the issue. “We resolved to take this up legally,” says Lakra, adding, “We have tried to reach out to both, DU authorities and Delhi Police to explain how students are distressed over the matter to highlight the risks and problems involved. But, when just the online uploading of admit cards has led to theft of students’ personal details, then how do we expect that DU is capable to conduct online exams without any hiccups?” Though students have filed a police complaint regarding this issue, but continue to remain stressed about the situation. Karan Goel, ACP, Cyber Crime, Gurugram, says that in cases such as these, “Victim should come out in open, and not be embarrassed about it. It can happen to anybody. Dialogue is very important with parents and law-enforcement agencies. Data theft cases are generally through unverified or lesser-known websites or domains available on internet. While visiting any domain, double-check if you’re on the right page. Don’t lackadaisically do any web surfing, like in this case they submitted data.” Adding to this, Harleen Kaur, a Delhi-based psychologist, suggests, “If you are confused about what’s happening, reach out to someone. Report anonymously if you like, but act on that gut feeling which is making you uncomfortable... It’s important to report as well as talk about it so that the youngsters who are at an impressionable age don’t feel helpless.” If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.

The matter has now been adjourned for arguments on July 22.In October 2017, sub-inspector (SI) Mohan Singh was arrested for accepting Rs 2 lakh in bribe, allegedly on the directions of the then Sector 31 SHO, Jaswinder Kaur.Prem Singh Bisht, the complainant, had alleged that the SI, who was the investigating officer in an attempt to murder case, demanded Rs 9 lakh to drop the names of three of his employees from the FIR.Bisht had alleged that the SI had told him that the Rs 8 lakh were for SHO Jaswinder Kaur and Rs 1 lakh for him. The CBI had arrested the SI while accepting Rs 2 lakh bribe, but the case was closed against Kaur as the agency could not find any evidence to implicate her.However, in the CBI court, the complainant had said that he was taken to SHO Kaur by the SI at Old Car Bazaar in Hallomajra, where a meeting had taken place and SHO had demanded money.In 2019, Bisht had moved an application to declare Kaur an accused in the case, followed by another application in February 2020, where he stated he was being pressured by the SHO.Taking cognizance of the applications, the court had directed CBI to place before the sanctioning authority (SSP, Chandigarh) all evidence, so that the authority could apply its own mind whether to give sanction for prosecution or not.On July 15, citing a Supreme Court judgment, Bisht moved another application in the CBI court, stating that five months had passed, but the sanctioning authority had not decided upon grant of sanction for prosecution against Kaur. On this, the court had issued a notice to the investigating agency and sought its reply on the application, besides seeking a reply from the UT DIG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sanction-to-prosecute-sho-jaswinder-kaur-under-consideration-dig-to-cbi-court/story-3yD7sZzDKvqNIF2LulFlCK.html

A bench led by justice D Y Chandrachud said the court did not want to interfere in the issue which has to be solely dealt with by the local administration.However, the J&K high court on Wednesday asked SASB to “urgently take all decisions regarding the Yatra in view of the pandemic. However, the court hasn’t set any deadline for the government to take the decision.A senior official on condition of anonymity said, “SASB never said the pilgrimage shall begin from July 21. They were speculations only. There were certain directions by the Supreme Court and J&K high court. On the basis of court directions, the local administration has been asked to decide over the same.”“Now, we have asked for the report from the administration about the pilgrimage feasibility and their response is still awaited. Thereafter, the SASB will hold a meeting and take a final call in the matter,” he informed.He, however, said the basic arrangements of track clearance from shorter Baltal track have been done and the morning and evening aarti was being telecast live by Prasar Bharti.Sources in the SASB admitted that given the circumstances uncertainty looms over the pilgrimage.Meanwhile, CRPF has started securing Yatri Niwas base camp on the banks of Tawi river in Jammu. The paramilitary force has started setting up check posts on the Tawi bridge leading to Bhagwati Nagar. “At least six check-posts are being set up by the CRPF. Similar posts are also being established at the Yatri Niwas base camp from where the pilgrims leave for the yatra,” said a CRPF officer.Sources in administration had told HT on July 7 that J&K chief secretary BVR Subrahmanyam had decided that 1,000 pilgrims on helicopters and 500 on foot shall be allowed each day during the curtailed pilgrimage that is likely to be held from July 21 to August 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amarnath-shrine-board-awaits-admn-s-final-response-on-annual-pilgrimage/story-pMmfjwfSa7DIPqowPQkuhP.html

We fear that Singh and his son, legislator Pawan Singh, may be killed in an encounter. Mamata Ji the fallout will be serious if it happens,” tweeted Vijayvargiya.Senior officers of Barrackpore police district refused to comment on the visit of the police team but state food minister and district Trinamool Congress (TMC) president Jyotipriyo Mullick alleged that it was in connection with a bank scam.“The raid was in connection with a scam at a local cooperative bank. The culture of encounter is nurtured in Uttar Pradesh. West Bengal does not believe in encounter killings. Arjun Singh is saying all this for media coverage. He is looking for publicity,” said Mullick.“I am ready to die to free West Bengal from the misrule of TMC,” said the BJP leader.Arjun Singh, a former four-time TMC legislator from Bhatpara and former chairman of the local civic body, joined the BJP ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and defeated TMC’s two-time MP Dinesh Trivedi from Barrackpore. Singh’s son is the legislator from Bhatpara.There have been several political clashes in different parts of the constituency, including Bhatpara, during and after the Lok Sabha election. In the most recent incident, Dharmendra Singh, a local TMC leader in the Kankinara industrial area was shot in the head by two motorcycle-borne men on Wednesday morning. The incident triggered tension in the area.

The SIT was able to nab some fruit merchants and around ₹8 crore were recovered from them and paid to orchardists, but due to the nationwide lockdown, the process had met with a halt, but now the SIT has sped it up again.Himachal fruit vegetable and flowers association president Harish Chauhan said hundreds of orchardists have been cheated by fruit merchants as they had not paid them their dues, the amount of which is estimated to be more than ₹100 crore. This has been going on for the last seven to eight years, but after state government’s action, several orchardists were able to get their money back, Chauhan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-fruit-merchants-get-cid-over-non-payment-to-growers/story-dqigtOfcuAhPFMko0gv52O.html

17-07-2020||Chandigarh||Mattewara industrial park : Sekhowal villagers, panchayat oppose land acquisition||Slamming the state government’s decision to establish an industrial park over 1,000 acres in Mattewara, the villagers and panchayat of Sekhowal village said they will hold an agitation if 407 acres of panchayat land in the village is acquired for the project.Accusing the administration and government of cheating them, the villagers said around 60 families were dependent on the chunk of cultivable land that is proposed to be used for the project.Levelling serious accusations at administrative officials, sarpanch Amrik Kaur said, “The authorities got my approval on documents around two months ago saying that ‘parks’ will be established on around 200-acre land. The authorities never told us that the whole 407 acres of land would be acquired and industrial parks will be established on the same. I would have never given the nod if I knew that panchayat land would be taken over by the government for building an industrial park. Apart from destroying the lives of villagers, who earn their bread and butter by working in these fields, the state government will also damage the Mattewara forest, which is situated near the village. We will not let the government acquire the panchayat land and will raise an agitation, if needed.”‘SARPANCH WAS MISLEAD’Former sarpanch Dhir Singh said,”The current sarpanch is illiterate and could not understand the conspiracy. The panchayat of the village got possession of the land around five years ago after we won the case in the Supreme Court. The land was earlier being used as a potato seed farm. We will never hand over the land to the government and the government should also not play with the lives of villagers.”LIP, AAP EXTEND SUPPORT The Lok Insaf Party (LIP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) have also extended their support to villagers. They said that they will also join the protest. While LIP president and MLA Simarjet Singh Bains visited the village on Thursday, AAP MLA and deputy leader of opposition in legislative assembly Sarvjit Kaur Manuke met the villagers on Friday. Residents of the city have also started a campaign on social media networks to stop the government from ‘destroying’ the Mattewara forest.SDM (east) Baljinder Singh Dhillon said,”I have joined the office recently and I am not aware of the episode, which took place before my joining. I will look into the grievances of the villagers.”The state government has proposed to establish the industrial park on government and panchayat land of Haidar Nagar, Sekhowal, Salempur, Sailkiana and Machian Kalan villages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mattewara-industrial-park-sekhowal-villagers-panchayat-oppose-land-acquisition/story-FY3ikwbO6nkQG50P9JgMgN.html
17-07-2020||City||Infighting in HP Congress: Disciplinary panel to decide fate of dozen leaders||Amid turmoil within the Himachal Pradesh Congress, party state chief Kuldeep Rathore has called an emergency meeting of the party’s disciplinary committee to decide the fate of erring leaders who are up in arms against the state leadership.The rift in the party widened after a group led by former state Congress president Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu stepped up its activities. All India Congress Committee had appointed 56-year-old Rathore as the president last year, replacing Sukhu ahead of the Lok Sabha (LS) elections after the party’s stalwart and former chief minister Virbhadra Singh demanded his (Sukhu’s) removal. Rathore is close to Congress deputy leader in Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma. The former CM also supported Rathore’s appointment.The state disciplinary committee headed by Solan legislator Dhani Ram Shandil will meet on July 22.Differences between Sukhu and Virbhadra resurfaced after the party’s worst-ever performance in LS elections in the state. The BJP won each of the four seats with a record margin of over 3.25 lakh votes.Both Virbhadra and Sukhu blamed each other for the defeat, while a large section of sitting legislators and party nominees, who unsuccessfully contested to state assembly, held Rathore’s poor management and ineptness responsible for the party’s debacle. However, AICC’s in-charge for Himachal affairs Rajani Ashok Patil openly supported Rathore ignoring the dissent of the rival group.Recently, the leaders owing allegiance to Sukhu, including six-time legislator Harshwardhan Chauna, former parliamentary secretaries Rohit Thakur and Sohan Lal Thakur, former urban development minister Sudhir Sharma and Palampur legislator Ashish Butail, got together to chalk out their future strategy. They opined that it was difficult for the party to contest elections under the present set-up and called for appointing former health minister Kaul Singh Thakur as the party chief.A section of leaders from Mandi district had also raised a banner of revolt against Rathore. In a letter shot to the party’s central high command, they alleged that senior leaders were sidelined when Rathore had reshuffled the party, among other complaints.Following this, Congress issued a show-cause notice to all the 12 signatories which included former minister Mansa Ram, former chief parliamentary secretaries Lal Singh Kaushal, Jiwan Thakur, Sohan Lal Thakur, Champa Thakur, Jagdish Bedi and Mansa Ram, former minister Vijay Pal Singh, former HPCC spokesperson Jagdish Bedi. On the other hand, former CM Virbhadra Singh had also hosted a lunch, possibly in a show of strength for Rathore, on July 12, for which several leaders turned up at his residence, including MLAs Mohan Lal Brakta, Pawan Kajal, Rajender Rana, Sunder Singh Takur, Mukesh Agnihotri and Kasumpti legislator Anirudh Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/infighting-in-hp-congress-disciplinary-panel-to-decide-fate-of-dozen-leaders/story-FQRLdw6Ntexlf1w9IznzFL.html

Earlier too, on July 13, the eve of the lockdown, Yediyurappa had said the government did not plan to extend it in Bengaluru urban and rural districts, and had appealed to the people to cooperate by not paying heed to rumours.However, earlier today city Mayor M Goutham Kumar and commissioner of the civic body Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike B H Anil Kumar had favoured its extension.They had said that in their personal opinion, a 15 day lockdown would be good, as that much time is required to break the chain. The Opposition Congress too had asked for a minimum of 15 days lockdown after taking expert opinion. “Respected Chief Minister, you have imposed lockdown in Bengaluru, but it is difficult to expect results from this lockdown, which has been imposed just for for the sake of it. Take expert opinion and enforce strict lockdown in Bengaluru at least for 15 days. If not, even if God comes,it will be difficult to protect Bengaluru,” KPCC Working President Eshwar Khandre tweeted.Speaking to reporters after attending the meeting chaired by the CM, revenue minister R Ashoka said lockdown will not be extended and all activities can resume as usual from July 22.“Lockdown will not be extended. I’m saying this after discussing with the Chief Minister. There is no such thinking before the government.CM has got report from the experts, it was discussed in the meeting.By lockdown we can only postpone things, we have taken that breathing time.If we continue lockdown it will keep on continuing,” he said. The minister said the process of sealing places, wherever required, would continue. He said the plan to conduct more tests was discussed at the meeting and all the required zone wise arrangements would be made “We also discussed about beds and shortage of ventilators and steps will be taken to arrange for them,” he said. As of July 16 evening, cumulatively 51,422 Covid-19 positive cases have been confirmed in the state, which includes 1,032 deaths and 19,729 discharges. Bengaluru urban district tops the list of positive cases, with a total of 25,288 infections.Out of 4,169 fresh cases reported on Thursday, a whopping 2,344 were from Bengaluru urban alone At the meeting, the Chief Minister said all necessary steps should be taken to clear all the difficulties faced by infected patients in getting admitted to hospitals. The CMO statement quoted Yediyurappa as directing Ministers to hold meetings with private hospitals to ensure that Covid and non-Covid patients get treatment. Warning of strict action against private hospitals if they don’t allocate beds for COVID patients,he said volunteers and nodal officers would be appointed to gather information about admission of such patients and availability of beds The Chief Minister said rapid antigen tests should be conducted on those dying at hospitals or homes and necessary action taken to hand over the bodies or to conduct last rites as per the procedures, depending on the cause of death. Recruitment was on to appoint doctors to resolve shortage, he said,adding that volunteers have been identified in each ward for micromanagement and ambulances allocated. Marriage halls and lodges have been selected in all wards for those not having separate quarantine facilities, Yediyurappa said and stressed on increasing testing. Deploying extra police force at places where there are chances of people gathering in large numbers, ensuring beds availability and ambulances within two hours of a patient testing positive- with decentralized monitoring, giving priority to those symptomatic above 65-years during allocation of beds were among directions given by the Chief Minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/lockdown-not-the-solution-to-control-covid-19-no-proposal-to-extend-it-in-bengaluru-yediyurappa/story-faTMVaab3JiP3imaDVVatK.html

Industry sources said around 60,000-tonne honey is lying in cold stores across the country as export of mustard honey was hit due to the covid-19. Bee-keepers are seeking the formation of a dedicated policy for honey to support bee-keepers in marketing mustard honey in the domestic market and other high-value honey by-products like pollens, bee venom, royal jelly and beeswax.The honey has huge demand in the west and is also called ‘cream honey’, being dreamed from mustard flower nectar President of Progressive Bee Keepers Association Narpinder Dhaliwal said Punjab farmers have a stock of 15,000 tonne of mustard honey but it has no Indian market. “An integrated honey policy is needed as bees play a crucial role in the pollination of agricultural and horticultural crops. The myth needs to be broken that crystallised mustard honey is adulterated. Since honey is also known for immunity booster properties, stockpile can be marketed in the country with the assistance of government agencies to improve the economy of bee-keepers,” said Dhaliwal.With an annual estimated production of 18,000 tonnes, Punjab is the third-largest producer of honey. According to National Bee Board data, Punjab has 2.7 lakh bee colonies.Beekeepers say liquid honey or one the one that is derived from nectar of all other flowers and does not crystalise, is consumed in India.Shahzada Singh Kapoor of Ludhiana-based Kashmir Apiaries, one of the country’s largest honey exporters, says since overseas shipments are uncertain, the government should step in to help small and marginal bee-keepers in marketing their produce. “Contrary to the per capita honey consumption in the West of 700-grams, Indian consumption is just 60-gram. Indian bakery and sweet confectionary should be incentivised to replace sugar with a healthier option of honey,” he said.Kapoor, a second generation honey export entrepreneur, said India has about 35 lakh box-bee colonies against the potential to harvest 12 crore such units, adding that byproducts of honey were also good opportunities.“If mentored, bee-keeping can become a more profit-making venture. Bee pollen has an immense scope in the health supplement sector, where venom can be sold to the pharmaceutical sector,” he added.A progressive bee-keeper from Bathinda’s Tungwali village Gurcharan Mann said the state government should buy the entire stock of honey for marketing by Markfed at its mega honey packaging unit in Jalandhar.“To reduce financial burden on bee-keepers, the state should provide sugar to feed bees in the ongoing off-season. Markfed should purchase honey kept at cold stores and this cab be lifted, as and when needed for for marketing,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bee-keepers-seek-govt-support-to-sell-export-grade-honey-in-domestic-mkt/story-mtoDOPtBR0iAl8vNayFzDP.html

The SGPC had also urged Akal Takht to hand over the probe to a retired judge or independent Sikh personality.Acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh announced the name of the retired woman Sikh judge. He said Ishar Singh, a lawyer at the Telangana high court, will assist her in the probe.“On July 12, the SGPC executive committee passed a resolution, urging Akal Takht to get the matter probed at its own level. So, the probe has been assigned to Navita Singh. If the need arises, the services of account experts, former and incumbent employees and officials of the SGPC will be provided to investigators who have been asked to give their report within a month. Akal Takht will take action accordingly,” the acting jathedar said.MAY 2016 FIRE SPARKED OFF CASEFourteen saroops of Guru Granth Sahib were damaged in a fire at the SGPC publishing house at Gurdwara Ramsar Sahib in May 2016, according to the committee but the Punjab Human Rights Organisation (PHRO) claimed after five years that the damage was done at a mass scale and that this fact was hidden to save the then SAD-BJP government from public wrath as the Bargari sacrilege incident was already a burning issue and the assembly elections were close.On the basis of the statement of a retired employee of the SGPC, the PHRO said that 267 saroops went missing after the fire and a probe must be conducted to ascertain their whereabouts.COMMON DIGITAL PLATFORMFOR PANTHIC UNITYGiani Harpreet Singh said a common digital platform will be introduced for Panthic unity in the light of the ideology of Guru Granth Sahib and to defeat divisive forces. “The step has been taken in view that some elements are trying to divide the Panth. Announcement of this platform will be made after discussing the matter at a meeting of the Panj Singh Sahiban (five Sikh clergymen),” he said.Besides, the jathedar appealed to Sikh youngsters to adopt constructive thinking and focus on academics to achieve greater heights in economic, social and political fields.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/retired-high-court-judge-navita-singh-to-probe-case-of-267-missing-saroops-of-guru-granth-sahib/story-CpBMmpigZcpfbARdhA0MaJ.html
17-07-2020||City||With 2,345 Covid-19 cases, Srinagar among worst-hit cities in north India||With 2,345 Covid-19 cases, Srinagar is among the worst-hit cities in north India. The J&K administration claims that all is well but has issued gag orders to doctors and health department officials asking them not to speak to the media.Fifty-seven fatalities, including 54 locals from Srinagar, show the city is emerging as a Covid-hotspot. For the last four days after a surge in cases, fresh restrictions were imposed in the city. Markets are now closed and red zones have again been sealed.On Thursday, 259 people were found positive in Srinagar alone, a day before the surge there were 153 cases. The spike has left people worried and doctors have already started flagging the issue of shortage of Covid-19 beds in the hospitals within the city. “The administration got four months to prepare amid the lockdown and now we are being told there is a shortage of beds. If tomorrow, 1,000 cases will are reported, is the government prepared to tackle the exigency? Do we have sufficient high-flow oxygen beds available in the hospitals?’’ asked Adil Ahmad, who lives on the outskirts of the city at Shalteng.Huma Bhatt, a young entrepreneur and poet, said people should stay indoors as cases are rising. “Not wearing masks, gloves or taking precautions can be suicidal.”‘PEOPLE NOT FOLLOWING GUIDELINES’J&K art, cultural and language academy former secretary Rafiq Masoodi said there has been a dangerous increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in Kashmir, especially in Srinagar city. “The government can’t police people everywhere. I am a senior citizen and I don’t go out but once a month when I go to get groceries, I can only spot three or four people wearing masks,’’ he said. “When government knows that people are not adhering to norms then why are they opening parks, gardens and tourist places?” he asked. “There have been instances where people have posted pictures from the Dal Lake to demonstrate how social distancing is being ignored,” he said, alleging that people were not being screened properly at the airport. Former Srinagar Municipal Corporation mayor Junaid Azim Mattu said the government needs to adopt a comprehensive, multi-pronged approach to deal with rising Covid-19 cases in Srinagar.“There is no other way to get a grip on the situation. SMC, the health department and the district administration need to work at close quarters and do so consistently,’’ he tweeted.Mattu said the designation of containment zones is one measure and not a strategy in itself. “Allied measures need to be taken. Hospitals, large public offices, bank branches and markets are the most vulnerable hotspots and need our focused attention on a daily basis. Multiple cases at JK Bank HQ is a case we need to study and draw quick lessons from.’’DC SAYS TALLY INCLUDES PEOPLE FROM OTHER DISTRICTSSrinagar deputy commissioner Shahid Choudhary said most cases that are added to Srinagar’s tally don’t actually belong to the district. “Yesterday’s 259 cases include 120 security forces and 68 people from other districts. During instances where 151 to 119 cases were reported in a single day cases, only 20% cases were from the Srinagar.’’Contrary to the DC’ s claims, Srinagar has been among the worst affected districts since the Covid-19 outbreak. It now has 946 more positive cases than Baramulla district that has 1,399 positive cases. Of these cases, 327 were travelers who came from different parts of the country or foreign countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-2-345-covid-19-cases-srinagar-among-worst-hit-cities-in-north-india/story-HrCtLhG9HOkxiujZtD0kaM.html

It feels important that the relationship between the role of a human rights lawyer and that of a poet is made explicit.”“I am looking forward to working with both staff and the diverse student community in terms of building conversations together about the role of the imagination and empathy, and how poetry in particular offers an aberrant alternative in language,” she added.The three-year post will see Arshi take part in events with students from both English and law subjects, as well as contributing to the university’s programme of public engagements.Fiona Beveridge, executive pro-vice-chancellor, said: “We are tremendously excited by this appointment.

Pilot has 18 Congress MLAs and three Independents supporting him.“In view of the tapes released in a section of media, Shri Bhanwar Lal Sharma (MLA, Sardarshahar) and Shri Vishvendra Singh (MLA, Deeg Kumher) have been suspended from the Congress Party with immediate effect for anti-party activities,” the Congress said in a press release.“Show-cause notice has been issued to them to explain their conduct in the conspiracy to topple the Congress Government in Rajasthan,” it said.The party in a release after Surjewala’s press conference talked about two “sensational and shocking” audio tapes which it said surfaced through the media. “These audiotapes have allegedly revealed the conversation between Union cabinet minister Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Congress MLA Shri Bhanwar Lal Sharma and BJP leader Shri Sanjay Jain,” the release said.The intention and conspiracy to topple the Congress government in Rajasthan by offering money and trying to change the loyalty of its MLAs are clear through this so-called negotiation. This is the dark chapter in the history of democracy,” it said.Pilot and the 18 legislators supporting had on Thursday approached Rajasthan High Court’s Jaipur bench to seek the cancellation of the disqualification notice served on them by assembly speaker CP Joshi.They have insisted that the anti-defection law could not be invoked against them for disagreeing outside the House with some government decisions and policies.The petition will be heard on Friday by a two-member division bench of the high court at 1pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/congress-suspends-sachin-pilot-camp-s-bhanwar-lal-sharma-vishvendra-singh-from-party-over-leaked-audio-tapes/story-FOIzXYDTUGn3dUQoljnHWM.html

17-07-2020||Jaipur||Cong demands FIR against Union minister Gajendra Shekhawat, accuses him of conspiring to topple Gehlot govt||The Congress on Friday upped the ante against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), accusing the ruling party of hatching a conspiracy to topple the Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan.It also demanded an FIR to be registered against Union minister Gajendra Shekhawat, who the party said was involved in horse trading of Rajasthan MLAs.Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala held a press conference on Friday in which he said that two audio recordings have surfaced in which Congress MLA Bhanwarlal Sharma, Union minister Shekhawat and a BJP leader Sanjay Jain are purportedly talking about the “conspiracy” to topple the government. Surjewala also read out a transcript of the purported conversation, alleging money was offered to party leaders to switch sides.He demanded an FIR against the three and their arrest. Surjewala also said that chief whip Mahesh Joshi has given a complaint to the Special Operation Group for registration of FIR in the matter. He also accused Sharma of being in touch with Sachin Pilot.Sharma, meanwhile, denied the allegations. He called the audio tapes as fabricated, and accused chief minister Ashok Gehlot of doing this.However, Surjewala said that Sharma has been suspended from the primary membership of Congress pending inquiry on these tapes.He also said that another Congress MLA and former minister Vishvendra Singh has also been suspended from the primary membership of the party.Surjewala then pointed fingers at the BJP’s central leadership and claimed that the conspiracy was planned at the behest of the big leaders.Rajasthan has been witnessing a political turmoil since Gehlot claimed at a press conference last week that attempts were made to topple his government, and pointed fingers at Pilot. Miffed, the former deputy chief minister left the state with his supporters who later claimed that the Gehlot government is in minority.But the Congress stood with Gehlot and removed Pilot from the post of Rajasthan Congress chief. The chief minister also dropped him from the state cabinet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/cong-demands-fir-against-union-minister-gajendra-shekhawat-accuses-him-of-conspiring-to-topple-gehlot-govt/story-B4wU9LkFEB5ifAaSgdMKTP.html

17-07-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Our lady of Khan Market||Even during the best times of the pre-Covid era, Khan Market was a bleak place in early mornings. There would be no crowd, and only a few cafes would be open for an early-hour breakfast.The market is looking bleak this morning, too. Doubly more so because the cafes that used to be open by this hour are still locked. In any case, the coronavirus pandemic forbids table service in restaurants. At least two cafes have already shut down permanently because of their inability to pay high rents to Khan Market landlords.The only human sighting on the market’s middle lane is of a showroom security guard changing his blue long-sleeved shirt into a casual T-shirt—his night shift must be ending.There’s actually another figure further ahead, down the lane: A masked woman in red top and shorts. She is strolling slowly, carefully looking at closed shops and cafes on either sides. The woman could easily pass off as Ms Marple, the famous mystery sleuth of Agatha Christie mysteries, probably on a lookout for clues to solve some Khan Market crime.But Joban is no literary character. Even so, she is an equally rare specie—one of the very few persons on Earth who call Khan Market a home. Delhi’s most upscale shopping destination began as a low key bazaar with shops on the ground floors and residences on the upper floors, allocated to Partition refugees. Over the years, most of those flats owners sold away their homes or raised them on rent as commercial outlets. What were houses turned overnight into expensive restaurants and fashion houses. Only 7 homes out of 74 survive. Joban’s is one of them.The lady ambles up to the end of the middle lane and turns towards her door. She gestures up at the lush pink bougainvillea creepers falling down the front of the building, saying, “My mother, Harbans, planted it many many years ago, as a twig, with no roots.”Joban is 76 and divides her time between Khan Market and Scarsdale in New York. A single person, her two children live with their families in Europe. Her father, Avtar Singh Dugal, a doctor, migrated from hometown Lahore after the Partition.“We were given the flat in Khan Market in 1952.” Eventually, the doctor settled into a cosy life in this central Delhi locality with his home upstairs and the clinic directly below. He died in 1984. What used to be the clinic was leased out to a business.Joban confesses that it’s the first time in 50 years “that I have spent the summer in Delhi.” She arrived in February for her annual trip and had her return ticket to the US booked for March-end when coronavirus hit worldwide and disrupted her travel itinerary. The pandemic is also obliging her tenants to finally call it quits.This has given Joban a new opportunity. She has no intentions to rent out the property to the highest bidder, but has other ambitions. “I want to turn this place into a light house for each person navigating to their authentic self to find safe harbour.” Inspired by the ideals of economist Sardar Tarlok Singh, the first private secretary to prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Joban plans to create a space that will “help the youth of India become the architect of the modern world.”Gazing up again at the bougainvillaeas, she hopes that her ambitious initiative will take birth sooner than later and “grow organically with time,” just like “mummy’s plant.” Later in the evening, Joban is spotted again walking in Khan Market. This time she is dressed more formally, as she steps inside a long-time shop run by a fellow Khan Market dweller.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-our-lady-of-khan-market/story-AScp9Chwnf9oNTnRaxOcRN.html

He said that though a political party tried to give the incident a religious colour, the investigation cleared the air. “The charge sheet filed by CID clearly states that the killings of the two sadhus and their driver by a mob were triggered by the rumours. There was no religious angle to it,” Deshmukh said.The home minister informed that the CID registered statements of 808 people and arrested 154 accused and that the further course of action will be decided by the court. On April 16, two sadhus and their driver were dragged out of their vehicle outside Gadhchinchale village, located about 110 kilometres from Palghar, and beaten to death by a mob.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-religious-angle-to-palghar-lynching-case-charge-sheet-says-maharashtra-home-minister/story-jpubnOW1cmRu8PN9LbeDJK.html
17-07-2020||City||Maharashtra sees fewer deaths during childbirth||Maharashtra’s efforts to minimise maternal deaths during childbirth seems to be working as the state has the least number of maternal deaths in the country after Kerala. MMR is defined as the number of deaths during child birth or pregnancy per 100,000 live births in a period. The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of Maharashtra is 46 as per the Maternal Mortality in India 2016-18 report, conducted by the Office of Registrar General through sample registration system and released on Thursday. Kerala has the lowest MMR at 43 in the country.The state has recorded constant improvement in MMR in the last few years. In 2015-17, MMR in Maharashtra was 55, while in 2014-16, it was 61 and 68 in 2013-15, said health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas. Maharashtra has met the objective of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), which aims to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births.“The state has taken up special programmes to keep pregnant women and infants healthy. We have started 248 first referral units [FRU] which are being used for normal deliveries as well as for C-sections. FRUs are health facilities that are identified at the tertiary level, where all emergency and essential services are available in rural areas of the state,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.Tamil Nadu has the third least deaths at 60, followed by Telangana (63), Andhra Pradesh (56), Jharkhand (71) and Gujarat (75), the report stated.Assam recorded the highest MMR as it has 215 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. The other states with highest maternal mortality ratio are Uttar Pradesh (197), Madhya Pradesh (183) and Rajasthan (164). Apart from conducting population census and monitoring the implementation of registration of births and deaths in the country, the Office of the Registrar General, India, gives out estimates on fertility and mortality rates using the Sample Registration System (SRS). SRS is the largest demographic sample survey in the country, which among other indicators, provides direct estimates of maternal mortality through a nationally representative sample.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-sees-fewer-deaths-during-childbirth/story-XrWN7MASy7xc640S3A8uuL.html
17-07-2020||City||Nephew’s wife held for 70-year-old’s murder in Mumbai||Four days after the murder of a 70-year-old woman in Chembur, Tilak Nagar police arrested her nephew’s wife on Thursday. The police said the accused, identified as 32-year-old Anjana Patil, hit her husband’s aunt Sajanabai Patil on her head with a bat and then strangled her to death. She then dragged the Sajanabai’s body to the bathroom and ransacked the house to make the murder look like a part of a robbery attempt, said a police officer. Anjana, her husband Dinesh and Sajanabai used to stay on the first floor of Nav Bharat Cooperative Society. Dinesh is employed at a petroleum firm, while Anjana is a homemaker. Her parents also stay in the same building.According to the police, the two women used to quarrel frequently over trivial issues. Recently, Anjana took some cash which Sajanabai withdrew the post office, without informing the latter. Sajanabai suspected that Anjana took the money and confronted her over the issue.“On Monday, there was a heated argument between the two women when the victim questioned the accused about the money the issue. In fit of rage, the accused picked up a bat lying in the house and hit the victim on her head repeatedly. She later strangled her with a rope,” said deputy commissioner of police Datta Nalawade, in-charge of Zone 6. She then dragged the victim’s body to the bathroom and cleaned blood stains from the floor as well from the senior citizen’s clothes. “The accused then hid her own blood-stained gown and ransacked the house and scattered clothes from the wardrobe in the room so that it would seem that the victim was murdered by robbers,” added Nalawade. Anjana then left the door open and went to her parents home who live in the same building. Around 4pm, when the accused’s sister in-law went to her house, she found Sajanabai lying in a pool of blood and alerted the other relatives in the building and the police. The victim’s body was taken to Rajawadi Hospital, where she was declared dead. The doctors at the hospital found multiple injuries on the victim’s head as well as strangulation marks around her neck, following which the police filed a case of murder against unidentified people and questioned all the relatives and neighbours. The police learnt from the neighbours that the two women would often have arguments and that Anjana was in the house at the time of the murder. There were also discrepancies in Anjana’s statement, who claimed that the woman fell in the bathroom and died, said the police. After repeated interrogations, Anjana confessed to the crime, following which she was arrested for murder and destruction of evidence, said Nalawade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nephew-s-wife-held-for-70-year-old-s-murder-in-mumbai/story-rJEjd4UbihJvSj0Kn7fgSL.html
17-07-2020||City||Maharashtra Class 12 results: 49 colleges manage perfect score||A total of 49 colleges from the Mumbai division, which also includes Thane, Raigad and Palghar, recorded 100% result in higher secondary certificate (HSC) exams this year, as per data shared by the state board on Thursday. With this, the number of colleges with perfect results dipped 30%, compared to 70 in 2019. Most colleges that achieved the feat are small junior colleges, mainly located in Thane and Navi Mumbai. Snigdha Roy, principal, Fr Agnel Multipurpose School and Junior College, Vashi, which featured in the list, said, “We ensure continuous mentoring for two years. Each child is monitored and given guidance. Every time the child undergoes a test, the weak areas are analysed and a format to study is prepared. However, we do this with the consent of the student and as per their convenience. We also have a counsellor who has built a rapport with the students and ensures they are involved in both academics as well as extra-curricular activities. This helps build a balance for the students and keeps them energetic too.”Saraswati Vidyalaya High School and Junior College has two campuses – Rabodi and Ghodbunder Road, Thane. Both the institutes have managed cent percent results, “A student’s good result is the outcome of team work, support from teachers, parents’ motivation and the hard work of the student. We explain this to parents and ensure that students who need special attention are given coaching. The study leave and vacations are utilised by teachers to guide students. We ensure that they are motivated at all times,” said Meera Korde, chairperson, Saraswati Vidyalaya High School and Junior college.Some prominent colleges, however, missed the 100% mark by a few points. “We have a 99.73% result this year. Of the five students who failed, two were absent and one was a cheating case,” said Rajpal Hande, principal, Mithibai College, Vile Parle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-class-12-results-49-colleges-manage-perfect-score/story-YcdYIigH7PTK0q8utyLM3K.html
17-07-2020||City||Maharashtra Class 12 results out: UG admissions begin today||With the higher secondary certificate (HSC) results out on Thursday, the online registration process for undergraduate degree courses in colleges affiliated to the University of Mumbai (MU), except autonomous colleges, will start on Friday.A link for the process will be available on mum.digitaluniversity.ac. The schedule for the admissions process, however, will be released later, said university officials.For the first time this year, MU will not only conduct the pre-admission registration process online, but also manage document verification and fee payment process digitally.“Keeping in mind the current Covid-19 situation in the state and city, it would be unfair to ask students to physically visit colleges to confirm admissions. We are currently working on making this option available to students for their benefit,” said a spokesperson for the university.Until last year, students could finish the registrations online and individually approach colleges for admissions. This year, the process might witness changes, say MU officials. “This pre-admission registration process helps students opt for more than one college. The process has been explained well on the website, so students will have no trouble completing this step,” said the spokesperson.However, students aiming for professional courses, including engineering and medical, will have to wait longer for the next step. The National Testing Authority (NTA) recently pushed the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) and National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for engineering and medical aspirants to September. The schedule will be out after the exams.Re-evaluation, photocopy from FridayStudents can apply for re-evaluation of their scores between July 17 and July 27 and for photocopies between July 17 and August 5 on the board’s official website. Fees can be paid online. Students who wish to apply for revaluation have to first secure a photocopy for their papers and then apply for revaluation. Board teachers complete evaluation While HSC exams concluded before Covid-19 crisis and the resultant lockdown, officials at the board worked on war footing to ensure results are not further delayed.“Some papers had to be moderated and the computation of results had to be done. Somehow, all our staff from the board and our teachers supported us in this process,” said an official from the board. Signal school student scores 55% Eighteen-year-old Dashrath Pawar, who earlier cleared his Class 10 boards after attending classes at the Teen Hath Naka signal school in Thane, scored 55% in the arts stream from Dnyansadhna College in Thane in the HSC exam. Pawar’s parents sell flowers at signals for a living and he had dropped out of school in Class 9 to help his parents earn an income. Two years ago, Pawar joined the signal school, started by the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) along with a non-governmental organisation, Samarth Bharat Vyaspeeth, and cleared his Class 10 exams. He is currently undergoing training at the police academy in Dadoji Kondev Stadium, Thane. Pawar said at Dnyansadhna College, his teachers supported him and helped him understand the concepts well.“ I have worked very hard in the past two years. From 6am till noon, I would go for the police training and then attend classes till 6pm. After my college, I would visit the signal school for revision, till my parents returned home,” said Pawar who resides in Kalwa. “I want to join the police force to ensure that everyone is treated equally before the law as well as to ensure that law and order is maintained,” said Pawar.The school, which is inside a shipping container, was started to provide education to children who beg or sell goods at signals. It not only focusses on imparting education, but also teaches students to follow good health and hygiene practices as well as behaviour. This student defied cancer Anisha Anjalikal Joy, 20, who is undergoing treatment for bone cancer, scored 86% in the science stream from Thane’s Dnyansadhna College. Only two months before the board exams, Joy underwent a surgery, but it did not deter the Ambernath resident from appearing for her exams.After she was diagnosed with cancer three years ago, Joy was forced to take a break from studies owing to as she had to undergo medical several procedures. She scored 95 marks in biology and wants to pursue a career in science or information technology.“I was diagnosed with bone cancer on my left thigh after I finished my Class 11 exams in 2017. I underwent a series of chemotherapies and several surgeries and took a break from studies for two consecutive academic years. There were frequent hospital visits and treatments lined up but my family’s support helped me tide through the situation. My college staff also ensured that a seat is reserved for me. Despite finding it difficult to move, I used to attend classes with the help of a walker,” said Joy.Joy has been a bright student and scored 81% in her Class 11 exams.“I will always be grateful to the staff of Dnyansadhna College for their immense support,” she added.Student gives exam on computerScoring 90.3% in Class 12 HSC boards is no mean feat, for 18-year old Bhavya Shah, the achievement is even sweeter. Born with 100% visual impairment, Shah was allowed to appear for the exams on a computer this year by the state board.“In Class 10, I appeared for board exams with a scribe as well as with a computer, depending on the subjects. This year, the board permitted me to appear for all the papers without a scribe,” said Bhavya, who wrote his exams with a screen reader software that helped him type the answers.While scoring well in his boards was his aim until now, the next big step for the teenager is pursuing his undergraduate degree in the United States.“I was accepted by Harvard as well as Stanford universities but I chose the latter and will soon join soon. I’m yet to pick a major but I’ll choose a variety of subjects and will eventually figure out my major,” he said.In 2018, the board had allowed a student to write his exam on a computer as he had an issue with the sweat gland. In 2019, a girl was allowed to write her paper with the help of an iPad.Blind student scores 91%Born with 100% visual impairment, Sarvesh Nayak, a student of Ruia College relied on his Braille study materials, ever since he started writing. He also made sure he cleared all his doubts in the class without hesitating. And the results showed. Sarvesh scored an impressive 91% in his HSC exams, with 95 marks in sociology, 94 in political science and 93 in economics.“I had worked very hard throughout the year and always studied very systematically. This is a good score and I am really happy,” said the Thane resident.Sarvesh is now aspiring to make a career in law. “I want to be recognised as one of the best lawyers in the city,” he added. Twin athletes cross the 91% markSeventeen-year-old twins Mahika and Tisha Pahuja, who study at Jai Hind College, are state-level athletes. While Mahika scored 94.92% in HSC exams, Tisha secured 91.8%. “We’ve always studied together, and help each other solve problems whenever we get stuck at something. While the college helped us immensely, knowing that we have each other’s backs gives us more confidence,” said Mahika.Apart from athletics, the two sisters also play basketball. “The combination of sports and studies helps keep our mind free of stress, which helped us do well in the boards,” said Tisha.Pushing the boundariesEighteen-year-old Ayush Shah suffers from muscular dystrophy but that does not deter this gritty teenager from pursuing his dreams. A student of Mulund’s VG Vaze College, Shah scored 66.1% in his HSC exam in the science stream.“I used to study every day and revise whatever was taught in class. Because of my condition, I couldn’t study for more than two-three hours at a stretch, so I used to take breaks in between,” said Shah, who plans to pursue an undergraduate degree in BSc IT.“I’ve had tremendous support from my college as well as parents, and that helps me do better every time during exams,” he added.

17-07-2020||City||Congress upset over advertisement||Congress registered its resentment over an advertisement, for the job portal, issued by the state industries department for not carrying photos of any party leader. The advertisement about the newly launched MahaJobs portal featured leaders from the party’s ruling allies Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Expressing disappointment over the issue, Congress parliamentarian Rajeev Satav tweeted, “The scheme is good, but one should remember that this is a coalition government. I hope the government will rectify its mistake while issuing advertisements in the future.”Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat later said that he received a call from industries minister and Shiv Sena leader Subhash Desai to clear air over the issue. “He [Desai] assured us that the mistake will be rectified in the future. We are drawing curtains on it now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-upset-over-advertisement/story-DJYILJb2tFMcipwPuPqv8M.html

The duo arrived at the bank posing as customers and later held the bank employees hostage. According to Koparkhairane police, the accused, suspected to be in their early thirties, arrived at the bank, located in Sector 19, on a black motorbike, around 2.20pm. The faces were covered and they were wearing gloves.The police procured the CCTV footage from the bank and are trying to identify the accused. In the footage, one of the accused is seen holding a firearm.“The men deliberately chose to target the bank around lunch time, as it closes operations for customers after lunch time. The accused pretended to inquire about loans and waited inside after customers left. Once there were fewer people inside, one of the accused pulled out a gun and held the employees hostage. There was also a scuffle between some of the employees and the accused,” said an officer from Koparkhairane police station.Some employees sustained minor injuries in the scuffle. The accused filled the money in their rucksacks and fled on the two-wheeler. The police said they have intensified checking at all entry and exit points towards Thane and Mumbai to nab the accused. Police suspect that the accused may have conducted a recce of the bank before committing the robbery.

The need of the hour was to address the shortage of field staff in the department to curb the declining ground water level, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mann-slams-punjab-govt-over-abolition-of-posts-in-water-resources-dept/story-l3CVjHX9t4ezBqM91XeJUJ.html

This was decided in a meeting of the association that was attended by representatives from Ambala, Yamunanagar and Panchkula on Thursday. The members condemned the three farm ordinances passed by the Modi government by stating that “the ordinances will make grain markets in Haryana and Punjab like those in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar.”Addressing the mediapersons, State President of Arhtiyas Association, Ashok Gupta said, “Under the new ordinance, the farmers can sell their produce to any buyer armed with just a PAN card but those selling in the markets must have GST details, market licence, among other documents. If this act comes into force, the market system will break and the farmers will be forced to sell their produce outside. The government wants to break the farmer-arhtiya chain and also nullify the Essential Commodity Act that will promote privatisation and ultimately inflation.” Duni Chand, Patron of Haryana State Arhtiyas Association said, “The commission agents will support the farmers in their protest on Monday against the new farm ordinances which if comes into force, will make the grain markets in Haryana and Punjab like those in UP or Bihar. The government also wants to repeal the Minimum Support Price system.” Bharti Kisan Union president Gurnam Singh Charuni thanked the commission agents for extending their support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/centre-s-ordinances-haryana-arhtiyas-body-extends-support-to-farmers-protest/story-enN62Iqt0i5EviQ4FRG3DL.html
17-07-2020||City||Sand mining on Yamuna banks: NGT takes notice, forms joint committee||Following the complaints of rampant and large-scale sand mining on Yamuna banks, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has issued directions to the Haryana government and formed a joint committee under the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Hearing the complaint filed by Yamunanagar-based farmer Kiran Pal Rana, the bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel ruled that the joint committee comprising CPCB, Haryana state pollution control board and Yamunanagar district magistrate with regard to the area in Haryana should furnish a factual and action-taken report within three months, while scheduling the next hearing on January 6, 2021.The bench also ruled that the applicant may serve a set of papers to CPCB, Haryana pollution control board and Yamunanagar district magistrate within two weeks and file affidavit of service via email. In his complaint, the farmer alleged that in the lack of action by the authorities concerned, illegal mechanised in-stream riverbed mining was taking place on the banks of Yamuna river in Gumthala’s north and south blocks in Yamunanagar and near Nangla Rai village of Kairana block in Uttar Pradesh’s Shamli. He claimed that the mining mafia carried out the illegal mining activities during the lockdown, which is also a violation of guidelines issued under the Environment (Protection) Act as well as the sustainable sand mining guidelines issued by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change.“The illegal mining activities have changed the course of the river as the miners have created embankments to stop the flow besides building illegal bridges on the river,” he added. The complainant also mentioned a CAG report based on geospatial studies in June last year with critical findings regarding the illegal sand mining in Yamunanagar and resultant loss of revenue to the government. “In the last two years, six children have died by falling in deep mining pits in Yamunanagar, Panipat and Shamli. The miners have illegally excavated about 50 acres in Tajewala village and sold material worth around ₹155 crore, causing revenue loss of around ₹21 crore to the exchequer,” the complainant said. “Though the local administration has taken cognisance of the issue and ordered an inquiry, there is no information on what disciplinary actions have been taken against the violators involved,” he added.Reacting to the NGT orders, Haryana state pollution control board member secretary S Narayanan said, “Directions in this regard have been issued and the state pollution control board will comply with the orders of the green tribunal.”In his response over the allegations, Yamunanagar deputy commissioner Mukul Kumar said, “Action is being taken as per the law and we will ensure compliance with the NGT orders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sand-mining-on-yamuna-banks-ngt-takes-notice-forms-joint-committee/story-B61gaBR0SRLlTfd25acUzM.html
17-07-2020||City||Metro-4: Bombay HC allows MMRDA to build piers in mangrove zone||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday allowed the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) to construct piers of an approach road and spur line to Mogharpada depot, Thane, on the Metro-4 corridor within the mangrove buffer zone.The bench of justice RD Dhanuka and justice VG Bisht granted permission for work in the mangroves buffer zone primarily in view of the fact that the construction is for the larger public interest.The bench , however, directed MMRDA to scrupulously comply with the conditions imposed by state environment impact assessment authority while granting coastal regulation zone (CRZ) clearance for the work on November 28 last year.MMRDA moved HC, through advocate Akshay Shinde, seeking the court’s permission for the work in the mangrove buffer zone along Ghodbunder Road in Thane, as the court in November 2018 held that no mangroves shall be removed or no construction shall take place within the 50-metre buffer zone around mangroves without the prior permission of the court.Metro Line 4 will Wadala to Kasarwadvli on Ghodbunder Road in Thane. The 32.32-km entirely elevated corridor will have 32 stations along the line that runs parallel to eastern express highway, covering Ghatkopar and Mulund.According to MMRDA’s petition, the proposed car depot at Mogharpada forms an integral part of the project, which the authority plans to utilise for routine repairs as well as the major overhaul of coaches and repair, replacement and testing of heavy equipment.MMRDA added that the car depot, spread over 36.50 hectares, is proposed to be constructed at 200 metres of the existing road, and 16 piers of the approach road and four piers of the spur line fall in CRZ area. None of the piers nor the spur line, however, affect mangroves, the petition added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/metro-4-bombay-hc-allows-mmrda-to-build-piers-in-mangrove-zone/story-THHskFI5QYnPOLyQLwrXxI.html

The bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice RI Chagla held that MSRTC’s move to discontinue services of the drivers was in breach of provisions of the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 and the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.Services of all 14 drivers were discontinued between April and June 2018 after their colour blindness was confirmed by experts from Sir JJ Hospital, Mumbai. MSRTC had also rejected their representations for reinstatement, following which the drivers moved the high court.HC upheld their claim and said, “Petitioners have admittedly acquired their disability viz colour blindness during the course of their employment,” said the bench. “As a result, the petitioners are now entitled to alternative jobs as reasonable accommodation under section 20 of the 2016 Act,” it added.The bench said section 20(4) of the Disabilities Act, 2016 mandate that the petitioners ought to be shifted to an alternative post within MSRTC with the same pay scale and service benefits and if it is not possible for MSRTC to adjust the petitioners in any post immediately, they have to be kept on supernumerary posts until suitable posts become available.It has now directed MSRTC to reinstate all the 14 drivers in service on posts suitable to their present condition, within four weeks. The bench has also directed the state transport body to pay full back wages to the drivers as their services were terminated in breach of their statutory rights, and it would be “wholly inequitable and unjust” to deny them full back wages.The bench also struck down clause 11 of the July 2016 circular issued by MSRTC, which treated intervening period between medical examination of drivers and a decision thereon, as leave without pay. HC said it was contrary to the provisions of the 2016 Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/reinstate-14-drivers-terminated-on-grounds-of-colour-blindness-hc-to-msrtc/story-F308K8iDpFUdzrY7j9bqCO.html
17-07-2020||Mumbai||‘Dharavi model apt for dense urban areas’: Kiran Dighavkar||What is the Dharavi model, which will be replicated in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) to curb the rising number of cases?The Dharavi model is most apt for locations where social distancing and home quarantining of patients and high-risk contacts is not possible, mostly slums. Aspects of this model can be used in dense urban areas with high cases, such as organising fever camps, early detection, quarantining suspected Covid cases and institutional quarantine of a large number of high-risk contacts.WHO or ICMR direct contact-tracing on a massive scale. But in Dharavi, contact-tracing is difficult because 5,000 people are using one toilet block. The only thing in our control is proactive work. We are chasing the virus, as opposed to people identifying they are unwell, doing a test and coming to us. We arrange a large number of fever camps, screen residents, identify suspected Covid-19 cases and shift them to institutional quarantine facilities. When we aim to conduct maximum fever camps and tests, we will identify more cases and high-risk contacts and will need more institutional quarantine facilities. We acquired schools, colleges, installed beds and doctors monitored the facilities 24x7, supplied free medicines and gave free meals.How will you be involved in helping municipal commissioners of the MMR to implement the Dharavi model?I presented the Dharavi model before the municipal commissioners of MMR when I accompanied Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray, on his request. The main point is augmenting capacity at institutional facilities, and ensuring they have good amenities. When a person is agreeing to leave his home and stay at a quarantine facility, it is our job to ensure he is comfortable. The more high-risk contacts you remove from the community, the faster the spread of infection stops.Public-private partnership and community participation are crucial. The Dharavi model is about community support too. The support government received from private doctors, hospitals, NGOs, volunteers and elected representatives was excellent.What is the present situation in Dharavi?Our active cases are a two-digit number, hardly 97, and 2,070 people have been discharged. There are 2,415 cumulative positive cases. Doubling rate of Dharavi is 345 days. The infection growth rate is 0.4%.Dharavi’s mortality is high with over 200 Covid deaths at least? In G-North ward, including Dadar, Mahim, and Dharavi, there were 72 deaths in April, 167 deaths in May, 33 deaths in June, and two deaths in July. We are using early detection, hospitalisation and treatment. Beyond this, mortality figures are not in the ward officer’s hand once the patient goes to a hospital. A death is reported by the hospital to the epidemiology cell, which verifies it and then confirms it as a Covid death. As the unlock process starts in Dharavi, what is the most challenging aspect? The situation is very dynamic. Labourers who had left Dharavi in March and April are returning after seeing relief in the area. Many factories have started. There are many house helps and sanitary workers, who work across the city, staying in Dharavi. There is a possibility cases will surge again, or they may not. My only worry is this success should not go in our heads, and we should not assume we have tackled the virus for good, and no more cases should show. We will keep screening and testing. We are working on behavioural change of residents for cleanliness and sanitary habits, especially while using community toilets. I also want to create a permanent Covid health care infrastructure in Dharavi, like we built a 200-bed hospital in front of Maharashtra Nature Park, with oxygen supply beds in a record 15 days in April. This will be converted into a permanent structure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dharavi-model-apt-for-dense-urban-areas/story-0cMveeKubMy4B0q862DF6M.html
17-07-2020||City||Rise in MMR cases cause for Covid concern||The spread of Covid-19 in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) has emerged a major cause for concern, with the number of cases crossing 62,000 in Thane district.On Thursday, Kalyan-Dombivli recorded 524 cases and nine deaths, taking its count to 14,598 and toll to 225. The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) recorded 413 cases and 13 deaths on Thursday, pushing the total to 14,832 cases and 523 deaths. With 6,208 active cases, Kalyan-Dombivli is leading in the district, followed by 6,028 in Thane. These are cases recorded by the civic bodies. The health department tally is different owing to reconciliation.The corporations now plan to implement the Dharavi model.The cases began to rise steadily since June, when the Mission Begin Again started. Thane city started to see a rise of 300-400 cases, while Kalyan-Dombivli saw a drastic increase in the past fortnight. Navi Mumbai, too, crossed 10,546 cases on Thursday. An official from the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) said, “On Thursday, we saw 273 new cases and four deaths, taking the total to 10,546 cases and 322 deaths. The recovery rate in Navi Mumbai is better than the neighbouring city – 6,520 people have recovered, with the recovery rate of 62%. The active cases are now at 3,704.”After Kalyan, NMMC on Thursday started rapid antigen testing at its dedicated Covid hospital in Vashi. Antigen testing centres are also set up at NMMC hospitals at Nerul and Airoli.Abhijit Bangar, the newly appointed civic chief, said, “Antigen tests will primarily be conducted for free on high-risk contacts. I have ordered that the testing centres be set up at the 23 urban health posts of NMMC.”The civic body has 40,000 antigen test kits and will procure 60,000 more such kits. Bangar said they have also asked the government for one lakh kits.Along with the three major cities, Ulhasnagar city is also seeing a spike. It has recorded 5,046 positive cases and 74 deaths, with the active cases at 1,999. The city recorded 202 cases on Thursday.Bhiwandi, on the other hand, saw a dip since July, recording 63 cases on Thursday. Its total stands at 2,967. In June, Bhiwandi saw more than 100 cases a day. However, the Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC) recorded the highest number of deaths (14) on Thursday. The city has 168 deaths till now. “Most of the deaths are reconciliation figures, received from those taking treatment outside the city,” said Pankaj Ashiya, commissioner, BNCMC.Ambernath, which stated implementing the Dharavi model of Chase the Virus, from Thursday, has the least number of active cases (415). Ambernath recorded 41 new cases on Thursday, taking the total to 2,870 and deaths to 111. Badlapur city saw 90 more cases, taking the total to 1,703. Meanwhile, in the Thane rural area, the zilla parishad has asked villages that do not have a single case in 28 days to hoist a green flag in the gram panchayat. Moreover, all those who have come in contact with a positive person should be mandatorily checked. Thane rural has 1,972 active patients, with the toll at 99. Hiralal Sonawane, CEO, Thane zilla parishad, said, “At least 15 people who have come in contact with a positive person should be tested and isolated. A plan has been set in motion for what should be done each day after a patient gets admitted. This includes tracing contacts, testing and isolating them, providing treatment to the patients and so on. All of this should be implemented mandatorily and a daily report should be submitted to the district health officer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rise-in-mmr-cases-cause-for-covid-concern/story-8ipp6puPLyP49sySWcId8M.html
17-07-2020||Mumbai||Time to ‘chase the virus’ in MMR||The city’s model of ‘chasing the virus’ to contain the outbreak of Covid-19, which was used successfully in the densely populated area of Dharavi, and parts of Worli, Govandi, Bandra East, or Byculla, will also be replicated in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), considering the surge in cases.When Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray visited Thane and Kalyan earlier this week to take stock of the situation, he was accompanied by Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G-North ward with jurisdiction over Dharavi, to help cities in MMR replicate the model.Aaditya Thackeray told Hindustan Times on Tuesday, “Yes. [the Dharavi model will be used in MMR.] Essentially the Dharavi or Worli model, or the Bandra East or Govandi, or E ward model is that BMC has aggressively chased the virus.”According to Thackeray, when aspects of life will begin to open up in cities adjoining Mumbai, it will be important to have medical buffer beds, control mortality, and analyse data to predict what could happen.Kiran Dighavkar said, “The Dharavi model is about organising a large number of fever camps for early detection of suspected cases, quarantining them in institutional facilities, tracing the maximum number of high-risk contacts and moving them to quarantine facilities too. We are testing a lot. We are not waiting for a patient to fall sick, get a test done, and then come to us. We are chasing suspected patients. It requires large-scale infrastructure for institutional quarantine facilities and manpower for screening and testing.” The state is planning to create 40,000 to 50,000 Covid hospital beds for all cities in the MMR, and is also planning to construct jumbo facilities. Thackeray said, “We have set models in terms of chasing the virus, testing people, and also quarantine facilities. All municipal commissioners have been told that first they need to have standard operating procedures in place. I want to ensure there is strict division of work, and coordination among all teams.” As of Thursday, Navi Mumbai has recorded 10,546 total cases and 322 deaths with a doubling rate of 22 days, Kalyan has recorded a total of 14,598 cases and 225 deaths with a doubling rate of 14 days, and Thane has recorded a total of 14,832 cases and 523 deaths, with a doubling rate of 23 days.The rising number of cases is also a worry for Mumbai’s Covid-19 curve, as the city is gradually coming out of lockdown. Mumbai’s municipal commissioner IS Chahal said on Tuesday that the city will completely open up, and local trains, malls and gymnasiums will become operational only when the situation in MMR shows the same improvement as Mumbai.Sanjay Pattiwar, public health consultant, said, “Large scale testing, institutional quarantine, community participation, involvement of private practitioners is a pattern known to everyone, replicating it will not be a problem. But it requires a large number of resources that need to be made available quickly. I would suggest the government should decentralise quarantine centres, and make small local quarantine centres catering to people living in a two kilometre radius or so. These will be easier to manage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/time-to-chase-the-virus-in-mmr/story-un54XzemWLqGMrUoreXWJK.html

17-07-2020||Mumbai||HC relief for long-term convicts to avail emergency parole||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday held that a person convicted and sentenced for more than seven years, who did not avail parole or furlough twice or more before the Covid outbreak, can still be released on emergency parole. Two persons convicted for crimes under section 302 (punishment for murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and lodged at Kolhapur Prison approached the HC after their application for emergency parole was rejected by the superintendent of the prison. The superintendent had held that as the emergency parole rule framed by the High Power Committee (HPC) stipulated that the applicant should have availed of parole or furlough twice and as the two convicts did not fulfill the criteria, the application was rejected. The HC, however, observed that the order was absurd, and directed the superintendent to reconsider the applications afresh.A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Milind Jadhav, while hearing a plea by Milind Patil and Nishant Mane challenging the emergency parole rule laid down by HPC, was informed by senior advocate Satish Talekar that following a directive by the Supreme Court (SC) on March 23, the HPC had framed emergency bail and parole rules. The rules were for all those undertrials and convicts whose sentence was less than seven years. The rules were amended on May 8 to include convicts with sentences of more than seven years. The amended emergency parole rule stated that applications of such convicts would be based on two conditions – that a convict should have availed parole or furlough twice or more and returned on time prior to the emergency rules came into force; and that he should not be a habitual offender.Talekar submitted that as his clients had availed of furlough only once, their application for emergency parole was rejected, though two other convicts who were serving similar sentences were permitted. Talekar argued that the amended rule was absurd and would defeat the purpose of decongesting jails and hence section 19 (C) (ii) of the Maharashtra Prisons (Mumbai Furlough and Parole) Rules, 1959, inserted by Maharashtra Prisons (Mumbai Furlough and Parole) (Amendment) Rule, 2020, should be declared ultra-vires of Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India.The two convicts along with three others had been arrested in 2013 and sentenced to life imprisonment. All five were lodged at Kolhapur Central Prison since their arrest and were serving their sentences after being convicted. Following the Covid outbreak, four of them applied for furlough/parole. While two were granted furlough/parole, Patil and Mane’s application was rejected as they did not conform with the amended emergency furlough/parole rules.After hearing the submissions, the bench observed that as two other convicts had been granted emergency parole, Patil and Mane should also get the benefit of the same, and quashed the rejection order of the superintendent. HC directed the superintendent to decide the applications for emergency parole in two weeks and disposed of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-relief-for-long-term-convicts-to-avail-emergency-parole/story-rtKddkWhlZIBuvwkYvKgUK.html
17-07-2020||City||623 primary, middle schools shut down in Haryana since 2011, reveals RTI reply||As many as 623 primary and middle government schools have been shut down in Haryana since October 2011 due to poor enrolment.The information was provided by the Haryana school education department in response to an RTI (right to information) query filed by Rewari-based social activist Saket Dhingra. As per the department, there are 8,687 government primary schools and 2,383 middle schools functional across the state.“The government has closed 623 schools since October 2011. 124 schools were shut down in 2011, 385 in 2014, 62 in 2018 and 52 in 2019,” the report said. Dhingra said the closure of 623 government schools since 2011 due to poor enrolment has raised questions on the implementation of the government schemes and programmes to encourage students to join government schools.“If students are turning away from state-run schools, then why is the government spending crores on mid-day meal schemes, free uniforms, free textbooks and other projects?” he questioned.As per the RTI report, the Haryana government has built only 12 new schools — six in Rohtak, two in Sonepat, one each in Palwal, Hisar, Yamunanagar and Kaithal — since 2011. Haryana elementary education department director Pardeep Dagar admits the closure of over 600 government primary and middle schools due to poor enrolment. “Pupil strength in these schools had dropped below 10 and their students were accommodated in other schools. The government has built fewer schools due to low demand, but we have upgraded many schools over the past few years. The students who were shifted are not facing any problem due to closure of their previous schools,” the director said.Haryana Vidyalaya Adhyapak Sangh secretary Satbir Goyat said the government schoolchildren were shifting to private schools due to better infrastructure and facilities, resulting in poor enrolment leading to closure of government schools. “The government schools have performed better in Delhi and Chandigarh due to better infrastructure. In these two union territories, the enrolment and results have improved due to better government policies which lack in Haryana,” he added. Many parents prefer private schools due to English-medium curriculum and other facilities. “In private schools, every subject has a particular teacher. Whereas in the government primary schools, all subjects are taught by a single teacher, or at times two,” said a parent. The government should recruit new tech-savvy teachers, provide better infrastructure and facilities like smart classes and computer labs in state-run schools, parents demand. Blaming lack of government policies for the closure of schools, former Haryana education minister Geeta Bhukkal said, “Students have been opting for private schools over the past few years due to shortage of teachers, poor infrastructure and lack of government’s vision. Due to Covid crisis, over 8 lakh migrant labourers went back to their native villages. Now, more schools will face closure as their children studied in those schools.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/623-primary-middle-schools-shut-down-in-haryana-since-2011-reveals-rti-reply/story-LHJCJI7NoJQjSljgQIGk8O.html

17-07-2020||Mumbai||Don’t follow celebrities’ Twitter accounts blindly: Cyber police||In view of the recent spate of cyberattack wherein Twitter accounts of eminent personalities including Barack Obama, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Warren Buffet were hacked, Maharashtra Cyber police on Thursday issued an advisory urging Twitter users not to blindly follow accounts, including those of prominent celebrities.Cyber police said accounts of several prominent personalities were hacked and used to post cryptocurrency scam messages and phishing links. Many users have fallen prey to the scams. Maharashtra cyber police, the nodal anti-cybercrime law enforcement agency in the state, believe it is possible that hackers could try to gain access to prominent Indian Twitter users in a similar fashion. “In times of pandemic, any such hacking incident can also cause widespread rumours leading to chaos. Citizens should be alert and not blindly trust any tweet,” said Yashasvi Yadav, special inspector general of police (Cyber), Maharashtra. Twitter support has found that these interruptions were the result of social engineering attack. They have revealed that accounts of some employees, who have access to internal tools of the microblogging site, were compromised which led to the hackers gaining control of the prominent twitter handles.After the attack, Maharashtra Cyber police have intensified their vigilance as there is possibility of such incident happening in the Indian cyberspace since several Indian public personalities use twitter frequently.To prevent users from falling prey to the scam, the police advised Twitter users not to blindly trust content posted on social media platforms and take time to determine if the content is authentic or fake.Police urged users not to spread or further circulate any posts that seem like fake news or rumours as well as posts promoting hate speech and violence.“We have also asked other social media platforms to be on the lookout for similar incident, and inform the police in case of a cybersecurity breach,” a senior officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/don-t-follow-celebrities-twitter-accounts-blindly-cyber-police/story-TUnO75rWncxoemPpVxfWRJ.html
17-07-2020||Chandigarh||Locust swarms likely to hit Haryana again next week||The Haryana government has decided to buy three drones as a part of the massive exercise that is underway to stock additional quantities of pesticide ahead of the locust swarms’ yet another and by far more destructive attack after July 22. The locust warning organisation has warned of more high-intensity attacks in Nuh, Rewari, Mahendergarh, Bhiwani, and Charkhi Dadri districts after July 22. The warning was issued after large-scale locust breeding was observed in Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan.These attacks are likely to be more severe than the previous ones across 13,038 acres in Jhajjar, Charkhi Dadri, Palwal, Sirsa, Nuh, Rewari, Bhiwani and Narnaul. According to additional chief secretary, ACS, agriculture, Sanjeev Kaushal, arrangements were being made to stock additional quantities of pesticide Lambda cyhalothrin 5 EC.“The state government has stepped up its efforts to control the menace and prevent losses due to crop damage in view of warning regarding potential intense attacks in several districts after July 22,” he added.The locust swarms in the region, Kaushal said, had become resistant to the commonly used pesticide chlorpyrifos. To prevent homogeneity in use of pesticides during repeated spraying, arrangements are being made to stock 20,000 litres of Lambda cyhalothrin in addition to existing stocks. He said the state government will also acquire fogging machines being bought by the Centre from the United Kingdom (UK) for usage on trees. The state government has pressed into action 66 fire tenders besides 3,540 tractor-mounted spray pumps. Kaushal said the preparatory measures put in place had prevented significant losses in most districts during these attacks.“We are closely monitoring the situation,” he said, urging the farmers in the affected districts to stay alert and inform the officials if they found locusts anywhere.Box: EXTENT OF DAMAGE CAUSEDWorst-hit Rewari and Sirsa districts suffered losses up to 30%In most of the districts, losses to the crop were 5%-10%No report of any loss in Jhajjar, Palwal and Nuh districts during the recent locust attackAbout 93% bajra and cotton crops were saved in Narnaul4,808 litre pesticide sprayed over 8,245 acres||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/locust-swarms-likely-to-hit-haryana-again-next-week/story-33QdGLvepGNuqLUyz1bNZN.html

He was satisfied with the preparations done by us to fight the legal battle,” said PWD minister Ashok Chavan, who is heading the cabinet sub-committee formed to review progress of legal matters for Maratha reservation. The government provided 16% reservation to Maratha community in government jobs and education by enacting SEBC Act. However, the Bombay high court while upholding the legislation in June last year had said the quantum of 16% reservation was not justifiable and the same should be reduced to 12%-13%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cm-reviews-preparations-for-maratha-reservation-case/story-rQTCMr7mbhGrJBaSezHobP.html

Satyanarayana, 72, was admitted to SevenHills Hospital a few days ago after she tested positive. The 1972 batch IAS officer was appointed as the first woman commissioner of SEC, after she retired from the civil services as additional chief secretary, revenue, in February 2009. She retired as commissioner in July 2014. Satyanarayana had penned more than 10 books of poetry and 17 novels. Her autobiographical work ‘One Full, One Half’, based on her experiences as the mother of a boy suffering from Down’s Syndrome, was widely appreciated in the literary world. Expressing his condolences, Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari said, “She was an outstanding officer, a prolific writer, a courageous mother, and social thinker. She discharged every role in her career and life with absolute dedication, positive attitude, and passion. In her demise, we have lost a dedicated officer and socially responsive thinker.” CM Uddhav Thackeray said, “Maharashtra will always remember her for her sensitivity which has left her imprint not only in the civil service but also in the field of literature and arts. She was a role model for many Marathi youths who aspired to take up a career in civil services.”SEC chief UPS Madan said that the use of information technology in the election process began during her tenure. “Introduction of NOTA, use of pen instead of ink, and projects like Krantijyoti, were launched by her,” he said.Three members of Satyanarayana’s family also tested positive and have been admitted to hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/former-state-chief-election-commissioner-neela-satyanarayan-succumbs-to-covid-19/story-ds9hj0D9im0YB0Wd3rhsqJ.html

17-07-2020||Mumbai||Only charter flights from UAE permitted to operate to India till July 26: Civil aviation ministry||The Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) on Wednesday summoned four United Arab Emirates (UAE) airlines – Air Arabia, FlyDubai, Emirates and Etihad – and directed them to stop operations of their commercial flights and permitted only charter flights from the country to fly to India till July 26. A ministry official said, “The airlines, along with UAE’s ambassador to India, were summoned by the aviation secretary on Wednesday and were asked to stop their unauthorised flights movements with immediate effect.”On July 9, the government decided to allow UAE and Indian carriers to operate only charter flights from UAE to India. However, according to ministry officials, since July 12, UAE carriers unilaterally started commercial operations to India, for which it planned schedules and sold tickets. The development comes after Air Arabia operated its commercial flights to Mumbai over the last weekend without seeking requisite permissions from the Maharashtra government. On Monday, HT reported that the state government issued a show-cause notice to the airline over the issue for violating rules and asked Air Arabia to respond by the next day.While rules permit only charter flights to operate, an airline must get traffic clearance from the respective destination states as well as the Indian embassy. MoCA said this rule was brought to ensure that flights landing in the country are legitimate charter flights commissioned by either a community or a corporate house.On Thursday, Valsa Nair, principal secretary of state aviation department, said, “Air Arabia has apologised, and said it will ensure that the violation won’t be committed again.”Taking cognisance of the matter, aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Wednesday asked air traffic control (ATC) across the country to allow UAE flights to land, provided the airlines submit documents showing approvals from the respective states to the controllers before their departure to the destination airport. Arun Kumar, director general of DCCA, said, “We have tightened the rules and things are falling in place now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/only-charter-flights-from-uae-permitted-to-operate-to-india-till-july-26-civil-aviation-ministry/story-R5OGeNb150uDfyzSDFnJIL.html

This is despite the fact that block has 75% of the district’s deaths (15 of total 21). The block also has one-third of the active cases (29 of 82) and 259 cases of the district’s 683 (38%) confirmed cases. Over the past 55 days from May 21 to July 14, the testing target was achieved only six times, even as 2,220 total samples have been taken from block in the last 55 days. For the district, 19,533 samples have been collected to date. Sources said 20-25 samples were being taken from Malerkotla town. Additional deputy commissioner (general) Rajesh Tripathi, who is heading the drive against coronavirus in the area, said that the teams of civil administration and health department are focusing on a mass movement to promote masks and the residents will be motivated to get themselves tested.“We will increase testing in the area but it will take some time. The administration has made various groups of over 100 people from different walks of life. We will focus on protection measures. From Friday, a movement to promote the use of masks will be launched,” added ADC Tripathi.Sangrur civil surgeon Dr GB Singh said he would hold a meeting on Friday. “We have contacted private mill owners whose workers are tested positive. Samples will be collected from every required area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/malerkotla-authorities-not-meeting-covid-19-test-target-of-80-a-day/story-Xq50yaYakrcLsscYzB7JMM.html
17-07-2020||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad accused Varavara Rao tests positive for Covid-19||Poet and activist Varavara Rao, who was lodged at Taloja Jail as an undertrial in connection with the Elgar Parishad case, tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday. Rao, 81, is asymptomatic but will be treated with symptomatic drugs. His family has alleged criminal negligence by state authorities.Dr Ranjit Mankeshwar, dean of Sir JJ Hospital, confirmed on Thursday that Rao was Covid-positive. “He is asymptomatic and stable. From Sir JJ Hospital, he will either be shifted to Gokuldas Tejpal (GT) hospital or St George’s Hospital. His oxygen saturation is above 95%. He will be treated with symptomatic drugs,” said Dr Mankeshwar.Rao’s family issued a statement on Thursday expressing concern regarding Rao’s treatment and alleged Rao had been kept in “pathetic condition” at Sir JJ Hospital, “having to lie in urine-soaked clothes for hours, and with very little nursing aid available at the hospital”.Refuting the family’s claims, Mankeshwar said, “These are fake allegations made against the hospital. I have taken all the required care of the patient.” For further comment, he told HT to speak to the hospital medical superintendent, Dr Sanjay Surase. Despite repeated attempts, Surase was unavailable for a comment.The family’s statement also said, “The Covid finding highlights the criminal negligence of the state jail authorities, who have been repeatedly warned about the danger of Covid in Taloja Jail, and the fragile condition of the Hyderabad-based poet-writer. It is a matter of concern too that the trial court handling the Bhima Koregaon/ Elgar Parishad case turned a deaf ear to pleas for medical bail seeing the poor health condition of VV Rao and the danger of Covid.” The statement said Rao’s fellow inmate and co-accused in the Elgar Parishad case, Vernon Gonsalves, was also at risk of contracting Covid-19 as Gonsalves had been caring for Rao in jail.Rao’s family expressed doubts about Rao being shifted to St George’s Hospital, which is a dedicated civic-run Covid hospital. “This is again bad news as St George’s, with its poor health care record, may hardly be the place where Rao has a chance to recover. The only way VV stands a good chance is if Bombay high court (HC), hearing the matter tomorrow, gives him medical bail, and is shifted to decent private speciality hospital,” read the statement.Rao had moved HC, appealing against an order of a special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court that rejected his interim bail application on June 26. The plea will be heard today.Rao is one of 11 people booked in the Elgar Parishad case, on charges of conspiring to organise an event in Pune that has been linked to the violence at Bhima-Koregaon on January 1, 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-accused-varavara-rao-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-pAwnLS0BjFdAhiSUQkYMiO.html
17-07-2020||Mumbai||Vidhan Bhavan staff protest compulsory 50% attendance; monsoon session likely to be curtailed to 2 days||Vidhan Bhavan employees are upset with a July 13 order making 50% attendance mandatory, despite 17 staffers, including four police personnel, testing positive for Covid-19.The monsoon session of the state legislature is likely to be held for only two days, with limited presence of legislators, from August 3. The legislature secretariat, through an order issued on Monday, made 50% attendance mandatory for its employees. Maharashtra legislature principal secretary Rajendra Bhagwat, “We have asked the employees to come to work every alternate day, to ensure their safety. The decision has been taken only because of the ensuing session.”The employees, however, have expressed their discontent over this new rule, considering the state government has mandated only 15% attendance in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.“When the state government has mandated 15% attendance, how can the legislature secretariat ask 50% employees to attend office? At least 17 of our employees [of the total 750] have tested positive, while one has succumbed to the virus. Our employees are not allowed to travel by local trains meant for essential service providers. Most of the employees have been working from home efficiently, and asking 50% to attend office will put their lives at risk,” said an office-bearer of the employees union at Vidhan Bhavan.The monsoon session of the state legislature is scheduled to be held from August 3, after it was postponed last month. The legislature has been tapping the possibility of holding the session online or having a blended approach of online and physical attendance. The state government is expected to curtail the session to two days, with limited attendance of legislators living in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. “Holding the session is inevitable to table and approve the supplementary demands to the state budget for the healthcare outlay required for the fight against the pandemic. The state legislature has written a letter to the parliament administration for guidance on holding the session. Though the mechanism is ready for an online session, many legislators and even a section of legislative office-bearers are against it. In such a case, we may curtail it to two days and allow only limited lawmakers to attend,” said an official from the parliamentary affairs department. “Another option is to postpone the session again. The decision is expected to be taken during a business advisory committee meeting to be held next week.” A two-week programme has been chalked out for the session, but it is part of the formality, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/vidhan-bhavan-staff-protest-compulsory-50-attendance-monsoon-session-likely-to-be-curtailed-to-2-days/story-xEIVMkXCE8IN1xFtb5p0WI.html

However, they were stopped near Chanakyapuri police station, he said. The protestors were shouting slogans against Pakistan’s spy agency ISI for promoting pro-Khalistan activities and supporting the ‘Khalistan Referendum 2020’, an online campaign to demand a separate homeland for the Sikhs.The ‘Referendum 2020’ is an initiative of pro-Khalistan group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), which has been banned by the Indian government for advocating a separate homeland for the Sikhs.The Centre in a July 10, 2019, notification had declared SFJ as an unlawful association and had banned it for five years, saying the group’s primary objective was to establish an “independent and sovereign country” in Punjab and it openly espouses the cause of Khalistan, challenging the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sikhs-protest-against-isi-for-backing-pro-khalistan-activities/story-nUyCP2APNDqtd56VmLBOAO.html
17-07-2020||Mumbai||BMC app to check Covid-19 bed availability yet to go live||A month after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) launched a mobile application that would allow citizens to check the availability of Covid-19 beds in private, state- and civic-run hospitals in real time, the application is yet go live. The software developer says the app is ready but BMC is yet to give access to its data from hospitals. According to BMC, the project is awaiting a final go-ahead from the civic commissioner.Last month on June 17, mayor of Mumbai Kishori Pednekar had launched an application named Air Venti, which was expected to go live within a week with data on bed availability at all private, government and BMC-run hospitals. BMC had said the app would initially provide information related to available beds in intensive care units and ventilators. Later, it would have information related to quarantine facilities in several Covid-19 care centres. Eventually, the app would also have information on beds available in hospitals for the treatment of non-Covid diseases like dengue and malaria. At a later stage, information about rainfall, waterlogging and other alerts would be sent to citizens via this app.However, the app is yet to go live.Shantanu Kulkarni, the software developer whose firm Probity Soft developed Air Venti, said, “We are ready with the application, and one can also download it from Google Play store. We have approached the Mumbai mayor to ask BMC to either link their dashboard data with the mobile application developed by us or ask hospitals to report the data to us.” He added, “We are told the mayor has also asked BMC’s administration to do the same, considering this application will be beneficial for citizens by helping them find beds easily.”According to senior BMC officials, the decision to make the data live on Air Venti is awaiting approval from BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal. A BMC official said, “Once we get the final go-ahead from the commissioner’s office, the data will go live.” Chahal was not available for comment.Mumbai-based activist Anil Galgali said, “I have written twice to the authorities that all details of bed availability, expenditure and available or proposed infrastructure should be made available online, but the same has not happened. In this case, we have a mobile application ready for citizens to use and get information, but details have not been uploaded. This is not transparency.”BMC has faced criticism for limiting citizens’ access to information regarding the availability of beds, which has made the process of finding beds in hospitals complicated for many patients. On June 10, BMC launched 24 helpline numbers from which citizens could get information on the availability of beds. Later, it was decided that information regarding bed availability would be put up online by connecting the civic body’s disaster management control room to a mobile application, which could be accessed by citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-app-to-check-covid-19-bed-availability-yet-to-go-live/story-B2NXzpKfF1kUdcV5TOeywJ.html
17-07-2020||Mumbai||Lockdown effect: Builders offer 8%-18% discounts to woo buyers||Builders across Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) are resorting to distress sales to woo homebuyers and raise money as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc with the realty sector.According to Knight Frank, a real estate consultancy firm, this is one of the toughest phases for the realty sector. “Builders need money for their projects and hence, are giving discounts in the range of 8%-18% to woo homebuyers. Since we see no solution in sight, we may even see more reductions in the coming days,” said Gulam Zia, executive director, Knight Frank India.MMR, which covers regions like Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai and Raigad, is regarded as a prime realty market in India. However, builders have hardly recorded any sales in the past couple of months.The situation can be gauged from the fact that realty sales from April to June this year declined to a low of 2,687 units, compared to 15,959 units sold in the January-March quarter.According to the Builders Association of India (BAI), builders are now being forced to make distress sales. “Builders are facing acute monetary crises as there are no sales taking place,” said Anand Gupta, committee member, BAI. “Even those who have booked their apartments are now cancelling their bookings due to job losses. This is impacting us in a big way. “We are left with no alternative but to cut prices to raise money,” he added.One of the biggest fears builders are facing is that once the loan moratorium ends in August, banks will line up for payments from September onwards. Also, financial constraints will delay projects, making the whole scheme unviable, leaving the builder saddled with huge losses.Rajesh Vardhan, managing director, Vardhman Group, blames the banks and financial institutions for the mess. “For years, these banks and financial institutions made a fortune from real estate, and now when we need their support, they are not forthcoming. All we demand is a restructuring of our loans,” said Vardhan.Despite the discounts, homebuyers are still not taking the bait. “It is a very insecure job environment and not the right time to take a risk,” said Rahul Rajan, a senior executive at a private firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lockdown-effect-builders-offer-8-18-discounts-to-woo-buyers/story-3zsw6OQy82ieEnoHQfjoUL.html

The results were based on data collected for 2016-18. The report adds that there were only five states, which failed to reduce maternal deaths and recorded increase in MMR, and Punjab stood on number three among these states.The MMR is the number of maternal deaths every 1 lakh live births. Maternal death is when a woman dies while she is pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy. As per the bulletin, the state has witnessed 5.7% worsening in MMR, while it saw an improvement of 7.3% nationally. The state has recorded a worsening of seven points from 122 maternal deaths in 2015-17 to 129 maternal deaths in 2016-18. The country’s MMR improved from 122 in 2015-17 to 113 in 2016-2018. Elaborating on the causes, Dr Daler Singh Multani, former Fazilka civil surgeon, said, “Most pregnant women suffer from anaemia, which leads to their death. The migratory population also affects the statistics of the state, as some health services do not reach them. Sometimes, they don’t approach health care services. Most women from particular sections of society also go to self-made god-men, rather then hospitals and clinics during their pregnancy period.”The last time Punjab saw an improvement in reducing maternal deaths, was in 2014-16, when it recorded an MMR of 122 from 141 in 2011-13. However after that, there has been no progress. In fact, Punjab is among those four states, which has recorded minimum improvement in 14 years. The Central report adds that Punjab has recorded an improvement of just 63 points from 192 maternal deaths during 2004-06 to 129 in 2016-18.Dr Avneet Kaur, director health and family welfare department, said, “The report was just released on Thursday. We do not know about the exact source of its information. We are verifying it with the Centre.”Bihar, UP and Haryana perform betterStates like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and neighbouring Haryana performed better than Punjab in reducing maternal deaths during the time period of the study. Bihar has recorded an improvement of seven points, Uttar Pradesh 19 and Haryana seven points in mother mortality ratio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-s-mother-mortality-ratio-declines-among-bottom-3-in-country/story-XCtgwjQRG0HUJ1g8z12huL.html

Samples of 30 contacts were collected on Thursday and sent for testing, it is learnt. District epidemiologist Dr Anita Chauhan said, “Most of the doctors contracted the virus through the contacts of a junior resident who had visited Jaipur in the first week of July. He was tested positive on July 9. There is a fear of more health workers having been exposed to the virus. We have advised the college administration to close the departments with cases of infection.”DIRECTORATE TEAM VISITS COLLEGEA team of the Punjab directorate of research and medical education on Thursday visited the medical college at Faridkot to check the preparedness to tackle the Covid-19 outbreak.Dr Bhatti said the college is getting samples from eight Punjab districts for Covid-19 testing. “Some change was made in the protocol for testing labs on July 1.

17-07-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Now, govt school teachers asked to receive, escort NRIs||Around 45 government school teachers from Ludhiana have a new assignment at hand to receive NRIs at the airports and escort them to the quarantine centre. The order came from the nodal officer for Covid-19, additional chief administrator, Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA) Bhupinder Singh, on Wednesday.It all began on July 3 when 25 teachers were deputed on the same duty. The teachers have to maintain the record of the NRIs and brief them about the government guidelines that they will spend seven days in quarantine at a Covid-care centre and next seven days in home quarantine if there are no symptoms of the virus. President of Democratic Teachers’ Front Hardev Singh said, “Teachers are busy with bi-monthly assessment of online tests. Schools are closed but teachers are conducting online classes and have to check the answer sheets online. We are ready to perform any emergency duty but this assignment is unnecessary. The authorities must revoke this order with immediate effect.”Reacting to the move, former Punjab education minister Daljit Singh Cheema tweeted: “After distillery and checking of sand mafia, a new order for government school teachers which states that it is the responsibility of the government schoolteacher to receive the NRIs at airport and take them to the quarantine centre. Stay safe master ji (sic.).”Despite repeated attempts, GLADA additional chief administrator Bhupinder Singh couldn’t be reached for a comment.In May, government teachers in Gurdaspur district were deputed at distilleries to keep an eye on the supply in a bid to check liquor smuggling. The order was withdrawn after the authorities faced flak from different quarters. Last month, teachers in Phagwara were asked to accompany police teams to check sand mining during the night hours. That order, too, was withdrawn as there was a hue and cry. However, teachers deputed on July 3 to receive NRIs are already on the job. Baldev Singh, an ETT, said, “For the last 10 days, I am doing this. I am on my way to Mohali airport as a flight from Kuwait is reaching there.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-now-govt-school-teachers-asked-to-receive-escort-nris/story-V6OPupil4QAizzp0WBRHpM.html

As per the plan of the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), e-auctioning to disassemble the power generation facility will be held on August 20 and bids for the same can be uploaded on July 20.PSPCL controller (store and disposal) Mohinder Singh Khosla said , the state government has decided to keep the towers intact since the structures had enormous heritage value. “The state government has directed to dismantle the plant that was decommissioned over two years ago. Civil structures, including chimneys and machinery used in power generation besides cables and pipes will be disposed of,” said Khosla. The government is planning to set up a mega industrial zone at the site of the thermal plant.Opposition parties like the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) besides employees of state power department and various farmer unions have been protesting against the decision to wind up the power plant that was set up in 1974. Political leaders and local residents have been demanding that the towers be not razed since they are the landmark of Bathinda, a key city in Punjab’s south Malwa region.The cooling towers of the thermal plant are often confused with smoke-emitting chimneys.Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, who is local Congress MLA, earlier this week met Union minister of chemicals and fertilizers DV Sadananda Gowda and sought setting up of a pharmaceutical park in Bathinda.Manpreet has been claiming that 1,350 acre land at the plant site would be utilised for an industrial hub but some officials say it is to be seen how the industrial plan is conceptualised with four towers covering a sizeable area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-dismantling-four-mega-cooling-towers-of-bathinda-plant-to-live-on-as-landmark/story-KlRWo6WQZMQ5tXnqs1dsxJ.html

The state has 114,648 active cases. Maharashtra also recorded 266 fatalities on Thursday — its second-highest jump — taking the toll to 11,194. On Thursday, 5,527 patients were discharged in the state, pushing the tally of recoveries to 158,140. The state had breached the 8,000 cases mark for the first time on July 11 with 8,139 cases.Mumbai, meanwhile, recorded 1,476 new infections, taking the city’s total to 97,950. Mumbai has 24,307 active cases. It also recorded 56 new fatalities, pushing the city’s toll due to the disease to 5,523. The case fatality rate (CFR) in Mumbai stands at 5.6%, while the recovery rate is 70%. On July 15, Mumbai conducted 7,000 Covid-19 tests, among the highest number of tests conducted in a single day. Till date, Mumbai has conducted 415,390 tests.Besides Mumbai, its surrounding areas continued to contribute a chunk of the fresh cases. Thane city and Thane district recorded 427 and 401 new cases, respectively. Kalyan-Dombivli recorded 590 new cases, taking the satellite city’s tally to 16,661. Vasai-Virar and Mira Bhayander recorded 326 and 134 new cases, respectively. Navi Mumbai recorded 285 new cases, while Ulhasnagar recorded 208 fresh infections.

Both Nashik and Jalgaon districts have over 5,000 cases each.With the number of active cases reducing in Mumbai and new cases being added in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the region around Mumbai has emerged as the epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak in the state. Most of the nine municipal corporations in the MMR, excluding Mumbai, are under lockdown for the past week. There has been a slight reduction in the cases from the region. The region still contributes to about 35% of the daily increase in cases; as against around 41% till last week. Out of the 68,712 active cases in MMR, which has Mumbai, Thane, Palghar and Raigad districts, 44,405 active cases are from Thane, Palghar, and Raigad districts. The number of active cases in Mumbai has gone to the third position in the state after Thane district with 34,821 and Pune district with 27,389. Mumbai has 24,307 active cases.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the region saw a surge in cases after the state government planned to “unlock” curbs in the region. Maharashtra government announced gradual relaxation in curbs from June 3 as part of its Mission Begin Again. It provided relaxations for outdoor physical activities, including running, jogging, cycling, among others, from June 3. Subsequently, it opened up market areas, shops except for malls and shopping centres from June 5. It also allowed private offices to open up to 10% of its staff from June 8.According to the data of the state health department, on June 3, MMR, excluding Mumbai, had 13,302 cases of the total 74,860, while on July 15, MMR has recorded 87,426 cases of the 275,640 cases, which is a jump of over six times. Till June 3, the cases in MMR constituted 17% of the cases in the state, now it constitutes nearly 32% (31.71%).“The numbers increased in the last one month when we unlocked the state from June 3. People from MMR started traveling for work to Mumbai, and at that time Mumbai had several cases. Therefore, the numbers rose in MMR. However, they will be brought under control,” Tope said, while speaking to news channels.Since the Maharashtra government announced relaxation in lockdown in June, including in red zone areas, where cases were on the rise, the state has recorded over 75% of the cases. From June 1 to July 15, the state has recorded a whopping 207,985 cases, which 75.45% of the tally.As the cases have surged in the region, health infrastructure was found wanting. The local administrations have put municipal corporation areas under lockdown from the beginning of the month to grapple with the situation. Tope admitted that the health infrastructure in the area, except Thane city, has been weak and the government is building jumbo facilities in the region to deal with the shortage of beds.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in a meeting held last week, directed the local administrations to build jumbo facilities on the lines of the ones in Mumbai. He had also remarked that the directive to prepare for such facilities was given in April, but no such facility was erected.Tope said that small periods of lockdowns are imposed to break the chain of transmission and to ramp up the infrastructure during that time. He said, “I accept the cases are increasing as the population is very dense. The health facilities should have been taken care of by the previous government as well. At present, we are focused on increasing beds here and overall healthcare facilities.”“There is a shortage of ICU beds in MMR. Thane city is always taken care of, but besides that, other areas —Kalyan-Dombivli, Ambarnath, Badlapur, Bhiwandi, etc — the health infrastructure has not been taken care of. A multi-specialty hospital is needed in these areas. I have been speaking about this to the CM and also in the cabinet. Till then, we are planning a jumbo facility with 1,000 beds with oxygen supply and 350 ICU beds. It will be completed in a months’ time,” Tope added.The minister also said that the health department has filled up a vacant post of health officer in the region to support the local administration. The state government is also going to provide private doctors antigen test kits free of cost. Besides that, Kalyan-Dombvli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) has set up a committee of corporators to engage with citizens in this battle against coronavirus. The twin cities recently overtook Thane city in the total number of cases recorded.Tope added that the state government has planned to start five new laboratories in the MMR, one of which will be operational in Kalyan-Dombivli in this week. New laboratories will be set up in Bhiwandi, Badlapur, Ulhasnagar and Mira-Bhayander. In the absence of a laboratory, these areas had to depend on facilities in Thane, Navi Mumbai or Mumbai. “We will start five new laboratories in the region. There will be no delays as they have to depend on other city’s laboratories. A laboratory will start in the next three-four days in Kalyan-Dombivli. Right now, Kalyan-Dombivli is dependent on Thane, Mumbai, Navi Mumbai for testing,” he said.Meanwhile, the state government has also asked Centre for some relaxations in the parameters for plasma therapy. Tope said that they have sought two relaxations from the Union health ministry that would lead to an increase in the number of plasma donors in the state. He said that the state government is now planning to start plasma therapy treatment in all the districts.“We are planning to start an option for plasma therapy treatment in all the districts. Yesterday, we had a meeting with the Blood Bank Association. They want relaxations in the equipment to extract the plasma. Instead of apheresis device, the blood banks can extract it by a component method. The purpose of the two methods is the same, therefore it should be allowed. The apheresis device is expensive equipment. I have spoken to union health minister Harsh Vardhan, who has assured me he will look at it and approve it,” he said.Tope added that the state has sought relaxation in parameter for a person to be an eligible donor. “Despite over 1.5 lakh recovered patients, very few donors have come forward because of the parameter for becoming an eligible donor. We have asked the union health ministry to relax the requirement of Immunoglobulin-G (IgG) and consider the recovered patients who os positive for IgG as a donor. If these two conditions are relaxation the plasma donation will get a push,” he said.According to the figures released by the state government, the number of recovered patients in the city on Thursday at 67,830 is the same as the number of recovered patients on Wednesday. The state health department clarified that “There was an issue while updating these figures on the portal. Hence these numbers could not be updated today.” According to daily covid-19 figures released by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), 707 positive patients recovered and were discharged on Thursday. Total number of patients who have been discharged so far are 68,537. According to BMC, the total positive patients in Mumbai are 97,751. State and BMC figures differ because the state government pulls these figures out of the portal at a later time than the BMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-sees-sharpest-1-day-spike-of-8-641-covid-cases/story-SpJqm3UYb7qXu8MvbzgzBL.html
17-07-2020||Mumbai||HSC exams: State, Mumbai division record improved success rates||Around 88% of Class 12 students who wrote the state’s Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) exams this year passed, a jump of 4.51 percentage points from last year, even as Mumbai division slipped to the last position among the nine divisions in the state.The Mumbai division, which also consists of Thane, Raigad and Palghar, recorded a success rate of 85.83%, a jump of 5.25 percentage points from 2019, as the number of top scorers, too, went up. Konkan division stood first with a 95.74% success rate. The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) declared the HSC results at 1pm on Thursday. Over 15 lakh students had appeared for the exams which were conducted in February and March. Of these, 3.38 lakh students were from Mumbai division alone. Both the city and state saw a significant jump in the number of students scoring 90% and above, thus indicating a tough competition for seats in coveted colleges of the city during the coming days. In the state, 7,344 students scored 90% and above, a jump of 64% from 2019. In the Mumbai division, 3,109 students managed to achieve the feat, thus seeing a rise of about 41% as compared to the previous year. Shakuntala Kale, chairperson of the state board said overall scores of students had risen this year. “This year, the paper pattern for science had changed with more options for physics, chemistry, mathematics and biology, and a lot of students might have benefitted from the change. It is a good sign that the results have improved,” added Kale. The Arts stream saw the biggest spike in pass percentage across all streams. It recorded a 78.35% success rate as compared to 72.75% in 2019. Science and commerce streams recorded 95.30% and 88.56%, a jump of 3-4 percentage points from last year. “Over the last few years, many high scorers even from other boards are coming to the Arts stream. Students from the other boards were earlier not used to the HSC pattern, but over the years, even colleges have realised how to train them for the format of the board exams, which might be a reason for the stream’s overall performance,” said Ashok Wadia, principal, Jai Hind college, Churchgate. At St Andrew’s College, Bandra, a 100% result was recorded for both Arts and Commerce streams. “Until a few years ago, Arts was the last choice for students, but now more students are opting for the course and faring better, which is a very good sign,” said Marie Fernandes, principal of the college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hsc-exams-state-mumbai-division-record-improved-success-rates/story-CBXrlCabpPlaM1KSjU3LNN.html
17-07-2020||Mumbai||City gets 400mm rain over 57 hours; July total goes beyond 1,170 mm||Continuous showers between Tuesday and Thursday took the city’s rain tally beyond 1,170mm for July. Mumbai recorded 417mm over 57 hours between Tuesday (8.30am) and Thursday (5.30pm), figures revealed, including its second-highest 24-hour rainfall this season and third-highest since 2015.The weather bureau downgraded its orange alert to yellow with the possibility of heavy rain between Thursday night and Friday morning, but predicted a reduction in intensity throughout Friday. Intermittent intense rain spells between Wednesday and Thursday led to waterlogging, traffic congestion, and damage to residential structures.The Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded 191.2 mm rain between 8.30am Wednesday and 8.30am Thursday (second-highest this season). Of this, 110 mm was recorded between 8.30pm Wednesday and 8.30am Thursday. Through the day on Thursday, between 8.30am and 8.30 pm, the weather station recorded 149.2 mm rain.This took Mumbai’s rain tally for the month to 1,172.6 mm in 16 days, which is 139% of the months’ average rain (840.7 mm). With 1,567.8 mm rain recorded through the season (June 1 to July 16), Mumbai has received 69.3% of its seasonal average rainfall (2,260.4 mm).Earlier this month, between July 4 and 5, the city had recorded 200.8 mm rain. The highest 24-hour July rain in 10 years was recorded last year with 375.2 mm rain on July 2. Prior to that, the highest was on July 3, 2014 207.2 mm and July 24, 2013, saw 215.6 mm. The all-time high continues to be the July 27, 2005 deluge of 944.2 mm rain over 24-hours.“As predicted, rain data showed scattered heavy to very heavy rainfall with isolated extremely heavy falls over 24 hours in Mumbai,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general, India Meteorological Department (IMD). “The break in rain activity on Wednesday afternoon owing to change in wind pattern allowed conditions to enhance for intense rain spells late Wednesday night followed by continuous downpour till Thursday early morning.”The Colaba weather observatory, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 156.4 mm rain between 8.30am Wednesday and 8.30am Thursday. Of this, 116.6 mm was recorded overnight. However, a sharp dip in rainfall was witnessed on Thursday in contrast to the suburbs with 23.6 mm rain between 8.30am and 8.30pm.Over the past 24 hours, location-wise highest rain was recorded at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) with 317.4mm, followed by Dharavi and Bandra at 210 and 209 mm respectively. Worli recorded 198.4 mm. IMD classifies very heavy rain as 115.6-204.4 mm, and extremely heavy rain as over 204.5 mm.“Variations in the distribution of rain within the city are common. Scattered movement of clouds from south of Mumbai along the coast gained more moisture as it moved northwards, enhancing rain activity over the suburbs,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD.Thursday’s rainfall in Mumbai exhibited an unusual north to south gradient, said Akshay Deoras, PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom. “A large difference between rainfall measured at south Mumbai and suburbs on Thursday was unusual considering the relatively uncommon movement of clouds from Colaba towards suburbs. Local factors such as lakes and terrain seem to have abruptly intensified rainfall over suburbs,” he said.Low-hanging clouds over south and central Mumbai were witnessed covering top floors of skyscrapers on Thursday afternoon. “This is a common monsoon phenomenon where constant influx of moisture from the Arabian Sea leads to the formation of nimbostratus clouds,” said professor Sridhar Balasubramanian, department of mechanical engineering and IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.Meanwhile, owing to less rain in catchment areas that provide water supply to Mumbai, located in Thane and Nashik districts, the city’s water stock stood at 25.8% so far, against 48.8% recorded during this period last year. “Westerly winds are mainly straddling along the coast owing to the moderate strength of offshore trough (weather system). They are not penetrating towards interiors for heavy rain over catchment. The Bay of Bengal needs to produce a system to pull these winds over these areas to recharge the catchments,” said Balasubramanian.Both meteorologists said usual intermittent light to moderate showers are expected during the weekend and early next week with rain bands expected to move northwards towards Palghar, Dahanu, and south Gujarat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/city-gets-400mm-rain-over-57-hours-july-total-goes-beyond-1-170-mm/story-ksE71i5cAvVHVj4gVlSS5H.html

17-07-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 leads to parallel modes of assessment in this university in Delhi||When the Delhi government on Saturday announced cancellation of exams for state universities, including Netaji Subhas University of Technology (NSUT), the order brought relief only to a section of students studying on the campus. The reason: the university functioned as an institute under Delhi University till 2018.This essentially means that exams were only cancelled for first-year students who were admitted to the state university after 2018. The rest — the second, third, and fourth year students — who were admitted under Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology (NSIT) will be evaluated on the basis of DU and University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines.Officials confirmed that students admitted before and during 2018-19 academic session will be under Delhi University. The rest, who were admitted in 2019-20 academic session, will appear for their first-year assessments this year, are under the state’s higher education department.So, while NSUT is conducting time-bound home assignments for its 1500 first-year students, NSIT is slated to start discussion-based online evaluation for final-year students on July 22. DU’s Faculty of Technology is responsible for conducting NSIT exams for the approximately 800 final-year students.Sachin Maheshwari, dean at DU’s Faculty of Technology, said, “The decision to evaluate final-year students was taken unanimously in a joint course committee meeting of all the departments of engineering courses. A panel of examiners will be conducting an online interaction with final-year students over video calls, or phone calls to evaluate them. The decision was taken while keeping the interest of students in mind while following UGC guidelines and existing infrastructure.”Supporting the move for final-year exams, Archit Sahni, a final-year undergraduate student at NSIT, said, “Most students of our batch just want their degrees. Many of us who have their offer letters will not be able to join for work if we don’t have our final year degrees.”Maheshwari explained that the decision was taken after consulting students, most of who were in favour of taking exams in this mode instead of pen and paper exam. Those facing internet issues on the day of the exams can also contact the committee set up by the institute requesting evaluation at another date.For second and third year students, which are under DU, students are likely to be promoted on the basis of past performance and continuous assessments which have already been conducted throughout the semester. DU’s dean (Exams) Vinay Gupta said the varsity’s Faculty of Technology and NSUT officials have discussed details on the mode of evaluation and will announce it by Friday.While NSUT had already started the process of conducting time-bound home assignments from its first year students from July 10, following deputy chief minister’s announcement of cancellation of exams and the call for “progressive modes of evaluation”, the varsity increased the time-limit of the exam from 2.5 hours to a day. Sujata Sengar, Dean Academics at NSUT, said, “Since our end-semester exams are not taking place due to the Covid-situation, evaluations are being done on the 50-mark internal component which will be used for 100% weightage. In addition to home assignments, students will also be marked on attendance, assessments and classroom quizzes that were conducted before and during the lockdown.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-leads-to-parallel-modes-of-assessment-in-this-university-in-delhi/story-YSS5YnxxFbLEgBiBuG3GJI.html

His alleged accomplice, Sanjay Sharma, a resident of Greater Noida, was also arrested.Officers of the STF said there had been tip-off about movements of known associates of Salem and Khan Mubarak, following which teams had been deployed across the state.“We knew that Singh would invoke the names of these mafias to extort money from people on the pretext of property dealing. Following inputs, a team went to his house Wednesday around 9.30pm; Singh was found sitting in his Brezza car with a driver and Sharma. He was detained and he confessed to being associated with known criminals,” said RK Mishra, additional superintendent of police, STF.Mishra said Singh had allegedly duped a Delhi-based businessman of Rs 1.8 crore in 2014. When asked to return the money, Singh allegedly used his connections to threaten the victim and even had him shot at in Sector 18, Noida.“He had also duped a Noida-based man of Rs 52 lakh through a fake property agreement. Whenever his victims asked for their money, he threatened them with his connections and used them to extort money from people. He also had non-bailable warrants issued against him from the Surajpur court in 2018,” said the additional SP.Singh was also allegedly involved in investing funds of known criminals in properties across Delhi-NCR in an effort to launder the money.

In rural areas the village will be taken as containment zone if there is one case, if there is more than one case the adjoining area of villages will be taken as buffer zone,” he said.While a containment zone imposes strict restrictions on the movement of residence and complete sealing on the entry and exit points, while in buffer zones, movement is not restricted but services, except for essentials, are.The DM further informed that in case of multi storied residential buildings / societies the same rules will apply with regards to containment zones. “If one case in a floor situated in a multi-storey society, that particular floor where active case/ cases have been found shall be designated as containment zone. If cases are found in more than one tower in a society, all such towers where active cases have been found along with all such common facilities like park, gym swimming pool, and banquet hall shall form containment zone,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/govt-nod-for-super-specialist-doctors-trauma-centre-at-gims/story-lv0crAF04DTjeTztVKsjoO.html
17-07-2020||Gurugram||100 shops sealed in Sadar Bazar, traders protest||More than 100 shops in the city’s busy Sadar Bazar area were sealed for encroachment by a team of municipal corporation Gurugram (MCG) early on Thursday morning , evoking strong protests from traders.The businessmen later sat on a dharna in the market and alleged that the civic authority had acted in haste. MCG officials, however, made it clear that the shops were sealed after the owners failed to take corrective action despite repeatedly being warned over the last three days. The shopkeepers will now have to pay a penalty of Rs 2,000 and submit an affidavit that no violations will take place in the future to get their shops de-sealed.As per MCG, the action was initiated against traders who had allowed unauthorized vendors to operate in front of their establishments, thereby leading to encroachment of the road.Officials said a team led by joint commissioner, Gaurav Antil started the drive at 5.30 am and sealed at least 100 shops that had been identified earlier by them for violations.Antil said that as per directions of the municipal commissioner, Gurugram, they had shared information through newspapers and also made public announcements in the market asking shop owners to refrain from extending their shops or allowing vendors to operate illegally. “Videography of the shops was also conducted, which were allowing vendors to operate in front of their establishments. Apart from sealing the shop, notices were also pasted which mentioned the reasons for the sealing drive. if the notices are removed then we will lodge a case against them ,” said Antil in a statement issued by the MCG.Soon after the sealing drive, the traders of the area launched a protest and sat on a dharna against the MCG action. The shop owners said that they had already suffered a lot owing to the raging coronavirus pandemic. Now, the government was further targeting them. “Why did the MCG officials take action only in Sadar Bazar and not in any other HSVP market where violations and encroachments are rampant. Also why is only Sadar Bazar forced to close shops on Sundays, when all other markets are open in the city,” asked Bablu Gupta, former president of the Sadar Bazar traders Association.Kishan Sharma, another shop owner said that the authorities should ensure a balance so that discipline remains in the market but business does not suffer.MCG officials, however, said that Sadar Bazar area is one of the most congested markets in the city and it is very important to ensure that social distancing and other measures, like wearing masks, are enforced strictly there. “Due to encroachments, the people visiting the markets were facing a lot of problems due to congestion and this can further spread Covid 19,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/100-shops-sealed-in-sadar-bazar-traders-protest/story-uReoNGZxm51YzFfpASUkCK.html
17-07-2020||Gurugram||Parents of young children withdraw admission from private schools amid financial uncertainty||A number of parents across the city are deregistering their children from nursery and pre-nursery classes of private schools amid the financial crisis and pay cuts caused by the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19. While some parents are moving to cheaper online classes, others are opting for pre-schools that charge a nominal fee as compared to formal schools. Government schools also said that they have seen an uptick in students who were migrating from private to government schools.Madhu Yadav, a mother of a three-year-old boy, withdrew her child’s admission from nursery in a private school in June. Yadav said that her family decided that it was best to withdraw admission from a formal school with physical classes remaining suspended and the uncertainty prevailing due to the outbreak of Covid-19.“There are around 18-20 children in the online class on a daily basis. I feel that individual attention to students is not given in a situation like this and a personal connection with the teacher is missing. Moreover, there are worksheets that need to be submitted every day. We don’t feel the need to put so much pressure on a child at such a young age,” said Yadav.Yadav is now continuing classes with a preschool, which conducts an hour-long online class with less than 10 students. The shift to a cheaper online mode, Yadav said, was also a financially viable option. “The preschool charges a nominal fee amounting to ₹3,000 whereas continuing with the formal school would mean paying anywhere between ₹30-40,000 fee for another quarter in addition to fees for extra-curricular activities. We didn’t want to pay so much for nothing, especially in such financially uncertain times,” said Yadav, who is considering applying to a formal school either next year or at a time when the pandemic gets over.Deepika Chauhan’s three-year-old child was going to a formal school until April. However, with the school initiating online classes, Chauhan withdrew admission and is teaching the child at home. “The school started conducting online classes after the summer break. We realised that we were not able to give the time and support that was needed during these online classes. His screen-time was also increasing and we felt it was better to try for admission next year,” said Chauhan.She said that while the school had given a small discount on the tuition fees, it was charging the annual fee, due to which several parents were withdrawing admission. “We will have to pay the admission fee again when we apply for next year but for now, we don’t see any merit in paying the quarterly fee when our child is unable to get the best out of these classes,” said Chauhan, who is also a teacher in a city school. She said that parents of children in lower classes were rescinding admission more in comparison to those in senior classes, who fear that withdrawing admission would mean loss of an academic year. “In the school where I teach, withdrawals are mostly taking place at the pre-primary or the primary level. There are various reasons ranging from financial distress to the lack of attention to younger children that are influencing parent’s decision,” said Chauhan.In May, the directorate of school education had said that all students of private schools were expected to pay the monthly tuition fee regularly from June onwards, as per the normal routine followed in previous years. The Haryana government had issued orders regarding the payment of fees on April 23, according to which only monthly tuition fees could be collected during the lockdown. The department also said that parents facing financial distress could write to schools formally seeking a deferment. However, several parents have complained that with no formal monitoring, private schools are under no pressure to follow guidelines. In order facilitate the transfer of students from private to government schools, the Haryana government had said that a school-leaving certificate(SLC) was no longer mandatory to take admission in the government schools. The move had drawn flak from private schools, which had criticised the move. Gurugram block education officer Sudesh Raghav said, while the notification regarding SLC certificate had been withdrawn, government schools had been receiving applications from parents, who were switching from private to government schools. “There are parents who are opting for government schools due to financial distress. While these admissions are not happening at a large scale, government schools are nonetheless extending the maximum help to parents who might want to shift,” said Raghav.Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, Urban Estate, said added that a number of students from private schools have opted out of the school in the aftermath of the lockdown.“Many of the children who are joining our school used to study in private schools earlier. With physical classes getting suspended due to the pandemic and parents struggling to pay the fees amid financial losses, they decided to move them to government schools. Parents don’t see the point in paying fees for online classes,” said Sharma.Aparna Erry, principal of the DAV Public School in Sector 14 and chairperson of the Gurgaon Progressive Schools Council (a consortium of CBSE schools in the city) said that schools were charging monthly fee. “We are not charging the quarterly fee and in case, parents have major financial troubles, they can write to the school and request a deferment,” said Erry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/parents-of-young-children-withdraw-admission-from-private-schools-amid-financial-uncertainty/story-xrnEJUDbk1yVKXKfLHTuWL.html
17-07-2020||Gurugram||GMDA extends deadline for processing of CLU formalities||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has decided to treat the lockdown period as a ‘zero period’ for the processing of all change of land use (CLU)-related formalities. As such, developers of projects, who were unable to submit letters of intent (LOI), building plans for approval, or applications seeking occupancy certificates (OC) for their projects will now have time till July 31 to complete the necessary formalities.As per a statement shared on GMDA’s website, the ‘zero period’ will apply only to those project proponents who were to submit their respective documents after March 15. “The matter has been examined vis-à-vis the hardships faced by the project proponent in the period of lockdown, the period of lockdown shall be treated as ‘zero-period’ for the cases wherein the project proponent failed to submit application /documents for above said purposes after 15.03.2020. Therefore, all such project proponent may submit their applications up to 31.07.2020 (sic),” the statement reads. The Haryana town and country planning department, on July 6, had also decided to consider the period from March 1 to September 30 as zero period during which there will be a moratorium on compliance rules and interest payments for all realty projects. At that time, a government spokesperson had said that this moratorium would apply to CLU rules, renewal of licences, the extension of CLU, fees payment and other charges as per the Haryana Apartment Ownership Act, 1983.The move comes as a relief to realtors, who had been seeking more time to complete official and financial formalities in days following the lockdown. Parveen Jain, chairman, National Real Estate Development Corporation (Naredco), Haryana, said that the government has taken a positive step by announcing these measures. “These moratoriums will give some space to the real estate companies to survive through these tough times,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gmda-extends-deadline-for-processing-of-clu-formalities/story-aFfbwBED6ahEI4HejF1rQL.html
17-07-2020||Delhi||‘Repeated incitement, planned rioting’: Minorities body files report on N-E riots||Repeated incitement to violence, planned and organised rioting by armed mobs, targeting of religious places, and multiple incidents of police inaction – these are some of the findings of a committee appointed by the Delhi Minorities Commission to probe the northeast Delhi riots in February. At least 53 persons died and 400 were injured in the riots that rocked the district. The committee, headed by Supreme Court advocate-on-record MR Shamshad, submitted its 130-page report to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia , other Delhi government ministers and speaker of the Delhi legislative assembly on Wednesday.The report has been based on individual victim testimonies and physical surveys of damage to religious sites.The committee said that in the Delhi election campaign between December 2019 and February 2020,multiple speeches delivered by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders such as Kapil Mishra tried to incite the people against anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protesters and called for forceful removal of protesters from the Jafrabad area.Mishra, who delivered one of his speeches on February 23, denied allegations. He told HT earlier that even legal experts said there was nothing wrong in what he said that day. “What I said is captured in video, and everyone has seen that video (on social media),” he said.Referring to local politicians, student activists and some leaders of anti-CAA protesters who were arrested, he had said: “The truth of Delhi riots is out; how long they have planned, their funding and why they especially chose the days of [US President] Donald Trump’s visit [in February-end]; everything is exposed already.” The report said the violence was not spontaneous and had been planned. It said armed mobs selectively targeted Muslim individuals and properties while shouting slogans. “The attacks were targeted to the extent that in instances where the owners were Hindus but the properties had been rented to Muslims, the buildings were spared but the moveable properties were looted or burned outside the premises,” the report said.Eleven mosques, five madrasas, one shrine and one graveyard were attacked and damaged in the violence, the report said, adding: “Non-Muslim places of worship in Muslim majority areas remained untouched and were guarded by Muslims neighbours during the riots.”“Multiple testimonies collected by the Fact-Finding Committee recount reports of police inaction even as violence unfolded before them, or of police not arriving despite repeated calls on the emergency call number. Testimonies also suggest how police were patrolling the area but when asked for help, they refused saying they had no orders to act,” the report said.Citing multiple testimonies, the committee noted that first information reports (FIRs) had either been delayed or had not been acted upon and “in some cases police were complicit and abetted the attacks” or “police merely stood as onlookers while the mobs engaged in looting, burning and violence.” Delhi Police said the department had not received a copy of the report, but had been doing a “fair and professional” investigation of all the 752 FIRs filed in connection with the communal violence.“We started a designated helpline and put advertisements on various platforms, urging people to come forward and file their complaints. As a result 752 cases were registered, mostly on the complaints of people from the minority community. Of them 372 have been solved and more than 200 have been charge sheeted. A total of 1,470 people have been arrested so far. We are still open to receive complaints related to the riots. A special court has been created and special prosecutors have been appointed to expedite the trial of the cases. A claims commissioner has also been appointed for assessing the damage to property in the riots and making rioters compensate the damages,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Anil Mittal.The report said Muslim women were attacked based on their religious identity and threats of sexual violence were also made against them. The report asked the government to form a five-member independent committee to ensure proper registration of FIRs, probe the “complicity and abdication of duty by Delhi Police”, make sure that compensation is properly distributed. “We will study this report and if there are any corrective measures that need to be taken, we will absolutely do that,” a Delhi government spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/repeated-incitement-planned-rioting-minorities-body-files-report-on-n-e-riots/story-fkuzl9hvl0vml6jU8XgGfI.html

Four cases have been registered against Kalita, who was arrested on May 23.Justice Vibhu Bakhru was informed by advocate Adit S Pujari, representing Kalita, that “selective” leaks have been made to tarnish the image of his client while also claiming that the investigating agency has violated its own advisory on media and reporting.Pujari added that he was supplied a copy of the charge sheet only after media leaks. He said that in one of the pleas filed by Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Brinda Karat seeking to upload in its website the FIRs lodged in connection with Delhi violence, police had opposed it saying the cases are sensitive and FIRs cannot be put in public domain as this would disclose the names of complainants, witnesses and accused persons.“However, the police are themselves leaking out these notes,” he submitted.Police told the high court on July 9 that the press note issued to the media was not a “selective leak”, as Kalita alleged, and it was done to present correct facts before the public.Additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi, along with advocates Amit Mahajan and Rajat Nair, representing the police, told the court on Wednesday that the nature of the case and allegations levelled against the woman were not revealed by the investigating agency first and it was the members of that group who disclosed the details on social media.The law officer had submitted that the issuance of press note on June 2 to the media about the case was not to harm Kalitha or tarnish her reputation but to correct the facts misreported on social media||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-reserves-order-on-plea-by-kalita-against-cops-leaks/story-LKQAt5A4ZE3Zddk5MZwLFJ.html
17-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC tells NABL, ICMR to speed up approvals for Covid-19 tests||The Delhi high court on Thursday directed National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL), a health care accreditation body, and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), to expedite the process of granting approvals to private labs and hospitals for conducting rapid antigen and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests in view of the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the city.A bench of justice Hima Kohli and justice Subramonium Prasad said the period of one month, which is currently the time taken to grant approval, is too long in the present scenario when Covid-19 cases, as on July 15, have shot up to 116,993 in the national capital.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayIt also asked the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to place before it the preliminary report on the sero surveillance carried out in the city’s 11 districts by July 27, after the NCDC counsel sought one more week to present the report.The court was hearing a plea filed by advocate Rakesh Malhotra, seeking directions to authorities to ramp up testing in the national capital.During the hearing, Union government standing counsel Anurag Alhuwalia, appearing for ICMR and NABL, told the court that it has received applications from 60 private labs and hospitals for testing permission. The court was also informed that the registration process takes a month.Also read: 10 cities account for half of India’s active Covid-19 infectionsThe ICMR, the apex medical research body overseeing all Covid-19 protocols in the country, said it has been granting approvals to private hospitals and labs to conduct the rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests, and that this was an ongoing process. It said all entities are given a month’s time to apply for the same after getting accredited by NABL.The bench was of the view that a month was too long as it could lead to complacency and directed the ICMR to shorten the window so that the general public is not inconvenienced in finding a lab or hospital for testing.Regarding the sero surveillance, NCDC in its affidavit said the study was done “to assess the prevalence of infection at the community level and is primarily used for evidence-based public health response”.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage NCDC said this exercise has to be done methodically and is a time-consuming process and therefore, imposing timelines for declaration of results “will lead to a compromise in the quality of the analysis and can have a detrimental impact on the evidence-based results so expected to be obtained through such studies”.It also told the court that a week more, at the minimum, would be required for the preliminary results to be ready and the bench directed that the report be filed before the next date of hearing on July 27.On Thursday, the Delhi government’s additional standing counsel Satyakam told the court that 281,555 rapid antigen tests have been conducted in Delhi between June 18 and July 15. In an affidavit, he told the court that 19,480 people were found positive for the virus infection, while the rest were negative. He submitted that the symptomatic patients (1,365), who tested negative on antigen tests, were subjected to the RT-PCR test, according to the guidelines from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), following which 243 people were found positive for Covid-19.On a specific query from the court, Satyakam said the number is “abysmally low” as the ICMR guidelines do not insist that all those testing negative should be tested again using RT-PCR.“Only those showing symptoms even after testing negative are to be followed up by the RT-PCR,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/speed-up-approvals-for-rapid-antigen-rt-pcr-testing-high-court-tells-icmr-nabl/story-NZRd7iwD8HIwKnnT1cWy8J.html
17-07-2020||Delhi||Ghazipur slaughterhouse set to reopen after 100 days||After being shut for over 100 days, the city’s lone abattoir—the Ghazipur slaughterhouse—is likely to reopen in a week. The move comes after the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) agreed to the demand of a two-year extension by the company that manages the facility. EDMC on Wednesday issued an order granting two years’ extension to the company and asked them to restart the facility. The slaughterhouse was closed on March 26 at the start of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, affecting the principal supply line of meat to the Capital.Officials said the slaughterhouse could not be reopened even after the lockdown was lifted because of the “stalemate” regarding the agreement of management between EDMC and Frigorifico Allana—the company managing the facility.While poultry slaughter is allowed in several places in the city, goats, lambs and buffaloes can only be butchered at the slaughterhouse close to the Uttar Pradesh border. It supplied around 400,000 kg of meat daily to Delhi until the lockdown.The meat supply in the city has been disrupted ever since the slaughterhouse suspended its operations. Traders were forced to get their supply from Uttar Pradesh and Haryana instead, leading to a sharp increase in mutton prices. Before the lockdown, mutton was sold for around ₹500 per kg; the price has now increased to ₹1,000 per kg in Delhi.Nirmal Jain, the mayor of EDMC, confirmed the slaughterhouse would become operational in around a week as they have provided a two-year extension to the firm. “We have been getting requests to reopen the slaughterhouse as people have been procuring meat at high prices. With the festival of Bakr-Eid around the corner, the demand is expected to rise further. So we have issued an order to provide a two-year extension to the existing company to run the slaughterhouse. In the meantime, we will also float global bids for a 10-year lease to run the slaughterhouse. We have asked the firm to reopen the slaughterhouse soon. It may take around a week as they will have to arrange labour and sanitise the premises,” Jain said.According to civic officials, the contract of the company had ended in August last year and was extended twice till May this year. The civic body, in the meantime, had sent out fresh bids, which failed. As the lockdown started being lifted in a phased manner, EDMC asked the concessionaire to restart the facility and gave it an extension of another six months, but the company declined the request and demanded at least two years more. “Now the civic body has agreed to the demand. We are hoping that the slaughterhouse will reopen next week,” a senior EDMC official said.Fauzan Alavi, the director of Frigorifico Allana, said, “We wanted the stalemate to end and the slaughterhouse to reopen. We are yet to get any official communication in connection with the two-year extension to the company.”Built in 2009, the Ghazipur slaughterhouse is spread across 25 acres near NH-24. It is an automated facility where around 1,000 butchers and supervisors work, and has the capacity for 10,000 animals to be slaughtered in three shifts daily.The opposition in EDMC, however, questioned the move and said that such a long-term extension should have been given only after approval from the House. “EDMC has given a two-year extension to the company running the slaughterhouse without getting it passed from the House and the standing committee. The ruling BJP should have first discussed and passed this proposal in the House. The move reeks of corruption,” the leader of opposition in EDMC Manoj Kumar Tyagi said.Responding to the allegation, EDMC mayor Jain said that the allegations were “baseless” and the step was taken as an “emergency move” as the slaughterhouse had been closed for over three months and the survival of its workers was at stake. “It is a public welfare decision and an emergency move. The people of the city have been suffering from meat shortage and over 1000 employees, who work at the slaughterhouse, are struggling for survival. We cannot keep the facility shut for eternity; we had to end the stalemate. That’s why we decided to reopen the facility,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ghazipur-slaughterhouse-set-to-reopen-after-100-days/story-tr2jJEgKpdBzvkVYjcop9H.html
17-07-2020||Delhi||Survey outside red zones to spot people at high risk of Covid-19 infection||The city’s district administrations are conducting surveys in at least 682 areas outside containment zones that house over six million people, to identify “high-risk” persons and those with symptoms of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), senior government officials said.The localities have been identified after the director-general of health services (DGHS) on July 9 issued modified guidelines for Covid-19 surveillance in the city. The 682 localities are mostly areas around containment zones, as well as those reporting isolated Covid-19 cases for 28 days or more. The localities also include areas that have seen infrequent isolated cases irrespective of the number of days.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know today “The district administrations have collectively reported that a total of 6,533,724 persons reside in these 682 localities identified across Delhi. Around 40,000-50,000 persons are being screened every day across the city in these localities. The aim of this survey is to identify symptomatic and high-risk individuals, most of who are then administered rapid antigen tests,” said a senior government official.According to a Delhi government report also submitted to the MHA on July 12, of the 11 districts in Delhi, 165 localities are in southeast district — a population of roughly 1,800,000. The central district has identified 50 such localities where the aim is to cover as many as 1,843,836 people. The west district administration has identified 97 localities in which 13,198 persons reside, the lowest of all districts.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Till July 6, the government had kept its door-to-door survey restricted to the containment and buffer zones in Delhi. It was decided on July 9 survey would be expanded beyond containment zones.“The survey within the city’s 658 containment zones is a continuous process and is going simultaneously along with the survey of areas outside the hotspots. In containment zones, over 375,822 people are being covered,” said a second official from the government’s revenue department.Both surveys are continuous processes and do not have fixed deadlines, officials said.For the surveys, over 13,000 booth-level officers (BLOs), health officials and Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) have been deployed. Health-related data concerning all family members in each household is fed into a mobile application linked to a dashboard maintained by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), which is chaired by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is DDMA’s vice-chairperson.High-risk individuals are defined as those who have been in contact with Covid-19 patients, people aged over 60, pregnant women, people with severe acute respiratory illnesses, people with influenza-like illnesses and individuals with comorbidities, which may include diabetes, cardiovascular ailments, hypertension and kidney-related issues, a senior government official said.“In areas with isolated cases, the district surveillance officers (DSOs) have also been asked to review localities that have been regularly reporting cases for over 14 days by mapping cases in terms of time and geographic location. Epidemiological situation analysis and tracking the transmission chains are also being done by the districts in this case,” a health department official said.Apart from the survey, district authorities are also conducting tests among ‘special surveillance groups’ (SSG) comprising rickshaw/auto, taxi, goods carriage and lorry drivers, domestic helps, daily workers (plumbers, electricians, carpenters, etc) and daily suppliers of food, general stores and delivery persons.The media advisor to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/survey-outside-red-zones-to-spot-people-at-high-risk/story-5Lnrq99cNvaMR8Rr9UrKdO.html

17-07-2020||Delhi||Students who scripted victory in CBSE exams, and life||A 14-year-old who runs a shop in her house to support her family; the daughter of a street hawker who sells socks to make ends meet; and a first-generation learner from an Urdu medium school who now wants to switch her medium to English so that she can pursue engineering. Three children with three different life stories had one triumph in common -- they cleared their class 10 exams with high scores.When the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) announced the results Wednesday, Vaishnavi (who goes by her first name) was working in the small stationery shop she had set up at her home in north-east Delhi’s Bhajanpura to help out her family. Although she could not write two of her exams owing of the communal riots that broke out in her area in February and the Covid-19 pandemic, she managed to score 92.6% marks under the new evaluation scheme.The CBSE could not conduct the class 10 exams that were postponed in view of the communal riots in north-east Delhi. The board evaluated students on the basis of the average of marks in exams that they took before the lockdown came into effect on March 25.A student of the government girls senior secondary school in Yamuna Vihar, Vaishnavi divided her time between her studies and work at the shop throughout the year.“My father had met with an accident last year and since then, he has not been keeping well and is jobless. My mother stitches clothes at home to make ends meet. To help my family, I opened a small stationery shop in our house. I would sit there after school hours till late evening. I later started keeping some groceries, too, at my shop. I studied while manning the shop; there was no time or money for tuitions,” she said.Vaishnavi said it was difficult for her to take exams after the riots took place. “I had appeared for my mathematics, science and social science exams in the aftermath of the riots. There was so much fear in our area and it kept us awake at night. But I am glad I managed to appear for some of the exams. I wish I could have appeared for the Hindi and English papers (postponed during the riots and couldn’t be held later owing to the lockdown) as well,” she said. She now wants to opt for science stream in class 11 and go on to become an engineer.Many government school students like Vaishnavi managed to beat the odds and performed well in the class 10 exams. Bhawani Kumari, 15, whose father sells socks on a cart and mother works as a helper in an anganwadi, scored 92% marks. A student of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Vasant Kunj, Bhawani Kumari said she aspires to become a researcher in biotechnology. “My father could not continue his studies beyond class 10 due to financial limitations. That’s why he has always wanted that my siblings and I continued with our studies,” she said.When not studying, Bhawani Kumari said she looks after her two younger siblings. “Sometimes when my mother gets delayed at work, I prepare the food for them. I like helping my parents,” she said.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said students of Delhi government schools have proved that talent cannot be measured by wealth. “I have heard a lot of people saying that a poor family does not want their child to study, that they would rather have the children earning money. These results have proved this wrong. These results have proved that when conditions at government schools improve, a poor family also wants to their children to study,” he had said.Mehak Shahid, 17, the daughter of a street hawker, scored 95.1% marks in class 10 exams. Student of a Urdu medium school, Zeenat Mahal School in old Delhi’s Lal Kuan, Mehak is a first-generation learner. She now wants to switch to another government school that offers the science stream. “My father sells iron items -- locks, scissors and suchlike -- outside the Old Delhi railway station. I wanted to make him proud by scoring well in my board exams. I am the first in the entire family to have studied till class 10. I will now switch to another school, an English medium, so that I can pursue science in class 11. I want to be an engineer and no engineering college offers a degree in Urdu medium,” she said.Mohammad Sahil, 16, a student at a government school in Mehrauli, had scored 83% when the results came. Although he did not make it to the 90% league, his journey is nonetheless remarkable. He has been giving tuitions to children in his neighbourhood for the last two years, to help his mother who has to feed a family of five. “My mother has been looking after the family for the past nine years after my father fell sick. She works at a garments factory for ₹5,000 a month. I had to take up some work to help support her and my education,” he said. Sahil wants to pursue science in class 11.Educationist Meeta Sengupta said, “The Delhi government has tried to do several things that motivated and encouraged students, teachers and parents. They invested in the infrastructure and fixed basic issues. Who would not like to study sitting in a nicely done classroom?

17-07-2020||Delhi||New math option helped govt school students score better in CBSE class 10 boards||The introduction of basic mathematics as an option in class 10 by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) played a major role in improving pass percentage across Delhi government schools -- recording a jump of over 11 percentage points in the board exams this year over 2019. The pass percentage of students in mathematics has gone up to 88.39% this year from 73.68% in 2019.According to the data provided by the Delhi government, of the 153,910 students from their 1005 schools who took the class 10 exams this year, 111,298 or 73% had opted for basic mathematics. The remaining 27% went for standard mathematics. As many as 94,920 (85%) passed the basic maths exam.  The CBSE had for the first time introduced the option of basic and standard mathematics in the class 10 exams this year. Basic maths was for those who do not want to pursue the subject in higher classes. Standard math was for those who want to study mathematics in class 11.Principals, teachers,and education department officials said the decision, along with repeated interventions in the form of remedial or extra classes and the revised policy of internal assessment, helped students perform better.Mary Jyotsna Minj, principal of a Delhi government school in Kondli, said , “The introduction of basic mathematics was a major reason why the pass percentage in our school jumped from 68% to 91.5% this year. Also, unlike previous years, the 20-mark internal assessment was divided into four components this year, which gave students multiple opportunities to score more marks,” she said. The school recorded 156 overall compartments last year; this year the number dropped to 33.Shailendra Sharma, senior advisor to Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia, said, “A simple tweak in a policy and focused support can do wonders for students. CBSE’s decision to divide maths into basic and standard is an example. As against 73.68% students of Delhi government schools clearing mathematics in class 10 last year, we have 88.4% students passing in this subject this year. Those who wanted to study maths beyond Class 10 opted for standard mathematics this year and 96.5% passed. A small step can make such a big difference.”Sharma said those who opted for basic mathematics in class 10 but want to pursue the subject in higher classes can appear for standard mathematics paper along with compartment students.Seema (who goes by first name), students of a government girls senior secondary school in Karawal Nagar, who scored 81% this year, said basic mathematics helped her improve her marks. “Since I scored 50 out of 100 in class 9, I was scared my performance in maths would affect my aggregate in Class 10. But I scored 75 in basic maths, which shows it is a good option for students like me who do not want to study maths in future,” she said.In September last year, the Delhi government had asked all heads of government schools to counsel “low performers” to opt for basic mathematics in class 10 examination instead of standard mathematics. Following which over 73% students had opted for the basic option.Some teachers had a different view, saying math was not the sole reason behind the increase in scores. Pawan Kumar, a math teacher at a government school in Madipur, which saw a 20 percentage point increase in its results, said, “While there wasn’t much difference between the two maths papers, repeated interventions by teachers and numerous class exercises ensured students were able to secure passing or average marks in mathematics this year. They also scored more in internal assessments.”BP Dhyani, head of a government school in Trilokpuri, added, “While compartments in math reduced this year across most schools, care must be taken to ensure this trend continues next year, especially in times of Covid-19 crisis. If classes are not conducted even after October, it will be difficult to cover the syllabus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/math-syllabus-division-helped-students-score-better-in-class-10-boards/story-Jtei3xVjEsuayLYKzrH7bJ.html
17-07-2020||Delhi||Two men gunned down in south Delhi, two of four killers held||Two men with criminal records were shot dead on Wednesday night allegedly by four persons known to them near Saket in south Delhi, police said.While the police have arrested two of the alleged killers, the remaining two are on the run, senior officers said. Police said the murder was a fallout of a dispute as the gang suspected one of the deceased men to be a police informer.Police identified the two dead men were Sanjay Pal and Abdul Ali, both residents of Geeta colony in east Delhi. A senior police officer who did not wish to be named said they received a call on Wednesday at 8.56pm, reporting that a man had been shot in the leg and was lying next to a drain close to a residential colony at Mehrauli-Badarpur Road in Saket.“A police team that reached the spot found that the injured man had already been rushed to AIIMS for treatment. A police team that reached the hospital found that the man had been pronounced dead,” the officer said. Meanwhile, another team thoroughly inspected the crime scene and found a blood trail. Police found the wall near the drain broken and discovered some liquor and water bottles as well as cigarette packets. “Further inspection also led to the recovery of a blood-soaked mobile phone and an abandoned white Santro car parked nearby,” the officer added.The deputy Commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said, “During the initial stage, we checked CCTV camera footage from the area and found that six men had arrived there in the white Santro car. Five separate teams were constituted and deputed to identify the deceased and trace the suspects,” Thakur said.The DCP said, on Thursday, the man declared brought dead at the hospital was identified as Abdul Alim. As part of the investigation, police traced the owner of the Santro car, Vipin Balyan, a resident of Bhajanpura.“During interrogation Balyan confessed to the crime and disclosed the details of another co-accused—one Satender Singh from Khajuri Khas. Based on his inputs, our teams raided Singh’s house and caught him too,” the DCP said. Police said the two men, along with their accomplices, had shot the two men dead. Police said one of the shooters (yet to be arrested) suspected Pal of being a police informer and then shot him. “As planned, on Wednesday night, the four men brought Pal and his friend Alim to the jungle area on the pretext of having a drink together and then shot them,” the DCP said, adding that they recovered Pal’s body from the bushes in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-men-gunned-down-in-south-delhi-two-of-four-killers-held/story-5HdZvrz3DbBmeu3i4ZHcgM.html

Two patients and one a resident doctor in the psychiatry department have taken their own lives.Thursday’s incident took place in the old OPD block where trauma emergency cases are being currently assessed, as the hospital’s trauma centre has been converted into a full-fledged Covid-19 hospital.According to hospital sources, the man was a registered patient and had undergone a trauma surgery in July 2019. “He had come for a follow up. He was advised admission and while formalities were being done, he seemed to have disappeared and his body was found in one of the bathrooms,” the hospital source said.According to reports, the man was found hanging with a plastic pipe used for glucose drips. He was rushed to the emergency, where doctor declared him brought dead.The Hauz Khas police station was informed about the incident. The matter is being investigated.Psychiatrists have started taking rounds, especially coronavirus disease (Covid-19) isolation wards, to pick up early signs of anxiety, depression, etc., among patients and counsel them. “There is a lot of stress that patients feel, more so in Covid-19 wards, as there’s hardly any human interaction due to staff wearing personal protection gear. Even for health care workers, it is a stressful situation as many are not able to connect with their families,” said Dr Rakesh Chadda, head of psychiatry department, AIIMS.“Since last week, one senior doctor and a senior resident from the psychiatry department takes regular rounds in wards to observe patients and staff to identify signs of mental health issues,” he added.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, while formally inaugurating the out patient department block at AIIMS on Thursday, also said focus should be on ensuring the hospital functions in a “problem-free” manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patient-at-aiims-for-surgery-follow-up-found-hanging/story-3ixkn5MIuAR7tmZIfS8kyH.html

The letter also went viral on social media. The letter addressed to DGP Sanjay Baniwal, stated that she was being harassed by her two senior constables (names withheld) and that they were “spoiling the work environment” of the operation cell. The DGP had entrusted the inquiry to deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Rashmi Sharma Yadav.The letter that did not carry a name added that the two cops would consume alcohol in the operation cell and hurl abuses at the staff. The woman constable accused one of the two senior constables of circumventing rules and “calling shots as well as assigning duties”, instead of the in-charge doing so thus leading to harassment as it is the “senior constable who assigns duties and sanctions rest days (off days) for the staff”. She even alleged that the senior constables touched her inappropriately in lieu of giving a rest day.She added that both are using official vehicles attached to the operation cell for personal use.“A complaint has been received and we are looking into the allegations,” said DSP Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/woman-constable-alleges-harassment-by-senior-colleagues-probe-ordered/story-Uw4sYTwAjdTokqSjlZDGXP.html

We have received media reports and complaints from residents that critical patients are not getting beds in private hospitals.”The divisional commissionerate has set up the real-time dashboard www.divcommpunecovid.com/ccs for update on bed availability status in Pune city and the region, but authorities found negligence by private hospitals despite instruction.Agrawal said, “As the information is not regularly updated, patients rush to hospitals only to be denied medical attention citing bed shortage. Regular updating will not cause such situations.”Officer on special duty at divisional commissioner office Saurabh Rao has appointed five deputy collector-level officers to monitor bed situation in private hospitals.Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar on Wednesday evening issued a show cause notice to a hospital at Baner that denied admission to a Covid-19 patient and suggested another hospital. The patient later died in an ambulance, according to a PMC press statement. PMC also issued notice to a hospital near Pune railway station for overcharging a Covid-19 patient.Ward officers to act against pvt hospitals PMC empowers regional ward officers to take action against private hospitals for overcharging and denying admission to patients. The officials are also asked to visit hospitals to verify bed availability status. Additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agrawal said that fifteen ward officers had been empowered to take action against private hospitals not following given instructions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/25-pvt-hospitals-nursing-homes-slapped-with-show-cause-notice-for-not-updating-bed-status-in-pune/story-dzoCCGiBFklLrzh0ez3clO.html

Another court also granted bail to 150 foreigners from Indonesia. A plea bargain is an arrangement between the prosecutor and accused, whereby the latter pleads guilty to a lesser charge in exchange for a more lenient sentence, or an agreement to drop other charges.Metropolitan Magistrate Dev Choudhary allowed foreigners from Djibouti, Mali, Kenya and 17 Sri Lankans to walk free on payment of a fine of Rs 5,000 each, said advocate Ashima Mandla, who appearing for them.Metropolitan Magistrate Akash allowed a few Myanmar nationals to walk free on payment of a fine of 5,000 each, while others claimed trial before the court, their counsel Fahim Khan said.Three Sri Lankans and other foreigners from Nigeria and Tanzania claimed trial before the court, the lawyer said.Meanwhile, another court granted bail to 150 foreign nationals from Indonesia who were charge-sheeted for attending the Tablighi Jamaat congregation here, allegedly in violation of visa norms and violating government guidelines issued in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Gurmohina Kaur granted relief to the foreigners on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 10,000 each.To date, 682 foreign nationals from 35 different countries, who were charge-sheeted in the case, have been granted bail by the court.The police had in June filed 59 charge sheets, including supplementary ones, against 956 foreigners belonging to 36 different countries in the case.The accused, who was granted bail on Tuesday, will file their plea bargaining applications on Wednesday, said advocates Ashima Mandla, Mandakini Singh and Fahim Khan, appearing for them. During cognisance of the charge sheets on July 6, the court was informed by the Investigating Officer (IO) that the 956 accused were investigated for charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and criminal conspiracy to endanger life or personal safety of others.“However, to date, no evidence has come against the foreigners for these,” the investigation officer told the court.The police had filed charge sheets against 956 foreigners from 36 countries, including 122 Mayalsians, for violating visa rules, violating government guidelines issued in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and regulations regarding Epidemic diseases Act, Disaster Management Act and prohibitory orders under section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure.They were accused of offences under sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 271 (Disobedience to quarantine rule) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Foreigners Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/markaz-congregation-more-foreigners-walk-free-get-bail/story-LiOMzypGEVHRzXfvSjvEMP.html
17-07-2020||World||After dwindling Covid-19 cases, UK PM Johnson hopes for normalcy by Christmas||Pleased with ‘steady progress’ on dealing with the coronavirus challenge, Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday hoped that the UK will be able to allow a more significant return to normality from November, “possibly in time for Christmas”.Several restrictions have been eased in recent weeks. Johnson said people could now return to work in ‘Covid-secure’ conditions in workplaces, while maintaining social distancing and other measures, as much as possible. Public transport is also open to all, with face coverings.Johnson announced additional £3 billion funding to deal with a possible second wave of the virus over the winter months, when hospitals usually deal with a surge of illnesses.He said: “But even as we plan for the worst, I strongly believe we should also hope for the best. That means looking ahead with optimism – now extending our plan to lift the remaining national measures which have restricted our lives since March so we can get back to something closer to normal life”.“It is my strong and sincere hope that we will be able to review the outstanding restrictions and allow a more significant return to normality from November at the earliest – possibly in time for Christmas”, he added.More areas of public life are to be opened shortly. From August 1, most remaining leisure settings, such as bowling, skating rinks and casinos will reopen, besides close-contact services such as beauticians.Under Covid-secure conditions, Johnson said the government will restart indoor performances to a live audience, subject to the success of pilots, and also pilot larger gatherings in venues like sports stadia, with a view to wider reopening in the autumn.“We will also allow wedding receptions for up to 30 people. All of these measures for 1 August should be done in a Covid Secure way. In September, schools, nurseries and colleges will be open for all children and young people on a full-time basis, as planned”.“And universities are also working to reopen as fully as possible. From October, we intend to bring back audiences in stadia and to allow conferences and other business events to recommence – again, these changes must be done in a Covid Secure way, subject to the successful outcome of pilots”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-dwindling-covid-19-cases-uk-pm-boris-hopes-for-normalcy-by-christmas/story-B9C7prBG5UcrJiYJRCrQ8N.html
17-07-2020||World||China says it’s not trying to replace US, will fight back against ‘malicious slander’||China isn’t seeking to confront or replace the United States as the world’s top technological power, but will fight back against “malicious slander” and attacks from Washington, a foreign ministry spokesperson said Friday, responding to a litany of recent accusations from the Trump administration.Hua Chunying said China’s chief concern was improving the livelihoods of its citizens and maintaining global peace and stability, despite what critics say is an increasingly aggressive foreign policy that looks to expand Chinese influence in the military, technology, economic and other spheres.“As an independent sovereign state, China has the right to safeguard its own sovereignty, security and development interests, to defend the achievements made by the Chinese people with hard work, to refuse any bullying and injustice against China, and to fight back against malicious slander and attacks by the U.S. against China,” Hua told reporters at a daily briefing.Her comments came in response to a speech Thursday by Attorney General William Barr in which he cautioned American business leaders against promoting policies favourable to Beijing. He asserted that China at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic had not only dominated the market on protective gear, exposing American dependence on Beijing, but had also hoarded supplies and blocked producers from exporting them to countries in need.Barr also accused hackers linked to the Chinese government of targeting American universities and businesses to steal research related to coronavirus vaccine development, levelling the allegation against Beijing hours after Western agencies made similar claims against Russia.“The People’s Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg — an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world’s pre-eminent technological superpower,” Barr said.Numerous Trump allies have issued strongly worded messages over China in recent days, coming at a time when bilateral relations have fallen to their lowest point in decades over issues from accusations of technology theft to China’s claims in the South China Sea.Hua dismissed Barr’s accusations of cyber theft related to vaccine development as “absurd.”“Because everyone knows that China is in a leading position in the research and development of new coronavirus vaccines, we have first-class scientific research personnel, and we do not need to gain a leading position with theft,” Hua said.Chinese companies have moved swiftly to develop a coronavirus vaccine, as countries compete for the prestige and profits that would come with being the first to bring such a product to market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-it-s-not-trying-to-replace-us-will-fight-back-against-malicious-slander/story-pZareoZASfEE04mExqSUVI.html
17-07-2020||World||Nepal PM Oli changes tack after pressure to quit, asks who will replace me||Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli, who has been hemmed in by his rivals in the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) for weeks, has suggested that his replacement should be from the CPN (Unified Marxist–Leninist) faction of the party. The suggestion, made at his meeting with Pushpa Kamal Dahal on Thursday, is seen as a new effort to drive a wedge between leaders of the rival faction. Dahal, who has been widely seen to be his replacement, is from the CPN (Maoist Centre). The two parties had merged in 2018 to form the Nepal Communist Party.PM Oli, who came to power in a 50-50 power sharing deal with Pushpa Kamal Dahal, renegotiated the agreement in November 2019 that envisaged letting Dahal run the NCP while he continues to hold the reins of the government. But pressure has lately been building on PM Oli from the triumvirate in the communist party - former prime ministers Dahal, Jhala Nath Khanal and Madhav Nepal - to step down.“It is a ploy to split his opposition and get Dahal and Madhav Nepal fighting among themselves. But I don’t think it will succeed. They (Madhav Nepal and Dahal) are determined that the prime minister should first step down,” an NCP leader told Hindustan Times.PM Oli had survived the last rebellion in April-May this year when he picked up a feud with New Delhi over a 80-km road built near Nepal’s border and came up with a new political map. Later when his rivals, who have overwhelming support in the party’s standing committee tried to push him out, he hit back with accusations that they were working at India’s behest to destabilise him.Dahal did reject the charge, even hardened his stand against PM Oli, but ended up slowing down their campaign against the prime minister. There were occasions when PM Oli skipped the meeting of the standing committee where he is in a minority, ostensibly because he wasn’t feeling well, even when the meeting was being held at his official residence.The 44-member standing committee, which last met on July 2, was scheduled to meet at 3 pm this afternoon. But the meeting, the panel’s first in a fortnight, was postponed again at the last minute. It has been rescheduled to meet on Sunday, July 19.Earlier this month, PM Oli’s associates floated the idea that it was meaningless to discuss their differences at the standing committee and PM Oli should try to arrive at an arrangement with Dahal at one-on-one meetings. There had been no meeting ground; PM Oli wouldn’t step down.At his last round of meeting with Dahal on Thursday, PM Oli made the surprise suggestion about his replacement. Some see it as an attempt to buy time for himself, something that he has particularly excelled in over the last few months.People familiar with the discussions within the Nepal Communist Party said one of the possibilities being explored by party leaders was that the PM Oli standoff be referred to the 445-member central committee, which would have the last word.“This could give him more time to work something out but would narrow his options, a party source said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-nepal-s-political-stand-off-pm-oli-in-minority-tries-to-divide-rivals/story-eBUp9HCjNXcVEjZhQRP7iI.html
17-07-2020||World||UN says India has recorded largest reduction in number of impoverished people||About 273 million Indians moved out of multidimensional poverty between 2005-06 and 2015-16, according to a UN report, which noted that India has recorded the largest reduction in the number of people living in this category.The data, released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), shows that 65 out of 75 countries studied significantly reduced their multidimensional poverty levels between 2000 and 2019. Multidimensional poverty encompasses the various deprivations experienced by poor people in their daily lives – such as poor health, lack of education, inadequate living standards, poor quality of work, the threat of violence, and living in areas that are environmentally hazardous, among others. Of the 65 countries that reduced their Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) value, 50 also reduced the number of people living in poverty.“The largest reduction was in India, where approximately 273 million people moved out of multidimensional poverty over 10 years,” the report said.The report said that four countries—Armenia (2010–2015/2016), India (2005/2006–2015/2016), Nicaragua (2001–2011/2012) and North Macedonia (2005/2006–2011) halved their global MPIT value and did so in 5.5–10.5 years. “These countries show what is possible for countries with very different initial poverty levels. They account for roughly a fifth of the world’s population, mostly because of India’s large population,” the report said.MPIT is the Multidimensional Poverty Index estimate that is based on harmonized indicator definitions for strict comparability over time.“Four countries halved their MPI value. India (2005/2006–2015/2016) did so nationally and among children and had the biggest reduction in the number of multidimensionally poor people (273 million),” it said.The report noted that India saw the most people moving out of multidimensional poverty – some 270 million people between 2005/06 and 2015/16. In a footnote related to the number of 273 million people moving out of poverty, the report said that the number of people living in multidimensional poverty in India is based on population data from United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) (2019), which imply a larger number of multidimensionally poor people in 2006; previous estimates were based on UNDESA (2017).The report additionally notes that India and Nicaragua’s time periods cover 10 and 10.5 years respectively, and during that time both countries halved their MPIT values among children. “So decisive change for children is possible but requires conscious policy efforts,” it said.Fourteen countries reduced multidimensional poverty in all their subnational regions: Bangladesh, Bolivia, the Kingdom of Eswatini, Gabon, Gambia, Guyana, India, Liberia, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nicaragua, Nepal and Rwanda.The report stressed that while the new figures released show that before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, progress was being made in tackling multidimensional poverty, that progress is at risk. “Covid-19 is having a profound impact on the development landscape. But this data - from before the pandemic - is a message of hope. Past success stories on how to tackle the many ways people experience poverty in their daily lives, can show how to build back better and improve the lives of millions,” Director of OPHI at the University of Oxford Sabina Alkire said.While data is not yet available to measure the rise of global multidimensional poverty after the pandemic, simulations for 70 countries in the developing world, based on the anticipated impacts of the virus on just two components of the global MPI – nutrition and school attendance – suggests how much impact the crisis could have unless it is addressed.In three scenarios of varying deterioration in which 10, 25 and 50 per cent of people who are multidimensionally poor or vulnerable become undernourished, and half of primary school-aged children no longer attend school, poverty levels could be set back 8 to 10 years. “But even if we look only at the impact on nutrition, if anticipated increases in undernutrition are not prevented or swiftly reversed, the setback could range between 3–6 years,” it said.“Covid-19 is the latest crisis to hit the globe, and climate change all but guarantees more will follow soon. Each will affect the poor in multiple ways. More than ever, we need to work on tackling poverty – and vulnerability to poverty - in all its forms,” Director of the Human Development Report Office at UNDP Pedro Conçeicão said.The data shows that across 107 developing countries, 1.3 billion people—22 per cent—live in multidimensional poverty. The data also reveals that the burden of multidimensional poverty disproportionately falls on children. Half of the 1.3 billion poor (644 million) have not yet turned 18, while 107 million are 60 or older, a particularly important figure during the Covid-19 pandemic. About 84.3 per cent of multidimensionally poor people live in Sub-Saharan Africa. The report also said that 10 countries account for 60 per cent of unvaccinated children, and 40 per cent of children unvaccinated for DTP3 live in just four countries: Nigeria, India, Pakistan and Indonesia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-says-india-has-recorded-largest-reduction-in-number-of-impoverished-people/story-r4zOtASU7znvR0MYIlMpzN.html
17-07-2020||World||Canada to infuse CA$ 19 bn into provinces to generate economic recovery||The Canadian Federal Government will pump CA$ 19 billion into the country’s provinces and territories as part of Safe Restart Agreement aimed at economic recovery with precautions being exercised to prevent another outbreak of Covid-19.Many provinces across the nation have accelerated reopening of various sectors of the economy, but Trudeau said that till the time an effective vaccine against the coronavirus was available “the daily threat of COVID-19 will not disappear.”The “safe restart” programme will focus on preventive measures, including enhanced capacity for testing, contact tracing, and data management and information sharing to mitigate future outbreaks, investments in health care to respond to the pandemic, support for those considered most vulnerable like residents of long-term care facilities, and funding to secure a reliable source of personal protective equipment. Also announced was a temporary countrywide sick leave programme covering 10 days for those who did not have access to it.“As we continue to deal with the impacts of the virus, we are committed to working with the provinces and territories to provide the support they need to help Canadians make it through this crisis. Together, our priority is to keep Canadians safe and healthy, while building a stronger, more resilient Canada for everyone,” Trudeau said in a statement issued by his office. He made the announcement during a media interaction at Parliament Hill in Ottawa. He was joined by Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland who stated that these investments will “help ensure a safe restart” of the “economy over the next six to eight months”, pointing out there was no use pretending that anyone could predict what the scenario will be in that time period. Seven priority areas have been outlined under the agreement.Trudeau said the pandemic had resulted not just in a health crisis but also an economic crisis. “When we talk about the recovery phase, it’s not just about making sure we can detect, control and prevent future outbreaks. It’s also about helping people, businesses and entire communities adjust to our new normal,” he told reporters, according to the outlet CBC.Canada has recorded 8827 deaths so far and over 109,000 confirmed cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-to-infuse-ca-19-bn-into-provinces-to-generate-economic-recovery/story-rpIfAjvmUviWahyehhLIdO.html
17-07-2020||World||After US, India has done most Covid-19 tests, says White House||After the US, which has carried out a record 42 million Covid-19 tests, India has done the second largest number of 12 million coronavirus tests, the White House has said. More than 3.5 million people have tested positive with the coronavirus and 138,000 died in the US. Globally, more than 13.6 million have tested positive and over 586,000 have died. “With regard to (the coronavirus) testing, we’ve done more than 42 million tests. The second-highest number is 12 million from India. We’re leading the world in testing,” White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters at a news conference here on Thursday. The White House was responding to questions related to the coronavirus pandemic in the US. “We have done more than any country in the world on testing; there’s no doubt about that -- 42 million tests. The country with the next highest number is India at 12 million,” McEnany said. This record testing, she said, is in a very stark contrast than the previous administration. CBS is reporting that in 2009 under Obama-Biden, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention abruptly advised states to stop testing for the H1N1 flu and stopped counting individual cases, she said. “Ron Klain, Vice President Biden’s former Chief of Staff said this: It is “purely a fortuity that (H1N1) isn’t one of the great mass casualty events in American history. It had nothing to do with us doing anything right.” This is former VP Biden’s Chief of Staff. It just had to do with luck,” she said. “Contrary to that, this President led the world in testing; led the world in ventilators -- redistributing ventilators for therapeutics; 13 vaccine candidates -- one going into phase three clinical trial. This response has been extraordinary and historic. We didn’t pause testing; the Obama-Biden administration did, and that was a shameful decision,” McEnany said. There has been encouraging news on vaccines, the press secretary said. “Moderna’s vaccine candidate is showing promising signs. They produced a positive, neutral immune response among the 45 participants in the study. This is comparable to what we see in recovered patients. The bottom line is that, so far, we are seeing exactly what you would hope to see in a vaccine. The Moderna vaccine in particular is expected to reach phase three by late July, with 30,000 participants. “On the therapeutics front, I just want to note: A very encouraging Regeneron contract. A USD 450 million contract for a monoclonal antibody cocktail. This is a bioengineered version of convalescent plasma, one of the several therapeutics available to treat Covid-19. It can be used for prophylaxis and treatment. They say they could have up to 70 to 300 thousand doses -- by the end of the summer or early fall,” she said. As such there is encouraging news on the therapeutics front, McEnany added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-us-india-has-done-most-covid-19-tests-says-white-house/story-qX8niE5cXkPzBxt3hA49UN.html
17-07-2020||World||‘Slept on this for too long’: Pompeo calls for global push back against Xi||The time has come for the world to push back against the challenge posed by the Chinese Communist Party, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said as he contended that the US “slept on this threat for too long.” Pompeo also said the Chinese government was aware of human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus before they shared this information with the world.“Countries not only in Southeast Asia but in Asia more broadly, in Europe, have come to understand the threat that the Chinese Communist Party presents. The United States slept on this for too long,” Pompeo told Bill Hemmer of Fox News in an interview on Thursday.“I think they all did too, and I think they’re coming to a joint conclusion that it’s time for the world to make sure that we get this right.“For democracies and freedom-loving people around the world, it is an imperative that we push back against the challenge that the Chinese Communist Party presents to us all,” Pompeo said.He said that for 40 years, successive US administrations just looked the other way and allowed China to trample on America.President Donald Trump said “no more,” he said.The US is going to have fair, reciprocal trade relationships; and it is going to demand that the Chinese Communist Party treat Americans the same way that the US treats people who go there, he said.Hemmer asked Pompeo to comment on claims by Hong Kong-based virologist Dr Yan Li-Meng, who recently fled to the United States, that Beijing knew that the virus could spread between humans three weeks before that knowledge was made public.Pompeo said that “the World Health Organisation itself was co-opted into the same effort to deny the world the knowledge it needed to respond to this threat, to this threat from the virus that emanated from Wuhan, China.” “This is a simple understanding, and President Trump is going to demand that it happens,” he said.“And of course, now too, we’ve seen the virus that started in Wuhan, China cost the globe hundreds of thousands of people and trillions and trillions of dollars, and I believe the world is going to unite to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for having covered this up when they could have prevented so much of this tragedy,” said the top American diplomat. The United States has been the worst-hit country with over 3.5 million coronavirus cases. The country has reported more than 137,000 deaths so far.Pompeo refrained from responding to news reports that there could be a ban on US travel for Chinese party members and their families.“We’re working our way through, under the president’s guidance, about how to think about pushing back against the Chinese Communist Party. You see it in trade, you see it in other economic activity, you see it in diplomatic engagement,” he added.“The rights that we have that the Declaration of Independence set forth, that are in our Constitution, are central to American foreign policy. We have to get that right. We have this deep tradition. It’s under attack,” he said in response to a question.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/slept-on-this-for-too-long-pompeo-calls-for-global-push-back-against-xi/story-d4J4PvKOn650v2zBKsh9iP.html
17-07-2020||World||QUAD is ready but no more free lunches for ASEAN on South China Sea||In September 2007 under the UPA-I regime, India, US, Japan, Australia, Singapore participated in Malabar Naval exercises in Bay of Bengal. This was before the concept of QUAD - US, India, Japan and Australia - was not even born but Chinese Communist Party (CCP) ruled Beijing sent demarche to all four countries and virtually blaming the exercises partners for targeting the Middle Kingdom. With the Indian Left parties badgering the Manmohan Singh regime already over India-US nuclear deal and not willing to earn the wrath of Chinese rulers, the naval exercise concept was dropped like a hot potato by all barring the US. Thirteen years later, India, Japan and Australia are again on the same cross-road with Chinese dragon breathing on Ladakh land borders with India, contesting Senkaku Islands with Japan, openly threatening Australia with trade war, and talking nuke missiles to exercising US navy in South China Sea (SCS).Also Read: Apex China Study Group reviews East Ladakh: Key stand-off points record withdrawalWhile the call on QUAD naval exercises is still to be taken, US Navy following the new maritime policy in SCS has sent a guided missile destroyer into the contested waters at Spratly islands as part of the freedom of navigation operation. USS Ralph Johnson is backed by two super carrier task forces led by USS Ronal Reagan and USS Nimitz, who are exercising in international waters off the Chinese coast.With the Narendra Modi government not a believer in free lunches as the ASEAN regimes, India has rejected the Chinese claims on SCS by calling it a global commons and openly advocated its long held position of freedom of navigation and overflights. Even though the Russian trade to the port of Vladivostok passes through SCS, Moscow has been silent on the SCS issue given its perceived closeness to the Chinese authoritarian state. Australia and Japan have also bilaterally discussed the SCS issue and like ASEAN want America to be at the fore-front. The so-called Tiger economies of ASEAN talk against China behind closed doors to the QUAD but are virtually servile before the Middle Kingdom as they do not have either the political or military heft to challenge China.Also Read: US backs ASEAN on South China Sea, challenges China’s predatory world viewAlthough China is the first to call out any country opposed to its political and military objectives, the same cannot be said in reverse with exception of a few. And this is despite the fact that Beijing cavorts with most repressive regimes in the world like North Korea, Pakistan and lately Iran. It is this unchallenged belief that China today runs roughshod over most of the countries in the world, either through money or muscle power. The Chinese penetration into the democratic world through its US listed companies is a matter of extreme serious concern as is evident to Delhi with Indian Universities signing scores of MoUs with Chinese fronts without even understanding the cultural implications of the move. The story of Chinese infiltration into global telecom sector is so humongous that it requires another article in this paper.Also Read: How PM Modi called China’s bluff in LadakhThe world seemed to be humouring China like an errant child prodigy till the Galwan flare-up took place on June 15. The US, which had decided not to spill any more American blood for global causes, also turned around and threw the SCS gauntlet and challenged the PLA Navy on high seas. While the PLA Navy looks formidable on the paper, China is still to gain expertise on carrier operations as landing a fighter on a moving floating deck in rough seas requires decades of experience. US Navy has it and so has Indian Navy. Also Read: Canada’s Trudeau has exposed China’s attempt at hostage diplomacyThe PLA Navy may have Russian made or copy destroyers but dealing with an Indian submarine in equatorial waters is a different cup of tea. The huge difference between surface and temperatures at sea depth, the refraction causes optical paradox and makes the task of detecting submarines very hard and perilous. To cut the long story short, the PLA Navy is unproven on high seas and the PLA Army has not fought a war since 1979. This holds as much truth as the political fact that the objectives of Chinese communist rulers are totally at variance with the democratic world at large.While the middle-powers like India, Japan, Australia and South Korea have started to rise, it is the democratic world that needs to hold hands together to make China sombre to the global truth. Otherwise, like in 1999 Sci-Fi film, there will be only Mr Smiths left in the Communist matrix.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quad-is-ready-but-no-more-free-lunches-for-asean-on-south-china-sea/story-Vx16PS5BHqYUtXqUWqf3OP.html
17-07-2020||World||Trump administration exempts European students from Covid travel restrictions||Foreign students coming from Europe are exempt from a travel ban the United States imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic, the US State Department told congressional offices on Thursday.The State Department also told lawmakers that it would offer exemptions for some au pairs and family members of visa holders in the United States, according to a memo sent to lawmakers and seen by Reuters.The moves are part of a Trump administration effort to gradually reopen international travel following months of sweeping restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic. President Donald Trump banned travelers from most European countries in March as Covid-19 cases soared in the region before the disease took hold in the United States.The European Union began to allow non-essential travel from a limited number of countries last month, but such travelers from the United States, where coronavirus cases have risen rapidly in recent weeks, remain banned.The US decision to allow European students comes days after the Trump administration agreed to drop a policy that could have forced tens of thousands of international students to leave the United States if their classes went entirely online. The reversal came amid legal challenges by major universities and pressure from business and tech companies.China, Brazil and Iran face similar travel bans, but students from those nations were not included in the US exemptions. Students in European countries who already have visas to study in the United States are exempt from the ban, according to the memo.The State Department also said spouses and children of certain foreign workers coming to the United States could qualify for exemptions, including the spouses of skilled workers with H-1B visas.The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-exempts-european-students-from-covid-travel-restrictions/story-SVPEzv32NWXIjZQlqASpTM.html
17-07-2020||World||Want to do everything possible to keep peace for people of India, China: Trump||US President Donald Trump has said that he wants to do everything possible to keep peace for the people of India and China, according to his spokesperson. Over the past several weeks, the Trump administration has come out in support of India against China. “He (Trump) said I love the people of India and I love the people of China and I want to do everything possible to keep the peace for the people,” White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters at a news conference here on Thursday. She was responding to a question on Trump’s message to India, which recently had a standoff with China in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control. Earlier in the day, White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow described India as a great ally, saying President Trump is a great friend of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that India has been a great partner of the US. “India has been a great partner… They are an important partner of ours. I have a great relationship with my foreign minister counterpart. We talked frequently about a broad range of issues. We talked about the conflict they had along the border with China. We’ve talked about the risk that emanates from the Chinese telecommunication infrastructure there,” Pompeo told reporters in response to a question. Travelling in Europe, US National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien told reporters that China has been very aggressive with India. O’Brien said that India is a democracy and is a great friend of the United States. Prime Minister “Modi and President Trump have a super relationship,” he said. “In fact, it was the last foreign trip that I took with the president before the COVID-19 crisis hit, was to India, and we had a great reception of the Indian people there. We have a lot in common with them, we speak English, we’re democracies. We’ve got a growing, very strong relationship with India,” O’Brien said. Welcoming the White House statement, Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, said that unlike his predecessor, President Trump has come out openly in support of India. “Most of the Indian-Americans have observed that every earlier president - be it a Democrat or Republican, like Clinton or Bush Senior or Bush Jr or Obama have been very scared to side with India openly, for fear of hurting China. “Only President Trump has had the courage to say that… I love India, America respects India… US stands with India - and that also, to over one billion Indians in India at the Namaste Trump rally held in India… and that too… near India’s neighbour China,” Mason said in a statement. “And he is consistent in his love for India and Indian-Americans,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/want-to-do-everything-possible-to-keep-peace-for-people-of-india-china-trump/story-9mujv19CKeDl9dEqKUA9ZO.html
17-07-2020||World||WE Charity controversy: Trudeau’s finance minister to be investigated||The controversy over a contract to a charity with ties to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his family has become more complicated with the revelation it could have earned more than twice what was originally stated, and the country’s Ethics Commissioner launching an investigation into the Finance Minister in connection with this issue.WE Charity which was given the contract to administer a nearly one billion dollar programme was originally stated to be in line for a payment of CA $ 19.5 million, but that amount could have touched CA $ 43.53 million if it achieved certain targets. This was revealed by Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth Bardish Chagger while being questioned by the House of Commons Finance Committee, one of two Parliamentary panels looking into the matter.The country’s Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion had earlier announced that Trudeau’s links to the WE organisation will be investigated in this regard given that his mother, brother and wife have made appearances paid for by the WE organisation’s organs. Now, Dion has launched an investigation into Finance Minister Bill Morneau since one of his daughter’s was employed with WE and another volunteered with them. Trudeau has already apologised for not recusing himself when the Cabinet took a decision to give the contract to WE. The contract was cancelled after the furor over Trudeau’s connection to WE exploded.However, Chagger, an Indo-Canadian Minister, said that she had not been directed by Trudeau’s office to arrive at the agreement with WE nor had she personally held discussions in this regard with either Trudeau or Morneau. She stated that a bureaucrat “made a clear recommendation that WE Charity was the organization that was able to deliver this program in the timeline that was needed.”The Parliamentary committees examining the matter have also sought Trudeau’s appearance but the Canadian PM has yet to confirm he will do so, as he faces an ethics investigation for the third time, with the prior two having resulted in finding him in violation of Federal norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-charity-controversy-trudeau-s-finance-minister-to-be-investigated/story-HnEPPTUcBQUMHs2IqE7cJO.html

The Taiwan-Hong Kong Services and Exchange Office will closely monitor the development in Hong Kong,” a council official told DW.During 2019 protests, nearly 6,000 Hong Kongers moved to Taiwan, a sharp increase compared to the previous year, according to Taiwan’s immigration agency.Renowned Hong Kong bookseller Lam Wing-Kee is a Hong Kong immigrant who came to Taiwan in April 2019.Since then, he reopened his bookstore, Causeway Bay Books, in Taipei, and has been vocal about the drastic changes that have been taking place in Hong Kong.“Certain books written by pro-democracy figures are viewed as banned books in Hong Kong and raising a piece of white paper during a protest can be deemed illegal under the national security law,” Lam told DW.

17-07-2020||World||UN designates Pakistan Taliban leader Noor Mehsud as global terrorist||The United Nations on Thursday (local time) designated Pakistan based terror organisation Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan’s leader, Mufti Noor Wali Mehsud, as a global terrorist.The United States Security Council 1267 Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee added Mehsud to its ISIL (Da’esh) and Al-Qaida Sanctions List.Mufti Noor Wali Mehsud was listed pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 4 of resolution 2368 (2017) for “participating in the financing, planning, facilitating or perpetrating of acts or activities by, in conjunction with, under the name of, on behalf of, or in support of” entities associated with Al-Qaida. The United States has welcomed the development.“Welcome news that the @UN has added Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan leader Noor Wali Mehsud to its ISIL & AQ sanctions list. TTP is responsible for many deadly terrorist attacks in Pakistan. The United States domestically designated Noor Wali as a terrorist in September 2019,” State SCA tweeted.TTP, also known as Pakistan Taliban, is responsible for carrying out multiple suicide bombings, and have killed hundreds of civilians. TTP was earlier designated as Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) by the Department of State.Noor Wali, also known as Mufti Noor Wali Mehsud, was named the leader of TTP in June 2018 following the death of former TTP leader Mullah Fazlullah. Under Noor Wali’s leadership, TTP has claimed responsibility for numerous deadly terrorist attacks across Pakistan, according to the US State Department. Last year in September, The United States had domestically designated Mehsud as a terrorist.This comes as another blow to Pakistan which has been repeatedly called out by the world community for supporting the terrorist groups. Pakistan has been under the FATF radar for its complicity towards terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) among others.Last year, the United Nations designated Jaish-e-Mohammed chief, Masood Azhar as a “global terrorist”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-designates-pakistan-taliban-leader-noor-mehsud-as-global-terrorist/story-9yK4GCFfgnIH46CWwfBQNO.html
17-07-2020||World||Brazil’s Covid-19 tally crosses 2 million; death toll at 76,000||A thousand deaths a day. Since late May, three months after Brazil’s first reported case of the coronavirus, it has recorded more than 1,000 daily deaths on average in a gruesome plateau that has yet to tilt downward. On Thursday evening, the federal health ministry reported that the country had passed 2 million confirmed cases of virus infections and 76,000 deaths. Even as cases wane somewhat in the biggest and hardest-hit Brazilian cities, the virus is peaking in new locations across the largest country in Latin America. Experts blame denial of the virus’ deadly potential by President Jair Bolsonaro and lack of national coordination combined with scattershot responses by city and state governments, with some reopening earlier than health experts recommended. An interim health minister untrained in the field is presiding over pandemic response. Bolsonaro himself is sick with Covid-19 after repeatedly flouting social distance recommendations and undermining local leaders’ restrictions on activity. Brazil’s roughly 7,000 Covid-19 deaths in each of the last seven weeks is equal to several airplanes packed with Brazilians crashing every day, former health minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta told The Associated Press. “People have become callous,” Mandetta said. “When you say, ‘Yesterday there were 1,300 deaths,’ people say, ‘OK, then it didn’t go up. It was 1,300 people the day before, too.’” Brazil’s nearly 2 million cases is second only to the United States and experts believe the number to be an under count due to widespread lack of testing. A model created by professors from several Brazilian academic institutions, based on the number of confirmed deaths, estimates Brazil has had 10 million infections. “The virus would have been difficult to stop anyway. But this milestone of 2 million cases, which is very underestimated, shows this could have been different,” said Dr. Adriano Massuda, a health care administration specialist and professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a Sao Paulo university. “There’s no national strategy for testing, no measures from the top, ... too little effort to improve basic care so we find serious cases before they become too serious, no tracking.” The virus has begun reaching cities and states previously spared, offsetting declines elsewhere. The number of deaths has been ebbing in states including Rio de Janeiro and Amazonas, where people were buried in mass graves in the capital, Manaus. In the last two weeks, 10 of Brazil’s 26 states and its Federal District saw increases, with two southern states’ average daily death tolls doubling. Bolsonaro has consistently downplayed Covid-19’s severity, saying strict social distancing measures that sacrifice jobs and income will ultimately be more harmful than the virus itself, and calling on supporters to encourage their local leaders to lift restrictions on activity. Many mayors and governors have struggled to hold the line. In Ribeirao Preto, a city in Sao Paulo state, protesting shopkeepers on Wednesday demanded they be allowed to reopen. They surrounded the mayor’s car as he left City Hall, punching his windows and cursing at him. Campinas, a city of 1.2 million people closer to the state’s capital, adopted quarantine measures early, but succumbed to political pressure and reopened commerce on June 8, said Pedro de Siqueira, a Campinas city councilman. The city center swarmed with shoppers like an overturned anthill, he said in an interview. Two weeks later, the number of Covid-19 deaths had roughly tripled to 253, as did the number of confirmed cases, to 6,324. Intensive-care beds refilled with patients, prompting the mayor to reinstate restrictions on commerce on June 22, but allowing offices and churches to continue operating. “Campinas reopened prematurely and erroneously, supported by the state government,” Siqueira, who is also a public health physician, said at the time. “This reopening was so catastrophic that Campinas had to step back, but did so only partially.” Since then, Campinas’ number of cases and deaths has doubled once more. On Wednesday, the city extended restrictions until July 30. Daniel Soranz, a researcher at state-run biology institute Fiocruz’s national health school, said Brazil’s center-west that includes the agricultural heartland will be the last region slammed by the virus. And, looking at deaths from severe respiratory insufficiency, it appears Brazil as a whole has begun turning the corner, he said. “By the end of August, we should be at a much better place than today,” Soranz said. In Sao Paulo, Brazil’s most populous state with 46 million residents, the number of deaths has stabilized at a level slightly below its peak. At one of the capital’s cemeteries on Wednesday, Michelle Caverni buried her 88-year-old aunt, who died of Covid-19 and also suffered from pulmonary emphysema. The same day a friend of Caverni’s buried her 57-year-old mother. She also died of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-s-covid-19-tally-crosses-2-million-death-toll-at-76-000/story-C3GFjXH2dRWYWXQOLKhimK.html
17-07-2020||World||Russia accused of stealing Covid-19 vaccine research||The US, UK and Canada have accused Russia of trying to steal coronavirus vaccine research as the pandemic surges across the world, with Brazil announcing it has surpassed two million confirmed cases.The virus has killed more than 585,000 people, infected more than 13.6 million and crippled the global economy since emerging late last year, and the world’s hopes have turned to a vaccine to end the onslaught.In the latest positive sign, British media reported on Thursday that an Oxford University trial had shown its prototype vaccine generated an immune response against the virus.But hours later, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre said a hacking group called APT29 had targeted British labs conducting vaccine research to “steal valuable intellectual property”.The agency said it was “almost certain (95%+) that APT29 are part of the Russian Intelligence Services” and its targeting of researchers was “highly likely (80-90%)” to “collect information on COVID-19 vaccine research”.The US, UK and Canada all accused Russia in a joint security advisory.Moscow denied any involvement, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying: “Russia has nothing to do with these attempts.”The dispute came as the need for a vaccine was underscored once more with Brazil, the second hardest hit country in the world, passing the bleak milepost of two million coronavirus cases. The number of deaths recorded in the country are now over 76,000.‘Horrible experience’Experts say the true case load in Latin America’s largest economy, home to some 209 million people, could be understated by as much as a factor of ten and fatalities as much as twofold. Like the US, which has the world’s biggest epidemic by far, Brazil is led by a populist leader, Jair Bolsonaro who has downplayed the virus and railed against restrictions.Bolsonaro was himself diagnosed positive a week ago.The United States has recorded by far the most deaths and infections in the pandemic, setting a record on Wednesday with more than 67,000 new cases in 24 hours.Florida is the country’s new epicentre, and is shaping up as a key battleground in a partisan-tinged fight playing out nationally over reopening schools in the fall.US President Donald Trump meanwhile has been escalating a conflict with Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease specialist, but has so far stopped short of firing the scientist from his coronavirus task force.Fauci’s warnings on the dangers of reopening states too fast are at odds with Trump, who has placed his re-election hopes on declaring victory over the virus and jumpstarting the economy.South Asia new epicentre?While the virus runs rampant across the US and Latin America, the Red Cross warned that South Asia is fast becoming the next epicentre.India is on course to hit one million cases in the coming days and the 125 million people in the impoverished Bihar state, neighbouring Nepal, started a new 15-day lockdown on Thursday.“We have not faced such a situation in my life before, it is really a horrible experience,” housewife Radhika Singh said in Patna, the capital of Bihar, where all schools, clubs, temples and non-essential businesses were ordered closed.Governments in many other countries have been forced to reimpose restrictions as COVID-19 refuses to fade, including Spain, which has locked down a northeastern area as it fights more than 120 active outbreaks.Spain honoured its more than 28,000 virus dead at a solemn state ceremony joined by bereaved families and top EU and World Health Organization figures on Thursday.Elsewhere in Europe, Germany’s federal and regional governments agreed on tougher, more localised lockdowns to contain fresh outbreaks.France meanwhile said it will make mask-wearing compulsory in indoor public spaces from next week after an uptick in infections.In Italy, the first European country to lock down, the official death toll topped 35,000. In north Africa, Algeria is planning a law to protect health workers after an increase in “physical and verbal attacks” since the country’s outbreak began, as it registered another record number of daily cases.On Monday, the director of a hospital around 125 kilometres (78 miles) southeast of the capital jumped out of a window to escape the angry family of a patient suspected of having died from the COVID-19 disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-accused-of-stealing-covid-19-vaccine-research/story-tIheVl9ECp3gmkBiQOkJEK.html
17-07-2020||World||New US travel restrictions may target China’s Communist Party||President Donald Trump is weighing a sweeping travel order banning members of the Chinese Communist Party and their relatives from entering the United States, according to news reports that citied officials. The New York Times reported the order could target a narrower group of the 25 members of the politburo or a wider list that includes members of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and state-owned enterprises.The potential presidential proclamation, which was likened to the controversial 2017 Muslim travel ban that targeted citizens from certain Muslim-majority countries, was said to be in the draft stage. Trump could still reject it as a final decision is yet to be taken.If approved, the proclamation will use the same statute in the Immigration and Nationality Act, which was used by the administration to bring in the Muslim travel ban.The proclamation will be a marked escalation in tensions between the two countries, with the US announcing a slew of punitive measures against China in recent weeks, targeting it over Uighur Muslims, a new security law in Hong Kong, and the handling of the coronavirus disease pandemic.Earlier on Thursday, China said it will stick to the Phase 1 trade deal it had reached with the US earlier this year, but warned it will respond to “bullying” tactics and hit out at Washington over its actions targeting Huawei.Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying also invited secretary of state Mike Pompeo to come to China and visit the Xinjiang region to see that there are no human rights violations, responding to US sanctions over abuse of Uighurs living there.Asked whether the recent US sanctions would impact the trade deal, Hua said China hopes it can still be implemented. “We always implement our commitments but we know that some in the US are oppressing China and bullying China,” she said. “China must respond to the bullying practices by the US side; we must say no, we must make responses and take reactive moves to it.” Hua slammed the US clampdown on Chinese telecom giant Huawei as “dirty play”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-us-travel-restrictions-may-target-china-s-communist-party/story-mfFnHXRea8pKWvfq1SmhbI.html
17-07-2020||World||UK frowns at opposition to new Hindu temple in Pakistan||The Boris Johnson government has expressed concern over opposition in Pakistan to the construction of a new Hindu temple in Islamabad and has raised the issue of freedom of religion or belief with the country’s authorities at a senior level.Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, speaker of the Punjab assembly, is among several elements who have opposed the proposed Shri Krishna temple after the Imran Khan government allocated Rs 100 million for its construction. They contend that it is against the spirit of Islam.Tariq Ahmad, minister in the Foreign Office, told crossbench peer David Alton, who raised the issue in the House of Lords, that the government is in contact with Hindu community groups in Pakistan and is monitoring the situation closely.Ahmad said: “We are concerned by any comments which suggest that there should be restrictions on Freedom of Religion or Belief (FoRB)… We engage at a senior level with the Pakistani Government on our concerns about FoRB and the mistreatment of religious and ethnic groups”.“Our High Commission in Islamabad frequently engages with the Hindu community to understand their needs. I raised our concerns about FoRB and the protection of minority religious communities with Pakistan’s Human Rights Minister, Dr Shireen Mazari, on 5 June”.“The UK High Commissioner to Pakistan raised our concerns about FoRB with Pakistan’s Human Rights Minister on 8 June. We will continue to urge the Government of Pakistan at senior levels to guarantee the fundamental rights of its citizens, regardless of their belief, in accordance with international standards”.Alton, a former Liberal Democrats MP from Liverpool and now a member of the House of Lords, asked the government what assessment it had made of the statement by the Punjab assembly speaker opposing the temple.“(What) representations they intend to make to the government of Pakistan about (1) the obligations under Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and (2) the freedom of religion or belief”, he asked.Besides opposition from Elahi and religious groups, the row over temple construction has also reached Pakistan’s courts. A partially built boundary wall as part of the temple construction has reportedly been demolished.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-frowns-at-opposition-to-new-hindu-temple-in-pakistan/story-zpAKv94NUVzcHHWJWMUnkM.html
17-07-2020||India||Durga Puja organisers frame norms on how to hold week-long festival amid Covid-19||With less than 100 days remaining for Durga Puja – Bengal’s biggest festival – the state’s only forum of puja organizers has drawn up detailed guidelines on how the festival may be held by maintaining social distancing norms despite the Covid-19 pandemic.The list of dos and don’ts includes reducing the size of pandals and idols so that they could be sanitized, restricting the number of pandal hoppers to 25 at a time, less of decorative lighting to discourage crowding at night and allowing food stalls in pandal premises sans any seating arrangements among others.“We can’t predict what the situation would be like in October-end, but puja would be held for sure. The question is whether the week-long festival can be organized with pomp and grandeur as it provides livelihood to lakhs of people. We are being optimistic and have prepared the guidelines with the presumption that the festival will be held,” said Saswata Basu, general secretary of the Forum for Durgotsab and general secretary of one of the big-budget pujas in north Kolkata.Out of the 4,500-odd community pujas held in the city, the forum has under its banner more than 370 of the most prominent and biggest pujas, including the ones that are patronized by some senior ministers of the ruling Trinamool Congress government Even Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was apparently keen on organizing the festival this year despite the Covid-19 pandemic. Lakhs of people hit the streets every day during the festival hopping from one pandal to another. “Durga Puja is coming. We have to organize it. For that we have to stay fit from now,” she had said on Wednesday while addressing local clubs to ensure that every citizen wears masks so that the virus could be checked.This year Durga Puja begins on October 22 and ends on October 26. Mahalaya, an occasion that usually precedes Puja by a week, falls on September 17 this year. “The 17-point code prepared by the forum also calls for offering only whole fruits to the goddess, less of interior decoration and more airy pandals which can be seen from outside, thermal guns and sanitizers to be kept at pandals. No visitors would be allowed without wearing a face mask,” said Partha Ghosh, a member of the forum’s executive committee and general secretary of one of the prominent pujas in south Kolkata. The forum members will soon approach the state government with the proposed guidelines but believe that it has already reached the Chief Minister as she had expressed her keenness on organ sing the festival a day after the guidelines were circulated among the members of the forum.“It is too early to say and forecast anything on how the situation could pan out in October-end. Situations are evolving very fast and Covid-19 cases are rising,” said a senior official of the state health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/durga-puja-organisers-frame-norms-on-how-to-hold-week-long-festival-amid-covid-19/story-VR9csRIP1QHT1JCAJZVrJM.html
17-07-2020||India||SC, high court nod for demolition of Telangana secretariat building complex||The Telagana government’s plan to demolish the existing secretariat building complex in Hyderabad cleared all legal hurdles on Friday with both Supreme Court and state high court dismissing the public interest litigation petitions challenging the demolition.In the morning, the Supreme Court dismissed the petition filed by Congress MLC T Jeevan Reddy challenging the demolition of the old secretariat buildings and construction of new official complex in their place at a cost of around Rs 500 crore.The apex court made it clear that the construction of the secretariat was a prerogative of the state government and it would not interfere in the policy matter. “The verdict comes as a slap on the faces of those who are opposed to the construction of a new state-of-the-art integrated Secretariat complex,” an official release from the chief minister’s office said.In the afternoon, the state high court also gave the green signal for the demolition of the existing secretariat buildings by dismissing a PIL filed by activists P L Vishweshwar Rao and Cheruku Sudhakar.A division bench of the high court comprising chief justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and justice B Vijayasen Reddy did not agree with the argument put forth by the petitioners that the government had not taken the environmental clearance from the Centre for demolition of the secretariat buildings.The petitioners argued that the demolition was causing huge environmental pollution, posing threat to the lives of the people in the present coronavirus pandemic situation.On behalf of the central government, assistant solicitor general N Rajeshwar Rao submitted an affidavit to the court stating that the state government did not require prior environmental clearance to demolish any buildings, but required permissions only for new constructions.Telangana state advocate general B S Prasad submitted to the court that the state government would take all necessary permissions while taking up construction of new buildings.The division bench, which heard both the arguments, agreed with the assistant Solicitor General that there was no need for clearance from the Union environment ministry and upheld the decision taken by the state cabinet.While giving the approval to the government to go ahead with the demolition of the secretariat buildings after taking all the permissions, the high court bench, however, cautioned the authorities to continue the works keeping in view the prevailing Covid-19 situation in the city.The new secretariat complex is expected to cost Rs 500 crore and will be equipped with state-of-the-art connectivity and other features.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-high-court-nod-for-demolition-of-telangana-secretariat-building-complex/story-PAicdRSz9tsvcMMjwSZVML.html

He reminded that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had proposed to construct a state-of-the-art multi-storeyed hospital complex in place of the existing old structure.“He had personally visited the hospital and observed that the century-old structure was in a dilapidated state, posing danger to the patients. But the same opposition parties, who are now raising a hue and cry over rainwater entering the hospital premises, had stalled the proposal,” Rajender said.The minister said the demolition of the old building was stonewalled by environmentalists and heritage conservationists as a result of which the proposal was dropped. “We had no option but to continue the hospital in the same building after undertaking some repairs,” he said.Rajender explained that the rainwater had entered into OGH premises due to a block in the storm water drain connecting Begum Bazar with Musi passing beneath the hospital building. “We have cleared the block and are now finding a permanent solution to see that the problem does not recur,” he said.PCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy held the chief minister responsible for the pathetic conditions at the OGH. “The submergence of wards, especially during the time of the Covid-19 pandemic, reflects the attitude of the KCR government towards public health,” he said.He said the estimates and blue print for construction of a new building in the same OGH complex at a cost of Rs 500 crore have been pending for approval since 2017. “The chief minister should drop the plan for demolition of the state secretariat complex and start constructing a new building for the OGH while protecting the heritage structure,” he said.BJP’s official spokesman K Krishna Sagar Rao said the inundation of OHG with rain and sewerage water reflected the mis-governance and criminal negligence of the TRS government.“It was true that the opposition parties and many civil society organizations obstructed the demolition of the 110-year old heritage building, but the BJP had neither objected nor would ever object, if the state government were to build a new building elsewhere for relocation of Osmania General Hospital,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-blame-game-over-flooding-of-osmania-general-hospital-begins/story-v6ZnIsurDFafqkxsgsBgRM.html
17-07-2020||India||Air India defends decision to implement leave without pay, calls it a ‘win-win’ one for staff||Defending its decision to implement ‘leave without pay’ (LWP) for its employees due to the Covid-19 pandemic, national carrier Air India on Friday referred to its scheme as a ‘win-win situation’ for both parties. It said that the while the scheme on the one hand gives freedom to its employees to engage themselves with another employer for the said period, the airline is able to save its cash flow on the other hand.This comes after the national carrier was flooded with letters of criticism from its employees from all sections.The airline said that in a challenging financial situation, it is taking recourse to several initiatives with a view to ensure that its flight operations continue. The LWP scheme was introduced on Tuesday and according to the airline enables employees to avail the benefits of proceeding on leave without pay on voluntary basis. “It has been introduced for grant of leave without pay and allowances for permanent employees for a period of six months/two years, which is extendable upto 5 years,” the airline stated. Recalling previous instances, Air India said that it had brought out similar LWP schemes in September 1998, in June 2009 and in August 2009 and employees had availed of the LWP scheme. However, this time the addition in this scheme as compared to the earlier LWP scheme is that the airline management can pass an order requiring the employees to go on compulsory leave for a period of six months to two years, which is extendable upto five years.The airline spokesperson said, “In the wake of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, there may be employees who are unable to attend their office duties in person on account of personal reasons. The LWP scheme enables employees to take a break from their office responsibility for a defined period of time with the approval of the management, while retaining their employment with the company. They will continue to avail facilities such as passage, medical and housing at specified rates.”As on April 2020, Air India had over 14,000 employees that included around 1,800 pilots and around 4,000 cabin crew. Justifying the scheme, the spokesperson also said that the LWP scheme provides opportunity to employees to take up alternative employment with the approval of the management during the period of the said leave. “The LWP scheme is a win-win situation for both the management as well as employees as it provides flexibility to employees and simultaneously reduces the wage bill for the company. The Covid-19 outbreak has very seriously impacted the aviation sector and currently, the airline operations of the company are a small fraction of the prior Covid-19 level operations,” said a senior AI official. Disagreeing with the management, a senior airline official said, “LWP scheme is to save money for the company not a weapon to settle scores with employees. This is going to affect the livelihood of many. Why doesn’t the airline make every employee of AI take LWP a few days every month? This way the burden can be shared. The motive of the top management is to save their money by snatching money from lower employees.” The airline, however, assured to use the scheme sparingly and with complete fairness, and said that the selected names of employees that can be sent on mandatory LWP will be implemented after assessing their performances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-defends-decision-to-implement-leave-without-pay-calls-it-a-win-win-one-for-staff/story-lTa8Kksic8tpTJfUAdIC7I.html
17-07-2020||India||PM Modi calls for ‘new type of human-centric globalisation’ at UN event||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday pressed member states of the United Nations to use the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic to reform the global multilateral system to enhance its relevance and effectiveness to make it the basis for a “new type of human-centric globalisation”.The United Nations was born 75 years ago to deal with the “furies” of the Second World War, the prime minister said addressing a high-level meeting of the UN Economic and Social Council. “Today the fury of the pandemic provides the context for its rebirth and reform. Let us not lose this chance.”As an incoming member of the UN Security Council, India will play its role in full support of the UN agenda, “with our deep commitment to maintaining global harmony, to improving socio-economic equity, and to preserving nature’s balance”, the prime minister in his virtual speech in English.This was the first time Modi had addressed UN members after India’s thumping victory in the June 17 election to the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member for a two-year term starting next January. India will get into the UNSC loop for documents and papers starting August, purely in an observer capacity to prepare it for its upcoming term.India has called for reforming the global multilateral system to reflect the changed realities of the contemporary world. It has campaigned for the reform of the UN Security Council to expand its permanent membership with a seat for itself. And it has also sought the reform of the IMF and other global bodies to make them more contemporaneous.“Today, while celebrating 75 years of the United Nations, let us pledge to reform the global multilateral system to enhance its relevance, to improve its effectiveness to make it the basis for a new type of human-centric globalisation,” Prime Minister Modi said renewing India’s call for reforms with an added emphasis on people, to make them more “human-centric”.The theme of the High-Level Segment of the ECOSOC, on the 75th Anniversary of the founding of the UN, was ”Multilateralism after COVID19: What kind of UN do we need at the 75th anniversary”. It was in tune with India’s continued for the reform of the UN system and priorities for the upcoming term at the Security Council: ’reformed multilateralism’ in a post-COVID-19 world. India had held the inaugural Presidency of ECOSOC (Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar, in 1946), and Prime Minister Modi had delivered the keynote address virtually at the 70th anniversary of ECOSOC in January 2016.In his Friday address, PM Modi recalled India’s support to the ECOSOC and the UN’s developmental work, and how they are tied to India’s own domestic agenda. “Today, through our domestic efforts, we are again playing a salient role in achieving Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals. India is also supporting other developing countries in meeting their Sustainable Development Goals,” he said.The prime minster went on to say, India’s motto of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas, Sabka Vishwas” resonated, for instance, with the core SDG principle of leaving no one behind. And he spoke at length efforts made in India to expand access to sanitation, bring about gender parity in elementary and higher education, and empowering women through financial inclusion.Modi said it was India health care system that had helped it fight the Covid-19 epidemic. India had the best recovery rate in the world, as a result, he added.On fighting climate change, the prime minister spoke of India cutting 38 million tonnes of carbon emission annually and went on to highlight its role in the setting up of the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure.Modi also spoke about India’s role in the region as a “first responder”. India has extended medical and other assistance to over 150 countries in the fight against Covid, and had set up a SAARC Covid emergency fund for the neighbourhood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-un-event-pm-modi-calls-for-new-type-of-human-centric-globalisation/story-vMI2uGlhp4N5RjuaWh0izJ.html

The ITBP has its presence on forward posts in Badahoti and Mana Pass.Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat agreed to the requests and committed to work in coordination with ITBP for realization of the above stated objectives, according to an ITBP official.Officials in Uttarakhand CM’s office, who did not wish to be named, said that Rawat has cleared Rs 10 crore under chief minister border areas development project while instructing officials to ensure the state complemented the national developmental schemes for the region.“The CM told officials that creation of infrastructure and facilities will help in stopping migration from border areas. He added that stopping it was important from the point of view of the country’s security,” the officials quoted above said.Several defense and strategic experts have recently spoken about the need for increasing human settlements and tourism activities in border areas which could act as the second line of defense.The chief minister also instructed officials to urgently draft a project to provide power connection to ITBP posts in remote border areas in the state. He said the Central government will be requested to help set up mobile towers in these regions for uninterrupted communication. He also instructed the Dehradun district magistrate to make available 15 acre land for setting up of ITBP’s frontier headquarter, added officials.Chief minister assured ITBP DG that the government will make effective moves to increase people’s access to remote areas apart from taking measures to stop their migration.For promotion of adventure tourism in the area, the CM asked for creation of a working group including ITBP and state tourism officials that could work in tandem with the winter tourism cell of the state. The officials added that ITBP chief pointed out that civilian settlements in border areas become a big source of convenience for the forces. He underlined the fact that neighbouring countries have developed access to areas on their side of the border and India, too, should grant increased access using inner line permits. Currently permits are issued only for grazing of cattle in grasslands in these areas.The shepherds and herders are considered the second line of defence in parts of the border district and are crucial to the internal security.Last month, there were reports of the Chinese objecting to the efforts on the Indian side to improve infrastructure in the Lipulekh area near the border. Nepal, too, has raised objections to the new road to the Lipulekh pass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/itbp-chief-meets-uttarakhand-cm-with-second-line-of-defense-in-border-areas-in-mind/story-FCwmtE3BTWnohz0MLwJ2pM.html
17-07-2020||India||Stage set for Australia to be part of next Malabar exercise with India, US, Japan||The stage is set for Australia to be part of the next Malabar naval exercise conducted by India with the US and Japan, with people familiar with developments saying the wargame’s expansion will complement growing strategic and security cooperation among the four countries.The people, who spoke on condition of anonymity, indicated Australia’s inclusion in the trilateral exercise is only a matter of time, given burgeoning security and defence ties between New Delhi and Canberra. The next edition of Malabar, already delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, is set to be held by the end of the year.However, the formal invitation to Australia is expected to be extended after some time in view of the delicate negotiations between India and China on disengagement and de-escalation to end their standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the people said. They noted there is still some time to go for holding the exercise.It has also become clear that Australia will join the exercise if it is formally invited, one of the people cited above said.When India and the US initially sought to expand the Malabar exercise in 2007 by inviting Australia, Japan and Singapore to participate, the move had not gone down well with China. That was the first and only time Australia joined the naval drills, which were begun in 1994 to increase interoperability between the Indian and US navies and enhance cooperative security relations between the two sides.China has also been wary of the Quadrilateral security dialogue or Quad that was revived in late 2017 by India, the US, Australia and Japan, and these suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level last year.At a virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his counterpart Scott Morrison last month, India and Australia elevated their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership and signed the crucial Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA) for reciprocal access to bases, medical and training facilities, spares and fuel.In light of these developments, experts say inviting Australia to join the Malabar exercise will be a welcome step. Rear Admiral (retired) Sudarshan Shrikhande, a military affairs expert, said the Quad is getting greater traction from member countries in the face of China’s growing belligerence in the western Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean and Himalayas.“We shouldn’t be worried about China’s sensitivities. We should be mindful of our own interests. Beijing doesn’t care for anyone’s sensitivities,” he said.The people cited above noted that defence and security forms a key part of the India-Australia relationship and both have zeroed in on the joint goal of promoting peace, security, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. The bilateral AUSINDEX naval exercise, started in 2015, has also grown in complexity, and the third edition held last year was a “very complex” drill involving warships, submarines and aircraft from both sides.“This type of exercise indicates a very high level of comfort in operating together,” said another person who declined to be named.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said: “China sees such developments about the Malabar exercise as the four countries ganging up against it. But it is the Chinese who have given us a strong reason to include Australia in this exercise.“Besides, if the China factor doesn’t propel the four countries to come together, I don’t know what else will propel them to work more closely together in the region.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stage-set-for-australia-to-be-part-of-next-malabar-exercise-with-india-us-japan/story-bkfdSV0Vyk9qdoOIU6ztvO.html

Today, the fury of the pandemic provides the context for the rebirth and reform of the United Nations. Let us not lose this chance.”At the global forum, PM Modi emphasized that in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, India’s grass-root health system has helped the country to ensure one of the best recovery rates from the viral infection in the world, despite reporting a large number of daily coronavirus cases.The Prime Minister said a lot had changed since the formation of the global peace keeping body, and at the same time the UN now brings together 193 member countries and along with its membership, certain expectations from the international organisation have also grown and raised hopes among member countries.His address was the first since India was unanimously elected as a non-permanent member of the powerful Security Council last month.PM Modi also urged for increasing the UN’s relevance, its effectiveness, and to make it the basis of a new type of human-centric globalization.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/multilateralism-with-reformed-un-at-its-center-can-meet-human-aspirations-pm-modi/story-Nb4Mnb1CVkFmlJM17npmCJ.html

We are mindful of our weight and responsibility. We know that if India succeeds in achieving its development objectives, it will go a long way in achievement of global goals. And so we have taken ‘whole-of-society’ approach- by engaging our States, our local governments, our civil society, communities and our people,” the PM said. UN general assembly had adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 to be achieved by member nations by 2030.“India also contributed to shaping the ECOSOC agenda, including the Sustainable Development Goals. Today, through our domestic efforts, we are again playing a salient role in achieving Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals.

In two areas, Poonthura and Pulluvila, community transmission has happened” said the CM.He said in Poonthura when 50 people were tested randomly, 26 tested positive, while in Pulluvila, 28 out of the 57 tested were found to be positive.The CM’s Kerala admission came on a day when the state reported another highest single-day spike of 791 new cases, taking the total infections so far since January 30 to 11,066. Of the infected, 6, 029 are active cases while 4,971 have recovered. The state has reported 40 deaths so far.Community transmission means that the disease is in its third stage and the source of its origin is not known. It is now present in the community and can infect people with no history - either of travel to or contact with infected people and areas. At this point, everyone is susceptible to catching it.Experts also say that in random testing, if more than half of the people test positive, then it can be called a community transmission.Kerala increased testing for the coronavirus disease only recently, but even now its rate is one of the lowest in the country. Till date, it has done less than four lakh tests while neighbouring Tamil Nadu and Karnataka have reported triple the number.The state has tested 16,642 samples in the last 24 hours, said the CM on Friday.The chief minister also announced that triple lockdown will be imposed in coastal hamlets from Saturday to check further spread of coronavirus infection.“The coastal belt is facing a dire situation with the disease spreading very fast. We need to mobilise all our resources to deal with the situation,” he said. Of the new cases reported on Friday, 532 were through local transmission, the CM said during his evening briefing.“The number of locally-transmitted cases is increasing by the day because of negligence on the part of people. Going by the trend, one assessment is that disease control can only be achieved by the end of this year,” he said.As many as 1.78 lakh people are under observation, while 6,124 are in various hospitals, including 1,152 admitted on Friday.There are 285 hotspots in the state as of now.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-kerala-cm-confirms-community-transmission-of-covid-19/story-zGoyjgiUYmP521n0xKLTCM.html

17-07-2020||India||Karnataka CM rules out extending lockdown in Bengaluru as Covid-19 cases spiral||With Covid-19 cases in Bengaluru continuing to spiral - despite the state government imposing a week-long lockdown which began on July 14 - several leaders including BBMP Mayor Goutham Kumar of BJP and Congress working president Eshwar Khandre have sought an extension of the lockdown. Both of them said that the lockdown should be extended at least for two weeks to contain the current rapid spread of the virus.On Friday, Karnataka recorded 3,693 new Covid-19 cases taking the tally to 55,115 including 20,757 discharges and 115 deaths. Bengaluru recorded yet another day of more than two thousand cases in a single day taking the total active cases in the city to 20,623. The number of active cases in the capital city is nearly two-thirds of the total number of active cases in the state.Bengaluru Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao also earlier in the day had tweeted that he would undergo home quarantine for a period of four days before undergoing his fifth Covid-19 test in the last three months after his driver tested positive for the virus.However, Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa who met ministers-in-charge of the eight zones of Bengaluru regarding Covid-19 management immediately ruled out an extension of the lockdown in the capital. “That (lockdown) is not a solution to contain Covid-19 and there is no such proposal to extend lockdown in the city,” he clarified.At the meeting with cabinet colleagues and officials, the CM directed them to remove all obstacles in the admission of infected people to hospitals. He also directed them to ensure the availability of treatment to Covid-19 as well as non- Covid-19 patients in private hospitals according to government guidelines.Meanwhile, JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy said that the government should immediately step in and address the demands of around 2000 contract Ayush doctors who have threatened to resign if their demands are not met. The Ayush doctors who are working on contract say that they are being paid Rs 20,000 a month against allopathic doctors who are being paid Rs 60,000 a month. The government has said that it is looking into their demands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-cm-rules-out-extending-lockdown-in-bengaluru-as-covid-19-cases-spiral/story-70nfjGINscSH3dpvSLuaOP.html

Like Lodhi, Savitri Devi is a first-timer legislator in the state assembly. She represents Nepanagar (ST) state assembly seat in Burhanpur district, according to the state assembly secretariat.Though Lodhi joined the BJP after quitting from the state assembly and was immediately appointed chairman of Madhya Pradesh State Civil Supplies Corporation by the BJP government in the state, there is no information about Savitri Devi’s next move.Also Read: In Rajasthan tangle, Congress names central minister, 2 FIRs filedState assembly principal secretary AP Singh confirmed the Congress MLA’s resignation.“MLA Sumitra Devi from Nepanagar (ST) state assembly constituency submitted her resignation at 3 pm today.

Thus, the assembly seat has fallen vacant,” said Singh.Despite efforts, the MLA couldn’t be contacted for her comments.

That’s why they are trying to create such a situation that even after BJP loses in the bypolls, it could still maintain the majority in the House on the basis of the effective strength of the state assembly.”State BJP media in charge Lokendra Parashar said, the party was aware that Savitri Devi had resigned from the state assembly and added that she has not joined the BJP.-Ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-mp-mla-quits-congress-says-bjp-insuring-against-losing-bypolls/story-J4K2ZoGdxKRwdcwiWRXw0I.html

17-07-2020||India||Supreme Court rejects plea, clears deck for new Telangana Secretariat||The Telangana government’s decision to build a grand, state-of-the-art Secretariat got a boost on Friday after the Supreme Court refused to hear a PIL questioning the decision as a waste of public money.The High Court for the state of Telangana situated at Hyderabad had dismissed a bunch of PILs on the same issue on June 29. One of the petitioners – senior Congress leader T Jeevan Reddy, approached the apex court against the HC verdict.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, SK Kaul and MR Shah found the High Court to be right in dismissing the petitions. It said, “The reports quoted by the High Court say there are several deficiencies in the buildings. We would not like to interfere.”For the petitioner, senior advocate Satyam Reddy argued that the existing buildings of the Secretariat intended for demolition are set in more than 25 acres. “These buildings were constructed in the years from 1966 to 2012. Two blocks constructed in the year 2012 are state-of-the-art buildings having a life span of 70 years. The new Secretariat will cost more than Rs 1,000 crore which will amount to wastage of public money.”Reddy submitted that on the one hand the state government has claimed of not having enough money to pay salaries of employees and pensioners and yet was willing to spend lavishly on such projects.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta who appeared for the Telangana government informed the Court that the High Court had decided the petitions on merit and nothing was left to be decided by the apex court. The bench too was satisfied that the HC had examined all aspects and there was nothing remaining for further judicial review.The total constructed area in the present Secretariat building is 9,16,681 square feet and the North Block and South Block of the Secretariat were constructed in 2012 over an area of more than 1,40,000 square feet. The Secretariat Complex served the undivided Andhra Pradesh and after the bifurcation continued to serve as the common Secretariat for the states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The decision to have a new Secretariat complex was the brainchild of Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. In 2016, the state government proposed to construct the building in Secundrabad. But the proposal was shot down by the Centre as the project plan was on defence land. On June 18, 2019, the state Cabinet decided afresh to construct a new Secretariat complex at the existing premises by demolishing the present buildings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-rejects-plea-clears-deck-for-new-telangana-secretariat/story-5bfh1BgyjOFAqx2jLJRQjN.html
17-07-2020||India||Jaishankar responds to 9 barbs from Rahul Gandhi on Twitter, then hurls his dart||Foreign Minister S Jaishankar on Friday delivered a sharp comeback to Rahul Gandhi after the Congress leader accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of “blunders” that he said “had weakened India”. Jaishankar responded to the barbs, one by one, in 9 tweets. The minister’s 10th tweet was his counteroffensive.In the 10th tweet, Jaishankar reminded Rahul Gandhi that he appeared to have glossed over Pakistan in his video message.“And #Pakistan (that you skipped) surely notes the difference between Balakot & Uri on the one hand, and Sharm-el-Sheikh, Havana & 26/11 on the other. Ask yourself,” Jaishankar said, his counterpunch to the Congress leader.The reference to Balakot and Uri are a reference to the 2019 airstrikes at a terror camp in Pakistan’s Balakot after the Pulwama bombing and the surgical strike at terror camps across the line of control after a terror attack on soldiers in Uri in 2016.Jaishankar’s tweet compared these two instances of cross-border action against terrorists to the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks - that went unpunished due to the lack of political will by the UPA-1 leadership - and the two agreements signed by the Congress-led UPA government with Pakistan in 2006 and 2009 which, many strategic experts had contended, weakened India’s position. .@RahulGandhi hs questions on Foreign Policy. Here are some answers:•Our major partn’ships are strongr & internat’l standng higher.Witness regular summits&informal meetngs wth #US #Russia #Europe & #Japan.India engages #China on more equal terms politically.Ask the analysts. https://t.co/GPf17JWSacIt was in the 2006 Havana joint statement that India, for the first time, recognised Pakistan not just as a perpetrator of terrorism but also a victim. In a newspaper article back in 2006, Ajit Doval, now the National Security Adviser, had then described the joint statement as India’s “first strategic setback in the fight against terrorism”.At another meeting three years later, PM Manmohan Singh agreed to let Pakistan slip in a reference to terrorism in Balochistan in the joint statement issued after his 2009 meeting with Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani in the Red Sea Resort of Sharm El-Sheikh.“Both leaders agreed that the two countries will share real time credible and actionable information on any future terrorist threats… Prime Minister Gilani mentioned that Pakistan has some information on threats in Balochistan and other areas,” the joint statement said. From Pakistan’s perspective, it was seen to imply that India had a role in violence in Balochistan.Jaishankar, responding to Rahul Gandhi’s attempt to fault the government’s foreign policy, said India’s major partnerships are stronger and international standing higher than before. This is why India has regular summits and informal meetings with the US, Russia, Europe and Japan. “India engages #China on more equal terms politically,” Jaishankar said, adding that he could check with the analysts for more.On Rahul Gandhi’s criticism over China, Jaishankar - who was a career diplomat before joining the government - said the government speaks its mind more openly now than it did in the past, alluding to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, Belt and Road Initiative, South China Sea and on UN-sanctioned terrorists.The government, Jaishankar continued, was also addressing the border infrastructure imbalance legacy, pointing that the budget on border infrastructure had gone up by 280% between 2014-20 and 2008-14, road building by 32%, bridges by 99% and tunnels by 6 times. On Rahul Gandhi expressing concern over Sri Lanka giving a port to the Chinese, Jaishankar reminded him that the Hambantota Port agreement between #SriLanka and China was concluded in 2008. “Ask those who dealt with it,” Jaishankar said in his riposte.India had transformed ties with Maldives that had been in a difficult phase because India had watched President Nasheed being toppled in 2012 when the UPA was in power.“A settled land boundary (2015) with #Bangladesh; opens path to more development and transit. And terrorists no longer find safe haven there. Ask our security,” he said. On Nepal, Jaishankar kept the focus on improving people to people ties. “Nepal after 17 years is getting Prime Ministerial visits. And a swathe of developmental projects: power, fuel, housing, hospital, roads, etc. Ask their citizens,” he said, before going to refer to better relations with Bhutan and Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-responds-to-9-barbs-from-rahul-gandhi-then-a-crisp-counteroffensive/story-wM9vIw5EE7vQnoZEekjJIP.html
17-07-2020||India||Sachin Pilot’s petition is not maintainable says Rajasthan speaker: All details here||Speaker of the Rajasthan assembly has told Rajasthan High Court that Congress rebel Sachin Pilot’s petition questioning the Tenth Schedule of constitution pertaining to the anti-defection law cannot be entertained since it may render all related judgments of the Supreme Court useless if allowed.Senior advocate and Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who is representing speaker C P Joshi, also argued that his client was within his remit while taking into account dissidents’ speeches and activities even outside the House to decide a disqualification petition. He made the arguments while asking the court to allow Joshi to join the proceedings in the case filed by Pilot and his associates. Sachin Pilot and his team, represented by senior advocate Harish Salve, have questioned the anti-defection law and if it can be applied on incidents outside the assembly, alleging that permitting so would allow its misuse by political parties against elected members. Pilot’s legal argument also cites infringement of freedom of speech if such a wide berth is allowed for action against elected representatives. Singhvi argued that the Speaker’s consideration of “allegations of speech and activities outside the House” is not mala fide and within the contours of the Constitution. He claimed that assembly speakers across state legislatures have done so in a manner consistent with the Tenth Schedule and in cases “identical” to the current one.The core legal debate in the case revolves around the application of the Tenth Schedule of the constitution which has been challenged by Salve.Also Read: Congress suspends Sachin Pilot camp’s Bhanwar Lal Sharma, Vishvendra Singh from party over leaked audio tapesSinghvi, however, argued that the challenge to its constitutionality was not maintainable.“If the challenge to constitutionality of the Tenth Schedule is allowed, all judgments of the Supreme Court [including the landmark decision in Kihoto Hollohan (1992)] would be rendered useless by the High Court. Their argument is unsupported by law and is based on implausible leaps of imagination,” he submitted to the court.On the issue of sufficient notice period, Singhvi argued that a decision on this is the sole prerogative of the speaker of the house. He elaborated that there is no “constitutionally prescribed period” for the notice period and it is merely “directory” in nature and therefore it can’t be claimed as a matter of Constitutional right.Singhvi also stated that it was “bizarre” for the defendants to oppose the speaker’s application for becoming a party to the case since he is the decider of the proceedings of disqualification.“It is bizarre that the Petitioners oppose such addition. It is done with an obtuse intention of preventing the Court from questioning the maintainability of the Petition, which he would’ve done,” Singhvi argued in the court.19 MLAs were served notices for disqualification on Tuesday and given time till Friday to reply. The notices were served on the recommendation by Congress chief whip who accused Pilot and 18 other MLAs of anti-party activities citing they had failed to attend two Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meetings, held on Monday and Tuesday and given alleged anti party statements.The Pilot camp, however, argues that a party whip applies only when the assembly is in session.The arguments will resume when the court reconvenes on Monday. The matter is adjourned to July 21 for further hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachin-pilot-s-petition-is-not-maintainable-says-rajasthan-speaker-all-details-here/story-jHxZzXGkLfSNrFCeIFlGAI.html

Made to wait at the gates, the cops were finally allowed to enter the hotel.Earlier today, the Special Operations Group (SOG) of the Rajasthan Police registered two first information reports (FIRs) against two incriminating audiotapes in which a Congress lawmaker is purportedly talking to a middleman and a person named Gajendra Singh about toppling the Ashok Gehlot-led government.The FIRs were registered on the basis of the complaint filed by Mahesh Joshi, the Congress chief whip of the Rajasthan assembly, after audiotapes surfaced on Thursday evening and went viral on social media amid the political turmoil in state. The Congress has repeatedly accused Sachin Pilot of being in cahoots with the BJP to topple the state government.In another development, the Rajasthan High Court on Friday asked assembly speaker CP Joshi to hold off on action against Sachin Pilot and the 18 lawmakers who were issued disqualification notice this week. The court, which was hearing Pilot’s challenge to the disqualification notice, will resume hearing the case on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-police-team-not-allowed-to-enter-haryana-hotel-where-sachin-pilot-rebels-are-camping/story-FX2ZkG1iV9Y94OLpHp3LJM.html

The note, which has been issued by his PS Sushil R. Gaikwad on June 25 and accessed by Hindustan Times, states that the minister had taken cognizance of “officers visiting his residence without being called” and “officers entering his chamber without his permission or being called for”.The note further adds that Naik “desires that decorum be maintained at his office and residence”. “Officers will visit the residence only when called to attend official work, if any,” states the note. “Whenever the RRM (Rajya Raksha Mantri or MoS defence) is in office, officers are expected to (be) seat(ed) in their respective chairs. They will enter RRM’s chamber only when called, with prior permission.”It also states that “not all officers are required to attend meetings with the RRM”. “They will attend meetings only at the instruction of the RRM, otherwise they are expected to remain seated in their office,” states the note. According to officials in the ministry, this is an internal matter for the office of the Minister of State and not an umbrella policy. “Keeping in mind the need for social distancing in the wake of the Conid-19 pandemic, the instructions have been issued,” an official in the Defence Ministry said. “The RRM wants to minimize contact due to the pandemic.” Last month, defence secretary Ajay Kumar had tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/visit-home-only-when-called-junior-defence-minister-in-note-to-officers/story-B5EDyGlukWzme4M7qP7uPO.html
17-07-2020||India||P Varavara Rao: NHRC issues notice to Maha, seeks health report within two weeks||The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has taken cognizance of a complaint filed by Maja Daruwala, special monitor, NHRC, about the deplorable health condition of P Varavara Rao (81), an acclaimed Telugu poet and social activist and an accused in the 2018 Elgar Parishad case.The commission on Friday issued notice to the state chief secretary, Sanjay Kumar, and SN Pandey, the director-general (DG), prisons, Maharashtra, and directed them to submit a report about Rao’s health condition within two weeks after the undertrial tested Covid-19 positive a day ago.The complaint mentioned that Rao is suffering from multiple old-age-related health complications and also tested Covid-19 positive on Thursday, which has further aggravated his condition.NHRC observed that the right to life and medical care are one of the basic human rights. The commission said the onus is on the state to provide to a prisoner, who is in its custody, appropriate medical care in a bid to ensure that there is no danger to his life.NHRC has also directed the state government to constitute a medical board to examine Rao’s health condition and ensure that the treatment being provided to him is appropriate.The commission has said the board is required to decide whether Rao should be admitted to a government-run or private hospital that could provide him the best possible treatment.Pandey denied receiving any notice from NHRC.Meanwhile, Rao’s bail plea could not be heard by Bombay high court (HC) on Friday due to lack of time.His lawyer R Sathyanarayan said that he would move a praecipe for the bail plea to be heard on an urgent basis on Monday.Rao had moved the HC appealing against the order of the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court, which had rejected his interim bail application on June 26.Rao had sought interim bail on the grounds of failing health and susceptibility to Covid-19 amid the viral outbreak in Maharashtra’s prisons and correctional homes.On May 28, Rao was taken to Sir JJ Hospital after he had lost consciousness. Later, he was discharged on June 1.At that time, the family members had alleged that he was hurriedly discharged in a bid to obstruct his bail plea before the special (NIA) court, a fear that came true on June 26.On July 13, Rao was again admitted to Sir JJ Hospital after his health condition worsened and he showed signs of delirium.On Thursday, he was shifted to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)-run St George’s Hospital, whose healthcare facilities are few and far between, after he tested Covid-19 positive and amid the protestations of his family members.The NIA, which had taken over the Elgar Parishad case from Pune Police in February, had opposed the bail plea, as Rao was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, where there is no provision to grant him temporary bail.NIA had submitted that the jail authorities could be directed to ensure that Rao was provided proper medical attention, whenever required.Earlier, on January 1, 2018, violence erupted between Dalits and Marathas near the village of Bhima Koregaon in Pune district, where thousands of Dalits had gathered to mark the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Koregaon.In that battle, the British Army’s Dalit Mahar soldiers had defeated the Brahmin Peshwa rulers of the Maratha empire.The commemoration took place a day after an event in Pune called the Elgar Parishad was held.The Pune Police conducted a preliminary probe and claimed that the violence in Bhima Koregaon was the result of speeches made at the Elgar Parishad event.They alleged that banned Maoist groups organised the event, and a first information report (FIR) was also filed.In June 2018, the Pune Police arrested five activists and lawyers from Pune, Nagpur, and Delhi – Surendra Gadling, Mahesh Raut, Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, and Shoma Sen – for their alleged links to the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist), and also for organising the Elgar Parishad event.In August 2018, the police arrested four more activists – Sudha Bharadwaj, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, and Rao.While Gautam Navlakha and Dr. Anand Teltumbde were arrested on April 14 this year, taking the total number of the accused in the case to 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/p-varavara-rao-nhrc-issues-notice-to-maha-seeks-health-report-within-two-weeks/story-cwiaoXxkkPoKPFJia5fwoL.html

The members of the group, who made a video of the incident, also wrote “Jai Sri Ram” on his scalp.After the video made by the group went viral on social media, Nepal’s ambassador Nilamber Acharya spoke to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath on Friday and raised the matter of ensuring the safety and security of all Nepalese citizens in the state, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.“We have raised the matter with authorities in India. People’s safety is important,” one of the people cited above said, without giving details.The people said Nepal’s envoy was given an assurance about the safety of Nepalese citizens in the country. The two sides also agreed such matters shouldn’t have an impact on bilateral relations, they said.Oli sparked a controversy with his recent remarks that the “real” Ayodhya is in Nepal and that Lord Ram was Nepalese. He had also said Nepal had “become a victim of cultural encroachment” and its history was manipulated.“Although the real Ayodhya lies at Thori in the west of Birgunj, India has claimed the Indian site as the birthplace of Lord Ram,” Oli was quoted as saying by the media.The Nepal government subsequently clarified Oli’s remarks reflected the many myths about Lord Ram and highlighted the need for further research on the “vast cultural geography” of the Ramayana. It also clarified the remarks “are not linked to any political subject” and there was “no intention at all to hurt the feeling and sentiment of anyone”.The controversy came close on the heels of a border row between India and Nepal, which erupted after New Delhi opened a new road to Lipulekh on the Tibet border and Kathmandu published a new map showing Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepalese territory.Meanwhile, police in Varanasi have registered a first information report (FIR) against Vishwa Hindu Sena chief Arun Pathak, who acknowledged in a Facebook post that members of his group had tonsured the Nepalese man over Oli’s remarks.Vishwa Hindu Sena had also put up posters in Varanasi that said Nepal’s prime minister should stop “acting at the instance of China”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-envoy-raises-safety-of-citizens-with-up-cm/story-iD01hG0MGtDfHL0GorzhyN.html

Hailing from Osmanabad in Maharashtra, the young man revealed that he had travelled nearly 1200-odd kilometres to meet a girl from Shah Faisal town in Karachi, Pakistan.Siddiqui Mohammad Zishan had befriended the girl on Facebook and both of them had been in constant touch on social media via Facebook and Whatsapp. He wanted to go to Pakistan and had tried to use Google Maps for navigation, the young man said. He was found by BSF personnel in a dehydrated condition and revealed that he had fainted while trying to cross the Rann of Kutch. An ATM card, and other documents like Aadhaar and PAN card helped the security personnel to identify him.During the search operation, the BSF found a bike which the youth had abandoned when he reached close to the border. He had used the bike to travel from his hometown in Maharashtra. The young man was apprehended about 1.5 kilometres away from the Indo-Pakistan international border based on information shared by the Crime Branch of Maharashtra Police. The Maharashtra Police had informed the Gujarat Police about a missing complaint that had been lodged by the parents of the youth.

17-07-2020||India||Rajasthan HC asks speaker to hold off on action against Sachin Pilot, 18 Cong MLAs; to resume hearing on Monday||Two judges of the Rajasthan High Court on Friday asked assembly speaker CP Joshi to hold off on action against Sachin Pilot and the 18 lawmakers who were issued disqualification notice this week. The court, which was hearing Pilot’s challenge to the disqualification notice, will resume hearing the case on Monday.The interim order of the high court came minutes before the deadline set by speaker CP Joshi’s office for responding to the notice was to expire.Sachin Pilot’s group had on Thursday challenged the disqualification notice under the anti-defection law, contending that they hadn’t done or said anything that would indicate that they were parting ways from the Congress.In their writ petition, the legislators argued that they had neither given up their membership of the House nor did their failure to attend the two Congress legislature party meetings make them liable for disqualification on the grounds of defection. The Pilot camp termed the notices under the Tenth Schedule a way to stifle their “freedom of speech” and to impose the “majoritarian views of the party on them”.Forty two-year-old Pilot, credited with leading the Congress’ successful 2018 assembly election campaign, has categorically ruled out joining the BJP, asserting that attempts to link him to the opposition party were a ploy to tar his image. If the rebel MLAs are disqualified, the majority mark in the 200-member assembly will come down, making it easier for chief minister Ashok Gehlot to win a floor test. In another development, the Special Operations Group (SOG) of the Rajasthan Police has registered two first information reports (FIRs) against two incriminating audiotapes in which a Congress lawmaker is purportedly talking to a middleman and a person named Gajendra Singh about toppling the Ashok Gehlot-led government.The SOG is also investigating another case related to sedition against two persons, who have been arrested, on the basis of intercepts of two mobile phones that pertain to an alleged bid to oust the Gehlot government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-court-asks-speaker-to-hold-off-on-action-against-sachin-pilot-18-cong-mlas-to-resume-hearing-on-monday/story-7Cm5uONNxaTqR01kMd2jAN.html

The announcement has come a day after 199 Covid-19 positive cases were reported across the state taking the total number of coronavirus cases to 3,982. Rawat said, “The number of cases of the virus has increased in the last few days, which is a matter of serious concern. The only way to curb it is by creating a gap and as a result, we have decided to implement state-wide lockdown on Saturday and Sunday.”For Coronavirus Live UpdatesHe, however, said that guidelines for the same would be decided in a high-level meeting later on Friday.“We would soon issue the guidelines for it, which will include who would be allowed to enter the state and who would be not. The decision to implement the weekend lockdown is also important as it was also the demand of our trader community that markets should be allowed to open for only five days,” said Rawat.The chief minister specified that the decision applied only to this week and fresh assessment of the conditions and the necessary containment measures will be made on a weekly basis.“The decision for the next week would be taken in the next meeting,” said Rawat. Also Read: Staff absent from work to be retired, says Uttarakhand; calls it routineEarlier on Thursday evening, Rawat held discussions with chief secretary and secretary health regarding the spike in cases and had directed them to take necessary actions to curb it.

17-07-2020||India||Cop killed gangster Vikas Dubey ‘in defence’, UP police tells SC, claims encounter was genuine||Uttar Pradesh government has refuted the allegations that Kanpur gangster Vikas Dubey and five of his associates were killed in staged encounters in its detailed reply submitted to the Supreme Court on Friday.UP police maintained that Vikas Dubey was killed in an encounter when he opened fire at the special task force team which was pursuing him when he attempted to escape while being taken to Kanpur from Ujjain.In its affidavit filed before Supreme Court on Friday, the Uttar Pradesh government said that the vehicle in which Dubey was being brought to Kanpur overturned when it tried to avoid hitting a herd of cattle which was crossing the road.“All the four police persons in the vehicle got seriously injured and lost consciousness. Accused Vikas Dubey snatched a pistol from Inspector Rama Kant Pichauri and escaped through the backdoor of the police SUV,” the affidavit said.The STF team reached the spot and a team led by DySP TB Singh pursued Dubey. Dubey then fired indiscriminately at STF.“In defence, the STF fired six shots at Vikas Dubey. Three shots hit him. He was then rushed to the hospital where he was declared dead”, the affidavit said.Also Read: ‘Who should we reward for catching Vikas Dubey?’ UP Police ask MP PoliceThe Supreme Court had indicated on Tuesday that a judicial probe could be ordered into the killings while it asked the Uttar Pradesh government to submit its response to a bunch of petitions demanding an independent investigation into the matter.The police’s claim has been contested widely, with experts alleging that their version was unconvincing. Politicians, former police officers, and rights groups have demanded a probe in Dubey’s killing and also of five others linked to Dubey, who were killed between July 3 and July 9.The Supreme Court had also set up a judicial probe in the Telangana encounter case earlier this year and it said on Tuesday that a similar approach could be undertaken in this case. It even asked the petitioners to suggest the composition of the judicial inquiry committee to probe the encounters.However, the three judge bench headed by the chief justice of India (CJI) Sharad Arvind Bobde had ruled out monitoring of the probe.The matter was posted for hearing on Monday, by when the UP government has been asked to file a status report in the case.The SC bench is hearing three petitions including one by Ghanshyam Upadhyay, a lawyer, who had filed a petition before Dubey was killed fearing he will be ‘eliminated’ like his accomplices.Anoop Prakash Awasthi, another petitioner, has sought a probe into the alleged police-politician-gangster nexus behind Dubey and his gang members’ killings. He has alleged the state police consider themselves to be above the law and hence “their excesses” in this case should be subject to a court-monitored probe either by central agencies or a panel headed by a retired judge.Dubey and his men were hunted down within a span of seven days in an intense operation by Uttar Pradesh special task force after eight policemen, including DSP Devendra Mishra, were killed in an ambush laid out allegedly by Dubey and his men in Bikru village of Kanpur. The police team had gone there to arrest Dubey in another case, when they were trapped and killed by a hail of bullets fired by the gangsters’ men. Some of the policemen’s bodies were even mutilated after they died.The STF nabbed Dubey in Ujjain, where he was spotted by locals at the famous Mahakal temple. He had reached there after giving police the slip in Haryana’s Faridabad. Police claim he snatched the revolver of a police officer before fleeing after the road accident in Kanpur on July 10. They claim that when cops tried to catch him alive, he opened fire at them, forcing retaliatory fire from the cops, in which he received fatal injuries.The opposition has alleged that Dubey was killed to cover up a gangster-police-politician nexus in Uttar Pradesh.Dubey and five alleged members of his gang have so far been gunned down in separate encounters in Kanpur, Hamirpur and Etawah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cop-killed-gangster-vikas-dubey-in-defence-up-police-tells-sc-claims-encounter-was-genuine/story-96otuADFTSSfXpvu6cNE4M.html
17-07-2020||India||Election Commission to hold meeting with political parties from Bihar today||The Election Commission will be meeting political parties from Bihar this afternoon via video conferencing. The development follows after a host of parties from the state, in a joint letter to the poll body, underlined the concern among the electorate and the parties that the Bihar “poll exercise does not become a super spreader event”. They highlighted that the coronavirus cases in the state saw an “alarming exponential surge”.“It is safe to assume that there are many more infected people who are either asymptomatic or have not yet been tested in the state, making their public movement a risk for others around them. It is also projected that infections would cross a million in Bihar by the tentative election schedules in October-November,” the parties argued in the letter and urged upon the EC to review if polls can be held in such a situation.On Thursday, the EC said it has decided not to notify the law ministry’s amendment to the Representation of People Act, 1951, that would have allowed those over the age of 65 to use postal ballots in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections. The move was welcomed by political parties.The commission cited “the field situation and logistics of operationalization” as the rationale behind its decision to not allow postal ballots.The Bihar assembly lapses in November this year and chief election commissioner Sunil Arora had told Hindustan Times in an interview on June 27 that state elections will be held when they are due.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-commission-to-hold-meeting-with-political-parties-from-bihar-today/story-X4gwokNzlB7GKLkrtiIpeL.html

This will be the third consular access to Jadhav.Confirming the development, Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said that they have agreed to India’s demand to not have a security personnel during the meeting.However, Qureshi said that the Indian officials who came to meet Jadhav on Thursday left without hearing him out. “[Jhadav] kept asking the Indian diplomats to talk to him and they left,” claimed Qureshi.Also read | It’s a farce: MEA on Pak claim that Kulbhushan Jadhav refused to file review petitionCalling the behaviour of the officials “astonishing”, Qureshi said that if the Indian diplomats didn’t want to talk to Jadhav, why did they ask for consular access.“They had objected to the glass that had been placed in the middle so we removed it. They had also objected to audio and video recordings so that was also not done. We fulfilled all their requests, but still they left,” said the Pakistan foreign minister.New Delhi had accused Islamabad of breaching its assurance of providing unimpeded access to Jadhav during the consular access.On Thursday, Pakistan provided consular access to Jadhav for the second time since he was detained in March 2016. But when two Indian consular officials went to meet him, they found Pakistani officials with “an intimidating demeanour” near Jadhav and a camera being used to record the conversation, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said.Also read | ‘Obstructive and insincere’: India roasts Pak after meeting Kulbhushan JadhavThe Indian officials met Jadhav to discuss filing a review petition in Islamabad high court against his death sentence by the deadline of July 20, and required privacy to talk about the matter.“The consular officers could not engage Jadhav on his legal rights and were prevented from obtaining his written consent for arranging his legal representation,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.“In the light of these circumstances, the Indian consular officers came to the conclusion that the consular access being offered by Pakistan was neither meaningful nor credible. After lodging a protest, they left the venue.”Meanwhile, the spokesperson of Pakistan’s foreign office Aisha Farooqui reiterated the country’s offer to file an appeal in the Islamabad High Court against Jadhav’s conviction and subsequent death sentence by a military court.The statement added that Pakistan remained committed to fully implementing the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) judgement of July 17, 2019. “It is hoped that India will cooperate with the Pakistan court in giving full effect to the said judgement.”Consular access to Jadhav was first provided in September 2019, while his mother and wife had been allowed to meet him in December 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-offers-third-consular-access-to-kulbhushan-jadhav-says-its-official-won-t-be-present-in-meeting/story-RTbmU4756V1Htn2OX4bFNN.html
17-07-2020||India||Staff absent from work to be retired, says Uttarakhand; calls it routine||The Uttarakhand state government has initiated the process for screening employees for compulsory retirement in its various departments. Under the process, all the departments have been asked to give a list of employees who could be asked for compulsory retirement, said officials on Friday.A letter was sent by Vinod Kumar Suman, additional secretary (AS), secretariat administration, to all the additional chief secretaries, secretaries in-charge and heads of the department concerned on the matter to screen the names of employees and give the list to the screening committee for further action, said officials.“In May, a meeting led by the chief secretary was held in which a screening committee was formed and a letter was sent to all the departments for the same,” said an official privy to the development on condition of anonymity.“Under the process, all those employees who are above the age of 50 and are often absent in work due to some reason or the other will be screened out and considered for compulsory retirement. In this process only, a reminder was sent by additional secretary Suman two days ago to all the departments,” said the official.Meanwhile, Suman said that the process has ‘nothing to do with the pandemic’ as it is an annual process being carried out in the state departments.“It is not a new thing and is an annual exercise held in all the states since last about 40-45 years during the month of June-July only. All those employees who remain absent from work in the whole year due to prolonged illness or are not interested in work, are screened for compulsory retirement,” said Suman.He said that ‘usually the numbers in this exercise are very less like two or three only.’“Only those employees are screened out who are not much interested in work or have themselves asked the government for compulsory retirement as per the norms and regulations of the Centre. We have initiated the process and are sure other states are also doing the same. It has nothing to do with the ongoing pandemic,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/retire-those-over-50-and-absent-at-work-says-uttarakhand-govt/story-y9zEfOUDFh77pTnNwze9SL.html

The chief minister’s residence has become the centre of fake audio tapes and defamation of leaders,” he said.“The MLAs who are themselves from the Congress party have refuted allegations but the Congress has tried to drag in central leaders without any basis,” he said.He asked if the government has the numbers, then why these ploys and politics? The SOG and ACB and other agencies are being misused to defame leaders. If they have the guts then why don’t they parade their MLAs? Why not get the entire episode investigated by the CBI?” he said.He said the entire series of events was an attempt by chief minister Ashok Gehlot to save his chair.“It’s strange to see someone flashing a victory sign when one’s own house is crumbling. The BJP is being used as a pawn in what is essentially an internal fight of the Congress. They should worry about their own party instead they are making allegations against the BJP and central leaders,” said Poonia.He also hit out at the state government for being non-existent during the time of the Covid-19 crisis.“At a time when people are reeling under the growing menace of coronavirus, the government is under lockdown in a resort and playing football. This is unfortunate. The entire government machinery has come to a standstill even as the infection is continually rising,” he said.Poonia said it is the people of Rajasthan who have lost out and are feeling betrayed by the Congress whom they had voted to power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-refutes-congress-claim-of-horse-trading-in-rajasthan-says-audio-tapes-are-fake/story-tbOfPgIhabvDtNpWfd9dUN.html

Reports have said Swapna Suresh, the second accused in the Kerala gold smuggling case, called him several times the day 30kg of gold was seized from a consignment addressed to an official of the consular office in Thiruvananthapuram on July 5.There was an attempt to smuggle the gold through diplomatic baggage, which according to the Vienna Convention is not checked by customs officials.Ghosh was rushed to the medical college hospital and doctors said he was out of danger.A senior police official said preliminary reports suggest it may be a suicide bid and that Ghosh is not in a position to record his statement. Police started a search after his last call was traced near his house on the outskirts of the state capital of Thiruvananthapuram.Ghosh’s boss, the UAE consulate attache Rashed Khamis Ali Musaiqri Alshemeli, had slipped out of the country three days ago amid reports he was called back by his country. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has taken over the gold smuggling case and several other central agencies are also probing it.NIA filed a first information report (FIR) on July 10 against P Sarith Kumar, who was arrested by customs officials on July 5, and Swapna Suresh, Sandip Nair and Fazil Fareed, an alleged smuggler from Ernakulum but based in the UAE, and charged them under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). It added the name of an alleged gold smuggler KT Ramees to the FIR on July 15.The Kerala government on Thursday suspended chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s former principal secretary M Sivasankar for violating service rules.Vijayan said the action was taken on the basis of an inquiry report that pointed to lapses on Sivasankar’s part. The inquiry was conducted by a two-member panel headed by chief secretary Viswas Mehta.The senior Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer was removed from the post of the CM’s principal secretary last week after allegations that he was close to Suresh, one of the key accused in the gold smuggling case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-uae-consular-attache-s-missing-gunman-found-with-slit-wrists/story-ttblrZIzpEIeCQle5ZaR5J.html
17-07-2020||India||Assam: Two jail officials arrested in separate cases of sexual assault||Assam Police has arrested two jail officials for their alleged involvement in two separate cases of sexual assaults.In the first case, Mrinmoy Dawka, the superintendent of Tezpur Central jail in Sonitpur district, was arrested on Thursday following complaints of sexual assault by two women.“There were two complaints against the accused. He had allegedly sexually assaulted the wife of an inmate on the promise of releasing her husband. The second case is of him outraging the modesty of the wife of a jail warden,” said Mugdhajyoti Dev Mahanta, superintendent of police (SP), Sonitpur.“The first incident had occurred a month ago and came to light, when the woman disclosed the matter to her husband, who is lodged in the jail. The second incident was more recent,” he added.Based on both the complaints, the police arrested Dawka on charges of criminal breach of trust, assault or criminal force to outrage the modesty of a woman and intercourse by luring inducements under Sections 354 (A), 409 and 376 (C) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Dawka was produced before a court on Thursday and has been sent to judicial custody for five days. Further investigations into both the complaints are on.In the second case, a jailer of the district jail in Dhemaji was arrested on Thursday on charges of sodomising a male inmate with the promise of securing an early release of the latter.“The jailer Dulal Das was arrested following a complaint filed by the mother of an inmate who alleged that her son was sodomised thrice in 2019 by the accused,” said Dhananjay P Ghanawat, SP, Dhemaji.The 20-year-old victim, who’s in jail in connection with a child sexual assault case, was reportedly in trauma due to the assaults and allegedly attempted suicide once.“Because of his mental trauma, the victim is undergoing treatment at the Assam Medical College Hospital in Dibrugarh. We have lodged a case under Section 377 of the IPC for unnatural sex. The magisterial inquiry into the incident has also been ordered,” said Ghanawat.The accused was produced in court on Thursday and was remanded to judicial custody for 14 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-two-jail-officials-arrested-in-separate-cases-of-sexual-assault/story-MwUrLypSmHE77ucj81sU9K.html
17-07-2020||India||Shape up or ship out, Bhubaneswar police commissioner’s sermon to city cops||While governments across states have been trying hard to flatten the Covid infection curve, the top brass of Odisha police has asked the cops in the twin cities of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack to focus on flattening their bellies and bringing down their weight to ward off co-morbidities that increase vulnerability to coronavirus.In a notice to the policemen and policewomen of Bhubaneswar-Cuttack police commissionerate, police commissioner Sudhansu Sarangi has made it clear that cops with high body mass index would be given a chance to get in shape by November failing which they may be given compulsory retirement.“While joining service, our officers receive physical training apart from learning technicalities of the job and are physically fit. But over the passage of time, the training is forgotten and they do not take care of their health. They then suffer from health issues such as high/low blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol. Any person with such comorbid conditions is at a high risk because of Covid-19. We might even see some new kind of virus attack in the future and have to be prepared for any eventuality,” said Sarangi in his notice to over 7,000 policemen of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack.Sarangi said height and weight of all cops will be measured to calculate Body Mass Index. Those with more than 30 BMI would be guided on what measures to follow to have a healthy lifestyle. If by November, a staff’s BMI is still above 30 then they would have to mandatorily attend a six-week refresher course.The commissioner said those who don’t take the order seriously may face a cut in increment and compulsory retirement.Incidentally, in 2017, union ministry of Home Affairs had issued a circular to all the states for making it compulsory for all cops to adhere to the norms of SHAPE – 1, the highest physical fitness standard for cops. As per MHA, SHAPE-1 is an acronym for S – Psychological, H – Hearing, A – Appendages, P – Physical Fitness and E – Eye Sight. The 2017 circular had also clearly advised states not to recommend obese cops for police medals.The Odisha Police Association welcomed the move saying it was necessary, but added that the cops need time to exercise regularly. Referring to the Status of Policing in India Report-2019 by Common Cause and Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, OPA president Satyajit Mishra said about 60 percent police personnel in Odisha work for more than 16 hours and 22 percent work for more than 13 hours a day.“The policemen need enough time. During the lockdown, the work hours of policemen have been very hectic. All policemen want to come back to shape. It’s just that the work burden is way too much,” said Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shape-up-or-ship-out-bhubaneswar-police-commissioner-s-sermon-to-city-cops/story-BWNTTMQ4anmVFhPro8gUXK.html

There are 387 active cases in the state, 153 people have recovered from the infection and three patients have died so far. Until May 23, the northeastern state had remained free from the coronavirus pandemic. Dr L Jampa, the state surveillance officer, said of the new infections, 42 were reported in the Capital Complex Region, seven in East Siang district and three in Upper Subansiri.“The detection of 52 patients is the second-highest single-day spike of Covid-19 cases in Arunachal Pradesh as 75 people had tested positive for the disease on July 15,” he said.Of the fresh patients found in the Capital Complex, two had returned to the state recently and 40 were detected from various areas of the region. The three new patients from Upper Subansiri district also came back to the state recently, Jampa said.Jampa added 35,430 samples have been tested in the state so far.The Capital Complex region, which consists of Itanagar, Naharlagun, Nirjuli and Banderdewa areas, registered 247 cases and is the worst-hit by Covid-19, followed by Changlang with 33 cases and Namsai with 30 infections so far.Jampa also said that seven ITBP personnel deployed at the Advance Landing Ground (ALG) at Pasighat, the East Siang district headquarters, were found to be infected with Sars-Cov-2, the virus which causes Covid-19.The state government has imposed a total lockdown in the Capital Complex Region till July 20 with a view to contain the spread of Covid-19. The state government on Thursday had announced that it will proceed with an extensive sero-survey in the region for tracing the primary and secondary contacts of infected patients, including vulnerable groups. P Parthiban, Arunachal Pradesh’s health secretary, said rapid antigen tests began last week in the Capital Complex region after the state witnessed a spurt in the coronavirus cases. Authorities have conducted 968 antigen and 1,867 ELISA tests in the areas so far.The health department will conduct more such tests and rapid response teams have already been formed for the purpose, Parthiban added.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-52-new-covid-19-cases-arunachal-pradesh-s-tally-reaches-543/story-PcMuJy6y6hqYar3BqVlaAK.html
17-07-2020||India||‘Can’t guarantee to what extent talks will resolve border row’: Rajnath on China||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said that the ongoing negotiations with China should help resolve the border dispute but he couldn’t guarantee to what extent the situation would be resolved, in another confirmation of the complex nature of the military and diplomatic negotiations between the two nuclear powers.Addressing soldiers at Lukung near Pangong Tso during his visit to Ladakh, Singh assured the country that no power in the world could grab even an inch of Indian territory.His comments come a day after India on Thursday said the complex disengagement process with China on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) is specifically aimed at preventing “face-off situations”, and any unilateral attempts to change the status quo on the disputed border won’t be accepted.In his speech, Singh said India had neither attacked any country nor grabbed anyone’s territory. He said India would not tolerate anyone hurting its self respect and would give a befitting reply. He said the country was led by a Prime Minister who was capable of taking strong decisions.The minister is visiting Ladakh two weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an unscheduled visit to the sector on July 3. The PM then declared that the “era of expansionism” is over, sending a strong signal to China about India’s determination to defend its borders.Earlier in Leh, the minister witnessed an exercise by soldiers including some battle drills by troops of the Ladakh Scouts. He was also briefed on the situation including the actual position of the troops on both sides, people familiar with the developments said on Friday.The exercise showcased application of integrated combined force in high altitude terrain with newer generation helicopters and special forces, said one of the officials cited above. A special assault drill by the Ladakh Scouts was also showcased. Chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat and army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane are accompanying the minister.Two days after corps commanders from both sides met at Chushul to discuss the road map for easing tensions on the LAC, the Indian Army on Thursday said complete disengagement is an “intricate process” requiring “constant verification”.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity the statements from the external affairs ministry and the army pointed to difficulties and suspicions involved in the disengagement process, and the need to draw a distinction between de-escalation and New Delhi’s stated aim of restoring status quo ante on the LAC.Singh will also visit forward areas in Kashmir. The military is keeping a strict vigil on the western front to deter Pakistan from fishing in troubled waters and prevent what could turn out to be a two-front conflict, as reported by Hindustan Times on July 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-t-guarantee-to-what-extent-talks-will-resolve-border-row-rajnath-on-china/story-smPDFYKa9ib285QodbVORM.html

The Indian Army had deployed six T-90 missile-firing tanks and top-of-the-line shoulder-fired anti-tank missile systems in the Galwan Valley sector in June. The army’s decision to deploy the T-90 Bhishma tanks was taken after the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had strengthened its positions on the river bed with armoured personnel carriers and troop tents. He also interacted with the personnel of the Indian Army and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) in Lukung post near Pangong Lake where Indian and Chinese troops are in the process of disengagement.“Talks are underway to resolve the border dispute but to what extent it can be resolved I cannot guarantee. I can assure you that not one inch of our land can be taken by any power in the world,” he said.“If a solution can be found by talks, there is nothing better,” he said emphasising on finding a diplomatic solution to the standoff. “Recently what happened between troops of India and China at PP14, how some of our personnel sacrificed their lives protecting our border. I am happy to meet you all but also saddened because of their loss. I pay my tributes to them,” he added. The defence minister will go to Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday.Singh was scheduled to visit Ladakh on July 3 but his visit was deferred. “Leaving for Leh on a two day visit to Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir. I shall be visiting the forward areas to review the situation at the borders and also interact with the Armed Forces personnel deployed in the region. Looking forward to it,” the minister had tweeted in the morning.On July 3, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had made an unscheduled visit to a forward post in Nimu in Ladakh earlier this month and interacted with the troops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-army-rolls-out-t-90-tanks-armoured-vehicles-during-defence-minister-rajnath-singh-s-leh-visit/story-DfJbFcib2UsEW5ILHbQi4J.html
17-07-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi releases video attacking Modi govt, says China’s actions prompted by India’s disruption over 6 years||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi stepped up his attack on the government over Chinese transgressions in Ladakh, claiming that “troubled economy, foreign policy and neighbourhood” prompted Beijing to take an aggressive stand against India.On Friday, Gandhi released a video on the India-China border stand-off in Ladakh as part of his move to share his thoughts on national issues through a series of short and incisive videos.“The question is why have Chinese chosen this particular time to move? Why have Chinese chosen to violate the LAC (Line of Actual Control) with India at this point in time? What is it about India situation that has led China to act in such an aggressive way? What is it about this moment in time that has allowed the Chinese to have the confidence they can move against a country like India?” he asked a flurry of questions to the Narendra Modi-led Central government.“To understand that you have to go into multiple spaces. Countries are protected not by one particular thing but by a confluence of forces, by a confluence of systems. A country is protected by its foreign relationships, it is protected by its neighbourhood, it is protected by its economy, it is protected by the feeling that its people have, the vision that its people have,” he added.Gandhi has been critical of the government on its handling of the border stand-off with China and has repeatedly asked it to come clean on the alleged intrusion by Chinese forces in Ladakh and also on the disengagement process.“And what has happened over the last six years is that in all those areas India has been disturbed and disrupted. And I’ll cover each one of them,” he said.Gandhi attacked the government over its foreign policy and the “soured” relationship with neighbouring countries such as Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bhutan, claiming the ties have become transactional.“Let’s start with foreign policy. Our relationship with the outside world used to be with multiple countries. We had a relationship with America, strategic partnership with America I would say. That is very important. We had a relationship with Russia. We had a relationship with Europe. And these countries used to help us manoeuvre in the world,” he said.“Today, our relationship has become transactional. We have a transactional relationship with the United States. We have disturbed our relationship with the Russians. We have a transactional relationship with Europe,” added Gandhi.Talking about the neighbourhood, he said earlier Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka were India’s friends and except Pakistan, the entire neighbourhood was working and partnered with New Delhi.“Today, Nepal is angry with us. If you go to Nepal and you speak to the Nepalese people they are furious with what has happened. Sri Lankans have given a port to the Chinese. The Maldives is disturbed. Bhutan is disturbed. So, we have disrupted our foreign partners, we’ve disrupted our neighbourhood,” the Congress leader claimed.He also took on the government over economy and unemployment amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.“Now let’s come to the economy. Our pride, something that India used to go to the rest of the world and talk about and boast about. We have the worst economic growth in 50 years no end in sight, absolute disaster. Unemployment is the highest in 40-50 years. So, our strengths have suddenly become our weaknesses,” he said.Gandhi said his party had repeatedly urged the government to inject money into the economy and announce a financial package for the small and medium businesses, but no action was taken.“We told the government that look, please realise that we are becoming vulnerable. All these things are connected. They’re not separate. When you look at a nation you have to look at all these factors and you have to act, taking into account all these factors,” he said.“We told them to listen; for God’s sake inject money into the economy. Fire the economy and do it immediately; protect the small and medium businesses. They refused to do it,” claimed Gandhi.He claimed that a weak economy, troubled foreign policy and disturbed neighbourhood prompted China to take an aggressive stand against India over the past few months.“So, today you have a country which is economically in trouble; in trouble as far as foreign policy is concerned; in trouble with its neighbours; and that’s why the Chinese have decided that this is possibly the best time to act and that is why they have acted,” he said.Later, Gandhi tweeted: “Since 2014, the PM’s constant blunders and indiscretions have fundamentally weakened India and left us vulnerable. Empty words don’t suffice in the world of geopolitics.”Earlier, while announcing that he would release videos on different issues, Gandhi had said: “Today a large part of the Indian news media has been captured by fascist interests. A hate-filled narrative is being spread by television channels, WhatsApp forwards and false news. This narrative of lies is tearing India apart. I want to make our current affairs, history and crisis clear and accessible for those interested in the truth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-releases-video-attacking-modi-govt-says-china-s-actions-prompted-by-india-s-disruption-over-6-years/story-GXpFC5d4vq1Y7eSn7hQIcL.html

Low-cost carrier IndiGo, under its newly introduced “6E double booking scheme”, will allow fliers to book air tickets for twin seats from the airline’s website, starting July 24.Earlier in July, Vistara, a full-service carrier, had announced a similar facility without any additional charge except for the ticket cost for a second seat.IndiGo clarified that this scheme would not be available for bookings made through travel portals, IndiGo call centre, airport counters, or if a customer initially books a single seat and then seek to upgrade to a twin-seat.The budget airline, too, will charge only an airline component and Goods and Services Tax (GST) and there will no additional airport charges. According to the airline, the second seat will be priced at a lower rate than the total fare paid for the original booking. “The charges for the extra seat will be effectively up to 25% lower than the original booking cost. The offer is effective from July 24,” IndiGo stated.The seat-selection charges, under this scheme, will be applicable for both seats.Sanjay Kumar, chief strategy & revenue officer, IndiGo, said, “Even though air travel is the safest mode of travel at this point, we understand the passengers’ emotional need for safety. We had been receiving such requests and are happy to introduce the option to book two seats for a single passenger to ensure additional safety. 6E double-seat will provide a stress-free flying experience to our customers. We are constantly working towards measures and services to strengthen air travel as the safest choice for travellers. We are confident that this option will enhance a passenger’s comfort and trust, augmenting the overall demand for air travel”. The airline said any kind of changes and cancellation charges -- based on the type of fare -- would be applicable on the extra seat. “The extra-seat booking will not be entitled to additional baggage allowance for customers. The extra seat can be used by passengers, who are carrying a large musical instrument, or a child’s car seat, or for more space needed due to personal comfort, size, or disability,” IndiGo added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-vistara-indigo-gives-option-to-book-two-seats-for-single-passenger/story-mVkBzpgF1HUraa4sddb8iP.html

M. Venkaiah Naidu, chairman, RS, has decided to proceed with the oath-taking ceremony keeping in view the resumption of meetings by the department-related parliamentary standing committees of both the RS and Lok Sabha and the interest expressed by the new members to participate in such meetings, Naidu’s office said in a statement.A Member of Parliament (MP) can participate in the meetings and other house proceedings only after being administered the oath or affirmation; even though they are eligible to draw salaries and other benefits.For the first time, the oath-taking ceremony will be carried out in the chamber of the House during inter-session because of the unprecedented coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. “Subscribing to oath or affirmation is usually done either during the session or in the chamber of the RS chairman, if the House is not in session,” the statement said.Among the MPs, who will be administered the oath or affirmation, are Dr. K. Keshava Rao (Telangana Rashtra Samithi) and Tiruchi Siva (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam), who chair parliamentary committees, and cannot convene the meetings of their respective committees unless they are administered the oath.A total of 61 members from 20 states, who have been elected to the Upper House, will be administered the oath in the chairman’s chamber while complying with Covid-19 induced social distancing norms and only a family member, or a guest will be allowed to accompany the newly elected MP.The MPs were informed of the decision by the RS secretary-general and those who fail to turn up will be administered oath or affirmation during the monsoon session, which is likely to begin after August 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/newly-elected-members-of-rajya-sabha-to-take-oath-on-july-22/story-Ojxfc0LOQYO2pIAxkHXgdJ.html

The letter further underlined the fear among the electorate and the parties that the “poll exercise does not become a super spreader event”.Congress, RJD, CPI, CPI(M), RLSP, CPI(ML), HAM were signatories to the letter that was sent to the poll body. The parties said that Covid-19 pandemic has affected the state badly and the cases may be much more than the reported figures as testing is still not as intensive as it should be.“It is safe to assume that there are many more infected people who are either asymptomatic or have not yet been tested in the state,making their public movement a risk for others around them. It is also projected that infections would cross a million in Bihar by the tentative election schedules in October-November,” the parties argued in the letter. The parties asked how will the EC ensure physical distancing in a state with a population of 13 crore with 7.5 crore eligible voters. The two yard distancing has been repeatedly advocated by WHO, Indian Council of Medical research and also Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“People need explicit clarity so that wholesome participation of majority of voters is not adversely impacted. People also expect the commission to ensure and satisfy the people that entire poll exercise does not become a super spreader event,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-elections-should-not-be-a-super-spreader-event-congress-rjd-others-write-to-ec-to-review-if-polls-can-be-held/story-mjFaLmsnVLODrWzSSPbAdJ.html

Initially, he was treated at a private hospital, but was later shifted to Sion Hospital. He died of Covid-19 on Thursday evening. He had a medical condition, as he had undergone a bypass surgery around seven years ago,” said Tanaji Pol, superintendent of the children’s home.The home is run by the Children’s Aid Society and comes under the Maharashtra government’s women and child development department.The facility has a sprawling campus, including a staff colony on its premises.Earlier, three staff members, including the guard, had tested Covid-19 positive, said an official.The home houses 130 children, who have been rescued by the police or non-governmental organisatons (NGOs) from various factories indulging in child labour, or are victims of child trafficking rackets. Some of the inmates are street urchins and runaway kids.“The children are panic-stricken and anxious after they came to know about the guard’s death,” said the official. However, Pol maintained that there was no cause for concern.“The children are safe and they need not worry, as the deceased guard didn’t come to work for the past 13 days.

17-07-2020||India||In a video, Rahul Gandhi weighs in reasons behind India-China border standoff||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday gave three reasons behind China’s aggressive stance against India as both the neighbours have clashed on its border in eastern Ladakh in the last few months taking their ties to a new low.Rahul Gandhi talked about several aspects of the government’s policies that he said the Centre has destroyed over the last six years and resulted in the present action by the Chinese.“Since 2014, the PM’s constant blunders and indiscretions have fundamentally weakened India and left us vulnerable. Empty words don’t suffice in the world of geopolitics,” Gandhi tweeted on Friday. Watch: Rahul Gandhi explains why China felt confident to move against India The former Congress president also posted a video to talk about the reasons he said have allowed the Chinese to have “the confidence that they can move against a country like India”.Gandhi explained in the 3:38-minute video that countries are protected not by one particular thing but “by a confluence of forces and by a confluence of systems”. “A country is protected by its foreign relationships, it is protected by its neighbourhood, it is protected by its economy, it is protected by the feeling that its people have and the vision its people have. What has happened over the last six years that on all those areas India has been disturbed and disrupted,” he said.Talking about the government’s foreign policy, he said India’s relationship with the outside world used to be with multiple countries. India, he said, had a strategic partnership with the United States and a relationship with Russia and Europe.“These countries used to help us manoeuver in the world. Today, our relationship has become transactional… We have a transactional relationship with the United States. We have disturbed our relationship with the Russians and we have a transactional relationship with Europe,” Gandhi said.The Congress leader then slammed the government for disrupting the country’s relationship with its immediate neighbours like Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka among others.“Our neighbourhood other than Pakistan was working with India and saw itself as being partnered with India. If you speak to the Nepali people, they are furious with what has happened. Sri Lankans have given a port to Chinese. The Maldives is disturbed. Bhutan is disturbed,” he said.He also talked about India’s economy, which is said is now “an absolute disaster”, in the video interspersed with graphics and news reports.“Our pride. Something that India used to go to the rest of the world and talk about, boast about. Worst economic growth in 50 years, no Indian site, an absolute disaster, unemployment is the highest in 40-50 years,” said Gandhi.“Our strengths have suddenly become our weaknesses.” He said the Congress party urged the government to “please realise that we are becoming vulnerable”.“We told them and said for god’s sake inject money into the economy, fire the economy and do it immediately. Protect small and medium businesses. They refused to do it,” he said.“Today you have a country which is economically in trouble, in trouble as far as foreign policy is concerned and in trouble with its neighbours. And that’s why the Chinese have decided that this is possibly the best time to act,” he said.Earlier this week the Congress lawmaker from Kerala’s Wayanad had said he will launch a video programme on current affairs and history and make them “accessible for those interested in the truth”.“I want to make our current affairs, history and crisis clear and accessible for those interested in the truth. From tomorrow, I’ll be sharing my thoughts with you on video,” Gandhi had tweeted on July 13.Rahul Gandhi and the Congress party have been critical of the government over the handling of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) situation with China after 20 Indian Army soldiers, including an officer, were killed on June 15 by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley.

The animal had killed two people earlier this month, including a one-and-a-half-year-old child, which had enraged the locals.With this, two of the three leopards declared ‘maneaters’ by the forest department in last one month, have been eliminated.Sanchita Verma, range officer, Almora forest range, confirmed the killing of the leopard.According to the forest department, one-and-a-half-year old Harshit was killed by the leopard when he was playing in courtyard of his house in Udal village in Almora on July 6. Following protest by angry villagers, the leopard was declared ‘maneater’ the very next day by chief wildlife warden Uttarakhand on the request of Almora forest division. Two days after this incident, a mangled body of 70-year-old Anandi Devi also was recovered from Petshaal village of the same block on July 8. Forest officials claimed she was also killed by the same leopard.After declaring the animals ‘maneater’, forest officials invited three hunters - Nawab Saifi Asif of Bijnor, Rajeev Solomon of Moradabad (both in Uttar Pradesh) and Harish Dhami of Nainital (in Uttarakhand) - for killing the leopard. The hunters reached Almora on July 8 and had started searching for the animal.“We reached Almora on July 8 and since then were tracking the leopard. We spotted it on Friday but within seconds, it disappeared,” said Solomon.“Saifi, Dhami and I were sitting and waiting for the leopard on a scaffolding (machaan) on Thursday evening. Suddenly the leopard appeared just 50 metres away from the spot where it had killed the child. On sighting it, we took the aim and opened fire. The leopard fell and didn’t move,” he added.Saifi, another hunter, said, “Three shots were fired on the leopard with .375 magnum rifle and with .12 bore guns. The leopard died on the spot.”Forest officer Sanchita Verma said, “Leopard was a 9-year-old female around 6.10 feet long. Its one tooth and a claw of the front paw were broken. Her claws were worn out and it is likely this is what made it to attack humans.”After the killing of the ‘maneater’ leopard, the villagers of the area heaved a sigh of relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leopard-which-had-killed-woman-and-child-in-uttarakhand-shot-dead/story-DMD64K69V86fqVFYK8vTBP.html

However, Singh underlined that not an inch of our land can be taken by any power in the world.India and China have held many talks over the past few weeks, even activating the Special Representatives Group to resolve the issue. “Talks are underway to resolve the border dispute but to what extent it can be resolved I cannot guarantee. I can assure you, not one inch of our land can be taken by any power in the world. If solution can be found by talks, there is nothing better,” said Singh.On Thursday, reflecting on the disengagement process between the two armies along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the army said it is an “intricate process” and “requires constant verification”.“The senior commanders reviewed the progress on implementation of the first phase of disengagement and discussed further steps to ensure complete disengagement,” army spokesperson Colonel Aman Anand said yesterday.The disengagement effort involves rival troops pulling back a specified distance from face-off sites, with further retreat taking place in phases as the plan progresses on a verifiable basis on the ground every 72 hours by both sides.The government’s high-powered China Study Group (CSG) on Wednesday reviewed the latest developments in eastern Ladakh, with focus on the next stage of disengagement between the two sides.The tension between the two countries has been going on for months, but flared up after 20 army soldiers were killed in a violent face-off between Indian and Chinese troops on June 15.“Recently what happened between troops of India and China at PP14, how some of our personnel sacrificed their lives protecting our border. I am happy to meet you all but also saddened because of their loss. I pay my tributes to them,” added the minister. Singh arrived in Leh as part of his two-day visit to Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir.

Kamrup Deputy Commissioner Kailash Kartik along with police rushed to the facility in Changsari on Thursday and asked the patients to clear the highway and return to the centre so that the matter could be resolved through discussions, they said. Tension prevailed in the area, however, after assurance the patients returned to the centre, an officer said. The patients alleged that they were not being provided with food and water and the condition of the beds was also not up to the mark as 10-12 of them were being kept in a single room. The deputy commissioner assured them that their allegations will be looked into and efforts made to address them, the officer said. Health and Family Welfare Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said if the patients are not happy at the Covid care facility, they can opt for home quarantine. “We have brought them to the facility so that they can be cured and they do not infect others. If they are not happy there, they can sign the undertaking and go under home quarantine,” he said at a press conference. The health workers are on duty day and night and there may have been some delay as they are overburdened, he said. “In other states, even the testing is conducted on payment but in Assam, the entire expenditure -- from testing to their stay and food -- are borne by the state government,” Sarma added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-100-patients-break-out-of-covid-care-centre-block-highway-over-food-water/story-KnKsDFUXQOEnfFIStldupL.html

He cited audio clips in which Bhanwar Lal, who belongs to the sacked deputy CM and Gehlot challenger Sachin Pilot’s camp, is alleged to have conspired with the BJP leaders.Shekhawat, who has been at the forefront of lashing out at the Gehlot government for blaming the BJP for the Congress’s internal power tussle, denied that the purported voice on the tape as his.The minister also denied that he had a telephonic conversation with an intermediary called Sanjay Jain, whom the Congress alleged that has also been caught speaking on tape.Surjewala said the Congress has demanded that the SOG (Special Operations Group) of the Rajasthan Police should file an FIR (first information report) against Shekhawat, Lal, and Jain.The BJP has been vehemently denying that it instigated the bid to ensure the fall of the Gehlot government or engineered defection by colluding with Pilot and a bunch of lawmakers, who are supporting him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-crisis-ready-for-probe-says-union-minister-shekhawat/story-mzfTNlTwU24qD7a60NKjEK.html
17-07-2020||India||Rains begin to reach deficient parts of NW India, to intensify over the weekend: RWFC||Some parts of north-west India, including Haryana and Delhi-national capital region (NCR), were lashed by rains, as the monsoon trough is shifting northwards amid worries over rain deficiency in the region.In Delhi, only some neighbourhoods in south Delhi received light rains on Friday morning.The Regional Weather Forecasting Centre (RWFC) said that rains would intensify over the weekend.At present, Delhi has a -52% deficiency and the corresponding figure for north-west India is -16%.“The monsoon trough (line of low pressure) has started moving northwards and is likely to bring widespread rains to the north-western region until Monday,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, RWFC.The highest deficiency is in Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh at -59% and -66%, respectively; -34% in Himachal Pradesh; and -14% in Uttarakhand.Under the influence of strengthening of lower-level easterlies over north-west India and the monsoon trough, widespread rain with some heavy falls is likely over the plains of northwest India between Friday and Monday, with maximum intensity and distribution of rainfall on Saturday and Monday, said India Meteorological Department (IMD) in its Friday morning bulletin.In view of likely shifting of the eastern end of monsoon trough towards foothills of the Himalayas from Sunday, widespread and very heavy rain is likely over the north-east and adjoining eastern India from that day onwards.Extremely heavy rain, measuring over 20 centimetres (cm), is likely to occur over Sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam and Meghalaya on Monday.Due to a strong convergence of south-westerly winds parts of Mumbai received over 20 cm of rain between Thursday and Friday. Intense rains are likely over Mumbai on Friday as well.A good monsoon, which accounts for 70% of India’s annual rainfall, is critical to the fortunes of the agricultural sector on which at least 700 million people in India are dependent for a livelihood.The monsoon is crucial for the yield of rice, wheat, sugarcane, and oilseeds in a country, where farming accounts for about 15% of the economy but employs over half of its people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rains-begin-to-reach-deficient-parts-of-nw-india-to-intensify-over-the-weekend-rwfc/story-AsDetEbt6ZIa1DEDcBfeoK.html
17-07-2020||India||Assam: Kaziranga tigress rescued from floods released into the wild||A tigress (2) was released into the wild on Friday by the authorities of Assam’s Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR), two days after she was rescued amid the flood fury that has submerged 85% of the park, the largest habitat of one-horned rhinos in the world.The tigress was brought in a cage on a vehicle and released by forest personnel, which was captured in a telling video that showed the animal running into the wild after a few seconds of initial hesitation.The tigress was one of the two big cats that had strayed out of the park on Tuesday to escape floodwaters. While one tiger was driven away to higher locations in adjoining Karbi Anglong district, the tigress moved to a nearby village and spent the night in a thatched hut’s kitchen.The forest officials and veterinarians tranquilised the tigress on Wednesday afternoon, as they were apprehensive about its safety because of the widespread monsoon-induced inundation in the area and shifted it to the Centre for Wildlife Research and Conservation (CWRC) located at Borjuri near the park.“The decision was taken to tranquilise and rescue the tigress because it had not moved out of the village on its own. The animal was kept under observation at CWRC for two nights,” said P. Sivakumar, director KNPTR.Veterinarians and CWRC personnel conducted a thorough health check-up of the tigress and decided to release it back to the wild after they were convinced that the animal had not suffered any injury and would be safe on nature’s lap.“I thank all forest personnel, who were involved in the rescue and release of the animal, and hope it will thrive in the wild,” said Dr. Shamshul Ali, a wildlife veterinarian.Earlier on Monday, another male tiger had come out of the park to escape floodwaters. The animal moved back inside the park after spending a few hours outside.Kaziranga, which is spread over 430 square kilometres, is home to 121 Royal Bengal Tigers — one of the highest densities of the species anywhere.This monsoon, 86 wild animals, including five rhinos, four of which due to drowning, have died in and around the park, while 125 other animals, including a one-year-old female rhino calf, have been rescued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-kaziranga-tigress-rescued-from-floods-released-into-the-wild/story-2zZY8xkHFGSORxw0gbcAsK.html
17-07-2020||India||3 Jaish terrorists killed in Kulgam encounter, top IED expert among them: Police||Three terrorists were killed in an encounter in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kulgam on Friday, the police said. They have been identified as members of the terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), according to news agency ANI, which quoted Jammu and Kashmir Police chief Dilbag Singh.“Three terrorists were killed in a joint operation launched in the wee hours of Friday by the Central Reserve Police Force’s (CRPF) units, Army and the Kulgam Police on a credible input about the presence of terrorists in village Chimmer,” Singh said.The DGP said that the terrorists were given instructions by their Pakistani handlers and were responsible for a large number of attacks.Out of the three terrorists, one has been identified as Walid, a Pakistan national. He was active in Jammu and Kashmir for past one and half years, the police said. “He had escaped our cordon four times and was the most wanted terrorist,” said Vijay Kumar, Inspector General of Police, Kashmir.The DGP said that Walid was a top IED expert.Three soldiers were injured in the encounter, which began early in Friday after the security forces got inputs about the presence of terrorists in the Nagnad-Chimmer area. A search and cordon operation was launched, and when the security forces reached the area the terrorists opened fire and the gunfight began, the police said.The injured soldiers have been admitted to the army hospital.Incriminating materials including arms and ammunition have been recovered from the terrorists, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-jaish-terrorists-killed-in-kulgam-encounter-top-ied-expert-among-them-police/story-b0bVZThBKlQpivw0InC0YN.html
17-07-2020||India||10 years on, family of Odisha cop killed in landmine blast yet to get land||The family of an Odisha policeman, who was killed a decade ago in an attack by Maoists, has said it has not got the land the government had promised for all personnel killed in areas affected by the insurgency.Bibhisana Sahu of Pandiapali village in Sonepur district was killed in 2010 along with 10 other troopers of the Special Operations Group, an anti-Maoist specialist force like the Greyhounds of Andhra Pradesh, when the Maoists triggered a landmine in Boipariguda area of Koraput.The policemen were travelling in a vehicle to Malkangiri district from Baipariguda in Koraput district on road clearing when the blast occurred. Eyewitnesses said the impact of the blast was so severe that the vehicle was blown up at least 25 feet in the air before falling into a ditch below. Severed parts of the policemen’s bodies, including those of the 24-year-old Sahu, were found on trees.Though his family received the financial assistance and his younger brother Pankah got a job in the police department, his family is yet to get the 10 decimals land that the government had announced for all the slain policemen in Maoist areas.“I have been running to government offices for getting the patta of the 10 decimals of land that the government had announced, however, I am yet to get it,” Sahu’s father, Baikuntha, said.“I have provided all necessary documents to the government, but have not succeeded. How long would we have to run around for a piece of land? Don’t the families of the police martyrs deserve respect?” he asked.Sonepur district collector Monisha Banerjee said she has recently gone through all the documents of the case and ordered for the speeding up of the process.“I don’t know as to why the process was delayed. We should be able to give the land to the family in the next two months,” Banerjee said.The state government has claimed major gains in its fight against the Maoists by announcing exclusion of five districts from the list of affected ones.Last week, Odisha’s director general of police (DGP) Abhay said the state has recommended to the Union ministry of home affairs to exclude five districts from the list of those get funding from the Centre’s Security Related Expenditure (SRE) scheme for fighting the Maoists. Abhay said with Maoist situation improving in the state and more rebels surrendering due to aggressive police action, Odisha has now recommended to the Centre to drop Angul, Boudh, Sambalpur, Deogarh and Nayagarh.Once the Centre excludes these districts, Odisha would have 10 districts under SRE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-years-on-family-of-odisha-cop-killed-in-landmine-blast-yet-to-get-land/story-ujvKqPoLghtnQrLWS2IkqO.html
17-07-2020||India||June saw India make its first trade surplus in 18 years. But this isn’t good news||India’s trade balance went into positive territory in June . The last time this happened was in January 2002. In normal circumstances, a trade surplus generates tail winds for economic growth. Exports are demand for domestic goods by foreign buyers, whereas imports constitute a leakage of domestic incomes on foreign goods, and the surplus -- the difference between the two -- turning positive is usually good news. Many people including Piyush Goyal, the union minister of commerce and industry have celebrated the trade account turning positive. “Rapid Turnaround of Exports: Realising PM @NarendraModi ji’s vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat, for the first time in 18 years, India records a monthly goods trade surplus in June!”, Goyal tweeted on 15 July.However, under the current circumstances, a trade surplus might actually be bad rather than good news. Here’s why.The world economy today is characterised by global value chains. A large part of trade flows are driven by derived demand. For example, if mobile phone factories were importing batteries and motherboards for the final product, a fall in production of mobile phones will lead to a fall in import of batteries and motherboard. In this case, a sudden fall in imports might be symptomatic of fall in domestic economic activity rather than gains on the import substitution front, which is what the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign seeks to achieve..A large part of India’s import requirements fall squarely in the derived demand nature. According to the World Bank’s WITS database, almost 90% of India’s imports is made up of raw materials, intermediate goods or capital goods i.e. means to undertake domestic production activity. The share of consumer goods in Indian exports is much higher. India had the highest import to export ratio in the raw material category, a proportion that is skewed by crude oil imports. Unfortunately, the WITS analysis is only available up to 2018. However, it is unlikely that India’s domestic production and import structure have changed radically after this period.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();It is useful to analyse the June 2020 trade surplus in this background.A comparison of June 2020 and June 2019 trade statistics shows that both exports and imports have fallen in comparison to last year.This analysis uses information from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) database to classify imports and exports into useful categories. Exports are divided into petroleum and non-petroleum exports while imports are classified into petroleum, gold and silver and other imports. The biggest fall in absolute terms is in the non-petroleum and non-gold and silver import category. This, as has been pointed above is most likely a result of a fall in derived demand for intermediate and capital goods arising from a fall in domestic production. This is not good news for the economy. In proportional terms, petroleum imports have more than halved thanks to a reduced demand and low crude prices.Experts agree. The “surprise trade surplus...could be reflective of weak domestic demand, relative to global demand; the weakness in imports was spread across investment and consumption goods”, said a note by Pranjul Bhandari, Chief India Economist at HSBC Securities and Capital Markets Ltd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/june-saw-india-make-its-first-trade-surplus-in-18-years-but-this-isn-t-good-news/story-yhThGOLNr9qkDu7cRxicHN.html
17-07-2020||India||Demand for ‘made in India’ toys increase in Gujarat’s Rajkot amid Chinese products boycott||Toy industries of Rajkot witness revival in demand for products amid the campaign for boycotting the sale and use of Chinese products in wake of the Galwan Valley faceoff in mid-June.“Almost 80 to 90 per cent of toys are being imported from China. And with such an increase in demand, it is an opportunity to grow the domestic market as well as increasing the prospects of exporting to other countries, helping boost the Indian economy,” Arvind Jala, co-director of Aditi Toys told ANI.“In the next three-four months we hope that we would make more than 100 products and in one year, we would make more than 200 products so that we would be able to fulfill the demand of the Indian market.”Jala opined that there are very few toy entrepreneurs but believes that this industry can be a potential one for entrepreneurs to tap into.“There are very few toy entrepreneurs in the country at the moment making it a good opportunity for entrepreneurs to delve into. The competition too is also low and compared to other industries, there are more employment opportunities over here,” he said.Subhash Jala, the co-director of the toy company said that with anti-China movements across the country taking place wherein people have been boycotting Chinese products, there has been a demand for made in India products these days.“The anti-Chinese movement has made people demand made in India products these days,” he said.On June 15, twenty Indian soldiers were killed during combat with Chinese forces in Galwan valley, leading to tensions between both nations. Chinese soldiers subsequently started moving back following dialogues between two countries through the military level and diplomatic level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/demand-for-made-in-india-toys-increase-in-gujarat-s-rajkot-amid-chinese-products-boycott/story-w20QG1a3XZTYham0TZa9TP.html

BSF’s probe has revealed that the stranded people belong to Bangladesh’s Comilla district. “On July 11 at about 6 pm, 12 people, including a man, four women, and seven children, were traced near border pillar No. 2039/12-S. They revealed to a BSF patrol party that they are residents of Harikula village under Chandina police station of Bangladesh’s Comilla district. They were directed to go back to Bangladesh’s territory,” stated a BSF press release issued on Thursday evening.However, BGB personnel has refused to take them back, as they allegedly don’t have valid documents to prove their Bangladeshi nationality.Initially, a flag meeting was held between BSF and BGB personnel on July 11, where the latter made their stand clear.Three days later, another flag meeting was held, where the BSF personnel handed over the documents of the 12 stranded people, including photographs, home addresses, family tree chart and a compact disc (CD) containing a video clip that depicted a purported conversation between Kulsum Bibi and her son in her native Bangladesh, to BGB authorities,“ ... as per the understanding between the BSF and BGB personnel, women and children apprehended at the International Border have to be handed over/accepted by BGB/BSF, subject to confirmation of their nationality, immediately after apprehension, and treating them as victims of human trafficking,” the release added. BSF authorities have alleged that their Bangladeshi counterparts are deliberately delaying the process of ascertaining the nationality of the 12 people, who are stranded on the Indo-Bangla border since July 11.The BSF is providing basic amenities to the stranded people on humanitarian ground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-bangladeshi-nationals-including-7-children-stranded-on-indo-bangla-border-for-six-days/story-wu2dXrAsfHXM39dRNplMVN.html

17-07-2020||India||Man accused of raping 6 minors brought to Bhopal, will be produced before court on Friday||A 68-year-old man, accused of raping six minor girls in Bhopal in the past few years, was brought to the Madhya Pradesh capital on Thursday. He was arrested in Srinagar on Wednesday.The accused will be produced before a court on Friday, the police said.He had been on the run since Sunday after five of the six girls lodged an FIR against him. The man was arrested from a hotel in Srinagar with the help of Jammu and Kashmir Police.“Besides the crime related to rape we are also investigating if he was a part of a drug peddlers’ racket as we have gathered information in this regard,” said a police officer, who is part of the investigation, on cindition of anonymity.A resident of Shahpura locality in Bhopal, the man runs a small vernacular newspaper and was a state-level state government accredited journalist. He was also allotted a government bungalow which was later cancelled.Additional Director General (ADG) of Police, Bhopal, Upendra Jain said, “After the incident of rape came to light, he fled to Mumbai in a taxi and later reached Srinagar by a flight via Delhi. Police got the information on Tuesday that he was staying in a hotel in Srinagar.”“Police are interrogating him to know why did he go to Srinagar and who are the other accomplices in his crime. Two years ago, the police had arrested the friends of his son in connection with drug peddling. Now, police have got information that the rape accused has a strong connection with drug peddlers. We are trying to verify the information,” said Jain.“Police have also written to Income Tax department and Enforcement directorate as he has amassed huge wealth disproportionate to his source of income,” he added. Meanwhile, the advocate of the accused claimed that his client was a victim of political conspiracy. “He was not arrested from Srinagar but fact is he surrendered before the police,” said the lawyer Wahid Khan.The man’s daughter said, “My father is suffering from prostate cancer and he is being targeted by some politicians. After police had taken the girls to the police station my father had approached the police personnel to prove his innocence but he was not allowed to do so. Had he been an accused in any crime, the police should have arrested him immediately. But it was not done and the entire story was fabricated. Police demolished his legal properties as a part of a conspiracy.”A joint team of district administration, Bhopal municipal corporation (BMC) and police razed a marriage hall and a three-storey apartment owned by him in the city. The buildings were allegedly built by him illegally on government land, as per administrative authorities.Notably, the five teenager girls were spotted in an intoxicated state by a police patrol team in Ratibad area in Bhopal in the wee hours on Sunday. During counselling by the Childline, the girls narrated their ordeal about repeated rape with them in the past few years by the accused. Later on Monday, one more minor girl came forward and registered a case of rape against him, said police. He faces three FIRs lodged with Shahpura, Koh-e-fiza and Shyamla Hills police stations under sections 366 (a) (procuration of minor girls), 376 (2) (n) (repeated rape), 120 b (criminal conspiracy) and sections 5/6 and 14 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, Wildlife Protection Act and under relevant sections of SC/ST (Prevention of atrocities) Act, said the DIG of police. As of now, police have arrested four people including two women, who were working as his aide for luring the girls and shifting them from one place to another, according to police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-accused-of-raping-6-minors-brought-to-bhopal-will-be-produced-before-court-on-friday/story-55G19lBnIjvpf7LMijAfnO.html
17-07-2020||India||Covid-19 rears head during Madhya Pradesh govt’s ‘Kill Corona’ campaign||The Madhya Pradesh government’s much talked about campaign to tackle the coronavirus pandemic has seen the situation worsening in the state, driving authorities in several districts to clamp curfews and lockdowns or amend orders to reschedule opening of markets.When the “Kill Corona” campaign began on July 1, there were 13,593 Covid-19 patients in the state and of whom 572 had died. On July 15, when the campaign ended the number of patients stood at 19,643 and the death toll at 682.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIn comparison to the period earlier, the number of Covid-19 cases increased by 200% during the fortnight. During the campaign, as many as 6,050 new Covid-19 patients were identified across the state and 110 died.On average, 400 new patients were identified and more than seven died every day during this period in comparison to 133 Covid-19 cases and more than five people dying every day in over three months prior to the campaign.The major contributors to the Covid-19 cases during this fortnight were Bhopal (993 cases), Gwalior (876), Indore (787), Morena (734) and Jabalpur (242). The new cases from these five cities accounted for more than 60% of the 6,050 new cases identified in the first fortnight of July. A seven-day curfew has been clamped in Gwalior since Tuesday while a complete lockdown has been imposed in Morena. In Indore and Bhopal, the opening of markets has been rescheduled. When the campaign was launched, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had said the government and the society will work together in all districts during the “important campaign of controlling the virus and to generate health awareness”.“A meaningful message will be conveyed by this unique and major campaign to other states too,” Chouhan had said in an official meeting as per the state government’s official communiqué.“About 14,000 women and men health workers of the state will be entrusted with the important responsibility of survey work… Now, the task of identifying the suspected patients quickly and treatment will become easier through the door to door survey in the state. We have to work with a strategy for total control on the virus,” he had said.Interestingly, when the campaign ended on Wednesday the chief minister, as per another official communiqué, said in a meeting, “Positive cases are emerging due to reasons such as organising marriage ceremonies and parties at the social level, hence action should be taken to control it at both government and social level with alertness.” “Social distancing, use of masks and precautions must be continued. The causes behind the emergence of positive cases must be eliminated,” he said.Public health expert Amulya Nidhi said the Kill Corona campaign was to address the gaps in identifying the Covid-19 cases with special attention to the vast rural areas in the state. “The government’s strategy continues to remain the same—identifying cases, isolation, test and treatment. However, what we have seen during this campaign is more and more cases coming from urban areas which were already on the radar of the government. Hence, the government can’t say now that the cases in these cities increased due to more testing under the campaign,” Nidhi said. Nidhi said, “The government must increase the number of Covid tests and labs while strictly enforcing compliance of safety norms including lockdown restrictions. But the fact is there are crowds of people on streets and in markets. There are political activities in view of by-polls with hardly any respect for social distancing norms. Markets are being opened and run as per the wishes of politicians.”State government data shows 11,703 survey teams had conducted the health survey of 75% of the state’s population and 93,000 samples had been taken during the Kill Corona campaign till July 14, out of which 1,611 or 1.72% of the total samples taken tested positive.“When the government’s data itself is self-explanatory that when there are an insignificant number of patients identified under campaign the problem lies somewhere else,” SR Azad, a public health expert, said.“The government must admit that it has either failed to address the reasons or is not looking into the same for any reason,” Azad added.State home minister Narottam Mishra, who headed health department as well till a few days back, said the coronavirus pandemic is spreading fast not only in India but the entire world. “The Kill Corona campaign was aimed at increasing the number of tests and identifying the patients early. The number of tests was enhanced significantly. If a patient is identified early and treated it will reduce the number of deaths,” Mishra said.“Any death is unfortunate for us and the state government is making all-out efforts to prevent deaths caused by Corona. We have succeeded also in our efforts,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-rears-head-during-madhya-pradesh-govt-s-kill-corona-campaign/story-SbK2Y8bpADaFOywCzqbSXN.html

Gandhi had on Monday questioned the Centre’s claims on battling Covid-19, asking if India was at a “good position” in the battle against the virus.The country’s tally reached 1,004,652 with 36,247 new Covid-19 cases and 690 new fatalities putting the disease death toll in the four-and-a-half months of the outbreak at 25,594, according to an HT tally.India had 343,268 active cases and the case fatality rate (CFR) or the proportion of people who succumbed to the illness from among known infections or was 2.5%.

17-07-2020||India||Defence minister Rajnath Singh in Leh amid India-China LAC stand-off||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh arrived in Leh on Friday on a day-long visit to carry out a comprehensive review of the security scenario in the region amid the ongoing tension with China.Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat and Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane are accompanying Singh on the visit. The defence minister visited Stakna forward areas after landing in Ladakh where the troops showed him paradropping skills of the armed forces. Leaving for Leh on a two day visit to Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir. I shall be visiting the forward areas to review the situation at the borders and also interact with the Armed Forces personnel deployed in the region. Looking forward to it.The defence minister is on a two-day visit to Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir. While he is in Ladakh on the first day of his visit today, the defence minister will go to Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday.Singh’s visit comes at a time when there is military tension between India and China in the sensitive sector.Both the sides recently held the fourth round of talks on disengagement in eastern Ladakh. In the talks between corps commanders of the Indian and Chinese armies, that started on Tuesday and stretched into the early hours of Wednesday, both sides discussed the roadmap for further reducing tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The focus of the latest round of military talks was to hammer out a consensus on easing tensions in the Finger Area near Pangong Tso and Depsang plains as well as pulling back weapons and equipment from friction points in other sectors, said people aware of the developments.The previous attempts to reduce tensions along the contested border were made on June 6, June 22 and June 30.Singh was expected to visit Ladakh in early July but his tour was deferred. The defence minister will be visiting Ladakh two weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an unscheduled visit to the sector on July 3. The PM then declared that the “era of expansionism” is over, sending a strong signal to China about India’s determination to defend its borders.The military is keeping a strict vigil on the western front to deter Pakistan from fishing in troubled waters and prevent what could turn out to be a two-front conflict, as reported by Hindustan Times on July 2.The tension along the LAC began after 20 Indian soldiers were killed during a face-off between Indian and Chinese soldiers in Ladakh’s Galwan valley on June 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defence-minister-rajnath-singh-leaves-for-ladakh-will-visit-forward-areas-meet-indian-soldiers/story-naVGBKu9ckI4V5G5GtwRLN.html

17-07-2020||India||Assam Raj Bhavan, Secretariat, jail record Covid-19 cases as Kamrup Metro sees spike in infections despite lockdown||Assam’s biggest city Guwahati and rest of the Kamrup Metro district is witnessing an alarming spike in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases every day despite a total lockdown for over two weeks.The district alone accounts for more than 9,000 of the 20,646 cases in the state and infections have been reported from almost all places including Raj Bhavan, Secretariat, central jail with senior bureaucrats, police officers, doctors and jail inmates contracting the viral disease.Admitting community spread of the virus, the Assam government had initially imposed 14-day total lockdown in Kamrup Metro from June 28 and extended it by another week later till July 19. But that hasn’t helped in bringing down the number of cases.Guwahati, as well as rest of Kamrup Metro, has been witnessing nearly 500 cases every day for the past few days. On Thursday, Assam recorded 892 new Covid-19 cases of which 598 were from Kamrup Metro alone. Till Thursday, the state had recorded 50 deaths—26 of them were from Kamrup Metro. “We have been getting around 500-600 cases on an average daily since the past 10 days. The situation continues to be alarming. We were expecting that the Covid-19 curve would flatten, but that hasn’t happened yet,” Biswajit Pegu, deputy commissioner of Kamrup Metro, said.“Our policy is to detect as many cases as possible and the good thing is we are detecting them. People are coming voluntarily to the screening centres and getting tested. We have tested over 50,000 people in the 31 screening centres in Guwahati and also did door-to-door tests in some localities,” he added.Nearly 200 new cases are getting detected at the screening centres daily. But cases are also emerging from the Raj Bhavan, the state secretariat, hospitals and the central jail.According to officials, around 200 inmates of the jail, which houses nearly 1,000 convicted and under trial prisoners, have tested positive for the coronavirus disease. The most prominent of them being peasant activist and founder of the Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) Akhil Gogoi, who is at present undergoing treatment.Reports say nearly half a dozen senior bureaucrats posted at the state secretariat have tested positive and over 600 Assam Police personnel including two senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officials have also got infected.Unconfirmed reports say around 30 doctors, posted in government and private hospitals, in Guwahati have also tested positive. Earlier this week, a senior doctor at Guwahati Medical College Hospital (GMCH) succumbed to Covid-19.“A total of 45 people have been detected in Raj Bhavan till date but not all are staff members. Some are from security, intelligence, fire services etc. Governor Jagdish Mukhi and his wife had undergone tests, which came out negative,” Lucky Biswas, Raj Bhavan spokesperson, said.Besides the six government hospitals treating coronavirus disease patients, the district has over a dozen Covid care centres (CCCs) where asymptomatic cases are being kept. New CCCs are being opened frequently to accommodate the rising number of cases.Health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Thursday in order to bring down infections in Kamrup Metro, the state government will conduct around three lakh tests by the end of August.“Till now we have conducted around 1.10 lakh tests, we plan to complete another 1.90 lakh by next month. To achieve that we will employ 150 lab technicians and set up 60 more Covid screening centres besides the 31 we already have. Testing and tracing are keys to reducing numbers,” he said.Sarma said the ongoing lockdown measures will be relaxed in a gradual manner over the next weeks to ensure there is no fresh spurt in cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-raj-bhavan-secretariat-jail-record-covid-19-cases-as-kamrup-metro-sees-spike-in-infections-despite-lockdown/story-jLTfsA9xfOv5qMo6YhY3BJ.html

17-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||As it crosses a million cases of the coronavirus disease, India accounts for 7.14% of the people around the world who have been infected by the Sars-CoV-2 virus, and 4.26% of the people who have succumbed to the disease. It also accounts for 8.1% of the people who have recovered. Its lower share of deaths (compared to cases) and higher share of those recovered means the country hasn’t done too badly (relatively), but as a friend, with whom I shared this sentiment, said: “Try telling that to the 25,000 people who have died – or their families.” Numbers, unfortunately, can’t capture the pain.Six months is all it has taken for Covid-19 to upend all plans for 2020, disrupt lives and livelihoods, and prematurely usher in a future for which not everyone is ready, and which comes with its own set of inequalities. Still worse, its impact on people is directly related to current inequalities – most notably around income, class, and gender. The poorest and the most vulnerable have been hit the hardest, and there are fears that millions may slip back into the poverty from which they emerged only recently. Even among businesses, it is the smaller ones, already weakened by the rush to formalise the economy over the past four years, that have borne the brunt.Around 55.7% of India’s first million cases are from Delhi, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu. That trend is already waning, though. On Wednesday, only 44% of the new cases came from the two states and the Capital. On Tuesday, only 43% did. And on Monday, a little less than 43% did. While it is true that we are still seeing the first wave of infections at the national level, and cases could spike again in Delhi, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu, I believe what we are beginning to see now is the end (or the beginning of the end) of the first phase of the virus’s run in India. Since April, the two states and the Capital have accounted for a large proportion of the cases in India. In early April, the three accounted for 50% of new cases, a proportion that fluctuated sharply that month, but then rose again to around 50% by the end, then hovered between 50% and 70% (yes, it went that high) in May and June. On June 22, the two states and the Capital accounted for 69.3% of new cases. That was the peak. Since then, the share of the three in daily new cases has been falling. It was around 60% in early July.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Eight states are in line to take over: Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. Together, they accounted for 42% of the new cases on Wednesday. This is a proportion that has been the rise since July 1, when they accounted for just 29.3% of new cases.Together, they also account for around 55% of India’s population.Could the run of the coronavirus disease through these states mark India’s second phase?It could, and that should raise red flags everywhere. The quality of public health care in some of these states (as reflected in their development indicators) is a cause for concern. But this group is problematic for another reason – it has states that have the worst record when it comes to testing, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, even Gujarat. As they start testing more, they will discover new cases, which means their share of the daily new cases could rise even more and even faster – at the current doubling rate, India could reach two million cases in the second week of August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-UKXfFvUat8ipxTevfrjuSK.html

17-07-2020||India||‘Didn’t get free access to Kulbhushan Jadhav’: India slams Pakistan||A meeting between Indian officials and Kulbhushan Jadhav on Thursday ended inconclusively, with New Delhi accusing Islamabad of breaching its assurance of providing unimpeded access to the former naval officer sentenced to death in Pakistan for alleged involvement in espionage.Pakistan provided consular access to Jadhav for only the second time since he was detained in March 2016. But when two Indian consular officials went to meet him, they found Pakistani officials with “an intimidating demeanour” near Jadhav and a camera being used to record the conversation, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said.The Indian officials met Jadhav to discuss filing a review petition in Islamabad high court against his death sentence by the deadline of July 20, and required privacy to talk about the matter.“The consular officers could not engage Jadhav on his legal rights and were prevented from obtaining his written consent for arranging his legal representation,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.“In the light of these circumstances, the Indian consular officers came to the conclusion that the consular access being offered by Pakistan was neither meaningful nor credible. After lodging a protest, they left the venue.”Srivastava said India had taken up Pakistan’s offer of consular access only after receiving an assurance regarding “unimpeded, unhindered and unconditional access”.Thursday’s developments added another twist to the case of Jadhav, 50, as only four days remain under an ordinance promulgated by the Pakistan government to file a review petition in the Islamabad high court. Srivastava said India made more than 12 requests for consular access to Jadhav over the past year. “This consular access is of utmost importance, as it is the basis for a process of effective review and reconsideration ordered by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in July 2019 of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav by a Pakistani military tribunal,” he said.The Pakistani ordinance, promulgated ostensibly to comply with ICJ’s order, envisages an Indian consular official filing the review petition. Any conversation between Jadhav and the consular officials “must necessarily take place in privacy and without the presence of any Pakistani official or recording by Pakistan”, Srivastava said. It was evident Jadhav had been “intimidated repeatedly in the past, including in being made to express his alleged disinclination to seek a review”, he added. India’s latest request for consular access included several conditions — Pakistan was asked to ensure the meeting was held in an “atmosphere free from fear of retribution”, without the presence of any Pakistani official, and without any video and audio recording.“After extensive discussions, the Pakistan side conveyed that they were ready to organise consular access on July 16. We were assured this consular access would be unimpeded, unhindered and unconditional,” Srivastava said.“Regrettably, however, neither the environment nor the arrangements of the meeting were in accordance with the assurances of Pakistan,” he added. Jadhav was “visibly under stress” and indicated this to the Indian officials.Srivastava described Pakistan’s approach as “obstructive and insincere”. He added, “It has not only violated its assurance to the ICJ to fully implement the 2019 judgment, but also failed to act in accordance with its own ordinance.” External affairs minister S Jaishanakr apprised Jadhav’s family of the developments even as the Indian side reiterated its commitment to ensure his safe return to India.Consular access to Jadhav was first provided in September 2019, while his mother and wife had been allowed to meet him in December 2017.Pakistan on Thursday reiterated its accusations that Jadhav was arrested in Balochistan province on March 3, 2016, and had “confessed” to his involvement in terror activities. India has already dismissed such charges and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani intelligence operatives from Iran’s Chabahar port, where he was running a business.ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan had violated Jadhav’s rights under the Vienna Convention, and stayed his execution while calling on Islamabad to take all steps for an “effective review and reconsideration” of his sentence, including “enacting appropriate legislation”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/didn-t-get-free-access-to-jadhav-india-slams-pak/story-1TeCpZjEoyWBx9hQAIfnkL.html
17-07-2020||India||1 million Covid-19 infections in India, toll nears 25,600||India on Thursday became only the third country in the world — after the United States and Brazil — to hit a million Covid-19 infections, with 36,247 new cases taking the country’s tally to 1,004,652, and 690 new fatalities putting the disease death toll in the four-and-a-half months of the outbreak at 25,594. Experts estimate the next million to take less than a month — the doubling rate stands at 20.6 days — and say the focus now needs to shift to rural parts of the country that traditionally have been beyond the reach of adequate health care mechanisms, and where new hot spots are now feared to pop up.On Thursday, India had 343,268 active cases and the case fatality rate (CFR) — the proportion of people who succumbed to the illness from among known infections — was 2.5%. The US, which has 3,648,250 cases and 140,518 deaths, has a fatality rate of 3.9%; and Brazil, with 1,978,236 cases and 75,697 infections, is at 3.8%. India’s journey to a million cases took 137 days, and half of these were in a hard nationwide lockdown announced in the early days of the outbreak — a strategy that officials and experts said bought the country precious time to set up isolation centres, add hospital beds and beef up testing infrastructure. With crippling economic costs piling up, the country began unlocking in June, when the outbreak was on a sharp upward trajectory. Click here for complete coronavirus casesIn the last week, however, India has added an average of 30,076 cases a day, up from 23,895 a day in the seven-day period before that. At least two states, Bihar and Assam, announced they will be reimposing lockdowns while Uttar Pradesh — the state with the highest population — said it will follow a weekend shutdown.At this rate, Covid-19 infections are on track this year to surpass the roughly 2.4 million tuberculosis infections recorded in India in the 12 months of 2019, and lead to a comparable number of deaths. TB, widely regarded as the deadliest infectious disease in India, led to the deaths of around 79,000 people, according to the Union government’s India TB Report 2020, although the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates this number to be over 400,000. “With nearly 400,000 active Covid-19 cases, we will never be able to have a long enough lockdown to get the cases to 100s,” said Bhramar Mukherjee, the head of biostatistics at University of Michigan, among a team of academics from three American universities that predicted India would hit 1 million cases by July 15 after the lockdown began to lift.Mukherjee stressed on the need to step up testing and closely analyse real-time data in order to head off the outbreak. “It is important to identify states and metros at nascent stages of growth and impose strong measures, including punctuated modulated lockdown. This cannot be done when infections are already leading to large case-counts. What you are seeing today happened two weeks ago,” she added. A second expert said that increasing testing in places where coverage has been limited will now be crucial. “There’s no doubt that the disease is widespread, with even community transmission obvious in certain states. The way ahead is to test as many people as possible, to be able to track and isolate those people who are infected so that the disease spread is contained. If you isolate them in time then the spread in the community will be curtailed,” said Dr Jacob John, former head, virology department, Christian Medical College, Vellore.India’s average weekly test positive rate has risen from 7.7% in mid-June to 10.1% at present, but the aggregate level statistics mask sharp differences in testing performance across the country. Maharashtra, the state with the highest number of infections at 284,281, has a test positive rate close to 20%, while for Uttar Pradesh, this number is less than 4%.WHO identifies 8-12% as the ideal range for test positive rate in a country with an active outbreak. A number too low or too high implies that volume as well as targeting of Covid-19 testing is inadequate to accurately detect the spread of the disease. Three states have a test positive rate in this range. Tamil Nadu and Gujarat have a positive rate of 8.7% and 9% but experts have expressed scepticism on the numbers due to the other parameters reported from these region. Tamil Nadu has a CFR of 1.4% while for Gujarat, this number is 4.7%.Delhi is the only other region with a test positive rate of 8.1%, as well as the highest per population testing numbers across the country. The national capital has recorded a sustained decrease in new cases for the last six days at least, and a dashboard by Mukherjee and her team estimates that the rate of transmission in the Capital is now below 1 — a threshold below which an outbreak can potentially be halted.“Only two states, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, constitute 48.15% of country’s total active case load. Of the total 36 states and UTs, only 10 states constitute 84.62% of the total active case load,” the Union health ministry said in a statement on Thursday, adding that “targeted measures have contributed to a steady decline in the number of active cases”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-million-infections-in-india/story-POhE9MvLix1MFFwPeKr2oO.html
17-07-2020||India||234 universities to hold exams in August -September||Over 180 universities have conducted exams while another 234 are planning to hold them online in August and September, according to the University Grants Commission (UGC). UGC, the higher education regulator, wrote to 640 universities seeking the status of examinations after it issued guidelines for conducting them on July 6. The guidelines made it mandatory to hold exams for the final year students.UGC on July 6 asked universities and colleges to hold their final-year, or final-semester examinations, by September 30. The direction came as the Union home ministry’s approved the conduct of these tests.The examinations can be held either online, or offline (pen and paper), or using a combination of both. For students other than those in the final year, universities and colleges can choose their own exam method to close the academic session. Colleges and universities have been closed in the country since March 16 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Over 450 have written to UGC saying they have either conducted the exams or were planning to do so. According to UGC data, accessed by HT, 182 universities have conducted exams either online or offline while 234 others planned them over the next two months. Around 30 universities are awaiting directions from their statutory councils before holding the exams.According to information available with the regulator, 177 universities are yet to take a final call on holding the tests. In the case of 27 private universities set up in 2019-20, they do not have final year students yet and do not have to hold the exams.UGC’s advisory asking universities to hold exams was based on recommendations of a committee led by Central University of Haryana vice-chancellor R C Kuhad.UGC has said holding exams was important to retain the Indian education system’s credibility and that it would be in the interest of students.States like Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi had expressed their inability in conducting the exams in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Delhi government had said it was in favour of cancelling all exams.Officials said the Punjab government also wrote to UGC asking it to reconsider its suggestions. The regulator is learnt to have asked it to find a suitable way of holding the exams. The Union Human Resource Development ministry has also released guidelines on how exams can be held. Officials said the ministry feels that even state and private universities should abide by the UGC guidelines as the regulator is entrusted with maintaining educational standards. “UGC sought data from various universities. In what is a positive sign, a large number of them have either held exams or are in the process [of holding them]. UGC believes that holding exams for final year students would be greatly beneficial to their long-term prospects,” said an official.Institutions like Delhi University have tried to conduct exams but have faced opposition from students and parents with some citing digital divide in case of online tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/234-varsities-to-hold-exams-in-aug-sept/story-LySDvlFT6sdNSrNVNOJ8qJ.html
17-07-2020||India||No postal ballots for those aged over 65 in Bihar polls||The Election Commission on Thursday said it has decided not to notify the law ministry’s amendment to the Representation of People Act, 1951, that would have allowed those over the age of 65 to use postal ballots in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections and by-elections due in the near future, in a move welcomed by political parties. The law ministry, on the recommendation of the Commission, had decided to allow people over 65 to vote remotely in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The provision was supposed to be an enabling one. Five key opposition parties wrote to Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora to reconsider the move which some of them said would unduly benefit the ruling Janata Dal (United), or JDU-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) alliance in Bihar. The Bihar assembly lapses in November this year and Arora had told Hindustan Times in an interview on June 27 that as of now, the elections will be held when they are due. It will be the first assembly election since the pandemic began. According to EC officials, there are also nearly 50 by-elections that the Commission is gearing up to conduct. The Commission has cited “the field situation and logistics of operationalization” as the rationale behind its decision to not allow postal ballots. “Before every election, we have our field officers evaluate the practical situation on the ground,” a poll body official said on condition of anonymity. “Their assessment suggests that it may not be feasible to have postal ballots.”The EC official added that the Commission had listened to and evaluated the representations made by the political parties, but that wasn’t the reason behind the decision. “We heard all of them and their various objections to the postal ballot. The decision, though, has not been taken on the grounds that they made,” the official said. The official added that the amendment to the RP Act would still hold. “If we want to use it, we can notify it ahead of the election. That is how it was done in Delhi and Jharkhand.” The facility of optional postal ballots to electors who are above 80 years of age, persons with disabilities , voters engaged in essential services and voters who are Covid-19 positive or are suspected to be carrying the virus and quarantine (home/institutional) will be extended in these elections.Among the dissenting political parties were Congress, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Trinamool Congress (TMC), Communist Party of India (CPI)and Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI (M). CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury was among the first to raise concerns about postal ballots favouring the ruling party. This was followed by a representation by the Congress that said that the step would violate the secrecy of the vote. TMC, CPI and RJD also wrote to the Commission stating that no political parties had been consulted before the decision was taken. The Commission, in a detailed reply to Yechury mentioned that Bihar’s chief electoral officer had held consultations with various political parties. Yechury said that while they may not have notified the use of amendment for the polls, the change in the RP Act has already been made. “It is the constitutional mandate of the Commission to provide a level playing field,” said Yechury. “They have decreed the amendment, the EC can use it. All parties should have been consulted before the amendment was made. That has not been done.”Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Modi was among the first to welcome the EC’s decision to drop the idea of postal ballots, as did the opposition parties. “Postal ballots could have been misused by parties like the RJD and Congress,” Modi told Hindustan Times. “RJD in any case has a culture of looting votes. Moreover, there would have been logistical issues. The EC would have to amass enough manpower to collect postal ballots from nearly 30,000 people in every constituency.”According to Modi, nearly 10% of Bihar’s population is above 65. There are over 70 million voters in Bihar. “There were concerns raised about the secrecy of postal ballot and also the safety of voters. The decision was hasty and without due application of mind. We welcome today’s decision of the EC and hope appropriate measures will be taken to safeguard the health of voters,” Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said. According to Derek O’Brien, Trinamool’s Parliamentary party leader in the Rajya Sabha, the decision was an undemocratic one.“Trinamool had written to the Commission giving compelling reasons why they were ill-advised to be pushed into taking a decision that was completely illegal, undemocratic and was arrived at without consulting any political parties. So that is that,” O’Brien said. West Bengal is scheduled to go to the polls in the first half of 2021. RJD spokesperson Manoj Jha also stressed that by not notifying the amendment, a free and fair election would be ensured in the state. “We are glad that the EC has decided to not notify the amendment. Any change whatsoever in the peoples representation act should only be done by engaging through wider consultations. The commission should always remember that the idea of free and fair election as well as ensuring level playing field is not simply rhetoric,” RJD spokesperson Manoj Jha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-postal-ballots-for-those-aged-over-65-in-bihar-polls/story-hDN7xVxrRSMU3uS2TOvlKK.html
17-07-2020||India||Goa governor holds meeting with CM, asks state govt to plug ‘shortfalls’||Goa governor Satya Pal Malik asked the chief minister and other senior officials to plug the “shortfalls” of the state administration in fighting the spread of Covid-19, in an extensive meeting at the Raj Bhavan on Thursday.The meeting is seen as a run-in between the governor and the chief minister over the handling of the crisis. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, who is under fire from opposition parties as well as civil society, also found himself under the scanner, with the governor questioning the “error of judgement” in not locking down Vasco da Gama, the epicentre of the virus in the state, due to which the entire state is under threat. “I have raised several issues during the meeting. Wherever they have done a good job, I commended, and where they have fallen short, I have also pointed it out. Wherever there was a need like food supply, the quality of food, menu, the cleanliness of the Covid centres — bathrooms are overflowing — shortage of ambulances, the shortfalls were discussed. To a great extent, the health secretary has spoken and clarified what steps are being taken,” Malik said, addressing a local TV station. “As far as the tests are concerned, Goa is doing very well, management is fine too. But what happened here is that we became satisfied too early when we shouldn’t have. We relaxed the lockdown, and now, when the cases are rising, we are locking down again. When people were saying that Vasco should have been locked down, we didn’t do it. It has grown a lot and now we are doing it. There was an error of judgement,” Malik said. The governor had called for a meeting with the chief minister, chief secretary, health secretary and other officials due to the rise in number of cases, deaths as well as reports in the media over poor condition of Covid Care centres. The governor’s comments are in sharp contrast to the chief minister’s, who said the governor told them that the realised he was misinformed by media reports. “He was getting wrong information from the media and social media and we have given him the right information. In fact, he told us that what we are doing is very good. Social media, print media and electronic media are showing the wrong picture. That’s what he said. He said that the good side should be shown,” Sawant said. The governor, however, refuted the statement. “It is definitely wrong to say that I have blamed the press. The issue of the press (coverage) didn’t come up (during the meeting). I have definitely not criticised the press. The press is our strength, through which we get feedback and only then can we go forward. The CM has said that I have said this, but I haven’t. He shouldn’t have said that. I definitely didn’t say that,” Malik said.This isn’t the first time there were “perceived differences” between the Goa governor and the chief minister. In May, the governor was forced to clarify as being “in bad taste” news reports which he said “portrays differences and divergences between him and the chief minister in handling the crisis.”Goa has seen a spike in cases of the coronavirus and deaths with nearly 3,000 cases and 19 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-governor-holds-meeting-with-cm-asks-state-govt-to-plug-shortfalls/story-sIYTjwZe5YFRLQi9jbSl1K.html
17-07-2020||India||10 cities account for half of India’s active Covid-19 infections||As India crosses the 1 million mark for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, here is the most important statistic of the disease’s run through the country : at least half the 330,725 active cases in the country as of Wednesday night were reported from just 10 cities, with a third of all such cases in one state , Maharashtra.A district- and state-wise analysis of active coronavirus infections by HT shows that urban centres, or city districts, are significantly more affected by the virus and account for a majority of the active cases; just the 10 cities account of 52.7% of all active cases in the country.Active cases -- those still under treatment -- is a crucial metric because it directly reflects the pressure on the health care system in any region. It is calculated by subtracting the number of recovered patients and deaths from the total tally. As of Wednesday night, of the 968,405 total Covid-19 cases reported in the country, 330,725 (34.2%) were active, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.To be sure, most states do not release city-specific data, so the analysis has relied on district-wise numbers from states to zero in on the worst-hit cities in the country. Among the 10 districts with the highest number of active cases, eight are city-districts or districts that constitute a single city. Most major metropolitan cities in the country are districts among themselves (with the exception of Delhi, which consists of 11 revenue districts). Raigad (5,192 active cases) and Palghar (4,916 active cases), both in Maharashtra, are the only two districts in the top 10 that are not entirely urban. Three of the five worst-hit cities in terms of the total number of active cases are in Maharashtra (Chart 1), a fact that highlights the overwhelming numbers emerging from the spread of the virus in the western Indian state. Thane has 34,721 active cases – the highest in the country – with Pune at the third spot with 25,510 active cases and Mumbai at the fourth spot with 22,888 active infections. Hyderabad, which has the second highest number of active cases in the country, appears with stand-out numbers with nearly 99% (28,783) of the 29,111 cases reported in the city currently active -- a clear indication of how things have suddenly turned bad for the southern city. Among the top 10 cities based on active cases, Delhi has the lowest proportion of active cases – 15.2% – followed closely by Ahmedabad (at 10th spot) with 15.4% of cases active. Click here for complete coronavirus coverageIn terms of states, Maharashtra continues to have the highest number of active cases with 112,099 active infections (40.7% of the total Covid-19 cases in the state) as of Wednesday. This means one-third of all active cases in the country are in Maharashtra, which is not surprising as it is the state with the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths and accounts for 28% of all cases in the country.For perspective on the high active case count in Maharashtra, the state has more active cases than the combined total of such cases in the next four states on the list — Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Karnataka and Gujarat.Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said that taking cognisance of the lack of availability of beds, especially ICU beds in some cities in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) the state has ramped up health infrastructure to deal with this rise in active cases. “With the help of community participation and new interventions like antigen tests involving private doctors, the state will contain the spread in MMR and other parts of the state too.” Dr Avinash Supe, former dean of Mumbai-based KEM hospital and member of the expert committee appointed by the state to recommend steps to curb the spread, said that he expects active cases to come down in a few weeks. “Comparing the total number of cases in the country, Maharashtra’s share has come down drastically; it used to be almost half one point of time. It’s now less than a third of the national total. Even Mumbai’s number of active cases has improved in the last few weeks and we expect it to come down to 15000 in the next couple of weeks,” he said.With 59% of all cases active, Karnataka has the highest proportion of active cases to the total caseload. The state, which on Tuesday replaced Gujarat as the fourth worst-hit state in the country, has seen a sharp rise in cases over the past two weeks. This recent spike in cases in the state is also responsible for the high number of active cases – with two-thirds of its caseload appearing in just the last two weeks, the state’s recoveries are yet to catch up.This trend of states with fast-rising caseloads having a high proportion of active cases is also visible in other states such as Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal (Chart 2) – all of them have a higher proportion of active cases than the national average (34.2%).With inputs from Surendra P Gangan in Mumbai||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-cities-account-for-half-of-india-s-active-infections/story-jA9UvWLUfC2hzBoZkytaaP.html
17-07-2020||India||India lifted 270 million people out of poverty in 2005-15, says study||India lifted as many as 270 million people out of multidimensional poverty between 2005-6 and 2015-16 – the most in a global study of 75 countries – reflecting progress before the coronavirus pandemic hit, a new report released on Thursday reveals.Based on an index developed at the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), the data released by the United Nations Development Programme and the university’s centre suggests that the progress is at risk and that the pandemic is a reminder that stake-holders need to look beyond income to tackle poverty in all its forms.OPHI director Sabina Alkire, who led the development of the multidimensional poverty index (MPI) in 2010, said: “India remains the country that has the largest reduction in number of poor, with over 270 million persons leaving poverty 2005-6 to 2015-16”.“However, the report also soberly finds that on average, poverty levels will be set back three to 10 years due to Covid-19, unless action is taken to prevent or swiftly redress the rise of under-nutrition and children leaving school”.“Our hope is that this global MPI report will incite action in solidarity with the poor, so that the immediate crisis is not as deep as feared, and that we ‘build back better’ into a radiant India with permanently less disadvantage and human poverty”, she added.The MPI looks beyond income to include access to safe water, education, electricity, food and six other indicators. The report shows that 65 out of 75 countries studied significantly reduced their multidimensional poverty levels between 2000 and 2019.In China, 70 million people left multidimensional poverty between 2010 and 2014, while in Bangladesh, the numbers declined by 19 million between 2014 and 2019.Alkire said: “Covid-19 is having a profound impact on the development landscape. But this data – from before the pandemic – is a message of hope…The MPI – with its information on both the level and composition of poverty – provides the data needed to pinpoint where and how poverty manifests itself”.The report adds that addressing each challenge requires a different approach, many of which need to go beyond improving income, particularly in the light of UNDP’s work encouraging societies to take the opportunity to rethink development pathways and ‘build back better’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-lifted-270-million-people-out-of-poverty-in-2005-15-finds-study/story-1Ck6ZTy92wBHJx6QF4GbJP.html

The incidents come while the city has been receiving heavy rainfall for the past three days.In one of the incidents, two people were killed and three were injured after large portion of a ground-plus-six storey residential structure collapsed in Fort. Calling it one of the most risky operations by the fire brigade, officials said several people were feared to be trapped under the debris while some were stranded inside the building as the staircase was blocked.The incident took place around 4.43pm when a large portion of Bhanushali building on Mint Road in Fort collapsed. Eight fire engines, two rescue vans and around 10 ambulances were pressed into service. The rescue operation was going at the time of going to press.Prabhat Rahangdale, chief fire officer of Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB), said, “People are trapped under the debris and some are stranded inside. Five have been rescued and sent to hospital, of whom two are dead. Search operation for trapped individuals is in progress.” Civic official said the building was vacated by the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) to carry out repair works, however, some residents were still residing in it in violation of the eviction notice.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal after reaching the spot told the media, “This is a Mhada cess building. There were 12 tenants who were vacated after the building was found to be dangerous, but around three of them had returned.”In another incident, two people were killed and 13 were injured after a ground-plus-two storey chawl in Malvani, Malad collapsed around 2.35pm.

17-07-2020||India||SC seeks Centre, Kerala replies on plea against ban on animal sacrifice||Hearing a plea challenging the validity of a Kerala law that prohibits animal sacrifice for appeasement of deity in temples, the Supreme Court on Thursday said that there was an apparent contradiction in our laws which allow killing of animals for consumption but prohibit such killing when it comes to offering the meat as sacrifice for deity and then consuming it.Heading the three-judge bench, Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde said,“There is a dichotomy in law. Killing animals and consuming is allowed. But killing animals, offering to deity and then consuming is not permissible.” Killing of animals for consumption of their meat is allowed as per the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. However, the law which is under challenge in the present case, the Kerala Animals and Bird Sacrifices Prohibition Act, 1968 (Act), prohibits killing of animals for appeasement of deity in temples and temple precincts even though such meat is later consumed by humans.The court issued notice to the Kerala government, central government and Animal Welfare Board in the plea. The case is now likely to be heard on August 10 along with similar cases from Himachal Pradesh and Tripura concerning validity of animal sacrifice in temples.The Kerala Animals and Bird Sacrifices Prohibition Act was challenged on the ground that it violates right to equality guaranteed by Article 14 and the right to practice religion and manage religious affairs under articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution.The petitioners, who are followers of Shakthi worshipping tradition, claimed that appeasing deity through animal sacrifice is an essential religious practice mandated by religious texts and scriptures followed by them and they should, therefore, be permitted to do the same.“In Shakthi worship as per its scriptures and practices popularly known as “pramanas”, animal sacrifice is essential and unavoidable for the propitiation of the deity”, the petition filed through advocate A Karthik stated.The Act was earlier challenged before the Kerala high court, which on June 16 dismissed the plea. The Act imposes ban on sacrifice of animals and birds in temples for propitiation of deity and criminalises the same. Violation of the law attracts jail term of upto 3 months and fine of Rs. 300.The petitioners claimed that the Act violates right to equality because identical practices by other religious communities are not prohibited by the Act.Further, it was also contended that the Act only penalizes killing of animals for propitiation of deity and animal or bird sacrifice for all other purposes including personal consumption within temple precincts is not prohibited.“If the object of the law were to ensure preservation and protection of animals, it would demand its uniform application across all religious communities”, the petition stated.The petitioners also submitted that the law enacted by the central government to prevent cruelty to animals, Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960 specifically permits sacrificing animals as ritual in Hindu temples throughout India.“Kerala Animals and Birds Sacrifices Prohibition Act, 1968 is repugnant to the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 insofar as the Act operates in the same entry and criminalizes an act which the Union Legislation chooses explicitly not to criminalize”, the plea added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-centre-kerala-replies-on-plea-against-ban-on-animal-sacrifice/story-zjn1yLLJbXrLbDamMrhvYI.html

There is also a conversation that it would take 10 to 15 days to topple the government.Newly appointed Rajasthan Congress chief Govind Singh Dotasara tweeted saying the audio tapes exposed the BJP’s plan to topple a democratically elected government. “The tapes clearly show the role of BJP in the present bid to topple the Congress government,” he said.Also read: Congress ready for a ‘face saver’ for Pilot, he keeps them on the edgeBJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said the tapes running on TV channels didn’t seem authentic. “Even they (channels) aren’t verifying the authenticity.

17-07-2020||India||Global study reveals India lifted most out of poverty in 2005-16||Prasun SonwalkarLondon As many as 270 million people in India were lifted out of multidimensional poverty between 2005-06 and 2015-16, a global study of 75 countries has revealed. India showed the largest reduction in number of poor, the study shows.Based on an index developed at the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), the data released on Thursday by the United Nations Development Programme and the university’s centre suggests that this progress is at risk due to the coronavirus disease pandemic.OPHI director Sabina Alkire, who led the development of the multidimensional poverty index (MPI) in 2010, said: “India remains the country that has the largest reduction in number of poor, with over 270 million persons leaving poverty 2005-6 to 2015-16.”“However, the report also soberly finds that on average, poverty levels will be set back three to 10 years due to Covid-19, unless action is taken to prevent or swiftly redress the rise of under-nutrition and children leaving school,” Alkire said.“Our hope is that this global MPI report will incite action in solidarity with the poor, so that the immediate crisis is not as deep as feared, and that we ‘build back better’ into a radiant India with permanently less disadvantage and human poverty,” she added.The report shows that 65 out of the 75 countries studied significantly reduced their multidimensional poverty levels between 2000 and 2019.In China, 70 million people left multidimensional poverty between 2010 and 2014, while in Bangladesh, the numbers declined by 19 million between 2014 and 2019.Alkire said: “Covid-19 is having a profound impact on the development landscape. But this data, from before the pandemic, is a message of hope…The MPI, with its information on both the level and composition of poverty, provides the data needed to pinpoint where and how poverty manifests itself”.Apart from income, the MPI also includes access to safe water, education, electricity, food and six other indicators.The report adds that addressing each challenge requires a different approach, many of which need to go beyond improving income, particularly in the light of UNDP’s work encouraging societies to take the opportunity to rethink development pathways and ‘build back better’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-study-reveals-india-lifted-most-out-of-poverty-in-2005-16/story-bbxvX0hDVcTzLokyxvjQFI.html
17-07-2020||India||Sachin Pilot camp moves HC, plea to be heard today||Former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and his team of 18 lawmakers on Thursday approached the Rajasthan high court’s Jaipur bench to seek cancellation of the disqualification notice served on them by assembly speaker CP Joshi, insisting that the anti-defection law could not be invoked against them for disagreeing outside the House with some government decisions and policies.The petition will be heard on Friday by a two-member division bench of the high court at 1pm.Pilot’s decision to move the Rajasthan high court is seen by Congress leaders as a signal that he intends to pursue his battle with chief minister Ashok Gehlot, and underlines his growing distance with the party that removed him on Tuesday as the head of its state unit and as deputy CM of Rajasthan after differences came to a head last weekend.The hearing was deferred after Pilot’s camp – represented by senior advocates Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi -- filed an amended petition in the evening, incorporating additional grounds of challenge to its earlier plea filed before a single-judge bench.Also read: The tale of Rajesh and Sachin Pilot, writes Rajdeep SardesaiIf the Pilot camp is disqualified, it would reduce the strength of the assembly and place Gehlot on a stronger footing in a House with reduced strength until elections are held to fill their seats. The battle in the court is important from the point of view of the numerical strength in the assembly, which will matter in the event of a no-confidence motion against the government.The joint petition was taken up by the high court’s justice Satish Sharma on Thursday afternoon, when Salve sought time to amend the petition to broaden its scope.Justice Sharma resumed the hearing a few hours later at 5pm. The amended plea challenged the Constitutional validity of a key provision in the 10th Schedule of the Constitution: Clause 2(1)(a). This states that a lawmaker will be liable for disqualification on the ground of defection if he voluntarily gives up membership of the political party on whose ticket he was elected.Also read| Sachin Pilot, disqualification and the Tenth Schedule: An explainerThe petition said that clause 2(1)(a) is very wide, since previous judgments have even construed the expression of opinion or views by lawmakers against party leadership as conduct falling within its contours. Therefore, the petition argued, that the clause violates freedom of speech under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.The Congress maintained that the action of the speaker was justified and within the ambit of the provisions. “Everyone needs to follow the party’s whip. The speaker has full rights to send notices to MLAs,” state transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said.Differences between the CM and his former deputy were seen to be simmering for months, and the acrimony became public in the last two days after Pilot was sacked from his party positions. On Wednesday, Gehlot said Pilot was part of a conspiracy to topple the government and that “traits such as looking good and speaking fluent English” did not matter in public life. Pilot, earlier in the day, said Gehlot had humiliated him and kept him out of key decisions. As things stand, the numbers still remain slightly tenuous for Gehlot. He appears to have the support of 101 members — same as the majority mark in the 200-member state assembly (though this does not include speaker CP Joshi). Pilot has 18 other Congress MLAs and three independents in his camp. The BJP and its ally Rashtriya Loktrantrik Party have 75 seats. One Congress MLA, Bhanwarlal Meghwal, is indisposed, though he is said to be close to Pilot. Pilot’s primary argument was that his missing two meetings of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) did not amount to defection. According to the Constitution’s 10th Schedule, the anti-defection provisions kick in if a member voluntarily gives up membership of the political party or votes contrary to the party’s direction in the assembly.Pilot also said speaker Joshi may act under the influence of chief minister Gehlot.It is evident that the 10th Schedule of Constitution is sought to be used as a guise to impose the majoritarian view on the members and to stifle their freedom of speech and fair play in democratic setup, the petition stated.Elected representatives who disagree with certain policies or decisions of some members of the party cannot be counted as acting against the interests of the party; a healthy discourse on the pros and cons of policies of a political party cannot be inferred to imply voluntarily giving up membership under the anti-defection law, the petition said. It added that they had never spoken about quitting the Congress or trying to pull down the Gehlot government.The complaint against them was therefore “based on assumptions and surmises” and were without a factual basis to support such concerns, the petitioners argued.It contrasted the speaker’s inaction on a disqualification complaint against Bahujan Samaj Party legislators who crossed over to the Congress with Joshi’s July 14 notice that was issued within hours of a complaint by the Congress chief whip.The petition by 19 lawmakers also said that there would be “dangerous consequences” if an elected member is deprived of membership “merely on the whims and fancies” of party leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilot-18-mlas-move-hc-against-disqualification/story-nCRGtDnVIGSl739yiVobpM.html
17-07-2020||India||174 Indians challenge US suspension of H-1B visas||Washington President Donald Trump’s temporary suspension through a June 22 proclamation of non-immigrant work visas such as the H-1B, L-1, H-2A and J has been challenged by 174 Indian nationals, including seven minor children, in a federal court in Washington DC.The lawsuit filed by Wasden Banias, a law firm, has asked the court to direct the state department to decide on the plaintiffs’ H-1B and H-4 (for H-1B dependents) applications, direct the department of homeland security to not refuse entry to the plaintiffs, and strike down the restrictions. On June 22, President Trump issued a proclamation suspending most non-immigrant work visas, including the H-1Bs till December 21 ostensibly to ensure Americans have the first shot at jobs that become available as the economy emerged from Covid-19-related lockdowns and layoffs.Indians hired by US firms and US-branches of Indian firms are the largest recipient of H-1B visas, accounting for more than 70% of the 85,000 issued annually. There are fears that the temporary suspension could lead to more lasting changes and restrictions, based on reported plans of the administration. The president is said to be working on an executive order overhauling legal immigration system, to move it towards merit-based from family-based.The June 22 proclamation does not impact H-1B visa holders already in the United States, but those with approved petitions and those applying afresh. The lawsuit cited the cases of a family, which was on H-1B visa with a pending clearance for immigrant visa. They traveled to India recently and wanted to renew their H-1B or H-4 visas but there had been no progress on their applications. More than 70% of the 85,000 H1-B visas issued annually go to Indians.HT has reported how the restrictions has separated families -- with mothers and fathers stuck in India, separated from their children. Many of the H1B visa holders have built lives in the US; in many cases, their children were born in that country and are US citizens. The June 22 proclamation also extended the suspension of immigration, and the issuance of Green Cards.The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday. The same day, several lawmakers wrote to the labor secretary Eugene Scalia to end the H-1B restriction. “Throughout this administration, the president has continued to lament the alleged abuses of the immigration system while failing to address the systemic problems that have persisted and allowed businesses and employers to exploit and underpay immigrant workers, guest workers and American workers,” the lawmakers wrote as reported by PTI.“This misguided attempt by the president to scapegoat immigrants for policy failures during the pandemic not only serves to hurt immigrants, but dismisses the true problem of a broken work visa program that is in desperate need of reform,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/174-indians-challenge-us-suspension-of-h-1b-visas/story-HqntqTjcZvOawO53Vjg9rM.html
17-07-2020||India||Kerala CM’s former principal secretary suspended||Thiruvananthapuram:The Kerala government on Thursday suspended chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s former principal secretary M Sivasankar, a senior Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer, for violating service rules. Making the announcement, the CM said the action was taken on the basis of an inquiry report that pointed to lapses on Sivasankar’s part. “Inquiry report pointed out that there are some lapses on his part and he violated all-India service rules,” said the CM.The inquiry was conducted by a two-member panel headed by chief secretary Viswas Mehta. Sivasankar was removed from the post of the CM’s principal secretary last week after allegations that he was close to Swapna Suresh, one of the key accused in the gold smuggling case. He was questioned by the customs department for several hours on Wednesday. However, officials found some discrepancies in his statement and he has been called in for questioning again, people familiar with the matter said. He is likely to be arrested soon, the people said. The customs department seized 30 kg gold from a consignment which came in the name of an official of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on June 5. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has taken over the case and several other central agencies are also probing the case.Meanwhile, the Ministry of External Affairs has cancelled the passport of Faisal Fareed, the third accused in the case, who is reported to be in the UAE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-s-former-principal-secretary-suspended/story-MA87Zz4UII1qj7kmGRHTiP.html
17-07-2020||India||25 Cong MLAs appointed to various posts by C’garh govt||Raipur: The Chhattisgarh government has appointed 25 Congress legislators as parliamentary secretaries and to various posts in statutory bodies, boards, and commissions in the last three days, sparking criticism from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that linked the appointments to infighting within the ruling party and the ongoing turmoil in Rajasthan.On Tuesday, the Congress appointed 15 MLAs as parliamentary secretaries to assist 12 cabinet ministers. On Wednesday, six more lawmakers were named as chairmen and vice-chairmen of two development authorities. And, on Thursday, four legislators were appointed to state boards and commissions. With this, 38 of the Congress’s 69 legislators in the 90-member assembly now hold ministerial berths or other government posts. Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel has a 12-member cabinet. BJP leader Brijmohan Agrawal said the government hurriedly made the appointments as it fears a political crisis like the one in Rajasthan, where former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and MLAs close to him rebelled against chief minister Ashok Gehlot. “There is a huge discontentment among Congress legislators. The ruling party decided in a hurry to appoint them as parliamentary secretaries. This is a fallout of what happened in Madhya Pradesh and might happen in Rajasthan. The Congress is afraid...” Agrawal said.The Congress returned to power in 2018 after 15 years of BJP rule. Congress leader RP Singh dismissed Agrawal’s comments, saying the BJP has only 14 members in the state assembly and the party needed to understand where it stood. He said the list of these appointments was prepared before the Rajasthan crisis. “It is a coincidence that it has been announced now.”Another BJP leader, Ajay Chandrakar, said a growing rift between Congress leaders in Chhattisgarh is well known. Shailesh Nitin Trivedi, Congress’s communications head, said Chandrakar and Agarwal’s are two major factions in the BJP since 2000. “Now, they are talking about rift and infighting. They need to first get their house in order.”Political commentator Parivesh Mishra said using posts in government-owned corporations and bodies to placate the disgruntled people has been a practice common across party lines in various states. “In Chhattisgarh, the appointments were long due. The timing coincided with political events in Rajasthan...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/25-cong-mlas-appointed-to-various-posts-by-c-garh-govt/story-reeyVuiykDnKBirZodgfVI.html
17-07-2020||India||In gold smuggling case report to NIA, Kerala cops point to ‘terror angle’||The Kerala police have sent a report to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and asked it to investigate the “terror angle” in all major gold smuggling cases in the state, two officials aware of the matter said. The Kerala police suspect that some smugglers and hawala operators have terror links, one of the two officials told HT. Hawala transactions worth over Rs 1,000 crore annually on an average, have been taking place in the state, he added.The request comes as the NIA took charge of the probe of the seizure of 30 kg of 24-carat gold from Thiruvananthapuram airport on July 5. An attempt was made to smuggle the gold through diplomatic baggage, which according to the Vienna Convention, is not checked by Customs officials. “Since NIA is investigating the Thiruvananthapuram gold smuggling case under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), it might want to look at other cases and their link,” a Kerala police officer told HT over the phone, requesting anonymity. “We have given a report to the Centre and NIA on our cases. More reports are being prepared on similar activities.”On July 10, the NIA filed a First Information Report (FIR) against four persons: P Sarith Kumar, who was arrested by Customs officials on July 5, and three others, Swapna Suresh, Sandip Nair and Fazil Fareed, an alleged smuggler from Ernakulum but based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and charged them under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). On July 15, it added one more name to the FIR, an alleged gold smuggler named KT Ramees.A team arrested Suresh and Nair who have been sent to judicial custody till July 21. They are currently being interrogated by the investigation agency. The NIA has also approached Interpol for a blue notice against Fareed. A blue notice is issued for additional information about a person’s identity, location, or activities in relation to a crime. The agency found that Fareed forged the UAE seal and emblem to ensure diplomatic protection for the baggage.On Wednesday, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s former principal secretary M Sivasankar was grilled in connection with the smuggling case.NIA last week said gold smuggling into India from offshore locations threatens the country’s economic stability, national security and amounts to terrorism as per UAPA’s Section 15. In a statement, it added the fresh smuggling case has national and international linkages. NIA cited its initial probe and added it has revealed that the proceeds of smuggled gold could be used for financing terrorism in India.Apart from NIA and Customs, Research and Analysis Wing and Intelligence Bureau are also coordinating with the agencies to unearth the gold smuggling and hawala networks in Kerala, a second official said in Delhi.The Customs department has arrested 12 people in relation to gold smuggling and detained four since this case came to light.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-report-to-nia-kerala-cops-point-to-terror-angle/story-Dm4SyQzWBiZtlt9o7MwDyH.html
17-07-2020||India||Panel formed to review J&K internet curbs: Govt tells Supreme Court||The Central government told the Supreme Court that it did, as ordered to by the court on May 11, set up a committee to review curbs on 4G internet connections in Jammu & Kashmir, but not taken a decision yet because of a high number of terrorist attacks. The committee is headed by home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, it added. This is the first time the government has shared information about the committee -- and it came in the course of a contempt petition by the Forum for Media Professionals that the court’s May 11 order on forming such a panel wasn’t complied with. Attorney general KK Vengugopal also said that the committee met twice, on May 16 and June 10, and spoke of “20-page minutes” of the meetings. He said he was even willing to place the minutes of the two meetings in a sealed cover before the Court.He added that the committee sought details from the J&K administration on what steps could be taken to ensure that right to life, right to education, right to business and right to free speech and expression of J&K citizens is not hampered, and that it decided to meet after two months. In the midst of the pandemic, residents in the union territory continue to live without high-speed mobile internet, affecting education, work, and life. A lot of activities have moved online in the wake of the coronavirus disease. High-speed internet and all mobile services were suspended on August 5 last year when the government abrogated Article 370 that gave the state special status. While mobile telephone services have been restored, 4G mobile internet has not been. Responding to Venugopal, the bench of justices NV Ramana, R Subhash Reddy and BR Gavai asked the Centre to explain whether a decision had been taken on its May 11 direction mandating a periodic review of orders suspending telecom services in Jammu and Kashmir, and why the decision wasn’t in the public domain.  “Nothing is in public domain yet. What is the problem in informing public that there is a Committee and they are looking into this issue?”Senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi, who argued the contempt petition, pointed to an alleged fallacy in the attorney general’s submission that terrorist attacks in J&K had increased. He produced a statement made by home minister Amit Shah that the number of terrorist incidents reported in J&K have been the lowest since the scrapping of Article 370 in August last year.Ahmadi said the contempt was clearly made out as the direction of the Court mandated the special committee to review the suspension of telecom services every week, consider alternatives suggested by the petitioners, and place its decisions in the public domain. “At a time when the entire nation has easy access to internet, people in J&K are being denied this access. They can’t attend online classes, connect through internet or attend Court hearings through videoconferencing. This itself is violation of their Article 14 right,” Ahmadi said, referring to the pat of the Constitution that promises all Indians equality before the law. The court asked Venugopal to submit a response in one week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panel-formed-to-review-j-k-internet-curbs-govt-tells-sc/story-r0XBXBUyd4Hvtzmhrz4qnJ.html
17-07-2020||India||Saga of an audacious gold smuggling bid in Kerala||On July 3, P. Sarith Kumar walked into the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport to collect a rather heavy carton addressed to an official working at the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consular office in the city. The bespectacled 39-year-old Kumar claimed to be a Public Relations Officer with the consulate who had come to collect the carton for an attaché. Two days later, he was arrested by Customs officials for attempting to smuggle gold into the country. After receiving the nod from the ministry of external affairs, officers of the Customs (Preventive) Commissionerate opened the 70-kilogram carton in the presence of the acting in-charge of the UAE consulate. The sight that greeted their eyes may not have been what they expected: the carton had an assortment of pipes, taps, and door handles amidst food items and other electronics, according to news website The Lede. The pipes, however, weren’t hollow. At least 30 kilograms of 24-carat gold — the best quality — estimated to be worth at least Rs 15 crore, were hidden inside them. Since January, seven air cargo consignments, some heavier than 30 kg, had reportedly arrived in the state. Preliminary investigations by the Customs officials found that P. Sarith, who had worked for the UAE consulate but wasn’t currently employed with them as he claimed, had received multiple such consignments. Officials suspect that at least 300 kg of smuggled gold flooded the yellow metal market already. Last week, Kerala chief minister Pinnarayi Vijayan wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting a probe by central agencies. “Every link of this crime should be unravelled,” he wrote. “The case has serious implications as this undermines the economy of the Nation. In fact, it has more than one angle warranting a thorough investigation,” he wrote on July 8. On July 10, the National Investigation Authority (NIA), which usually tackles terror-related cases, took up its first gold-smuggling related case. It filed a First Information Report against four: Kumar, who was already under arrest, and three others — Swapna Suresh, Sandip Nair and Fazil Fareed, an alleged smuggler from Ernakulum but based in the UAE — whose names were revealed during interrogation. On July 15, it added one more name to the FIR: an alleged gold smuggler named KT Ramees.The NIA charged all of them under Sections 16, 17, and 18 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), which is usually invoked to deal with terrorists and those who pose a threat to the integrity of the nation. The suspected offence: Conspiracy and commission of terrorist act by raising funds through gold smuggling to threaten the economic security and monetary stability of India. On Wednesday, the NIA moved the Interpol to extradite Fareed from the UAE, as a Kochi court issued an arrest warrant against him.A multi-agency probe monitored by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval is underway which includes the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), the Intelligence Bureau (IB), and Enforcement Directorate (ED) besides the NIA and Customs (Preventive) Division.Suspects tracked downOn Saturday, the NIA arrested Suresh and Nair from a hotel in Bengaluru, and brought them to Cochin on July 12. The two have been remanded to NIA custody by a special court till July 21.Suresh worked at the UAE consulate general’s office before she joined as an operational manager of the Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited under the state IT Ministry in 2017. It was likely at the consular office that Suresh and Kumar came to know each other, and even after they stopped working at the consulate, they remained in touch with each other.Suresh, in her early forties, claims to hold a Bachelors in Commerce degree from Maharashtra’s Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Technological University. However, the university clarified that it didn’t offer such a course. The controller of examinations at the varsity, Dr. Vivek S Sathe, said her degree was fake. Her estranged brother Bright Suresh, based in the United States, told local television channels that she had not passed her matriculation.However, Suresh is known to be fluent in Arabic, English, Hindi, and Malayalam. She also played a key role in many programmes such as the Loka Kerala Sabha in 2020, a global meeting of non-resident expatriates from the state.Kerala assembly speaker S Sivaramakrishnan told media channels that he had inaugurated an automobile workshop owned Sandip Nair — whom he did not know — three months ago, at Suresh’s request. “I never knew about her past and I thought she is a high-ranking official,” the speaker said.Soon after she was named in this case, Suresh went underground.Last week, she applied for bail at Kerala High Court— her case was to come up on July 15. She also circulated an audio tape to a news channel in which she claimed that there was a concerted move to target the Kerala government ahead of the assembly elections next year and she had been made a scapegoat. She also claimed that she made a call to the Customs on July 3 to release the consignment because she was asked by the UAE consular office to do. She said she feared for her life.Since Suresh was arrested, the anticipatory bail hearing now stands infructuous.A political stormThe seizure of gold smuggled through the cover of a diplomatic channel has set off a political storm in Kerala as opposition party members have demanded chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s resignation, claiming that he had knowledge of the wrong-doing. Soon after she was named, customs officials raided Suresh’s house. During their investigation it was revealed that the chief minister’s principal secretary M Sivasankar was a frequent visitor to her house. In a series of swift political moves, Sivasankar was removed from his post on July 7, the chief minister denied the involvement of his office in Suresh’s appointment in the IT ministry body, Suresh was sacked from her job, and on July 8, Vijayan wrote the letter to the PM seeking a probe by central agencies.However, the Opposition wasn’t willing to let go and members protested, calling for his resignation. “Almost a week passed since the case came up. Not a single FIR was filed against Swapna Suresh though many cheating incidents against her surfaced including fake certificate. We suspect she is getting protection from higher-ups,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala on July 11.Though the CM welcomed the NIA probe — he said that such a probe would worry many people — the party is wary because it fears that his office may also come under the ambit of inquiry. “Nobody can browbeat an elected government. The union government announced the probe as sought by the CM. Let them investigate but we will not allow any victimization in this regard,” said Anathalavattom Anandan, senior leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).The Customs department questioned M Sivasankar at their office in Thiruvananthpuram for nine hours, till the wee hours of July 15. A day later he was suspended. “It is a big setback to the CM who is trying for a second term riding on the so-called Covid success story,” said political observer Sunnykutty Abraham.Meanwhile, the MEA has also had to ensure that diplomatic relations between the two countries are not affected because of this case. The Gulf is home to millions of Indian expatriates with a range of work profiles; at least 1.8 million belong to Kerala. The UAE has ordered a probe into this matter and said that it will assist the ongoing probe by Indian agencies, in a brief statement. Last week, the MEA minister of state V Muraleedharan also clarified that the baggage was not in the diplomatic baggage category and the Customs department had only sought the ministry’s nod to open the package due to the rules stipulated under the Vienna Convention, a framework on diplomatic relations between countries.Meanwhile, the MEA has also made a request to the UAE embassy in Delhi to meet a few employees at the consular office in Thiruvananthapuram for more details. The acting in-charge of the UAE consulate, who present during the opening of the consignment on July 5, left the country this week.Yellow metal marketIt started with innocuous looking packets of cookies, noodles and dates sent from the United Arab Emirates to its consular office in Thiruvananthapuram, which raised the suspicions of customs deputy commissioner Rama Murthy.Since January, seven such consignments flew in including door knobs, water taps and even shower caps. The trouble was that the packages which came as air cargo addressed to the consulate, enjoyed diplomatic immunity. In Kerala, the trade of illegal gold is a thriving business as it is cheaper in the Gulf. What’s more with an import duty of 12 % and an additional GST of 3 %, smuggled gold often costs Rs 8-10 lakh per kilogram lesser than legally imported gold.“The state tops in the country in terms of gold seizure. During the last financial year, 550 kg gold was seized from four airports of the state. At least half of this quantity is from Kozhikode international airport,” Sumit Kumar, Customs commissioner in-charge of Kerala and Lakshadweep region, said.Dates, bra straps, belt buckles, shoe soles, and sausages are few the ingenious methods used to smuggle gold into the country.“It is a fact, that a good quantity of smuggled gold is present in the market. We have to change our flawed import policy to check this. Tax evasion is also high in the industry, which gives employment to 60 lakh people directly and indirectly,” says Malabar Group Chairman M P Ahmed, who runs one of the largest jewellery store chains in the country.According to DRI officials, who spoke anonymously to HT, the union government was waiting for an opportunity to intervene, as they suspected that much of the smuggled gold also funded terror activities and hawala operations.“Custom and DRI have limitations in a foreign land. NIA can intervene here effectively and dig into the plush network. Invoking terror sections will really help to unearth the well-entrenched syndicate,” said the senior DRI official in Kochi.But this case has also given other agencies a filip to get tough on smuggling. Customs commissioner in-charge of Kerala and Lakshadweep Sumit Kumar, on Wednesday, issued an ultimatum to smugglers to surrender. At least six persons in connection with gold smuggling have been arrested.“We have a list of regular offenders and we are out to break their syndicate. The multi-agency probe is going as planned,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/saga-of-an-audacious-gold-smuggling-bid/story-NNHIsiPOwMk8GTTylNq7mN.html
17-07-2020||India||Attack on Dalit couple: 6 police personnel suspended in Madhya Pradesh||Six police personnel, including a sub-inspector, were suspended on Thursday for beating up a Dalit couple for resisting an anti-encroachment drive in Madhya Pradesh’s Guna district on Tuesday. The couple also consumed pesticides in protest and are in hospital, where the district administration said they are out of danger. The incident provoked outrage after a video went viral. “An ugly situation was created due to Rajkumar Ahirwar and his wife [Savitri] consuming pesticide during anti-encroachment drive initiated by the revenue department on July 14. Sub-inspector Ashok Singh Kushwah was sent to maintain law and order. However, a video went viral regarding the use of force by the police team. Hence, the police personnel who were present on the spot are being suspended given their suspected role in the use of force,” Guna police superintendent Tarun Nayak said in an order, a copy of which has been seen by HT. Apart from Kushwah, the others suspended were Rajendra Sharma, Pawan Yadav, Narendra Rawat, Neetu Yadav, and Rani Raghuvanshi, , all constables at the Cantonment police station, Guna.The police personnel also assaulted Ahirwar’s brother, Shishupal. Ahirwar’s mother, Geeta Bai, said they repeatedly requested the police team to let them stay until they harvested their crop. She said police did not listen to them, abused, and beat them.The district administration says the four-acre land was earmarked for a government college and the state government released Rs 12 crore to begin the building’s construction a year ago. But a local strongman, Babbu Pardi, encroached upon the land and rented it out to the Ahirwars for farming illegally. The Ahirwars say they took a loan of R3 lakh and paid Pardi to grow crops on the land. The state government on Wednesday announced a high-level inquiry into the incident and transferred Guna collector S Vishwanathan, Nayak, and inspector general (Gwalior zone) Raja Babu Singh. Vishwanathan had earlier defended the police action, saying the local residents resisted the police’s anti-encroachment drive. Senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia tweeted: “The Guna SP and Collector have been removed, and inquiry has been sought into the incident. I am confident that action will be taken against all those who are responsible for this heinous act.” In a tweet on Wednesday, Scindia said: “Guna incident is unfortunate. I had a discussion with chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and requested him to take action against insensitive and irresponsible officials. Taking a serious note of the incident the CM has ordered shifting of Guna collector and SP.”The opposition Congress attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government as the video of the assault went viral on social media on Wednesday. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi posted the video on Twitter and said: “Our fight is against this ideology and injustice.”The Congress said a party delegation will visit Guna on Friday and submit a report on the incident to state party chief Kamal Nath. The delegation will gather facts about the incident, said Congress leader Chandraprabhash Shekhar.

17-07-2020||India||Extreme rainfall from July 19 may trigger more floods in NE : IMD||Northeastern states, including flood-hit areas like Assam, are likely to receive extremely heavy rains from Sunday that will trigger further flooding in the region, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Thursday. Widespread and heavy rain is also expected in the northwestern plains, including Delhi, from Friday to Monday, it added. Delhi has received 52% less rainfall this season while northwestern India has a 16% rain deficiency.National Weather Forecasting Centre senior scientist R K Jenamani said the monsoon trough, which had moved to the foothills around July 8, moved back to its normal position around July 14. Jenamani added it is likely to move northwards again. “The western end of the monsoon trough will move to northwest India, where it will bring heavy and widespread rains while the eastern end will move to the Himalayan foothills bringing extremely heavy rainfall to the eastern and northeastern states. These states should be prepared.”IMD director general M Mohapatra said extremely heavy rains can trigger flooding once again in these regions.The death toll from floods in Assam rose to 66 on Wednesday as six more people drowned. The deluge has affected over 3.5 million people and submerged around 90% of the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve.The Central Water Commission on Wednesday said 52 stations in Bihar, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Jharkhand, and Arunachal Pradesh have reported severe flood and above normal flood situation. Severe flood is declared when water levels touch or exceed the danger level but are below the highest level.Parts of Maharashtra and Konkan have been receiving very heavy rain since Tuesday with some places recording over 20 cm rain over two days.Tillari Dam in Maharashtra’s Kolhapur district has filled up to 80% of its full capacity. Since heavy rain has been predicted in its catchment, water releases from the dam as per standard operating procedure should be made, the commission said. There is also a possibility of urban flooding in Mumbai, according to Central Water Commission CWC) . Sudden rise in water levels was expected amid very heavy rains and high waves in the range of 3.5-3.7 metres until Friday along the Maharashtra coast from Malvan to Vasai and cause flooding, according to CWC. Nine states have recorded excess rains—20 to 59% above normal--until Thursday. As many as two have received large excess—over 60% above normal. Eighteen states are in the normal category— (-19% to 19%) and seven in deficient (-59% to -20%). One state is in the large deficient category (-99% to -60%).The country has overall received 10% excess rains during the ongoing monsoon season till Thursday. The monsoon is key to India’s farm output as around 55% of the country’s arable land is rain-fed. Moderate to severe thunderstorms and lightning were also very likely over places like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh on Friday. HT on July 5 reported that at least 315 people have been killed due to lightning strikes this year since May 15 mainly in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Lightning incidence has increased by 20% over the last 20 years, according to an analysis of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) based on satellite data from 1995 to 2015. “It is in part due to climate change, which has led to high moisture availability because of the higher ocean surface temperatures,” said S D Pawar, an IITM scientist, who specialises in atmospheric electricity..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/extreme-rainfall-from-july-19-may-trigger-more-floods-in-ne-imd/story-NJvUpingyN5oDcqTscBJ5I.html
17-07-2020||India||Air India seeks to cut costs ahead of privatisation||Air India is seeking to reduce costs and lower its dependence on the government by cutting debt and aircraft leases/rentals and trimming staff and operational expenditure, chairman and managing director Rajiv Bansal said on Thursday.The cost-cutting drive dovetails with a government plan to sell its entire stake in Air India amid increasing debt and mounting losses. The Centre, in January, started the process by releasing an information document for investors and offering access to financial and other data of Air India and its subsidiaries. The government’s entire stake in Air India, its 100% stake in low-cost subsidiary Air India Express Ltd. and 50% stake in ground handling unit Air India SATS Airport Services Private Limited. are on offer.“We are trying to increase the topline, and are trying to contain costs. We are looking at measures of containing cost by reducing debt, reducing staffing cost, operating cost and aircraft rentals,” Bansal said at a press conference with aviation minister Hardeep Puri. “We have cut down staff cost, we have laid off employees working with us post-retirement and we are in negotiations with pilots, cabin crew and other employee categories.”An attempt to auction a majority stake almost two years ago failed to draw any bids. The airline’s accumulated debt is estimated to be more than Rs 69,000 crore. It posted a loss of Rs 8,556 crore in financial year 2018-19, as against a net loss of Rs 5,348 crore in the previous financial year.To Bansal’s comment that Air India wanted to reduce its dependence on the government, Puri said the government may not be in a position to extend financial backing to the national airline “due to the current situation.”“We don’t have a choice, we will have to be persistent with the privatisation effort,” the minister said.Amid the Covid-19 pandemic that has taken a heavy toll on the aviation industry, the government in June extended the deadline for submissions of bids for Air India to August 31, the third extension since the process began in January. Indian airlines will face a revenue loss of Rs 1.3 trillion between fiscal 2020 and 2022 because of the pandemic, according to rating agency Crisil.Earlier this week, the national airline’s board of directors approved a leave without pay (LWP) scheme for permanent staff ranging from six months to two years, extendable to five years. Air India has 9,426 employees on its rolls, out of which 4,200 are on contractual terms, according to the civil aviation ministry.On Thursday, the Indian Commercial Pilots’ Association (ICPA), the pilots’ union of Air India ,wrote to Bansal, alleging that a proposed pay cut for pilots amounted to almost 60% of gross emoluments, adding that pilots had not been paid 70% of their salaries since April.“We have expressed our willingness to negotiate a pay cut in line with the current market conditions. We were told by the ministry officials that we are being compared to one of the leading low cost private carriers, it was then explained to the MoCA {ministry of civil aviation} officials how the worst conditions of these private airlines were being cherry-picked to our disadvantage.,” ICPA said in the letter, a copy of which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times.“The proposed cut for pilots is almost 60% of gross emoluments. It is hilarious to note that the top management has proposed a meagre 3.5% cut on its own gross salary. For eg; the Director, Personnel takes a minuscule cut of 4% on gross pay while a co-pilot who is paid less than the market is given a cut of 60%. How is this justified? Doesn’t this amount to unchecked greed and selfishness,” the letter added.When contacted by HT, a spokesperson for Air India said: these were internal issues on which the airline wouldn’t like to make any comment.“The entire civil aviation industry world over is doing cost cutting. We have to face the reality,” Puri said at the press conference.The global aviation industry has suffered heavy losses because of lockdowns imposed by several countries to curb the spread of the coronovirus disease. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), airlines in the Asia-Pacific region will be the hardest hit by the Covid-19 crisis, with losses expected to be around $29 billion for 2020. This is more than a third of the $84.3 billion industry losses globally. In India alone, IATA expects passenger demand in 2020 to shrink by 49% compared to last year. Potential jobs impact in aviation and sectors dependent on aviation will be felt by more than 3 million people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ai-seeks-to-cut-costs-ahead-of-privatisation/story-BRUPvOHNoV3qP8X7v12oOP.html
17-07-2020||India||Neowise comet sighting likely this week||As anyone who watched the first season of Game of Thrones knows, a comet means different things to different people. In the case of Neowise, which makes its way across Indian skies this week, the sightings are eagerly anticipated. Even tempered with clouds of potential disappointment, they’re drawing amateur astronomy buffs, students, professors and philosophical stargazers to terraces across the country, for a glimpse of a celestial body that last passed by Earth 6,800 years ago.Incidentally, Neowise is visible to the naked eye around sunset; the best dates for viewings are July 22 and 23 (next Wednesday and Thursday), at which point it will be just 200 times as far from us as the moon is.In Chennai, branding and marketing professional and avid birdwatcher AM Aravind hopes this will be the celestial sighting to beat the Ikeya Seki, the Great Comet of 1965, which his father remembers seeing and still brags about. “It was one of the best comet sightings of the last century,” Aravind says. “People tend not to realise how rare it is to be able to see one, particularly with the naked eye.”Aravind, 38, has been tracking celestial events since the Hale-Bopp comet visited in 1995. He tracked the transit of Venus in 2012, the transit of Mercury in 2016 and has witnessed several eclipses.This time, it’s different. In the lockdown, he can’t head to a hill station or the beach at dawn or dusk for a better view. Light pollution in residential areas, now that everyone’s home, makes it harder to observe the night sky. “I did try to see it in the morning a few days ago but it was too close to the sun and it was too bright to see anything,” he says.For Jayshree Kumar, 22, Indore resident and history student on a break before her MA, it’s not about whether we see Comet Neowise, but how it sees us. “Six thousand years ago, when the comet last visited, humans were inventing the written word,” she says. “Now I’m texting my friends on WhatsApp because we can’t get together to watch it on someone’s terrace.”She’s never seen a comet before, but remembers checking out the Super Blood Moon in 2019. “We’re hoping the skies are clear this week. We’re tracking Neowise online via TheSkyLive, which is another way life on Earth has changed,” she says.Varun Bhalerao, 36, has peered further into space than most. The assistant professor with IIT Bombay’s physics department was a principal investigator on India’s first robotic telescope, set up just outside Leh in 2018.“But it’s been forever since I saw a comet,” he admits. “We almost never look through a telescope in our line of work. There’s always a camera or some recording software. I miss looking at the stars the way Sachin Tendulkar might miss playing galli cricket.”Sky gazing, he says, is a level playing field and he remains cautiously optimistic about spotting Neowise in Mumbai’s cloud-laden skies. “A 10-minute window is all you need to sight it, and in any case, we need the rains more than we need comets.”Kumar, in Indore, has a different view in more ways than one. “At a time when the world has lost control over so much,” she says, “Neowise is a reminder that somewhere out there, some things are moving according to plan.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/neowise-comet-sighting-likely-this-week/story-JpkU6R0QbwbMQ8dVgLqQ0K.html
17-07-2020||India||Pending issues holding up participation in Chabahar-Zahedan rail project: India||New Delhi India on Thursday said technical and financial issues yet to be finalised by Iran were holding up New Delhi’s participation in the Chabahar-Zahedan railway project, a key component of the trade and transit hub centred round the Iranian port. Reacting to media reports suggesting that Iran had dropped India from the railway project that will link Chabahar port to Zahedan, along the border with Afghanistan, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said New Delhi was waiting for Tehran to “nominate an authorised entity to finalise outstanding technical and financial issues”. He didn’t give any more details. India sees the port in the Gulf of Oman as key to its strategic plans to access both Afghanistan and Central Asian states. Though the US issued a waiver in 2018 sparing Chabahar from sanctions imposed on Iran, Indian entities and foreign financial institutions have been reluctant to back either the port or the railway project.The leadership of India, Afghanistan and Iran signed a tripartite agreement on the development of the port during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Tehran in May 2016. At the same time, India’s Ircon and Iran’s Construction and Development of Transportation Infrastructure Company (CDTIC) signed a MoU for building and financing the Chabahar-Zahedan railway link at an estimated cost of $1.6 billion.Srivastava said Ircon was tasked by the Indian government to assess the feasibility of the project, and had completed site inspection and review of a feasibility report. “Detailed discussions were thereafter held on other relevant aspects of the project, which had to take into account the financial challenges that Iran was facing.” These issues were also reviewed at the India-Iran Joint Commission meeting in Tehran last December.An Iranian official, who declined to be named, said Tehran had decided to construct the railway project with Iranian funding and engineering capacities “in the absence of an active Indian engagement and partnership”.Chabahar port and the railway link to Zahedan are part of the International North-South Transit Corridor and it was expected India could play a “more crucial role in funding and constructing this strategic transit route from Chabahar to Zahedan and from Zahedan to Sarakhs at the border with Turkmenistan”, the Iranian official said.Srivastava said Chabahar port has made significant progress “despite the difficulties posed by the sanctions situation”. An Indian company, which has operated the port since 2018, has scaled up traffic. “Since December 2018, 82 vessels have been handled there, including 52 in the last 12 months alone. The port handled 1.2 million tonnes of bulk cargo and 8,200 containers,” he said.“Proactive measures are currently underway to increase the usage of Chabahar port, both for Afghanistan and Central Asia,” he added.Srivastava also clarified that Iran informed India in January that Tehran would develop the Farzad-B gas field on its own and would involve New Delhi “appropriately at a later stage”. He added, “This matter remains under discussion.”India’s ONGC has been involved in negotiations in the discovery stage of Farzad-B gas field. “Follow-up bilateral cooperation was, however, impacted by policy changes on the Iranian side,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pending-issues-holding-up-participation-in-chabahar-zahedan-rail-project-india/story-N5jw6NiSwe0Ssnxd7PAcdP.html
17-07-2020||India||Total disengagement on LAC a complex process: Army||India on Thursday said the complex disengagement process with China on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) is specifically aimed at preventing “face-off situations”, and any unilateral attempts to change the status quo on the disputed border will not be accepted.Two days after corps commanders from both sides met at Chushul to discuss the road map for easing tensions on the LAC, the Indian Army, too, said complete disengagement is an “intricate process” requiring “constant verification”.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity the statements from the external affairs ministry and the army pointed to difficulties and suspicions involved in the disengagement process, and the need to draw a distinction between disengagement and New Delhi’s stated aim of restoring status quo ante on the LAC.Officials and experts indicated the army is preparing for the long haul as de-escalation isn’t likely in the short term. Rebuilding trust after the brutal skirmish at Galwan Valley on June 15, in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed, will not be easy and will take time, said an official who declined to be named. More engagements at military and diplomatic levels will be needed to make headway, said a second official.During a weekly news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava described the disengagement process in Ladakh sector as complex and said it was “specifically aimed at addressing face-off situations and close-up deployments of troops along the LAC”. Also read| Apex China Study Group reviews East Ladakh: Key stand-off points record withdrawalBased on an understanding between the corps commanders, both sides “have agreed at specific points to redeploy towards their regular posts on their respective sides of the LAC”, Srivastava said.“These are mutually agreed reciprocal actions to be taken by both sides,” he said, adding the “mutual redeployment should not be misrepresented”.“There is absolutely no change with respect to India’s position on the LAC. We are fully committed to observing and respecting the LAC. Any unilateral attempts to change the status quo along the LAC are not acceptable,” he added.Indian Army spokesperson Col Aman Anand said the corps commanders reviewed progress in the first phase of disengagement and “discussed further steps to ensure complete disengagement”.Anand added: “The two sides remain committed to the objective of complete disengagement. This process is intricate and requires constant verification. They are taking it forward through regular meetings at diplomatic and military level.”India’s high-powered China Study Group (CSG) on Wednesday reviewed the latest developments in eastern Ladakh, with the focus on the next stage of disengagement following the 14-hour meeting between the corps commanders during July 14-15.The disengagement involves rival troops pulling back a specified distance from face-off sites, with further retreat taking place in phases as the plan progresses on a verifiable basis on the ground every 72 hours.Following the July 5 phone conversation between the Special Representatives on the boundary issue – India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and China’s state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi – both sides held further meetings at the military and diplomatic level.The Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on the border met virtually on July 10 while the senior military commanders held their fourth meeting at Chushul during July 14-15, and the two sides agreed on complete disengagement of troops and de-escalation in border areas for full restoration of peace and tranquillity in line with bilateral agreements and protocols.The focus of the current military talks is to hammer out a consensus on easing tensions between the two armies in Finger Area and Depsang plains, as well as pulling back weapons and equipment from friction points in other sectors.A fifth meeting between delegations led by Lt Gen Harinder Singh, commander of Leh-based 14 Corps, and Maj Gen Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region, is expected to be held in two weeks to take things forward, said one of the officials cited above.As disengagement is discussed at the highest echelons of the government, defence minister Rajnath Singh will visit Ladakh on July 17 for a security review. Singh will fly to Srinagar on Friday afternoon and is expected to travel to forward areas in Jammu and Kashmir on July 18.Indian Army chief Gen Manoj Mukund Naravane will accompany Singh. In Leh and Srinagar, Singh will be briefed on security matters by commanders of 14 and 15 Corps, respectively. He will visit Ladakh two weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an unscheduled trip to the sector on July 3. Modi had then declared that the “era of expansionism” is over, sending a strong signal to China.Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said: “Nobody is claiming that India is sitting on the Chinese side. The Indian side is the one with a grievance and the Chinese are sitting on our side of the LAC, as perceived by us.We should recognise this process is going to take longer and India needs to acquire some leverage. But at the same time, pressure on China from players such as the US and the UK is growing and the outcomes of the India-EU Summit were significant. These developments are cause for optimism and India should derive some comfort from them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/total-disengagement-a-complex-process-army/story-bQHQ9i54TXY6SkpcsiDFNL.html
17-07-2020||India||Central Vista redevelopment will not harm landmarks: DDA||The redevelopment of the Central Vista area in the National Capital will not harm any heritage buildings in the area and historical landmarks like the Rashtrapati Bhawan, the North and South Blocks, the Parliament house and the National Archives will be conserved, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has told the Supreme Court, which is expected to hear the matter on Friday.The Central Vista is being redeveloped after taking into account the present needs of the city and will be carried out with “extreme sensitivity” to preserve the area’s heritage, a counter-affidavit filed before the top court on July 4 stated. HT has reviewed a copy of the affidavit.The Supreme Court is hearing two petitions which challenged the redevelopment project that aims to create a new Parliament house and 10 administrative buildings for all the government ministries, convert the North and South blocks into museums, and develop the Central Vista avenue that connects Rajpath to India Gate. “While making the recommendations, DDA has ensured that no heritage building is /will be harmed during the process of redevelopment,” the affidavit said.Many of the buildings on the Central Vista, including the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the Parliament and the North and South Blocks, as well as India Gate, were designed by British architects Edward Lutyens and Herbert Baker in the 1920s and ’30s and are Grade 1 heritage buildings.DDA also stressed that there will be no loss of green area due to the project, saying open spaces in the Central Vista will be kept intact by adequately compensating the loss of 9.5 acre of green cover in the district park by adding 5.64 acre of green area along Rajpath and another 3.9 acre in the C-Zone.The district park is the plot on which the new Parliament building is expected to come up, and currently houses a reception area, parking and other service infrastructure for the Parliament house. It is marked as a district park in the Parliament house complex. The entire Central Vista precinct falls within Zone D. The C Zone refers to the Civil Lines zone, which includes features like the Roshanara Bagh from Mughal times, and the old Secretariat Complex from the colonial period.“The present District Park area of 9.5 acre has been compensated by providing 5.64 acre in D Zone (Central Vista) and 3.9 acre in C Zone, thereby keeping the green spaces intact. It is pertinent to mention that as per modified plan, the green area along the Rajpath will increase by 5.64 acre,” the affidavit said.The redevelopment project proposes to do away with the encroachments along the avenue and increase the green cover on either side of the path.Advocate Rajeev Suri and Lt Colonel Anuj Srivastava filed petitions in the Delhi high court in February, following which the court ordered that the DDA should approach it before notifying the proposed changes in the land use.A division bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice C Hari Shankar, however, stayed this order prompting Suri to move the Supreme Court.The top court had on March 3 transferred the entire case to itself from the Delhi high court on the ground that the issue involves larger public interest. The case will be heard by a three-judge bench headed by justice AM Khanwilkar on Friday.Suri’s petition stated that the DDA did not have the power to notify changes to land use and standards of population density.“The change in land use is in the direction of aligning the existing land use with the proposed Central Vista Development / Redevelopment Plan and it is not going to alter any fundamental character or historicity of this area. It is only a readjustment / reorganization of the Central Government Ministry offices”, the DDA said in its affidavit.It was contended that the change in land use was in conformity with the Delhi Development Act and each and every provision of the Act as well as the Delhi Development (Master Plan / Zonal Development Plan) Rules was followed.Srivastava challenged the public hearings held in February, and argued that they were not a meaningful exercise. The DDA rebutted this argument stating, “Public hearing was held on February 6 and February 7….Full opportunity was granted to each and every person who approached for public hearing. The objections were duly categorized by Board of Enquiry and Hearing and persons raising similar issues were heard at the same time. The opportunity of public hearing had not been denied and in fact submissions of each person have been duly considered by the BoEH while giving its recommendations,” the DDA’s response said.The DDA stated that the proposal will not increase residential population density in Central Vista area though floating population will increase due to proposed government office buildings.“The proposed modification will increase the floating population which will be offset to an extent on account of persons moving out of existing offices housed in six hutments of 90 acre (which will developed into organized spaces). This land use change proposal is not going to alter any fundamental living history and heritage of this area”, DDA said.The Supreme Court in June declined to stay the redevelopment of Lutyen’s Delhi’s Central Vista for the second time in two months, saying it could prevent government authorities from acting according to the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-vista-redevelopment-will-not-harm-landmarks-dda/story-F7WsUbLzFWHyPjXbk2QBoL.html
17-07-2020||India||‘Miss my mother, miss the sea’, says 16-year-old detained for Markaz event||Among the 900 foreigners detained in March and April from across the city for allegedly spreading the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and defying government orders on large gatherings by attending a congregation of the Tablighi Jamaat, an Islamic missionary group, is a 16-year-old boy from Ukraine.The teenager, who turned 16 in January in India, is being held in a south Delhi facility along with 200 others who participated in the congregation at the Markaz headquarters of the group in New Delhi’s Nizamuddin Basti.The cases of the participants are being heard in different courts.Frequently wiping the sweat on his brow and shifting uneasily in the humid climate he is yet to get used to, the boy said he’s been in India for seven months. Coming from a country known for its cold and snowy winters, he said he’s finding it difficult to adjust to the scorching heat and humidity of the Indian capital.After a trip to Nepal and Aurangabad, the boy, accompanied by his father, had moved into the Nizamuddin Markaz on March 22, just days before the country went into a complete lockdown for Covid-19.Click here for complete coronavirus coverageA three-month trip that was supposed to have been a post-exam vacation ended up stretching into an almost five-month detention. Though not officially charged by police, his passport was seized, and he was lodged with his father at quarantine detention centres since being evacuated from the Markaz on March 31.Following a Delhi high court order on May 28, the foreign attendees at the Markaz congregation -- after their release from quarantine centres – were housed in different court-approved facilities across the city.The 16-year-old is lodged at a school turned into a temporary detention facility in Jamia Nagar, where the detained attendees sleep in classrooms turned into sleeping spaces.“We were supposed to return in May. I was to join a new school in September, but I cannot do that now. I miss my mother and my family. I was enjoying my visit to the country. This was my first time. I do not know why I am not allowed to return,” he said.Trapped in the national capital since March, the teenager has also learnt Hindi words such as “Sathi (friend)” and “Nahi (no)”. When asked if he had tested positive for Covid-19, he replied: “Nahi.”He is the only minor at the facility that is mostly housing senior citizens and couples. The teenager spends most of his time browsing the internet and playing mobile games alone in empty classrooms. His days are spent joining the adults in the centre in offering prayers or catching up with their experiences in the country.“I miss my mother, even though I speak to her and my two elder brothers over video call. It is not the same as being there with them. I am not sure when I will be able to be with them but I miss them and can’t wait to go back,” he said, recalling how he had always been pampered, being the youngest child of the family.The teenager’s father, Fazluddin, a businessman in Ukraine, said they had come to India on December 20 and visited Nepal, and Aurangabad in Maharashtra. It was his second visit to the country. For his son, it was the first.“We came to the Markaz on March 22. We were not preaching. We visited religious places as part of our learning experience. On March 31, we had no symptoms but were taken by the government officials to the quarantine centre in Tughlakabad. We were given a room, where we stayed for around one-and-a-half months. We did not face any problems at the centre, though. It is unfortunate that he is trapped here with me,” Fazluddin said, adding that he and his son had tested negative for the coronavirus disease. Aslam Masuri, who helps the foreigners at the centre, said: “This is no age for a child to be trapped in a foreign country and unable to return home. We are adults and can manage the stress. For a boy of his age, he has suffered enough. His case should be considered and he should be sent back immediately. The only solace in all this is that he is at least with his father.”When contacted, Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) member Roop Sudesh Vimal said that the commission had not been informed that a minor had also been moved to the quarantine centre along with those taken into custody in the Markaz case. “We will take cognizance and see if the authorities followed all protocols in the case of this minor,” said Vimal.At the centre, other attendees said that the two are always together. “He always walks behind his father. He is a shy boy,” one of the foreigners said.Stuck in the city for the last seven months and scared of a lengthy trial that could prolong their stay, the teenager’s father last week pled guilty and agreed to a plea bargain. He has been convicted and let off with a fine of Rs 5,000 and simple imprisonment of five days(already undergone in quarantine). The court convicted him under the Foreigners Act, Epidemic Diseases Act and Disaster Management Act. HT contacted the Ukraine embassy and also emailed a questionnaire to the mission seeking its response to the minor’s case, but it elicited no reply until Thursday night. An official at the embassy, who did not want to be named, said: “We are helping our nationals stranded in the country and provided all assistance. We do not want to make any official comment on the legal aspect of the cases because of the diplomatic ties of the country.”Commenting on the minor being lodged in quarantine for around two months, a senior Delhi government official said that the administration had followed the Centre’s orders while sending foreigners from the Markaz to the quarantine centres. Fazluddin said he and his son were now waiting for the government’s order to leave the country. He said they would have to spend another 14 days in quarantine after reaching home but wouldn’t mind that .“I long for the sea. If I was home during the summer, I would have been out swimming with my friends. I cannot see any sea here,” the teenager said in response to what he misses the most about home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-miss-my-family-long-for-the-sea-ukrainian-minor-stuck-in-india-for-7-months/story-rQP6D0jH1Ld9OlF2lGyrMN.html
17-07-2020||India||As an actor I love to challenge my craft: Manoj Bajpayee||Known for his exceptional performances and frank opinion, actor-producer Manoj Bajpayee needs no introduction to any cinema lover. The actor was busy shooting in Uttarakhand when the Covid-19 lockdown was announced. “The phase of uncertainties has stretched a bit longer than expected. But now I think we all need to go back to our normal lives even though the entire world desperately wants a vaccine or medicine to face the pandemic. It’s okay to say we had good time with our respective families, but how long can that go on. As far as I’m concerned, I am trying to be productive and keeping myself busy attending work meets online, reading and spending time with my little one,” says the actor whose recent OTT release is making waves.Sharing details about the making of ‘Bhonsle’ he says: “Five years back when we started to find financer for this script it took us four years to find the money for the film. Too many people got associated and whoever contributed in whatever manner we are thankful to them. I remember that after shooting for ten days we didn’t have any money and I was shooting as well organising finances and then the biggest help came from producer Sandeep Kapoor who had already produced projects like ‘Jugaad’ and ‘Anarkali of Aara.’ So ‘Bhonsle’ as a film has gone through a lot of efforts,” he said over phone.Talking about his titular character and what interested him to take it up, Manoj said: “As an actor I found it an amazing opportunity to go ahead and challenge my craft because if I succeed I will definitely come out as a better actor and better human being. What I liked about the character and the story was that the story unfolds during the ten days of Ganpati festivities and it was about the old guy who doesn’t want to retire as he has nothing other than his duty as a policeman to look forward to. Bhonsle doesn’t want to be thrown in that one room place where he used to live as his duty was his only escape from day to day life that didn’t interest him at all. He doesn’t get into petty politics and opposes who divide or discriminate on the lines of societal norms.”When asked about the way OTT is changing the entertainment rules, he says: “When we all were locked down OTT did come up as the best medium to keep us all entertained. As far as my film is concerned let me tell you frankly that theatre has never done justice to these films in the past nor they will ever do. Many of my films have already met the same injustice in the past they didn’t get proper shows, proper release and respect when released in theatres. So theatre release would have done no justice or favour to a film like ‘Bhonsle’ in fact I am glad and thankful to the platform that brought it out so pleasantly for us.”On the work front, Manoj would complete the shoot of the independent film in Uttarakhand as soon as things normalize.Then there is another film in post production stage along with the second season of his hit web series ‘The Family Man.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/as-an-actor-i-love-to-challenge-my-skills-manoj-bajpayee/story-TCOwczhhL4quD0yuUcN2LJ.html

The court referred it to a two-judge division bench.Congress chief whip has also asked the Court to be heard in the matter. The chief whip is being represented by a legal team led by senior counsel and Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi.Also Read: The tale of Rajesh and Sachin Pilot, writes Rajdeep SardesaiThursday marks the shifting of the political slugfest in Rajasthan to the high court, which will likely make the crucial decision about the fate of the 19 Congress MLAs who have rebelled against the leadership of chief minister Ashok Gehlot alleging ill-treatment and the state government’s alleged failure to fulfil promises made nearly two years ago before assembly polls.Gehlot’s camp has however, accused his erstwhile deputy in the government and also the former state party chief, Sachin Pilot, of plotting his government’s downfall in connivance with the BJP, a charge denied both by Pilot and the BJP.Pilot was sacked from both the positions after he and his followers refused to attend two legislative party meetings held over two days to discuss alleged horse-trading charges and the differences between the two rival factions. Yesterday, the party chief whip went ahead and asked the assembly speaker to disqualify all 19 MLAs for defying the party whip. He also invoked the 10th schedule of the constitution that deals with anti-defection law.Pilot and his team were then served a notice of disqualification from the membership of the assembly and asked to respond by Friday. The delay in the hearing was caused today due to Pilot’s legal team’s decision to amend the petition to challenge the Rajasthan Assembly Member (Disqualification on the grounds of changing party) Rules, 1989, instead of the notices of disqualification.The single bench judge had to then refer the case to a two-judge bench as only a division bench can hear petitions challenging rules, bylaws and amendments, said Prateek Kasliwal, who is representing assembly speaker CP Joshi.In the petition’s earlier form, Sachin Pilot had argued that missing two meetings of Congress Legislative Party did not amount to defection. In the amended version, the petition argues that the “expression of dissatisfaction or even disillusionment against the party leadership” cannot be treated as conduct that could be covered under the anti-defection law.It adds that expression of views and opinions, howsoever strongly worded, cannot be considered to trigger the anti-defection law, “the said clause would not stand the scrutiny and will have to be declared ultra vires the basic structure of the constitution” since it violates the lawmakers freedom of expression, it argues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachin-pilot-camp-mlas-challenge-to-disqualification-notices-to-be-heard-by-high-court-at-1-pm-tomorrow/story-VsbFWwVSA9KB0fEKFuL1GK.html

Zydus is one of the two companies (the other is Bharat Biotech) that have so far received the Indian dugs controller’s approval to begin human trials for their anti-Covid-19 vaccine candidates. ZyCoV-D was granted the approval on July 2.“…the Adaptive Phase I/ II human clinical trials of its plasmid DNA vaccine, ZyCoV-D commenced today with the first human dosing. The Adaptive Phase I/II dose escalation, multi-centric study will assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the vaccine. The human dosing of the vaccine marks a key milestone since the launching of the accelerated vaccine development programme for Covid-9 in February 2020,” said Zydus in a statement.Also read: India set for pivotal role in Covid-19 vaccine production, says ICMRThe vaccine candidate was found to be safe, immunogenic (generating immune response) and well tolerated in the pre-clinical toxicity studies. The vaccine was able to elicit a high level of neutralizing antibodies in animal studies. Phase I and II human trials are conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of a new drug or vaccine.“This is an all-important step in our fight against Covid-19. We acknowledge the support of… [the] government of India and regulatory agencies ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research] and DCGI [Drug Controller General of India] in the development of ZyCoV-D vaccine candidate. We look forward to the Adaptive Phase I/II clinical studies and gathering important data on ZyCoV-D in the months ahead,” said Pankaj R Patel, chairman, Zydus Cadila.Also read: India’s pharma industry an asset for entire world, says PM Narendra ModiIn the pre-clinical phase, the vaccine was found to elicit a strong immune response in multiple animal species like mice, rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits. The antibodies produced by the vaccine were able to neutralize the virus in virus neutralization assay indicating the protective potential of the vaccine candidate. No safety concerns were observed for the vaccine candidate in repeat-dose toxicology studies, according to the details shared by the company. The platform is also known to show much-improved vaccine stability and lower cold chain requirements, making it easy for transportation to the remotest regions. Also, the platform can be rapidly used to modify the vaccine in a couple of weeks in case the virus mutates to ensure that the vaccine still elicits protection.Zydus will be enrolling at least 1,000 subjects across multiple clinical study sites in India and has already produced clinical manufacturing practice batches of the vaccine candidate for the clinical trials.“The government is providing all support needed to fast-track the vaccine development process. India is about 60% supplier of total vaccine volume to the world, and will also take the lead in manufacturing the Covid-19 vaccine even if it’s developed elsewhere in the world,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, ICMR, on Tuesday.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “The vaccine will be ultimate to check the disease spread but we don’t know when will an effective vaccine be available for use even though all our efforts are being directed towards making it happen as soon as possible. A good vaccine is the most cost-effective way of preventing a disease,” said Dr Amita Jain, head, microbiology department, KGMU, Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zydus-cadilla-begins-human-dosing-in-trials/story-WI0sdKieiVMbnWdoAhJ8ZK.html
17-07-2020||India||Rajnath Singh begins his Ladakh visit to assess military preparedness||Defence minister Rajnath Singh will visit Ladakh for a security review on July 17 at a time of military tensions in the sensitive sector where the Indian and Chinese armies are in talks for the next stage of disengagement, two officials said on Wednesday. Singh will also visit forward areas in Jammu and Kashmir on July 18, they said.Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane will accompany the minister, the officials said. The military is keeping a strict vigil on the western front to deter Pakistan from fishing in troubled waters and prevent what could turn out to be a two-front conflict, as reported by Hindustan Times on July 2.Singh was expected to visit Ladakh in early July but his tour was deferred. The minister will be visiting Ladakh two weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an unscheduled visit to the sector on July 3. The PM then declared that the “era of expansionism” is over, sending a strong signal to China about India’s determination to defend its borders.Complicated negotiations on kicking off the next stage of disengagement between the Indian and Chinese armies in eastern Ladakh saw senior military commanders from both sides hold a 14-hour meeting at Chushul on Tuesday to discuss the road map for further reducing tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The talks that began at 11.30 am and went on till 2 am on Wednesday. The outcome of the talks wasn’t immediately known. A statement is expected only after top-level internal deliberations in the army on the matter, the officials said. The focus of the current round of military talks is to hammer out a consensus on easing tensions between the two armies in the Finger Area near Pangong Tso and Depsang plains as well as pulling back weapons and equipment from friction points in other sectors.This was the fourth meeting between the corps commander-ranked officers of the two armies who made previous attempts to reduce tensions along the contested border on June 6, June 22 and June 30.The previous two meetings went on for up to 11 hours while the first one was the shortest at 7 hours.Negotiations are expected to be far harder this time as the continued presence of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in the Finger Area and the Depsang sector could be the sticking point of the talks, as reported by HT on Tuesday.In Tuesday’s talks, the agenda included the step-wise withdrawal of weapons and equipment to mutually agreed distances from all friction areas along the LAC and thinning the military buildup in the region. The military dialogue will be followed by another meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs. The military commanders set the time-frame and method of disengagement while the WMCC monitors the process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defence-minister-to-visit-ladakh-for-security-review-on-july-17/story-2SHxK0Feoiro0VLOYhXWOJ.html
17-07-2020||Editorials||A million cases, and counting| HT Editorial||Over a million Indians have now been infected by SARS-Cov-2. Over 25,000 of them have died. India is the third most-affected country in the world by caseload. And Covid-19 is only spreading, hitting a record number of cases almost on a daily basis. New regions are getting affected. Its impact may be different vis-a-vis different groups, but it has affected the old and young, men and women, the rich and the poor. And, notwithstanding the end of the lockdown, it has continued to affect everyday life, economic activity, income levels, social interactions, education, travel and mobility. India’s experience offers key lessons in how to manage the pandemic. The first lesson is that in the absence of a vaccine, there is no alternative to aggressive testing. India’s testing rate is 9,323 tests per million people, much lower than other affected countries. There is a simple, obvious logic here, recognised by the government too. Testing is the only way to identify those who may have Covid-19, isolate and treat them, and ensure that they don’t become carriers. But by instituting restrictive testing protocols and not using the available testing capacity, India has been slow to do this. It should be clear after a million cases that not testing will not make the problem disappear. The second lesson is recognising that India is at a community transmission stage. This means that old protocols of limited contact tracing will not be enough in finding the infected; it also means that, through chains and processes that cannot necessarily be traced, the infection has spread far and wide, possibly in rural areas. This, then, requires a far greater investment in district health infrastructure and personnel, medical equipment, especially in states with a weak public health care system. The third lesson is that as the virus continues to make its way through other parts and other demographic segments, better economic management is essential. The lockdown devastated an already fragile economy, and caused suffering. There may be some bright spots, but the government’s economic package did not go far enough in providing the stimulus needed to rev up the growth engine, and its welfare schemes may not be adequate in addressing the humanitarian distress. As India heads towards both more cases (a million more in less than a month is now a real likelihood) and its most severe economic contraction in history, it is essential to get the lives and livelihoods balance right.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-million-cases-and-counting/story-DDbrR6iZbBWIIb81eZ3c0N.html
17-07-2020||Editorials||Looking at the big picture, finally | HT Editorial||India and the European Union (EU) have had a relationship based on common values — but not much else. The recent summit is the latest step in a 21st century reset. Common concerns about the United States’ (US) destructive unilateralism and China’s aggressive imperialism are forcing Brussels and New Delhi to look at the big picture. The new convergence is about working together on multilateral problems. The climate crisis tops the list but preserving international institutions and the security of the high seas and cyberspace also figure. The EU has put aside its tendency of preaching to India about human rights. Both sides have lowered ambitions regarding trade and investment negotiations. As the world order gets shakier, India and the EU have sensibly decided to worry about the big picture. Even here, moving forward will require a lot of concerted effort. The EU struggles to take common positions on sensitive geopolitical issues. Preference for Chinese profits over principles by Germany and other governments means Europe is all over the place when it comes to Beijing. The Europeans remain suspicious and ill-informed about the philosophy of the Narendra Modi government. New Delhi is more excited about future relations with Brexit Britain than it is with Brussels. The relationship needs a core focus, one that works at many different policy levels and has a good chance of generating results. The obvious answer to this is climate and that is where the two sides must concentrate their energies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/looking-at-the-big-picture-finally/story-9IX5U9r5qHifPd59aEQevK.html
