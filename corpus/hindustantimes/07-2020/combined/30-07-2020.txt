30-07-2020||News||The infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2||The coronavirus pandemic is unprecedented, and has infected 16.8 million in at least 180 countries in seven months. India has reported 1.5 million cases and 34,000 deaths. By April end, 0.78% of India’s 1.3 billion population was infected as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) studies. By mid-July, 24% of Delhi’s 20 million population was infected as per the National Centre for Disease Control’s (NCDC) sero-surveillance survey.Sero-prevalence studies from many countries indicate that the infection numbers are about 20-50 times more than the test positives reported in the same areas. This implies that the number of very mild and asymptomatic cases is much higher, and is not captured by the health system.Yet, this fast-spreading virus does not infect all the members of an infected person’s family. On an average, only 10-20% of family members develop the infection after one infection in their family. This rate of secondary cases in a close contact in the family is called household Secondary Attack Rate (SAR).A global literature review we conducted at the Indian Institute of Public Health Gandhinagar (IIPHG) on SAR showed that the rate is variable — from 4.6% to 50%. Infection rates are higher among the spouse or partner of the primary case and elderly members of the family, but it is lower in children. But most studies showed that 80-90% family members do not develop Covid-19 after a primary case is diagnosed in the family.Early ICMR data indicates SAR in India is 6%, which means that 94% of family members did not develop Covid-19 even when one member tested positive. This is surprising as the virus is infectious and we are told that one can get infected during a brief five-10 minute exposure at public places such as shops, vegetable vendors or banks. Studies have shown that a person with Covid-19 is most infectious two days before symptoms appear. This means a person begins infecting others on an average at least three to five days before being diagnosed, when no one around them at home is using masks or maintaining social distancing.Family members are in close contact with each other, sleeping, eating and living in close proximity. In spite of this close contact with an infected person, only 10-20% family members get infected as per most studies published in scientific literature globally.This is surprising for a highly infectious disease. This tells us something about the infectiousness of the virus and individual immunity against disease.One obvious interpretation is that around 80% people who remain uninfected in a family are resistant or not susceptible to the coronavirus in spite of close contact without any precautions. This contradicts the notion of a highly infectious disease agent. A low SAR rate of 10-20% questions the assumption that everyone is susceptible to the infection because no one has immunity against it.One competing explanation is that most cases are very mild with a low viral load, which carries a lower risk of transmission. Only 7-15 % of cases have a moderate or high viral load, which leads to the transmission of infection in many others. But such families will be few, and 85% people with mild disease will not have secondary cases in their families.A similar phenomenon is observed in epidemics caused by other new viruses, such as chikungunya, that saw 1.4 million cases and thousands of deaths in India in 2006. Even then, not all family members were affected and many people in the community did not fall ill even though the mosquitoes that transmit the disease were ubiquitous. The explanation there also seems to be that many people have resistance to the new infection and individual-centric immunity or resistance plays a critical role in the transmission of the disease in a population even in the case of new infections.What is the implication of the finding that a large proportion of the population is resistant to Covid-19? British neuroscientist Karl Friston from University College, London, has modelled data from many European countries and proposed a new concept called “Immunological Black Matter”. He suggests that a large proportion of the population is not exposed to the virus or are not susceptible to the infection. The practical implication of this is that with 20-30% infection rates or sero-prevalence in the community, the city or area will start seeing effects of herd immunity as about 50-60% of the population is not susceptible to the infection. It seems this is what is seen in cities such as Ahmedabad (central zone) where the sero-prevalence has reached 28%, and in Delhi where the sero-prevalence has reached 23% in July.This does not mean that people should stop taking precautions to prevent transmission as social distancing and masks must be used until the epidemic completely disappears. But given the fast spread of this largely asymptomatic infection, other cities will follow the course of Ahmedabad and Delhi and will soon reach effective herd immunity.Conducting more sero-surveillance in various cities will give a better understanding of the infection prevalence and how far we are from effective herd immunity. We need local epidemiological and public health studies to understand the disease dynamics. The “vocal for local” call by Prime Minister Narendra Modi should also be interpreted to mean generation and use of local data for disease modelling, and not just using global and imported models.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-infectiousness-of-sars-cov-2/story-QhTBa4DKqkN0cIov3q5dVP.html
30-07-2020||News||Why the anti-defection law has failed to deliver||The ongoing political crisis in Rajasthan is neither new nor uncommon. Turbulence in governments — involving the “switching of sides” by elected representatives — has been increasingly frequent in recent months. The past year has seen the toppling of two state governments in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh amid allegations of political defections and horse-trading. There has also been turmoil in Goa and Manipur. The phenomenon in question — i.e., bringing down an elected government by depriving it of its majority through the defection of Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) — goes back a long way. To resolve this problem, in 1985, the Constitution was amended to include the Tenth Schedule (also known as the anti-defection law). The anti-defection law provides that members of political parties who disobey the whip or vote against the party in a confidence motion, will face disqualification. As recent events have made clear, however, the Tenth Schedule is no longer an effective check on the phenomenon of defection, and an urgent reconsideration is required.There are a few reasons why this is so. The first is that the defecting MLAs have found a way around the restrictions in the Tenth Schedule. Instead of formally “crossing the floor” or voting against their party in a confidence motion, they resign from the party. This brings down the party’s strength in the House, and the government is toppled. A few months later, when by-elections are held, the same MLAs then stand for election on the ticket of the opposition party, and are returned to the assembly. This, it should be clear, is defection in all, but the most formal sense. Unfortunately, in their recent judgments, the courts have failed to stop this practice (although, arguably, the language of the Tenth Schedule does not leave much room to the judiciary). The second reason is that no matter how well-drafted a constitutional provision is, ultimately, its implementation depends upon constitutional functionaries acting in good faith. As BR Ambedkar pointed out soon after the framing of the Constitution, every constitutional text can be subverted if those charged with running the affairs of government are inclined to do so. In recent times, it has become clear that the major constitutional actors involved in times of constitutional instability — i.e., the governors and the speakers — do not act in good faith. In every constitutional crisis over the last few years, governors have acted like partisan representatives of the political party that appointed them, and have flouted constitutional conventions with impunity (from deciding which party to call first to form the government in a hung house, to ordering — or refusing to order — floor tests to prove majorities). Thus, despite the fact that the governor — as an unelected functionary — is supposed to play a minimal role in the affairs of the state, the individuals in that position have interfered on behalf of their erstwhile political parties. Speakers have done little better. Third, the judiciary itself has not proved up to the mark. For example, during the Karnataka crisis last year, the Supreme Court (SC) — while ostensibly passing a “balanced order” — effectively overrode the provisions of the Tenth Schedule. It said that rebel MLAs, whose disqualification petitions were being considered by the Speaker, could not be compelled to participate in the proceedings of the House. The rebels were happy for they did not have to obey the party whip. This reduced the effective majority of the government. More recently, the Rajasthan High Court effectively injuncted the Speaker of the Rajasthan Assembly from acting upon disqualification notices, despite clear SC precedent to the contrary. As observers have pointed out, if it is the case that horse-trading is in progress, then an indefinite injunction on the Speaker’s ability to act under the Tenth Schedule will only provide further fillip to such actions. The last — and most under-discussed — aspect is the presence of money in politics. It has been widely reported that huge sums of money are offered to MLAs to desert their parties and bring down the government. This is enabled by the existence of electoral bonds, which allow for unlimited and anonymous funding to political parties. Under the electoral bond scheme, phenomenal sums of money have been donated to political parties over the last two years. Unfortunately, a petition challenging the constitutionality of the electoral bond scheme has been pending in SC for the last two years. Despite multiple election cycles, the apex court has taken no action upon it. In sum, therefore, the anti-defection law needs to be improved (there have been suggestions, for example, that disqualification or resignation should be accompanied by a five-year-long bar from standing for elections again). More crucially, however, the legally-sanctioned influence of big money in politics must be curtailed. If these steps are not taken, Indian democracy risks dissolving into a sham quickly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/why-the-anti-defection-law-has-failed-to-deliver/story-JtDhlEFHZ8VPpnNBD7Fv9J.html
30-07-2020||News||At the root of today’s crisis, an intellectual void, writes Ram Madhav||Weak minds discuss people; average minds discuss events; strong minds discuss ideas,” said Greek philosopher Socrates. People and events dominate public discourse because they matter to the bread and butter issues of the people. But then, as Jesus Christ said, man does not live by bread alone. He needs ideas — “God’s word,” according to Jesus. We need strong minds to germinate transformative ideas. There will be times when humanity yearns for such ideas. The coronavirus pandemic is one such occasion when the world is desperately looking for fresh ideas to shape its future. Historically, Europe has been the intellectual kernel of mankind. Several avant-garde ideas originated in the minds of European philosophers and thinkers. In the last few centuries, all the important political ideas that impacted the world extensively came from Europe. From John Locke’s Enlightenment thinking to Karl Marx’s Marxism, from the Utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill to the Social Contract tradition of Thomas Hobbs, from Edmund Burke’s Conservatism to Frederick Nietzsche’s Nihilism — Europe produced many grand political ideas in the last two centuries. The democratic institutions that evolved during the same period are also the product of the continuous churning in Europe’s intellectual milieu. One grand idea that India contributed to world political thought in the last century was Mahatma Gandhi’s non-violence. From Martin Luther King Jr to Nelson Mandela to Barack Obama — the list of leaders who admired and adopted non-violence as a political ideology is long. Interestingly, after India’s successful experimentation with non-violence in 1947, dozens of countries adopted it and subsequently secured independence. Most of those countries became democracies and the world witnessed a “democracy boom” by the end of the last century. The collapse of the erstwhile Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War also helped further democratisation.But the dawn of the 21st century saw matters drifting fast. Democratic deficit and fatigue are setting in with alarming speed. Authoritarian regimes have bounced back with a vengeance. Terrorism, that acquired new dimensions and legitimacy towards the end of the last century, has led to the resurgence of the politics of violence. The first quarter of the 21st century witnessed the rise of “wolf warriors” and “lone wolfs”. It is in this political climate that the Covid-19 has struck the world. It has affected all existing political systems, authoritarians and democrats alike, diminishing the credibility of each one. A leaderless and rudderless world is emerging out of these two-decades of churning culminating in the pandemic. What the post-pandemic world needs is not just a new leadership, but also ideas for a new world order.Regarded for long as the crown jewel of democratic liberalism, the United States (US) is yielding ground quickly and significantly, signalling the decisive decline of those values in the world. In the last three decades, at least two dozen countries have turned authoritarian.Authoritarian regimes such as China have emerged powerful during the same period. Authoritarianism does not affect the people of the respective countries alone. It puts a lot of pressure on others too. Democracies, by very nature, become vulnerable to the onslaught of authoritarianism. In the process, they too gradually turn to authoritarian measures to ward off the challenge of authoritarian regimes. The net result will be a world less liberal and less democratic.There is a silver lining in the cloud though. Authoritarian regimes, although seemingly dominant at the moment, cannot sustain themselves for long. China is ageing fast. The one-child norm of the 1980s and 90s has skewed its demography. In a decade’s time, it will turn into an evening economy. So will other authoritarian regimes in West Asia for a variety of reasons. With their financial fortunes plummeting due to falling oil revenues, these authoritarian sponsors of terrorism are wilting precariously.The next 10 years will be crucial for the world. It has to not only build new leadership, but also come up with new ideas and agendas. It is here that India has a golden opportunity. India’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis has revealed the brighter side of its leadership and society. The combined efforts of the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, extensive efforts by its ubiquitous bureaucracy, and the exemplary discipline and commitment of its 1.3 billion people have helped India manage the pandemic in a manner that has set an example to others.India’s Covid-19 experience has highlighted its inclusive nationalism and humanist development vision. These can serve as the ideas for building a new agenda in a post-Covid-19 world. The pandemic has made many countries insular. That has led to the rise of more authoritarianism in the world. India stood out with its inclusivist democratic policies that have seen the government’s popularity going through the roof. This, together with humanist globalism as against materialist and militarist authoritarianism, can set a new agenda for the emerging global order.India has a decade to prepare itself to play a leading role in building such a world order. That is what the Prime Minister Modi calls Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) and Agenda 2030.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/at-the-root-of-today-s-crisis-an-intellectual-void/story-t1qTt1r3vwHeFteUuYupdP.html
30-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi doctor tele-consults with chronically ill Assam man on a boat after he is cut off by floods||A man with severe liver cirrhosis (scarring due to chronic liver diseases), who was cut off from hospitals and cellphone network due to the recent floods in Assam, was given a tele-consultation by doctors from a city hospital after his wife and friend managed to get him on a boat and take him to an area with network coverage. The patient, Lalchand Biswas, who lives near Guwahati, was semi-conscious,had breathing difficulty and had a swollen abdomen two weeks ago. He was stuck in his house because of the floods and hadn’t been able to visit a doctor or get the medicines needed to stabilise his condition. “I work for an outreach programme under which I had examined the patient in February or March. I got a distress call from Biswas’s friend Mohfisur Rehman who informed me of his condition. I thought of giving him a tele-consultation immediately but he was in an area where there was no cellphone network. So Rehman arranged for a small boat and carried Biswas and his wife to a place where we could get reception,” said Dr Ushast Dhir, consultant, department of surgical gastroenterology and liver transplant, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. He had hepatic encephalopathy – a decline in brain function as a result of severe liver disease leading to a build-up toxins in the blood stream, the doctor said. “When we started the video call, I had to show Rahman how to do an abdomen examination. I was able to establish that he had severe disease and needed immediate treatment. I prescribed him medicines. The challenge was not only to get the medicines – as many hospitals and pharmacies were closed – but also to administer it,” said Dr Dhir. As Rahman is a pharmacist, he was able to get the medicine within the hour. “He also knew how to administer the medicines and it was done on the boat itself. Biswas was monitored for six hours, with another dose of the medicine being given at a three-hour interval,” said Dr Dhir. Currently, the hospital, through some philanthropic organisations, has been able to ensure supply medicines for a month to Biswas. “What we are trying to do is to get help from various organisations to bring Biswas to Delhi for a liver transplant. That is the only option left as his disease has progressed,” he said. The flood situation in Assam improved further on Thursday though one more person lost his life taking the toll to 108 in the calamity, an official bulletin said.According to the daily flood report of Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) one person drowned in the flood water in Mikirbheta area of Morigaon district on Thursday taking the toll to 108.The toll in the landslides triggered by the flood stood at 26 taking the total number of deaths to 134, it said.The ASDMA reports said over 12.01 lakh people are in the grip of floods in Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Sonitpur, Biswanath, Darrang, Baksa, Barpeta, Chirang, Bongaigaon, Kokrajhar, Dhubri, South Salmara, Goalpara, Kamrup, Kamrup Metropolitan, Morigaon, Nagaon, Golaghat, Jorhat, Majuli, Sivasagar and Dibrugarh districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-doctor-tele-consults-with-chronically-ill-assam-man-on-a-boat-after-he-is-cut-off-by-floods/story-C4tPBcYrwcnFo1uxauOLKN.html

30-07-2020||City||Day after SC rebuke, IIT-B signs MoU to build smog towers in Capital||New Delhi The Indian Institute of Technology – Bombay (IIT-B) has signed an agreement with the Central government to construct a smog tower on an experimental basis in Delhi within 10 months to curb air pollution. The development came a day after the Supreme Court passed harsh remarks against IIT-B and the Centre for violating its January 13, 2020 order and threatened contempt action for breaching the earlier deadline of three months to install the first such tower at Connaught Place. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, informed a bench headed by justice Arun Mishra that after Wednesday’s hearing, the Centre contacted IIT-B and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with IIT-B to complete the smog tower project in 10 months. Mehta also said the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, U.S, would provide the drawing for the tower in two months. Irked by the deadline getting pushed ahead, the bench, which also comprised justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari said, “We will not tolerate this laxity. Is this the way you must be dealing with this matter…..Why are the drawings not ready till today when our order of January 13 said it should be completed within three months. While passing that order, we were informed that drawings are ready. Only dispute was with respect to the time to set it up.” With the IIT-B director present during the hearing through videoconferencing, Mehta told the court that the query about drawings should be directed to IIT-B. To this the bench replied, “Our direction was to your ministry. It’s a government project and you must make it work. You make it fait accompli by putting the blame on IIT-B. There seems to be no intention on your part to comply with our order even now.” The S-G requested time till Tuesday to present the entire plan on affidavit. He informed the court that the MoU between CPCB and IIT-B was digitally signed, a copy of which will be presented. The bench allowed the prayer and posted the matter for Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/day-after-sc-rebuke-iit-b-signs-mou-to-build-smog-towers-in-capital/story-OYEOodo3GUnZF642pgEG6L.html
30-07-2020||Delhi||DU’s responsibility to provide scribes to visually impaired students, says high court||The Delhi high court on Thursday pulled up Delhi University (DU) for its lack of preparedness in providing scribes to visually impaired students and said it is the responsibility of the varsity to provide scribes to such students. The court also observed that of the 1.82 lakh final-year students, who registered on the university portal for the first phase of the mock test that started on July 27, only 22,372 completed the entire exam process.DU is holding online exams in the open-book format (OBE) for final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students as a one-time measure amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite opposition from both students and teachers, DU has scheduled the online exams between August 10 and August 31. In OBE format, students have to download the question paper from an online portal and once they are done taking the exam, the answer sheets have to be scanned and uploaded. The university gives each student three hours for the entire process.A bench of justice Hima Kohli and justice Subramonium Prasad expressed its displeasure over the abysmally low number of students being able to complete the exam during mock tests and said it was “not comfortable with this figure”. The court’s remarks came while hearing pleas by law student Prateek Sharma and National Federation of Blind (NFB) seeking to set up effective mechanisms for visually impaired and specially abled students.On Thursday, DU filed an affidavit stating that 182,237 students had registered for online exams of whom 70,101 had logged in for the first phase of mock tests which started from July 27. DU said 39,159 students attempted the exams and only 22,372 could submit their answer sheets. With respect to persons with disability (PwD), the varsity told the court that 834 such students had registered for the OBE and only 142 could complete the exam process.Appearing for DU, senior counsel Sachin Datta, told the court that the mock test was conducted to familiarise the students with the online exam process and that they had given different subject papers to students. He said students may have got question papers that were not of their subject and hence they could not complete the exam.To this, the court said, “Why would you think that students would be able to answer something which is not of his/her subject?”.Senior advocate SK Rungta, appearing for NFB, told the court that several students could not take the exams for want of a scribe. He said 60 students had given a request to the varsity to provide them scribes -- 58 wanted the scribe at home, while two wanted them at the CSC (common service centre). The DU counsel told the court that they can only provide scribes at the CSC and not at home. The court said there was a “complete mismatch of information” after it was informed by the CSC director that they would only facilitate exams and would not have anything to do with scribes.“Look at the plight of the student. Several students are sitting outside Delhi. Let’s not forget that even if the metropolitan cities might have facilities, the other remote areas would not have proper connectivity. The paltry number of students having completed the exams against those registered raises some curiosity (sic),” the court said. The matter will next be heard on August 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-s-responsibility-to-provide-scribes-to-visually-impaired-students-says-high-court/story-6UBjmmXVwhnpDikiIGT6nN.html
30-07-2020||City||Three nabbed for robbing DU employee’s house of ₹14 lakh cash, gold||New Delhi: Three men were arrested on Thursday for robbing over ₹14 lakh cash and jewellery after barging into a Delhi University employee’s house and assaulting him and his mother on Monday afternoon, the police said. According to Rakesh Paweriya, deputy commissioner of police (crime branch), it was a relative of the victims who “unintentionally and accidentally” told one of the suspects about the presence of cash and jewellery in the house. The DU employee, however, said he suspected someone else of being the informer, but refused to share more details with HT. The 39-year-old victim works in the varsity’s administrative department and lives in a two-storeyed house in Dayalpur with his mother, wife and three children. His wife and children had been away when the incident took place — around 3.30pm on Monday. “Five men carrying pistols barged into the house. They cleared the house of ₹14.25 lakh cash, a lot of gold jewellery, some documents, and gadgets,” Paweriya said. The suspects had turned up the TV’s volume and went on to thrash the man and his mother. They then allegedly tied up both of them with bedsheets, stuffed cloth in their mouths and threatened that they would kill the man’s children, if he reported the matter to the police.The DU employee in his police statement said he was afraid of the robbers and decided to approach the police only after his neighbours and relatives convinced him. The police registered a case at Dayalpur police station and began probing the case, but it was the crime branch which got the breakthrough. “On Thursday, we received a tip-off that the suspects would visit Chand Bagh with the loot. We laid a trap and nabbed three men — Mohammad Chand, Javed and Salim. We recovered the robbed cash and jewellery from them,” Paweriya said. The officer said six men were involved in the crime and the mastermind was 30-year-old Chand.“He knew the victims’ family. Some days ago, a relative of the victims mentioned to him about the presence of cash and jewellery in the house. So, he roped in five people to arrange guns and loot the house,” Paweriya said. A hunt is on for the remaining three suspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-nabbed-for-robbing-du-employee-s-house-of-14-lakh-cash-gold/story-UDOhAv7oPbESFRFuxgtHgO.html
30-07-2020||City||Delhi riots: L-G refers lawyers’ panel issue to President||New Delhi: Delhi Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal on Thursday referred the issue pertaining to the appointment of a panel of lawyers to argue cases from February’s communal riots in the Capital to the President. The L-G also issued an interim order, saying till the matter is resolved by the President the panel of lawyers appointed by the Delhi Police and approved by his office will continue to argue cases. The Delhi government in a statement said that Baijal invoked Article 239AA(4) of the Indian Constitution and referred the dispute to the President, citing “differences of opinion” with the elected government. On Tuesday, the Delhi Cabinet, in its meeting chaired by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, had rejected the panel of lawyers proposed by the Delhi Police, saying it would not help a “free and fair” trial of the cases related to the riots in north-east Delhi. Following this, Kejriwal on Wednesday evening went to meet the L-G to discuss the issue.“The L-G invoked special powers granted to him under the Constitution. The home department of the Delhi government has been ordered to approve the panel chosen by the Delhi Police. The Delhi government will now have to implement the order at any cost as it is mandated by the Constitution,” the statement read.The L-G’s office refused to comment on the matter. On July 10, the Delhi police had sent a proposal to the Delhi government recommending the names of six special public prosecutors including Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta and Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Aman Lekhi to argue 85 cases related to the riots and the anti-CAA protests. But, the Delhi government had rejected Delhi police’s panel and had asked its home department to constitute an “impartial panel of the best possible lawyers in the country” to fight the cases of riots, which claimed 53 lives and left over 400 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-riots-l-g-refers-lawyers-panel-issue-to-president/story-ikPjSyQub5vjRe2RxnxWtO.html
30-07-2020||Mumbai||Before mosque, temple, Ayodhya was Buddhist site: Ramdas Athawale||In the backdrop of the scheduled Ram Mandir bhumi pujan on August 5, Union minister Ramdas Athawale and various Dalit outfits have demanded a grand Buddha Vihar in Ayodhya. Athavale said that the temple area was an ancient Buddhist pilgrimage site, hence a grand Buddha Vihar needs to be constructed in Ayodhya.“Before the temple and the Babri Masjid, there existed a Buddha Vihar. Since the Supreme Court has allowed the construction of Ram Mandir and even allotted a plot for Babri Masjid, we should also be given the plot to construct a grand Buddha Vihar,” said Athawale. He said he would shortly meet Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath to press for his demand.Noted singer Anand Shinde, also urged all Dalit leaders to sink their differences and come together to build the Buddha Vihar. “There were ancient Buddhist artefacts like stupas found during the levelling work of the temple. The Dalit leaders need to come together and work towards constructing a museum and a Buddha Vihar near the site,” said Shinde.Rajendra Gawai who heads the Republican Party of India (Gawai), said Ayodhya will become a symbol of religious harmony. “Ayodhya will have grand places of worship for all three major religions of India,” said Gawai.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of the Ram Temple on August 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/before-mosque-temple-ayodhya-was-buddhist-site-ramdas-athawale/story-0Bn2IA0SMg9QiONGnxLOKI.html

30-07-2020||Mumbai||Brown blanket of smoke in Raigad: MPCB notice to firm||The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) on Thursday issued a notice to Jindal Steel Works’ (JSW) Dolvi coke oven plant in Pen taluka, Raigad, after residents’ complained of excessive smoke released by the industrial unit, following a power outage.Residents said that thick brown voluminous smoke was released from the plant from 10.30am onwards on Wednesday, leading to yellowish-brown haze for hours in surrounding areas.A JSW spokesperson confirmed that it was for a period of 15 minutes. After the power outage, the plant was shut down but claimed the smoke was not toxic. MPCB said they called for an explanation on the absence of backup smoke emitting mitigation measures and issued a show-cause notice under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, Water Act, 1974, and the unit’s consent to operate.“The industry has violated the consent to operate since they did not have alternate electricity supply for their air pollution control equipment. Also, the pollution control system operation was not maintained properly that led to the sudden burst of smoke from coking coal. As a result, there was a huge quantity of emissions released into the environment. It is a potential health hazard for nearby local residents and workers within factory premises,” said JS Salunkhe, regional officer (Raigad), MPCB. Salunkhe added that MPCB plans on penalising the unit to ensure a similar incident was not repeated. “The industry has to explain why they should not be investigated and the entire coke oven plant not be shut down. Based on their response, fitting penalties will be levied,” said Salunkhe. JSW spokesperson said the smoke died down within 15 minutes as soon as the unit operation resumed. “Neither was the smoke hazardous or poisonous,” he said.Irked by the fumes, Dolvi resident Priyanka Tandel filed a complaint with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Wednesday. “Owing to an increase in pollution for several years now, Dolvi, Gadab, Wadkhal, Navegaon, Pen and several other villages are severely affected. Constant smoke causes distress to residents, especially children, the elderly and the sick. The company is playing with our lives but no action has been taken by pollution control state or Central agencies so far,” said Tandel.A resident of Pen-Vashi village Vijay Bhoir, who lives 10 km away from the plant, said, “A radius of 15 km around the plant was engulfed in brown smoke and led to breathing difficulty for my family and I. It took around five hours for the haze to settle down.”Environmental activist Kailash Anerao said, “It is unfortunate that big corporate groups are seen flouting pollution norms repeatedly and pollution control authorities are seen favouring them. If the draft environment impact assessment (EIA), 2020 becomes law then the public will not even be able to raise such issues anymore. The ‘polluters pay principle’ needs to be upheld.”MPCB TO ASSESS POLLUTION DATA FROM JSW TO ASSESS PENALTYAccording to MPCB, the 3.5 million tons per annum (MTPA) capacity coke oven plant is an extension of the 10 MTPA industrial site at Dolvi village, which recovers and supplies by-products like coke fines, crude tar, benzol, sulphur etc. The plant received environment clearance in February 2018 from the Union environment ministry with several conditions including the installation of five continuous air quality monitoring stations for PM2.5, PM10, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, and 22 continuous stack emission monitoring systems. These systems are connected online to the MPCB and CPCB portals. “We will be assessing the pollution data for Wednesday to check the breach of safety standards to finalise the penalty against the unit,” said Salunkhe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/brown-blanket-of-smoke-in-raigad-mpcb-notice-to-firm/story-62QqS2DZcP2DiPSxSvWNTO.html

Police said they were also investigating if the arrested suspects had links with certain hospitals.Senior police officials associated with the investigation said on Thursday that the role of some hospitals had come under scanner after vials and injections of remdesivir — an experimental drug administered to Covid-19 patients in emergency situations — were recovered in two raids this week. Investigators said that since remdesivir is directly supplied from manufacturing companies to the hospitals and there are no stockists of the drug, individuals associated with certain hospitals, local pharmacies and their nexus, in procuring and supplying medicines illegally to the arrested suspects, is being probed. The four Iraqi suspects arrested on Tuesday worked as interpreters at private hospitals and allegedly had ‘connections’ with distributors of pharmaceutical products.Aman Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Sadar, said, “The suspects have named three more pharmacists, who were allegedly involved in procuring and supplying injections to them. We have also received leads to suggest links with hospitals and an investigation to probe those links has been initiated. There could be other stakeholders involved . The investigation is now focused on making more arrests for which raids are being conducted.” On Wednesday night, the police had arrested a pharmacist, identified as Pardeep, who runs a medical store in Jharsa sector 38, for allegedly supplying remdesivir injections to the Iraqi suspects. Eighty four vials of Remdesivir, which the pharmacist had hidden in a room adjacent to a tubewell in his village near Pataudi, were recovered after a raid by police and officials of drug control department. Police said during questioning, Pardeep had named a Delhi-based supplier, from whom he had purchased the injections for Rs 15,000 per vial and then sold it to an Iraqi interpreter for Rs 18,000 per vial, without an invoice. The Iraqis had paid him Rs 15 lakh for supplying 84 remdesivir injections, which were supposed to be smuggled to Iraq through medical tourism patients. In Iraq, a vial of remdesivir, which costs Rs 5400 in India, is sold for Rs 1 lakh. A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “Based on inputs given by the pharmacist, a team had conducted a raid late on Wednesday night to trace the alleged supplier of remdesivir, but he was not found at the location shared by the accused.” Police said that two of the Iraqi suspects had earlier claimed that they had sourced some of the medicines from Kolkata, but in sustained questioning, they did not reveal any contacts or location of their supplier. “The suspects have not shared any specific location in Kolkata and have only mentioned names of a contact in Kolkata and one in the city, who was their supplier for the past six months,” said another police officer. Meanwhile, the pharmacist, Pardeep, was produced in a district court on Thursday and remanded to police custody for two days. Two Iraqi suspects arrested from sector 57 are currently in police custody till Saturday, while other two Iraqi nationals were remanded to two more days of police custody. On Tuesday, the police had arrested four Iraqi nationals in two separate raids from sector 47 and sector 57 after the drug control department had received a tip-off. Forty eight vials of Remdesivir, 55 strips of Fabiflu (Favipiravir) and 18 packs of Lopikast — the three drugs used in the treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus — among a large cache of antibiotics, antacids, anti-allergic and other cancer treatment medicines were recovered in the raid. One SUV and Rs 74.55 lakh cash was also seized. Police probe has found that the suspects had been smuggling medicines to Iraq for at least two years and since the pandemic, they had started dealing primarily in drugs used to treat Covid-19 which were in short supply and sold at exorbitant prices in Iraq.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-19-drugs-racket-three-more-pharmacists-some-hospitals-under-scanner/story-G7rjz9wsQd9B5UIFwOU7mN.html
30-07-2020||Gurugram||Industries in Manesar may have to get all their employees tested||Despite being notified as a large outbreak region (LOR) on July 15, emerging Covid-19 clusters in the industrial belt of Manesar have set the alarm bells ringing for the health department and the district administration alike. Labour and health department officials said the thrust is upon ramping up the testing in those areas where workers live. A proposal has also been floated that every industry will have to get its workers tested through antigen kits, the cost of which will be borne by the employer.According to the health department, in July, more than 100 Covid-19 cases have been reported from Manesar. Cases have been reported in under three Primary Health Centres - Manesar, Bhangrola and Kasan. The health department did not share the total number of cases reported since the industries have been allowed to resume in the region.A meeting in this regard was held on Wednesday among officials of the district administration, the labour department, the health department and the industrial association of the region. “The thrust is going to be on increasing the testing in the area. Companies have been asked to get their employees tested on their own by paying for the antigen test cost. But this is not compulsory. The health department is also holding testing camps in the area. The overall focus is on increasing the testing,” said Dinesh Kumar, deputy labour commissioner, Manesar.Confirming the move, Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer(CMO) said the proposal is yet to finalised. For this, the notification is likely to be issued by the district administration, he said.The industry association, on the other hand, has expressed disapproval for the proposal to get all the employees tested. “There are more than four lakh workers in Manesar. Testing each one of them is nearly impossible. Each antigen kit costs almost ₹510 and the test is valid for only two weeks. Getting employees tested twice a month is not feasible. It will be an added cost,” said Manmohan Gaind, general secretary, Manesar Industries Welfare Association. He said that protocols issued by Union ministry of home affairs to run industries with appropriate social distancing measures are sufficient enough. Gaind, who has a unit of home furnishing in Manesar said that any worker who has cough and cold or any Influenza Like Illness (ILI) are not kept with other employees. It is only after three days the worker is allowed to resume work only after getting the Covid-19 test.The health department has also been conducting rapid antigen testing camps in areas like Bhangrola, Kasan and Aliyar where most of the industrial workers live. “Tests are being conducted in several pockets of Manesar. In Bhangrola alone, more than 47 coronavirus cases were detected in July. The target is to aggressively conduct the antigen testing of symptomatic and high-risk cases with ILI and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) in these areas,” said Yadav, mentioning that a plan is being prepared. According to medical officers in three PHCs, over 30 testing camps have been organised in each of them. To figure out the prevalence of infection in industrial pockets, Yadav said that they will have to start with a sample size to decipher the positivity rate of a particular area. “Pockets have to be identified where the test positivity rate is around 5-10% to cut the chain of coronavirus transmission. To accelerate the process, a proposal has been floated with the administration to set up testing booth in the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) building.”Deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, who was present in the city on Thursday to hold meetings on labour issues, was asked about industrial areas in Gurugram emerging as Covid-19 clusters. He said, “Due to Covid-19, industries were shut in the last week of March and in April. But they could not remain closed for a long time as economy had to be restarted. Lockdown cannot be imposed if industries are to run to maintain the demand and supply. To tackle the Covid-19, the deputy commissioner is authorised to designate containment areas as he deems fit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/industries-in-manesar-may-have-to-get-all-their-employees-tested/story-AeES1HhSl0AC3zrQSJOHPK.html

Dushyant Chautala, deputy chief minister, Haryana, announced the proposed plan on Thursday, while speaking at a programme on the ‘one nation, one ration card’ scheme. Later Chautala also distributed ration to migrants workers from other states at John Hall in Civil Lines. “Existing fair price shops are unable to meet the demand of the people. As such, mobile ration depots can be set up to serve in the densely populated areas of the state, in addition to the existing fair price shops,” said Chautala, while addressing the gathering. He added that an example of this mobile unit has set by the food supplies department at John Hall, which distributed free ration to the migrant workers, who had gathered at the programme, from a mobile unit set up specifically for this purpose. Addressing the gathering, the deputy CM said that the new ration scheme will have three significant benefits for the poor, who avail ration at subsidised rates from the government-designated shops. First, any ration card holder will be able to take his or her share of ration from any ration depot wherever ration is available. Second, any ration card holder, irrespective of the state to which he or she belongs, will be able to get his/her share of prescribed ration from any other state as well. Third, the ration card holder can also get the ration from the depot of his choice by assessing the quality and quantity of the ration being offered, said Chautala. “The problems faced by migrant workers to avail ration during the Covid-19 lockdown led to the idea of ‘One Nation, One Ration Card’ scheme. The facility of keeping a digital record by attaching a POS machine with an e-weighing machine has also been started in Haryana. With this, the public distribution system in the state is now being digitally monitored,” he said. Under the scheme, the beneficiaries would be able to get his or her share of entitled foodgrains from any fair price shop in the country. The scheme was introduced in four states in 2019 as a pilot project. and at present has been implemented across 20 states in India. Under this scheme, a standard ration card with biometrics records of the holder has been prepared that can be used across the country, said officials. Haryana was among the first states to have implemented the scheme.  Director, Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department, Dr Chander Shekhar Khare, said that this scheme will curb the problem of fake ration cards, while ration depot holders will also be prompted to give good quality ration in full quantity. Khare also informed that this scheme will be implemented in the entire country by March 2021.Benefits for Contractual WorkersEarlier in the day, the deputy CM also chaired the second meeting of the State Advisory Contract Labour Board held at the PWD Guest House.In the meeting, Chautala said it has been decided to link all registered sites and organisations employing contract labour with the Haryana Udyam Memorandum (HUM) within the next six months. With this move all contract workers, especially construction workers will have to be registered which will help them get all the benefits prescribed under the Employee’s Provident Fund (EPF) rules and Employee’s State Insurance (ESI) Act, he said.It was also decided in this meeting that, in the next 6 months, it will be ensured that all organisations employing contractual labour have a HUM number. Under this, the registration of contractors and workers will be done with their Aadhaar number. The labour department will also confirm that every such organisation is registered. After February 1, 2021, if any contractor or organisation is not found registered, then strict action will be taken against it, he said.The second important agenda in the meeting was to allow employment of contract labour in the units related to the rubber industry. In this case, it was decided to invite suggestions from all industrial associations and trade unions, following which the labour board will take a decision.A number of trade union representatives also called upon the deputy CM and apprised him of the grievances faced by workers particularly because of the lay-offs during and after the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/one-nation-one-ration-card-scheme-mobile-depots-to-ensure-fair-distribution-chautala/story-UoQIpfGPp4HZeKYVyN8hYI.html

On Wednesday, the state had asked the criminal investigation department (CID) to look cases of small agricultural land being sold off without the requisite no-objection certificate.Chautala said the government was contemplating bringing an ordinance to plug loopholes in the law being used to carry out such illegal property deeds. Once the probe is over, the government would also revise the illegal registeries that have been carried out in violation of section 7A of Haryana urban areas act, he said. “An inquiry is being conducted into the matter of illegal property deeds being registered not only in Gurugram but other parts of the state as well. All those involved in these irregularities, whether they are revenue department officials, officials from town and country planning department, urban local bodies or others who have facilitated these violations, will not only face suspension but criminal action would be initiated against them,” said Chautala, while interacting with media persons at John Hall in Civil Lines. Chautala’s statement assumes significance as registries in violation of rules have been allegedly carried out by the revenue department even during the lockdown period. An RTI reply filed by a city based activist had also revealed that between April 20 to May 4, 129 such registries were carried out by the district revenue department. It was because of these revelations that Haryana government has ordered a ban on registry of properties from July 22 to May 17. On Wednesday, the CM Flying Squad, which is a wing of state CID department, said that it was probing the matter related to illegal registries and information had been sought from the revenue department in this regard. When asked why irregularities pertaining to departments he was holding such as excise and revenue were being exposed, Chautala said that this was due to the fact that he was prompt in taking action against the violations. “These irregularities are brought out in the open and strict action is taken against the culprits instead of brushing these matters under the carpet, which shows we mean business and are transparent,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/criminal-action-against-officials-if-found-involved-in-illegal-registries-haryana-deputy-cm/story-4YpvKNpwr5RMANt94g2mLI.html

The decision was taken by the department after receiving a representation from the hotel owners’ associations, asking for permission to serve alcohol in rooms at least. The excise officials said the permission has been granted only for three-star, four-star and five star hotels. Restaurants, pubs, and bars will continue to be prohibited from serving liquor for now.The officials said that they received requests from eight hotels so far and they have granted permission to all of them.Though, all star hotels would be allowed to serve liquor in rooms, they will need to apply for permissions individually. HC Dahiya, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (West), said that the permissions were granted to those who have paid the liquor licence fees for the quarter. “The hospitality sector has faced a disastrous situation with revenues plunging amid the Covid-19 outbreak. To revive the economic situation, the government has taken a step to support the liquor industry as it has been one of the biggest revenue-generating sectors,” he said. Officials said the hotel association of Gurugram had written to the department in June requesting them to waive their liquor license fees as they have been shut since March 25, when a lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 was first put in place. Aruna Singh, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (East), said that they had already waived one-third of licence fees, bringing it down to Rs 2 lakh, to support the hoteliers. “The hotels were also not allowed to serve or store liquor in rooms for guests so far. We had issued strict directions not to keep liquor in the room fridges also. Most of the hotels have stayed shut except for those listed under quarantine facility,” she said. The officials said there are 21 hotels across the city which are classified under star category. There are nine 5 star hotels, seven four star hotels and five 3 star hotels, which can soon resume serving liquor to guests. Restaurants were given permission to resume their operations at 50% capacity from June 8. Bars, however, remained shut. Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, said that the hotels have now been given permission to start taking bookings and to start their operations. The bars in such hotels will stay shut while the restaurants will need to adhere to the standard operating procedures regarding the preventive measures that have already been put in place. “Anyone found violating the guidelines will be dealt with strictly,” he said. Rohit Mann, director of Clarens Hotel in Sector 29, said that the business will pick up now as people would prefer to come to establishments that serve liquor to them. “The industry has suffered huge losses and this will start helping us recover some losses. Though, it will take at least three more months to get back to normal. People have started making online booking and we are getting at least 10 bookings a day from locals,” he said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-admin-allows-some-hotels-to-serve-alcohol-to-guests-in-room/story-gYZuxMcWW5bMx4DVOddxsI.html

However, three days later when the government allowed home isolation, the calls stopped suddenly. We had spent some money on making arrangements at the hotels but home isolation obviously turned out as a preferred choice,” said Ved Yadav, owner of the hotels in Bajaria.“With no patients, we had to withdraw from providing isolation facility and now run our hotels normally, although customer turnout is low due to Covid-19.”On July 20, the UP government allowed home isolation for asymptomatic patients based on several conditions, including a nod from the district administration. According to officials, 120 patients opted for the scheme and 104 of them were allowed by the district administration. “Our rapid response teams carefully screen the patients. So, the response is a bit low at present but it will pick up,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “However, there have been no takers so far for the hotel isolation facility which was also a low cost option for patients. But people have preferred the home isolation. Even the hotel owners have almost withdrawn from the scheme.”The home isolation scheme has also increased the utility of ‘Nigrani Samitis’ that were formed in every district to help the state keep track of symptomatic cases and monitor whether health protocols were being followed. “We have now dedicated a team in our control room which will be in touch with Nigrani Samitis twice a day. The idea behind this is to help us trace more symptomatic cases and get them tested at the earliest,” Pandey said. The district has about of 286 of these ‘Samitis’, with those in urban areas having three members, including the local councilors, while those in rural areas have 10-12 members each. The state government has also allowed for funds to the districts in order to any contingency. “The chief minister has directed that districts with over 2.5 million people be provided with ₹5 crore each, while the rest be given ₹3 crore each. This will help the district to take fast decisions in case they need to procure equipment, medicines or wish to make any payments at local level,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home). For the purpose, the state government has directed that a committee comprising of the district magistrate, chief medical officer and the chief development officer to be formed in every district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-takers-for-hotel-isolation-in-ghaziabad-people-prefer-to-stay-at-home/story-a9pmKyDgHBn4j96ZAUzlXN.html

The appointment of paramedical staff to the sector 39 hospital has been under controversy ever since the tender for hospital’s staff was cancelled by the then acting chief medical officer (CMO) Dr. Nepal Singh on June 14 citing some irregularity in the process. The district health society (DHS), of which the district magistrate (DM) is the ex-officio chairperson, then directed a private vendor agency to provide the personnel on contract till a new tender is ready. On Wednesday evening, when the applicants from the previous tender protested, district magistrate Suhas LY asked for a fresh merit list. “We have received some complaints about the irregularities in the selection process of the candidates. We want the entire appointment process transparent and merit-based. Chief development officer Anil Kumar Singh has been made the nodal officer. Under his supervision, the fresh merit list will be prepared and the appointment will be done only on the basis of merit,” he said. When contacted, Anil Kumar Singh, the CDO, said that the process of preparing fresh merit list has already begun. “Very soon, all the appointment will be done as per the merit of the applicants without any bias or favour,” he said. CMO Dr. Deepak Ohri said all the appointments will be made as per the government orders in this connection.The 400-bed Covid hospital, developed by Tata Project Limited (TPL) at the new district hospital building, will serve patients with moderate complications as well as those with mild symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/district-to-prepare-fresh-merit-list-for-appointing-staff-to-sector-39-district-hospital/story-qlfBMpzTxl7Vf9IZcfl75O.html

Apart from this, the DM extended prohibitory orders in the district up to August 31. However, only those Rakhi and sweets shops will be allowed to open which are located outside containment zones.At present, markets can open from 9am to 9pm for five days in a week while they are closed on Saturdays and Sundays, due to a weekend curfew imposed by the Uttar Pradesh government for taking up cleanliness and sanitization drives across districts.“Keeping in mind the upcoming festival, we have allowed shops selling sweets and those selling Rakhis to open on Sunday, which otherwise is a closing day for markets, so that residents can make purchases for the festival. However, they will have to adhere to the health protocols while maintaining social distancing and wearing masks. The shopkeepers are also to take up required measures as directed earlier,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, Ghaziabad. He added that the prohibitory orders were extended due to approaching festivals. “The prohibitory orders have been extended up to August 31 due to festivals. Anyone who flouts directions will face legal action,” Pandey added. Besides, night curfew will continue to be in place from 10pm to 5am, though the central government had relaxed this rule but had left it up to states to decide for themselves. The Ministry of Home Affairs had issued new guidelines on July 29 for opening up of more activities in areas outside containment zones. In Unlock 3, which will come into effect from August 1, 2020, the process of phased re-opening of activities has been extended further. Under the Centre’s new guidelines, the restrictions on movement of individuals during night (night curfew) have been removed besides the opening of Yoga institutes and gymnasiums will be allowed to open from August 5.“The states and Union Territories, based on their assessment of the situation, may prohibit certain activities outside the Containment zones, or impose such restrictions as deemed necessary.

The official further directed that the suspect cases found during the drive should be tested with the help of Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test, considered the golden standard in testing for Sars-Cov-2. The one-day drive is to be conducted on Friday. The nodal officer, Senthil Pandian C, on Thursday took a review of all Covid-19-related measures in Ghaziabad and asked officials to expedite pending works.According to official records, out of 4,855 total cases till morning of July 30 (as per live portal data), 23,138 contacts of 4,701 positive cases, with a rate of about 96.84%, were traced. Going by the figures, the average contact per positive patient is about 4.9. Of the 23,138 contacts traced, about 90.4% were also tested, said officials of the district health department. “The nodal officer took review of contact tracing and appreciated our efforts. The rate of contact tracing in Ghaziabad is high and we have planned that the pending work of contact tracing will also be traced and if required, the help of police surveillance will also be taken up. Further, we had also shifted focus on immediate testing of contacts in order to control the spread of the infection. At times, we found cases where mobile numbers or addresses of contacts were not found correct or they move to other cities. So, sometimes it leads to delays,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.“Our dedicated teams at the control room are working hard to increase the rate further. A majority of cases have come up in the month of July and the rate of contact tracing in July is almost touching 96%. Besides this, we are also focussing on fast uploading of contact tracing data on the state government’s portal,” said Pandey. According to officials, a total of 2,918 contacts of 3,052 patients were traced from July 1 to July 29 (95.6%), which resulted in tracing of 14,243 contacts with 4.88 contacts per patient and about 92% were also tested. For the one-day special drive in containment zones, the nodal officer also directed the Ghaziabad officials to mandatorily take up RT-PCR tests of cases of ILI and SARI in containment zones. From July 2 to July 12, the UP government had also directed a special door-to-door surveillance drive during which suspected cases of ILI and SARI were also identified and 150 of these were found positive after testing. “The nodal officer directed that a one-day special drive is to be carried out in containment zones having a high number of cases, and cases of ILI and SARI should be scanned. He especially directed that instead of antigen tests, such cases should be tested only with RT-PCR test. Friday has been decided as the day for holding the drive. This shall continue till further orders,” the DM added. According to official figures, about 2,50,618 households were surveyed from July 13 to July 29 (after UP government’s special surveillance drive from July 2 to July 12), covering a population of about 9,85,498 persons. Officials said they identified 237 cases of ILI and 233 of SARI cases and 19 of the total tested positive for Covid-19. According to the official figures till Thursday morning, the health department so far has completed total testing of 95,361 tests, out of which 4,856 have tested positive so far since the first week of March, when the first Covid-19 case was detected in the district. At present, the district has an overall positivity rate of about 5.1% and recovery rate of about 83.7% (4,009 patients recovered) while the fatality rate is about 1.3% with a total of 64 deaths so far.

30-07-2020||City||HC allows Punjab pvt schools to deposit ‘continuation fee’||Chandigarh The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday allowed 100-odd private schools in Punjab to deposit continuation fee for 2020-2021. The order was passed by high court bench of justice Sudip Ahluwalia on the plea of Punjab Private School Organization, a Patiala-based body, with 102 members across the state, which had challenged the June 12 instructions of the Punjab School Education Board (PSEB). Their counsel, PK Goklaney told court that PSEB has imposed an unacceptable condition that depositing of the continuation fees from the institution would be permissible only if the private schools concerned give an undertaking on certain norms put in place by the government. The response from the PSEB and state government has been sought by September 22.The PSEB charges continuation fee of Rs 10,000 for up to matric and Rs 20,000 for up to senior secondary from the schools. However, this year, they were told that only those schools would be permitted to deposit the fee, who sign the undertaking. Otherwise, they were not allowed to deposit the fee, which would result in closure of schools on March 31, 2021. In the undertaking, the schools had to comply with certain conditions by December 31, 2021. The conditions included having classrooms of specific size, number of rooms, according to level of the schools. Conditions have also been imposed on installing labs, following school fee and syllabus norms and having a playground. The approved site plan and the Change-in-Land-Use (CLU), in this regard, had to be deposited with the PSEB. The high court while allowing schools to deposit fee without the undertaking, said that such deposit would not automatically grant them the right of continuation, and would be dependent on the result of this petition in court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-allows-punjab-pvt-schools-to-deposit-continuation-fee/story-AWsUtMzg8477aOrk65PZyK.html

Six labourers and a farmer of Muchhal village, 30km from here, died between Wednesday night and Thursday evening after falling ill in a mysterious manner. Five of the victims were cremated without a post-mortem. Taking note of the seriousness of the matter, senior superintendent of police (rural) Vikram Jeet Duggal placed Tarsikka SHO Bikramjit Singh under suspension for negligence. A woman resident of the village was also arrested on the suspicion of selling homemade liquor. Those dead were identified as Dalbir Singh, 60; Balwinder Singh, 55; Kuldeep Singh, 24; Mangal Singh, 52; Baldev Singh, 45; Kashmir Singh, 75, and Kala Singh, 45. An eighth person, Joga Singh, 28, is critical at a private hospital. Joga Singh’s nephew Gurjant Singh said, “My uncle’s condition is serious. He and others had consumed homemade liquor on Wednesday night.” Villagers and the kin of the victims blamed the authorities, saying little was being done to check the sale of illicit liquor which was available at dirt-cheap price in the area. SSP (rural) Duggal said, “So far, six deaths are confirmed. We have arrested Balwinder Kaur of Muchhal on the suspicion of selling illicit liquor. A case under section 304 (culpable homicide) has also been registered against unidentified people at Tarsikka police station. SP (investigation) Gaurav Toora will lead the SIT to investigate the matter,” the SSP added. Sarpanch Rajwinder Kaur’s husband Daljit Singh said that illicit liquor and intoxicants were a big problem in the village. “We have been lodging police complaints regularly,” he said. He, however, claimed, these deaths were unrelated to the menace. On why the panchayat didn’t ask the police to conduct the post-mortems, Daljit said, “The police had asked the victims’ family members to allow autopsies, but they didn’t agree.” However, some people claimed police pressured families to cremate the dead. “Police reached the victims’ houses and pressured the families to conduct cremation and demands of some villagers for post-mortem were ignored. Family members of the victims say homemade liquor led to the deaths,” said Baz Singh, former sarpanch of the village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hooch-shadow-on-7-deaths-in-amritsar-village-sit-formed-sho-suspended/story-441ThbNnNh38ykbFksCGPJ.html

The state government had on Sunday decided to make plasma available to private hospitals from its plasma bank at a cost of ₹20,000 per unit. A notification was also issued in this regard.However, the move drew all-round flak, especially from opposition parties which accused the government of profiteering. Aam Aadmi Party state president Bhagwant Mann even announced to stage a state-wide protest on Friday against the government move to sell donated plasma at an astronomical rate to coronavirus patients undergoing treatment in various private hospitals in the state.In his statement, the chief minister also appealed to the recovered patients to come forward to save the lives of others. He urged all deputy commissioners (DCs) and health department officials, during a review meeting on Thursday, to motivate such patients to donate plasma. Currently, there are around 10,000 recovered Covid-19 patients in the state.The CM also asked the health department to expedite setting up of two new plasma banks in Amritsar and Faridkot to supplement the one already operational in Patiala. He was informed by medical education minister OP Soni that the approvals for the new banks have already been received and tenders are being floated for the procurement of equipment.Chief secretary Vini Mahajan suggested that all the field officers, including DCs and SSPs, should remain at their headquarter towns even at night for the next two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/under-fire-for-profiteering-punjab-to-now-provide-plasma-for-free/story-k5NZgKLQk4fqiaL5TvdLaO.html

30-07-2020||Chandigarh||Unlock 3.0: Punjab CM seeks DCs’ views on opening gyms, coaching centres||Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday said the final decision on opening of gyms and coaching centres, and other relaxations in Unlock 3.0 will be taken after detailed deliberations on inputs received from the deputy commissioners (DCs).During a review meeting (through video-conferencing) with the DCs and health officials on Covid-19 containment and management arrangements, the CM said while the central government has announced certain relaxations, including permission for gyms and coaching centres, as per the Unlock 3.0 guidelines, he will decide on the same after an assessment of the ground situation. He asked the DCs to think through and submit their views to chief secretary Vini Mahajan.Taking serious note of reports of violation of social distancing and other Covid-19 protocols by some shopkeepers, Amarinder directed the DCs to order shutdown of shops for three days in the case of first offence and more number of days for subsequent violations. He further asked the DCs to strictly enforce all safety protocols and norms, including wearing of masks and social distancing, to check the spread of the pandemic.Dr KK Talwar, who heads the expert committee advising the state government on health and medical education, said scientific data shows that wearing of masks is as effective as lockdown, as it not only prevents spread of infection but also lowers mortality. DGP Dinkar Gupta, who was also present, said from March 23 to July 29, a total of 14,384 FIRs have been registered and 19,850 persons arrested for various violations. Another 5.50 lakh persons have been fined for violation of the Covid-19 guidelines.Expressing grave concern over the increasing mortality, the chief minister called for concerted efforts to bring down the fatality rate. “With early detection being the only cure, the message of early treatment has to go down more effectively,” he said, directing the DCs to take all steps necessary to create awareness among people to go for testing at the first sign of illness.Given the spiralling cases, he said, all DCs should work closely with the health department and police to secure the willing cooperation and support of people, especially religious and community leaders. The DCs of some of the worst affected districts — Amritsar, Jalandhar, Patiala and Mohali — briefed the meeting on the situation in their respective regions and the measures being taken to monitor, track, test and treat people, according to an official release. Jalandhar SSP said given the social stigma attached to the illness, the district police had made it mandatory for all chemists to report those buying medicines for the treatment of fever and flu.Amarinder suggested the appointment of a dedicated Covid prevention monitor to ensure compliance at every private institution where a number of people are expected to come. He also asked the DCs to take steps for distribution of masks free of cost to the needy, and also make sanitisers and mask vending machines available in public places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/unlock-3-0-punjab-cm-seeks-dcs-views-on-opening-gyms-coaching-centres/story-w3DCIzXLIMgTAtcp7RBDWP.html

The parking lot was to come up in Udyog Vihar Phase 5 alongside Vanijya Kunj, which is the office of the agency. However, despite repeated demands of the industrialists the land could never be developed as a parking complex or multi-use commercial complex with parking facilities, said Takyar.“There has been a massive increase in the number of cars coming to Udyog Vihar and there is no commensurate parking space available in the area. I have been fighting for this multilevel parking space for the last several years but nothing has moved. The officials say that a new site has been earmarked but nothing concrete has been offered to entrepreneurs,” he said.The report submitted by the registrar said that the details of the complaint allegedly prove that HSIIDC had approved a multilevel car parking at Udyog Vihar and the report submitted to the court proved that no steps had been taken so far allegedly by HSIIDC with regard to the project.“The comments itself show that the matter has been referred for best use study project and the intention of HSIIDC is not to construct the multilevel parking and intention is to use the said land for these purposes. Lokayukta may consider recommending appropriate action against the officers who are responsible for delaying the construction of multi-level parking project, without reasonable cause,” the report submitted by the registrar said.When asked about the matter, Sunil Paliwal, estate officer (HSIIDC), Udyog Vihar, Gurugram, said that parking is made available to entrepreneurs and visitors on open spaces owned by the agency in different parts of Udyog Vihar. “Parking is made available on first-cum-first-serve basis and there is no shortage of space. As far as an alternative site for multilevel parking is concerned, the matter is under consideration of higher authorities in Chandigarh and a decision will be taken by them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/lokayukta-registrar-recommends-action-for-delay-in-multilevel-parking/story-rAkygfKECUyrMr5SPVKtWN.html

Chief spokesperson of LIP, Gagandeep Singh (Sunny) Kainth, said, “The road is in pathetic condition for over three years and accidents take place due to deep potholes. Despite complaints and requests submitted with PWD authorities, no steps have been taken to recarpet the road.”“Even the Congress MLA is not bothered. The lackadaisical approach of the department can be judged from the fact that a few days ago, a senior PWD official asked villagers to stage a protest to wake the department from its deep slumber. We were forced to protest and will continue the agitation till the road is constructed,” he added.Despite several attempts, PWD superintending engineer Kulwant Singh could not be reached for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-lip-up-in-arms-against-pwd-over-not-re-carpeting-sahnewal-dehlon-road/story-sGBYXT8ZATzrTecREHkFiJ.html

Welcoming the initiative such as teaching in mother tongue till Class 5, less academic pressure in their initial years in school, more focus on research, some educationists said that government needs to hire more teachers, boost infrastructure to implement this policy and allowing global institutes to set up campuses in India to increase competition.Appreciating the Centre for announcing the new education policy, Vandna Shahi, principal of BCM School, Dugri, said, “The new education policy has a futuristic approach, more emphasis on 21st-century skills, application of core concepts to be evaluated so rote learning discouraged, learning outcomes and competencies-based pedagogy and vocational subjects from Class 6 will help in skills development. It is a great step of bringing ECE level into the system and making it joyful till Class 2, this will reduce the burden on children.”A teacher at Malwa Senior Secondary School, Model Gram, Parambir Singh, said, “This policy will improve understanding of concepts. Allowing students to choose their own subjects based on their talent and interest in Class 8 to 11, is a welcome step as this way equal emphasis can be laid on all subjects. But to implement this policy there is a need to have more teachers and infrastructure at schools and colleges level.”Dharam Singh Sandhu, principal of Satish Chander Dhawan Government College said, “It is a great step by the ministry and the multiple exit/entry and the credit bank will give students a lot of flexibility in getting educated and earning degrees while they are working. In the policy, it is also stated that universities need to be research intensive, enterprising and multidisciplinary and colleges can focus on academic study. The step of allowing foreign universities to set up campuses in India will no doubt increase competition among the institutes but the government needs to keep a check that the institutions are focusing on providing education to students, instead of turning out into business institutions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-education-policy-ludhiana-educationists-demand-govt-to-hire-more-teaching-staff/story-8YK2Bj9wc2c9W29qpmNcdJ.html

District Education Officers (DEOs) will ensure compliance with immediate effect. “DEOs will also upload this information on their respective departmental websites, including the name of the schools that are not compliant and also a school compliant in one and non-compliant in the other two,” adds the order. “Schools will not evade sharing the complete status quo on all three points, fire and building safety certificates and board affiliation certificate. Each compliance or non-compliance must be clearly stated on the website,” said the order. The order was pronounced after a petition filed by Kamaldeep Kaur of Amritsar against respondents project director, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, and district education officer (elementary). The petitioner had asked for information about affiliation and safety certification of a privately-run school. However, the information received by the petitioner was incomplete, subsequent to which an appeal was filed. “There’s a humongous public interest in taking a broader view of the issue of safety of children and staff in schools than confining it to one school. It is evident from the ongoing hearings of this case that some schools – whether they are private, government-aided or government-operated may not be meeting and complying with the prescribed standards of building and fire safety norms set by the appropriate authority,” said the information commissioner.The commission has asked the government authority to issue guidelines to schools for implementation of the order. It asked a representative of the appropriate authority to be present at the next date of hearing on August 25 to show evidence that the order is being complied with.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/make-safety-affiliation-certifications-public-punjab-info-panel-directs-schools/story-arKH21PrDQpM1jlDv9n9UK.html

Activists have raised objections regarding the outer ring road project before the country’s environmental watchdog. NGT, while hearing the petition, asked the ministry of environment and forests to submit their say on the project. The ministry, in its reply, stated objections. The questions raised by the ministry include why a 40-year-old project is being forced upon residents despite public opposition? why politicians and administration are taking interest in the project when the government machinery is falling short of funds due to the Covid-19 pandemic? and why PMC is circumventing the procedure of environmental clearance for HCMTR? Sarang Yadwadkar, urban planner and one of the petitioners, said, “HCMTR was planned 40 years ago and was meant only for public transport, but now the plan is converted for private transport. The project would badly impact the environment causing massive air pollution and many buildings would need to be demolished.” Nagrik Chetna Manch’s activist Qaneez Sukhrani said, “On what grounds have an outdated plan of HCMTR been approved by PMC? How can it go ahead without having the environment clearance?” The activists said that the issues raised by the ministry in the affidavit are in line with their concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-s-outer-ring-road-project-will-need-clearance-from-environment-ministry/story-F9kMxqI6WBMKWO8l8dKfOK.html

Sugarcane is cultivated on large scale as a cash crop in the state and thus there is immense scope for SHGs to make earnings by selling seedlings,” said Sanjay R Bhoosreddy, commissioner, cane and sugar, department Uttar Pradesh. The women SHGs will prepare sugarcane nursery at their village level through ‘single bud’ and ‘bud chip’ methods to help them augment their income by selling the seedlings. The Cane Development Council and sugar mills have jointly selected villages for imparting training to women entrepreneurs. Bhoosreddy also said that necessary machinery, on subsidised rates with the cooperation of sugar mills, will be provided to the SHGs. The women are being given training regarding seed selection, cutting bud pieces from the hand-operated machine, germination in-tray, time of growing, and method of planting. The move would also help the state to increase the new sugarcane varieties from single bud and bud chip nursery. The seedlings prepared by the methods will solve the problem of late sowing due to excessive moisture in the fields for autumn cane sowing in lowland and flood-prone areas while autumn cane area will also increase. The method will also be useful in case, the cane is sown late after harvesting of wheat crop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-cane-seedlings-in-demand-up-govt-imparts-training-in-nurturing-them/story-gAJmeYwpz5bOWLBrtA25yN.html

Individuals, however, will be free to pay obeisance. I have announced July 31 as a holiday,” Sangrur deputy commissioner Ramvir told HT, adding that government establishments and banks will remain closed. Udham Singh killed General Michael O’ Dwyer, the former lieutenant governor of Punjab, who ordered the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919, on March 13, 1940, in Caxton Hall London. The Ghadarite was hanged on July 31, 1940.Despite 80 years of Udham Singh’s hanging and four years of announcement, the construction of his memorial is still pending in Sunam.

30-07-2020||Chandigarh||Must educate people about anti-corruption steps of Khattar govt: Nadda to BJP cadre||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) national president, Jagat Prakash Nadda, on Wednesday called upon the foot soldiers of the party in Haryana to give top priority to spreading awareness about anti-corruption and pro-development steps taken by the Manohar Lal Khattar-led state government since 2014. Addressing the frontline state BJP leaders and party workers through a videoconference after inaugurating six digitally equipped party offices, Nadda said the hot topic of discussion across Haryana should be how the governance in the state has become corruption-free. “Manohar sarkar ne Haryana ki tavasir badal di...Haryana bhrashtachaar se mukt hua aur vikas yukt hua...(Manohar-led government changed the face of Haryana...Haryana became free of corruption and incorporated development...) We must understand this and take note of it,” Nadda said as he recalled how the state was once notorious for corruption, especially in government recruitments and transfers of employees. He said the corruption in government recruitments before the first-ever BJP government was formed in Haryana in October 2014 was so much so that certain politically powerful people were undergoing imprisonment for their involvement in recruitment scam. Haryana has always been, Nadda said, very auspicious land for the BJP. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had started his election campaign from Rewari ahead of 2014 Lok Sabha polls and after the BJP came to power at the Centre, the party formed its first regional government with full majority in Haryana. During Wednesday’s virtual meet, Nadda set the agenda for the newly appointed state party chief Om Prakash Dhankar when he said “we should work on our political content in Haryana” and underlined the need of educating people about the steps the state government has been taking to eradicate corruption and usher in the state on the path of development. The national BJP chief said the resolve of each party worker should be to make Haryana a number one state of the country. Nadda, who is a former Union health minister, advised the party cadre to make best use of the offices equipped with the latest digital tools, including videoconference facilities. He asked the cadre to form groups of party workers up to the booth-level, make committees and inject political content via WhatsApp groups. “We don’t discuss weather in our party offices. We are pure political workers...Hamara rajnitik content hona chahiye (Our content should be political),” he said, asking senior leaders to teach workers the culture of the party. ‘Some parties are still in lockdown mode’In an indirect hit at the opposition parties, BJP’s national president JP Nadda said all political parties had locked themselves down during the lockdown, except the BJP. He said only the BJP ensured to remain fully plugged with the people during the lockdown with the help of digital tools. He quipped that some parties were still in the lockdown mode.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/must-educate-people-about-anti-corruption-steps-of-khattar-govt-nadda-to-bjp-cadre/story-7yr6RyWk2WOGxJmuVrVnTN.html

30-07-2020||Pune||DIAT develops bed isolation system for Covid +ve patients||In the current pandemic, due to the continuous increase of Covid-19 positive patients, the bed requirement is increasing day by day. The Defence Institute of Advanced Technology, (DIAT) Pune has developed Aashray, the medical bed isolation system to combat Covid-19 by minimizing the spread of the infection released by the patient. This is a low cost, reusable solution to maintain proper isolation of Covid-19 patients by creating suction, negative pressure near exhale, and further filtering and disinfecting the aerosol. The bed isolation system envelopes are made up of specialized material and manufacturing process with transparent and translucent 7.5(l) ×7(w) ×6.5(h) ft3 size supported on medical grade materials structure. The product is modular and portable in design and can be suitable for different requirements such as institutional, hospitals and home individual quarantine. The envelope is reusable as it is antibacterial-antifungal and can be sanitized. Each envelope is capable of housing one set of bed, table and chair along with some walking space. The width of the envelope can be adjusted as per the availability of space. The envelope is opaque up to 3 feet from bottom to maintain the privacy of the patient. The entire envelope is maintained at a low pressure (suction) with adjustable flow rate to restrain the spread of infection inside the hall or the intensive care unit (ICU). Each envelope is connected to the main duct equipped with UV light and filter circuit of pre, fine and HEPA filter (recommended for medical application) and suction blower. The cross-flow of air from the top of the envelope towards the main duct is regulated (with a flap valve) as per the comfort conditions of the patient. The contaminants are continuously sucked through the duct and accumulated at the filters which are projected with UV light. The suction blower throws the filtered and contamination-free air to the outside environment. As per prototype manufacturer (M/s Cleancore Solutions Pvt Ltd. Bhosari, Pune) the cost of the setup for a unit of 10 beds are Rs 1 lakh approximately and for home quarantine, it is Rs 15,000 for a single bed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/diat-develops-bed-isolation-system-for-covid-ve-patients/story-rwo5OMQjv4qNCVEQlkpH4M.html

He has also fixed charges for private ambulances. The move assumes significance as many private hospitals are to begin treating patients from August 1. The district has only 23 ambulances with an average of 50 persons testing positive a day for the past month. The number of cases has also trebled from 733 on July 1 to 2,165 cases on July 29.

30-07-2020||Chandigarh||3 new ministers join Jai Ram Thakur cabinet in Himachal||Shimla: BJP president JP Nadda helped Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jai Ram Thakur consolidate his position in the state unit as three new ministers, including two of his loyalists, were inducted into the cabinet at a low-key ceremony at Raj Bhawan here on Thursday. In view of the Covid-19 guidelines, governor Bandaru Dattatreya administered the oath of office to Rakesh Pathania, Rajinder Garg and Sukhram Chaudhary at the function attended by 50 people, including Thakur and his cabinet colleagues. Pathania and Garg are Nadda’s confidants and political observers see their induction into the 31-month-old ministry as a move by the BJP chief to gain hold in the state’s politics. CASTE AND REGIONAL EQUATIONS Jai Ram Thakur struck a regional balance with his ministry’s expansion. Rajput leader Pathania was given preference to appease the electorate in the politically sensitive Kangra district. Kangra has always had a lion’s share in the ministry. Two cabinet berths had fallen vacant after Bipin Singh Parmar was appointed speaker and Kishan Kapoor was elected to the Lok Sabha. Chaudhary was accommodated to give ensure representation to other backward classes. Garg belongs to Hamirpur, a stronghold of former chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal. Dhumal’s son and Union minister of state for finance Anurag Thakur is a four-time Lok Sabha member from Bilaspur. Garg’s elevation as minister will help both Nadda and Jai Ram Thakur check Dhumal’s clout in Hamirpur parliamentary constituency. Of the 68 assembly segments in Himachal Pradesh, 17 are reserved. Scheduled castes comprise 26.5% of the population, the second most dominant community after the Rajputs at 37.5%. KNOW THE NEW MINISTERS Nurpur MLA Rakesh Pathania, 55, Close to JP Nadda, he was elected as a BJP nominee in 1998 and re-elected as an independent in 2007 before becoming MLA for the third time in 2017. A Rajput, he was vying for a cabinet berth since 2017. Rajputs are a dominant caste in Kangra, which comprises 15 assembly segments. Paonta Sahib MLA Sukhram Chaudhary, 58, is an OBC leader from Sirmaur. He was elected to the Vidhan Sabha in 2003, 2007 and 2017 and parliamentary secretary from 2009-12. Jai Ram Thakur’s backing to him to sideline former party chief Rajeev Bindal helped him get a berth. Ghumarwin MLA Rajinder Garg, 54, is an old RSS worker and ABVP leader but first-time legislator. His loyalty to party chief JP Nadda found him a place in the cabinet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3-new-ministers-join-jai-ram-thakur-cabinet-in-himachal/story-QjjjmcCRQpnABzNVVfl1BM.html
30-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi airport to relocate UV sanitization tunnels to inline baggage handling system||Delhi airport will relocate ultraviolet tunnels installed outside the departure terminal to sanitize passengers’ luggage amid the Covid-19 pandemic to the inline baggage handling system, its operator DIAL said on Thursday.Once the new system is put in place, passengers will not have to queue up at the departure forecourt area and go through manual loading and unloading of baggage.Before resumption of domestic passenger flights in May, the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) had installed eight UV tunnels outside the entry gates in the departure forecourt area of Terminal 3. “Flyers used to sanitize their baggage before entering the terminal to board their flight. The decision to shift these UV tunnels was taken after passenger queues were observed during peak hours,” the GMR group-led DIAL said in a press statement.“The DIAL has planned to relocate UV tunnels at the inline baggage handling system by the end of this month. As all departure luggage are routed through it, hence it will ensure sanitisation of all check-in baggage,” it said. The flyers can directly go to the check-in counter, drop their baggage and the inline system will ensure their sanitisation automatically, the release said.All passenger flights are currently being operated from Delhi airport’s Terminal 3 due to less air traffic amid the pandemic.India resumed domestic passenger flights from May 25 after a gap of two months due to the pandemic. Airlines have been allowed to operate only a maximum of 45 per cent of their pre-Covid domestic flights.However, occupancy rate in Indian domestic flights has been around 50-60 per cent since May 25. Earlier this month, India had formed bilateral air bubbles with countries like the UAE, the US, Germany and France that allows airlines of both the countries in the pact to operate special international charter flights under certain restrictions.Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23.The aviation sector has been significantly impacted due to travel restrictions imposed in India and other countries in view of the pandemic. All airlines in India have taken cost-cutting measures such as pay cuts, leave without pay and firings of employees in order to conserve cash.Since May 6, international charter flights have been operated by Air India under the Vande Bharat Mission to help stranded people reach their destinations. Private carriers have also operated a certain number of flights under this mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-airport-to-relocate-uv-sanitization-tunnels-to-inline-baggage-handling-system/story-JZ7NRxLDjqfwrXDlzJFYqK.html

During the last few days, a series of FIRs have been lodged against each other at different police stations and even clashes have erupted between them in some areas.On Tuesday, the two groups of kinnars clashed in Muthiganj area resulting in injuries to some of them. A large number of kinnars from both groups created a ruckus at Muthigaj police station demanding to lodge FIRs against each other. The police booked 13 kinnars of both groups under section 151 for disturbing peace.The two groups of kinnars have been accusing each other of intruding in their respective areas for ‘neg’ for more than a year now. The group of kinnars affiliated to the Kinnar Akhada claim that a new group of kinnars is illegally operating in their areas and collecting ‘neg’ on auspicious occasions.Meanwhile, the other group of kinnars, which has few members, alleges that owing to their large numbers, the other group is bullying them and implicating them in false cases at different police stations of the city. “We were also born in Prayagraj and are living and earning our living here for many years. We are a group of over a dozen kinnars from different parts of Prayagraj who wish to live and earn peacefully but since a year some kinnars affiliated to the Kinnar Akhada have been harassing us.“Although the main reason for the situation is interference in our area, another big reason is that we do not want to affiliate ourselves with the Akhada, or acknowledge its supremacy. They are not only attacking and injuring us but even implicating our group members in false cases using their influence,” complained Chhoti Kinnar who heads a small group of kinnars in Prayagraj. Meanwhile, SP (city) Dinesh Singh said some FIRs have been lodged against a group of kinnars. Investigations were underway in this connection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/kinnars-at-loggerheads-two-rival-groups-clash-lodge-firs/story-AcnmOPVqVFPD8supV4UIWN.html

Johnson, 56, a cycling enthusiast, was seen riding a Hero Viking Pro bike to Canalside Heritage Centre at Beeston in Nottingham, central England, on Tuesday as he launched a £2 billion (Rs 19,392 crore) cycling and walking drive, which is part of the UK government’s anti-obesity strategy to combat Covid-19. TIME TO SHIFT GEARS A Covid-19 survivor, Johnson unveiled plans for thousands of miles of new protected bike lanes, cycle training for everyone and bikes available on prescription as part of a new fitness strategy. “From helping people get fit and lowering their risk of illness, to improving air quality and cutting congestion, cycling and walking have a huge role to play. Now is the time to shift gears and press ahead with our biggest and boldest plans to boost active travel -- so that everyone can feel the transformative benefits of cycling,” he said. The Viking Pro bike used by the UK prime minister is a part of India’s Hero Motors Company owned Insync brand, designed in Manchester and made in India by parent company Hero Cycles. Hero Cycles took over the brands Viking, Riddick and Ryedale and redesigned the range under the brand name Insync. The company said its Insync range consists of 75 bikes and is the first to be designed at Hero Cycles Global Design Centre (HGD) in Manchester. DELIGHT IN LUDHIANA “Insync is delighted that the Prime Minister rode one of our Viking bikes after announcing what will be a landmark moment for cycling in the UK,” said Pankaj M Munjal, chairman and managing director of Hero Motors Company, which includes Hero Cycles, Insync, the Viking and Lectro brands. “We strongly back all measures announced in the strategy, a move we hope will see many more thousands of people taking to the roads on two wheels. Providing safer cycle routes, funding towards e-bikes and a bike repairs scheme will encourage even more riders to return to cycling or take it up for the first time, building on the stand-out success the industry has seen during the pandemic,” he said. Last month, Hero Cycles had snapped up a Rs 900-crore deal with China in a major step towards indigenous production. Cycling sure has a long way to go.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/uk-pm-boris-johnson-rides-made-in-india-bike-at-launch-of-cycling-drive/story-gBKjtLQYryDcPykgJeiZzM.html
30-07-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana’s ML Khattar govt to undo 2017 amendment in urban areas law||Course Correction: Move come following reports of circumvention of law by real estate developers The BJP-led government in Haryana is contemplating to undo a 2017 amendment in Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act it had steered in the state assembly to water down section 7-A of the Act. The stipulations in section 7-A pertained to the grant of a no-objection certificate (NoC) by the town and country planning department (TCPD) before registration of land in notified urban areas.The requirement of NoC stating that land transfer does not contravene any provisions of the Act was to prevent ill-planned and haphazard construction in urban areas. An ordinance to amend the law again is likely to be promulgated soon, officials said.The move to undo the amendment comes in the wake of reports of large-scale violations in registration of sale deeds of properties without obtaining the NoCs in notified urban areas in Gurugram district. Subsequently, the government had last week halted the registration of transfer deeds across the state for a limited period citing alleged corrupt practices. The revenue department, which flagged the section 7-A violations, has written to the TCPD to make appropriate changes in the law.THE 2017 AMENDMENTThe 2017 amendment in section 7-A of the Act led to two modifications in the provision. First, it decreased the size of notified urban area land holding, for which NoC is required, from less than one hectare (2.5 acres) to less than two kanals. Secondly, the definition of land for which the NoC was required was changed from vacant land to agricultural land. The agricultural land was defined as Nehri (canal irrigated), Chahi (irrigated from well), Barani (dependent on rainfall) or any other term in revenue records.“The 2017 amendment passed by the assembly ensured that the real estate developers were able to circumvent the requirement of NoC by converting agricultural land into uncultivable (gair mumkin) in revenue records. Also, the reduction of size of land from less than a hectare to two kanals worked to the advantage of realtors,” said a revenue official. PROPOSED CHANGESOfficials said that as per the proposed amendment in section 7-A of the Act, the definition of notified urban area land and size of the holding for which the NoC was required is being modified. The land holding for which NoC is required is proposed to be less than one acre instead of less than two kanals and the notified urban area land definition will be changed from agricultural to vacant again.MOST VIOLATIONS PERTAINED TO SECTION 7-AOfficials said the registration of properties without NoCs in notified urban area land under section 7-A of the Act has led to mushrooming of unauthorised settlements.“It came to the notice of the Gurugram divisional commissioner that a number of naib tehsildars were executing sale deeds indiscriminately without the NoC,” said an official. The allegations though have been denied by the revenue officials saying that if the structures were built on urban area land notified under section 7-A, the TCPD does not issue NoCs and they have no option but to execute the sale deeds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-s-ml-khattar-govt-to-undo-2017-amendment-in-urban-areas-law/story-1peb8McvksRSy61ORcaohI.html
30-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt cuts taxes, diesel price slashed by over Rs 8||The Delhi government has decided to reduce the Value Added Tax (VAT) on diesel which will substantially cut the prices of diesel in the national capital.“Delhi Cabinet has decided to reduce VAT on diesel from 30% to 16.75%. This will reduce price of diesel in Delhi from Rs 82 to Rs 73.64 i.e. by Rs 8.36 per litre,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Thursday.“This is one of the several measures taken by our government to revive Delhi’s economy. Earlier this week, we had launched a portal to connect job seekers with potential employers,” Kejriwal added.The chief minister further said that he will connect with several industry groups and experts over video conferencing “to discuss more ways to revive Delhi’s economy”.After a series of hike in prices, diesel was retailing at its the highest ever rate in the national capital. In fact, diesel has been selling at a higher price that petrol. This happened because the Delhi government raised VAT on diesel sharply.Rates vary from state to state depending on the incidence of local sales tax or VAT.Diesel rates have continued to be revised sporadically in July. The cumulative increase in diesel price since June 7 now totals Rs 12.55 per litre.Prior to June 7, oil companies had for 82 days not revised petrol and diesel prices as they adjusted a record increase in excise duty by the government against the fall in rates warranted due to international oil prices slumping to a two-year low.Before the start of a daily price surge, petrol was being sold at Rs 71.26 per litre in Delhi and diesel at Rs 69.39 a litre on June 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-reduce-diesel-rate-by-rs-8-36-per-litre-will-cost-rs-73-64-says-cm-arvind-kejriwal/story-2ShFv2XKxle82LnX6kraMI.html

30-07-2020||Jaipur||Plasma donation has given life to people: Rajasthan health minister||Health minister Raghu Sharma said on Wednesday that plasma therapy has proved effective in defeating coronavirus (Covid-19) in the state. “There is a need for plasma to treat serious patients of coronavirus disease,” said the minister, appealing corona survivors to donate plasma. He said plasma donation is the great act of kindness during the Covid-19 pandemic. Sharma said that treating serious corona patients with plasma therapy was started at Sawai Man Singh Hospital in Jaipur and it has been 100% successful. “Permission has been sought from ICMR (Indian Council for Medical Research) to start treatment with plasma therapy at other medical colleges,” he said. “At present, patients are being treated with plasma therapy and given new life at Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota and Udaipur,” the minister said. Sharma said that soon Bikaner and Ajmer will get permission to start treatment with plasma therapy. He said micro-level planning is being done by the government to start plasma therapy at hospitals in each district headquarters. He said all this would become effective when more and more survivors donate plasma. He said that the government, understanding the importance of plasma therapy, has set up Plasma Bank at SMS Hospital. He said that there will be no weakness or any problem after donating plasma and with this, lives of many people could be saved. According to the medical experts, any person aged between 18 and 60, who was tested corona positive through RT-PCR test having symptoms of fever and cough and has turned negative after treatment of 14 days, can donate plasma. The health minister said that at present the biggest problem is corona infected people not having any symptoms. The top priority is to identify asymptomatic people and treat them. He said that the government would buy 12,000 pulse oximeters to identify such people. He said that if asymptomatic people are identified on time, spread of corona infection could be controlled to a great extent. Sharma said that although compared to the country, the spread of coronavirus infection in Rajasthan is less, but it could be stopped by remaining alert and cautious. He said that all the district collectors have been directed to impose local lockdown as per the requirement, but it is not the complete solution. He said that the increasingly vicious circle of the virus could be broken if the general public follow the protocol that is not to go out without any important work; wear a mask while going out; avoid going to crowded places and frequently wash hands with soap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/plasma-donation-has-given-life-to-people-rajasthan-health-minister/story-I9ZA6nhHd9ni4GOHFqmJeL.html
30-07-2020||Delhi||Cinema halls aim to reopen with a shot of immunity||Excited to sip some fizzy beverage and chomp fast food as soon as cinema halls reopen? Hold on to your excitement for the menus at cinema halls won’t be the same as before. You’ll have to ditch the soft drink and popcorn and instead opt for healthy foods when you get back to the theatres now! Thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, managements of cinemas, across the country, reveal that there will be an inclusion of immunity boosting foods at most theatres, ranging from the fancy Turmeric Latte to the traditional kada and rasam. “Much like ticket booking and check-ins, our guests are also going to have a contactless experience for food ordering and payments. As far as the menu is concerned, we have taken a deliberate decision of operating with a shortened menu, and across the country we have also introduced a handpicked array of immunity boosters including healthy green teas such as Tulsi and Ginger Lemon Tea, Hot Turmeric Pepper Latte, and lots of soups and juices. We will also serve Pepper Rasam and nutritious energy bars, and aim to make our menu tastier yet healthier,” says Dinesh Hariharan from INOX Leisure Ltd, adding, “Even at the live kitchens of our premium properties, the menu has been re-engineered with an introduction of exotic options such as fresh fruit juices, specially-curated beverages, soups and sandwiches, which would have the added ingredients to build immunity.” Some have gone a step ahead, the natural way. “We understand that patrons will be looking at health-conscious options when they visit the cinemas, especially during this period. So we have introduced immunity boosting products such as cold pressed juices as well as coconut water on our menu,” says Devang Sampat, from Cinepolis India. But healthy doesn’t mean you won’t be spoilt for choice. Some multiplexes have decided to roll an extensive menu, and Kunal Sawhney, from Carnival Cinemas, says, “We have included kada, Turmeric Latte, Tulsi Tea, and many other varieties of immunity-boosting teas in the drinks menu. Spinach, broccoli, fresh citrus fruit platter, yogurt, and nuts are also being included in the food menu. In the combos that will be on offer, we will add at least one healthy food item from these dishes.” Interestingly, film buffs, who are looking forward to finally return to cinema halls for the big-screen experience, say that this is the need of the hour. “It would be a very different feeling, for sure, to get back to the theatres after more than four months, and the scare of the virus surely demands cinema hall menus include such healthy options than just serving junk food that plays havoc with our system,” says Mohit Saraf from Faridabad. And while the movie he’ll watch is yet to be decided, Saraf has his beverage choices lined up. “From the immunity boosting menu, I would love to taste the Turmeric Latte,” he says.

30-07-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Death of a landmark nihari||Bloggers have blogged about it. Instagrammers have instagrammed about it. Heritage-minded walking tours too would stop by for quick feasts and photo opportunities. And now it is gone.Hazi Shabrati Nihari Shop is history. The iconic eatery near Old Delhi’s Haveli Azam Khan was famous for its signature meat stew — it would be cooked overnight and served fresh in the early morning. It has been replaced by a grocery that opened last Friday. The shop stays within the family, but the business has changed. It all happened because of.... you guess it—coronavirus pandemic!“We remained shut during the long lockdown,” says Mohammad Shuaib Ilyas, the grandson of Hazi Shabrati, the late founder who set up the eatery in 1957. In his late 30s, the gentleman says that he realized the following truth during the traumatic lockdown: “The only shops that thrive in situations of emergency are the ones dealing with any of these four things: medicines, vegetables, dairy products and grocery.”The eatery couldn’t survive the new conditions, Mr Ilyas says. “All our cooks left for their villages in UP and Bihar as soon as the roads reopened. There was no way we could have restarted the nihari cooking.”Replace the eatery by a grocery was the wisest thing to do, he feels, while handing over a cake of Lifebuy soap to a masked customer.This afternoon, the grocery is still looking new, as crisp as newly starched clothes that will take some time to adapt to the wearer’s figure. The floor is neatly arranged with rows of sacks containing different varieties of rice. The walls are lined with metal racks, the kind public libraries use for stacking books. The shelves are packed with jams and ketchups, soaps and detergents, lentils and spice boxes.Truly, the world here has changed so swiftly. Just a few months back this was a busy kitchen with a huge brass cauldron, or degh, filled with piping hot nihari. The degh would be half-buried into an earthen stove that was as old as the shop. A lungi-wearing cook perched on the counter would patiently ladle the nihari out of the cauldron to pour it into takeaway plastic packets for customers. It is said that in the old days, a nihari degh would never be made to leave the fire, and that the stew would be cooked slowly, continuously, with fresh stock being added daily. No such romance existed in Hazi Shabrati Nihari shop, at least during its final years. The degh would be washed twice daily, just before cooking nihari afresh, and a typical degh would be replaced by a new one in a month. But until the pandemic hit our city, while the shop would routinely roll down its shutters every evening and the cooks would duly go to bed, the nihari would keep simmering in the degh, on a low fire. That all-night slow-cook tradition was rigorously followed. And, every morning by 8, the locals would gather around to make their claim upon the dish. They still come, but now they ask for Amul buttter and Kissan jam — factory-made items available in all the ordinary places.Founder Hazi Shabrati died 23 years before his shop underwent such a drastic change. His wife, Sakina Begum, died late last year. Both lie buried in Dilli Gate graveyard. Grandson Mr Ilyas now poses with folded arms against the shop’s backdoor painted in Urdu saying Hazi Shabrati Nihari Shop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/death-of-a-landmark-nihari/story-PInhdPCNbQe4A1GCnzRAJL.html
30-07-2020||Delhi||Unlock 3.0: Delhiites elated to hire battery bikes from doorstep||Remember the blue coloured battery-operated bikes that could be easily spotted around the city, parked at various Delhi Metro stations, bus stops and other such public areas? Now think how convenient would it be if they could come right to your doorstep, allowing you to happily ride to the neighbourhood market for essentials. These Yulu bikes are now available for hire at your doorstep, on demand. And the residents are rejoicing!Come unlock 3.0 and Delhiites will be able to rise on these battery-operated bikes starting from their homes, to move around the city. “Wearing a mask and gloves and riding a bicycle that can be ordered at your doorstep is far better than taking public transport for the time being. In public transport, there’s scare of fellow passengers not maintaining distance and violating the social distancing norms. But while cycling, the ball is in your court,” says Charanpreet Singh, a resident of Defence Colony, who was an avid user of these bikes before the pandemic struck.The concern of rising diesel and petroleum prices, as witnessed all through unlock 2.0, is another reason for city dwellers to welcome this mode of transport. “The petrol prices have risen rapidly in the past few months. For smaller distances, for the time being, bikes on demand will be a huge relief for people who are already undergoing economic stress,” says Akshay Saxena, a resident of Safdarjung Enclave.Biking around the city and revisiting familiar places without the fear of using public transport is another factor that’s making Delhiites happy. “I’m glad we can rent bikes yet again, and can also ride in pairs while maintaining social distancing to explore Delhi during the pandemic. The city looks deserted, but also seems serene at the same time,” says Ashish Thakur, a resident of Vasant Kunj, looking forward to join his close friend on a biking spree around the city.The clear blue skies, as a result of the pandemic and consequent lockdown, have already made cycling an interesting activity for many. Pictures of people cycling around India Gate have been flooding social media. So battery operated rented bicycles are bound to be a hit. Radhika Bajpayee, a resident of DLF Phase 2, Gurugram, says, “Shifting to cycling as a mode of transportation would do wonders for our environment, even more than carpool! I’m looking forward to hiring these bikes, whenever I visit the Capital next, and contribute to a better, greener environment!” Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/unlock-3-0-delhiites-elated-to-hire-battery-bikes-from-doorstep/story-tJFBFA6odwrgyNDTUTSU9K.html

An FIR was registered in the NM Joshi Marg police station against the accused,” said police inspector Nitin Patil of unit 3. The police team also raided Momin’s godown and found PPE kit. As per inquiry, these low-quality N-95 and V-410-V masks are being manufactured in Delhi and then supplied to Mumbai. Momin has been selling these masks for three months claiming these were originals. He had bought the masks in bulk and stored them in his godown. He has been supplying face masks to medical stores and others without any license, said deputy commissioner of police Akbar Pathan of crime branch. Momin was produced in the court and remanded in police custody till August 3. After the lockdown was declared the Mumbai crime branch seized around 32.58 lakh masks worth ₹17.30 crore from different parts of the city in March and April month. The government has declared face masks and hand sanitisers as essential commodities to ensure that there is no scarcity of these two items and they are priced correctly. Under the EC Act, the government has declared that investigating agencies can carry out operations against those involved in the black marketing of masks and hand sanitisers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/trader-arrested-with-fake-n95-masks-worth-21-39-lakh/story-bYQVkGQrYb4cW6hXDSJOSL.html

The state government has reportedly received specific intelligence input that there could be “law-and-order issues” if Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends the ceremony in the Uttar Pradesh city. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, home minister Anil Deshmukh and senior officials from the home department were also present at the meeting. “Tension is likely to emerge on August 5, which is also the first anniversary of the decision of revocation of the special status to Jammu and Kashmir. The Central government is likely to issue high alert on the day across the country. The tension could intensify if PM Modi personally attends the function [at Ayodhya]. In such a situation, security forces in the state are to be deployed at full strength as discussed in the meeting,” said a state government official, requesting anonymity. The law-and-order situation during upcoming festivals, Bakri Eid and Ganeshotsav, too, was discussed in the meeting. No leaders from three ruling parties of Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi are expected to attend the bhoomipujan ceremony. While Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar has already said he will not be going, Thackeray has said an e-bhoomipujan should be conducted to avoid crowding at the temple site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cm-uddhav-thackeray-holds-meeting-on-security-ahead-of-ram-mandir-bhoomipujan/story-VNyWXgp1wFG7MROrw4ecxH.html

Over the past four days, around 726 police personnel from across the state have tested positive with five fatalities, taking the total death toll across state police force to 98.In a bid to cover maximum police personnel and early detection of infection in the force, the top brass of the city police department decided to test its personnel through rapid antigen testing. In the first phase of antigen testing, the authority has decided to send only those policemen for antigen testing who are from the 44-55 age group. Naval Bajaj, joint commissioner of police (administration), confirmed that 308 officers and 3,171 constabulary personnel have undergone the testing and 77 personnel have tested positive.Of the infected personnel, those with symptoms and comorbidities would not be allowed home quarantine and would have to undergo treatment at Covid hospitals or in the four dedicated police Covid care centres.So far, police stations in the east region have reported the most Covid-19 cases with 27 positives, followed by west, central and south regions with 21, 17 and 12 cases, respectively.In west region, nine policemen from Khar police station including the head of the police station tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday.

30-07-2020||Mumbai||Restriction on artists above 65 likely to be reviewed on August 1, State informs HC||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday informed the Bombay high court (HC) that the restrictions imposed on cast and crew members above 65 years of age from attending film and television shootings was a temporary measure and may be reviewed when the current lockdown ends on July 31.Government lawyer Purnima Kantharia informed the bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Riyaz Chagla that the guideline was issued in the interest of aged artists, to safeguard them from Covid-19 as they pose a higher risk of contracting the infection.Kantharia said the guidelines issued by the state government for shooting of films and television serials, are expected to be reviewed on August 1, after the current lockdown is over. She added that changes might be made but was unable to detail what those changes will be.Kantharia was responding to a petition filed by 70-year-old Pramod Pandey, who has been earning his livelihood by performing small roles in films and television serials for the past 40 years. He challenged a clause contained in the guidelines issued by the state government on May 30, regarding shooting of film and television serials.Pandey contended that though aged, he is physically fit, but the government rule deprives him of his only source of livelihood, as it prohibited entry at film studios and outdoor shooting sites to cast and crew members above 65 years of age.He claimed that perusal of available data makes it clear that a majority of the persons affected by Covid-19 are below the age of 65. He added that has grave hardship and prejudice will be caused to him if he is prevented from participating in the shootings, as he will not be able to survive with dignity and self-respect.Amicus curiae, senior advocate Sharon Jagtiani termed the restriction as discriminatory, as it singled out senior artists and similar restrictions were not imposed on senior citizens anywhere else. He added that the guidelines were not bases on valid grounds.The Indian Motion Pictures Producer’s Association has filed a similar petition challenging the same clause. Orders on the two petitions are expected to be pronounced on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/restriction-on-artists-above-65-likely-to-be-reviewed-on-august-1-state-informs-hc/story-dB5FY9ZaktDbEhYtUrtepL.html
30-07-2020||Mumbai||BMC to begin second phase of sero-surveillance on August 10||The city crossed the 5-lakh mark for testing Covid-19 samples on Wednesday, recording the single-day highest of 11,643 tests conducted in 24 hours. The total number of tests conducted so far is 5.05 lakh. To expand the scope of its testing, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will begin the second phase of its sero surveillance survey from August 10. The survey will be carried out in R-North, M-West and F-North wards, to help the civic body ascertain the spread of Covid-19 in these areas. On Wednesday, Mumbai recorded 1,109 fresh cases and 60 new deaths, taking the city’s case tally to 111,991 and toll to 6,247. The number of discharged patients in Mumbai was 85,327 with a recovery rate of 76.11% and active cases stood at 20,123. The fatality rate was 5.57% and doubling rate is 72 days. One hot spot that has shown signs of drastic improvement – Dharavi – recorded only two new cases on Wednesday, bringing the area’s case count to 2,545 of which 2,212 have been discharged. Over the past five days, the number of tests conducted in Mumbai daily has gone up due to the use of rapid antigen kits. Of the daily testing tally, approximately 30-35% are conducted using rapid antigen kits, said BMC officials. By May 6, the city had conducted more than 1 lakh tests. The 2-lakh mark was crossed on June 1 and on June 24, the 3-lakh mark was crossed in the testing tally. On July 14, the city had carried out more than 4 lakh tests and on Wednesday, BMC said a total of 5.05 lakh tests have been conducted. BMC has also sought opinion from state government authorities on how to undertake a sero-surveillance survey on a population larger than the sample used in the first phase. On July 3, BMC in collaboration with Niti Aayog and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, started a sero-surveillance survey in three wards in the city to identify recovered individuals and estimate the spread of Covid-19. In a sero survey, a sample set of individuals undergo blood tests to detect the presence of immunoglobulin-G (IgG) antibodies, which are produced by the body’s immune system upon exposure to a virus. On Tuesday, BMC released findings from the sero survey conducted by the civic body as part of a national study to understand the spread of Covid-19. In Mumbai, the survey of 6,936 people from R-North, M-West and F-North wards found 57% from slums and 16% from other residential areas had the antibodies, suggesting they had been exposed to Covid-19 and recovered. The survey also revealed that 60% of those diagnosed with Covid-19 have been male and more women recovered after being exposed to the virus. The civic body plans to undertake a second phase of the study in the same wards, covering neighbourhoods like Dahisar, Borivli, Matunga, Dadar, Wadala and Chembur. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We will start the second phase in the same area from August 10. The areas will be the same to help us understand the community in those specific areas better. However, the samples will not necessarily be from the same individuals. But it will be from the same area, considering we have to gauge the antibodies in the surrounding community.”Kakani added, “Whether to go ahead and conduct sero survey on the larger population can only be ascertained once the results for the second phase are out. By mid-September, we anticipate that the results for the second phase will be out.”Officials said the civic body is exploring how a sero survey may be conducted on a larger population and whether the help of private laboratories would be needed in such a survey. A BMC official said, “We are also carrying out discussions with the state health department on the same. We also have to consider the reluctance by many to give samples. The problem with private laboratories will be consent. We should have consent of the individuals who come for their blood check-up on whether we can use their body to test antibodies or not. This process becomes difficult, and hence we will have to wait until the results for the second phase are out to better understand the modalities for the third phase.”After the first phase of the sero survey, BMC officials said the results indicate populations in slum areas have developed antibodies.

30-07-2020||Mumbai||BMC to follow-up on recovered Covid-19 patients on alternate days||With many recovered Covid-19 patients complaining of weakness and fatigue after being discharged from hospitals, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has instructed all ward officers to follow up on recovered patients.Ward officers will do regular check-ups of recovered patients and both private and civic-run hospitals have been instructed to maintain a list of Covid-19 patients who report serious health complications after recovery. A study, published in the July 27 edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), said that in Italy, 87.4% of patients who had recovered from Covid-19 complained of symptoms, particularly fatigue and dyspnea (shortness of breath), even after two months.Doctors across Mumbai say they have noticed a similar trend, with recovered patients returning with complications. For instance, Ramdas Chauhan, a 65-year-old resident of Bhendi Bazar was diagnosed with Covid-19 on June 28 and admitted to Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital, also known as Sion hospital, the next day. When his oxygen saturation declined to 81%, Chauhan was shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and put on a ventilator. He remained in ICU for 14 days. On July 16, he tested negative and was discharged. Thirteen days later, he says he still has body ache and breathlessness. “At present, more than 75 recovered Covid-19 patients are seeing me with similar complaints. Around 12 have developed acute pneumonia which has scarred the lungs. Such patients can develop impaired lungs that can lead to further health complications,” said Dr Ansari Rehman, a general physician (GP) who is treating Chauhan. Cases like Chauhan’s have prompted BMC to follow up with discharged patients. “All ward officers have a list of patients according to their age and the seriousness of the infection. They have been instructed to follow up with patients who were cured and hospitalise them if they develop health complications,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. The civic body has also instructed both public and private hospitals to keep a list of recovered patients who have returned due to severe health complications. “So far, we haven’t received any such serious patients in civic-run hospitals, but we are also checking with private hospitals,” Kakani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-to-follow-up-on-recovered-covid-19-patients-on-alternate-days/story-7im1JQTDWoBzCitnsJav6L.html

According to the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC), the infrastructure for the lab is ready and they are waiting to apply for approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to begin operations.The lab is being set up at the civic hospital at Nerul and officials claim it could be operational by Saturday.NMMC has so far been sending test samples to labs in Mumbai and other cities which has led to delays in getting the reports. There have been instances of patients dying before the test results came through. For the past four months, residents and local representatives have been demanding a lab in the city to ensure results are given within 24 hours.Municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar, who took over earlier this month, had assured immediate action in the matter.“The process for starting the lab is underway. The equipment has been supplied and training is underway. Once completed, we will apply for permission from ICMR, which we hope to get by Saturday. As per the present capacity, we should be able to start with 500 tests a day. Once the lab starts functioning for 24 hours, 1,000 tests a day will be possible,” said Bangar.BN Kumar, a social activist from Navi Mumbai, said, “For over four months, a well-planned city like Navi Mumbai did not have a lab of its own, which was shocking. We were behind the administration for a long time for such a lab. It is good that the city will finally have its own lab.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/navi-mumbai-to-start-its-first-covid-testing-lab-soon/story-jwxQ9f9Y6Yaxnm1eWeu8lI.html

The father-son duo lived in a chawl at Goregaon (East) before the lockdown restrictions forced the two to leave the city. “His father would leave for work early in the morning. Pal would then do the household chores, cook for the both of them and then come to school. He has always been bright,” said Yadav, adding that Pal will pursue science stream. Mullaji said that Pal’s score was based on his merit alone as he had no means of extra classes or tuitions.

But we both wanted to clear SSC exams,” said Kamble, adding that his employer also encouraged him to focus on exams. The couple now plans to study further. “While my wife wants to pursue Class 12 boards, I may opt for a diploma course and at the same time also focus on our five-year old son’s education,” said Kamble.

Along with academics, Priyanka also participated in extracurricular activities and scored 15 extra marks in dance. “I did not follow any strict time table, but ensured that I studied regularly. I never studied for long hours in a day. I would also keep myself occupied with Kathak and attend drama sessions. This helped me to remain stress-free and focus on my studies continuously,” she said. Priyanka always scored above 90% in her academics. She said her family’s support helped her strike a balance between her studies and extracurricular activities.

He joined the signal school set up by the civic body and non-governmental organisation Samarth Bharat Vyaspeeth.“Earlier, I used to spend my time on the signal along with my younger brother, while our parents sold flowers. But some teachers at the signal school saw us and asked us to join the classes. The learning sessions are fun and the teachers are very patient,” said Dashrath, whose favourite subjects are languages, though he is yet to decide the stream he wants to opt for. The school is set up at a container at the Teen Hath Naka junction to educate children who sell items at Signals. “When Dashrath joined the school, he was not very confident and lacked detailed understanding of what he had learned until Class 8. We paid special attention on him and he managed to grasp the curriculum well,” said Aarti Parab, one of the teachers at the signal school.

30-07-2020||Mumbai||State approaches MERC to bring down power bills||Citizens may get relief from their inflated electricity bills as the state government plans to approach the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) with a proposal to bring down the amount household consumers are charged. Once approved by MERC, the proposal will be placed before the state cabinet next week. “We have decided to provide relief to the people from high power bills and will be a filing an appeal with the MERC tomorrow [Thursday]. As a regulatory body, all decisions pertaining to power charges need to be taken by MERC. Its decision is binding even on private power distribution companies,” state energy minister Nitin Raut said on Wednesday.According to energy ministry officials, who did not wish to be named, there could be two options — rebate up to a certain percentage in the existing power bill or reducing charges in the current slabs — that could be implemented to bring down consumers’ power bills from next month.Raut, however, said “the route to reduce the bill” will have to be decided by MERC. “The state will go by whatever is approved by the regulatory body,” he said.The decision to appeal to MERC was taken on Wednesday in a meeting of group of minister chaired by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. MERC Chairman Anand Kulkarni, who is currently abroad, also attended the meet through video conference. The state cabinet, too, was informed about the move. Consumers across the state have been complaining about inflated power bills for the past few months, but power distribution companies have maintained that there was been no error on their part and that there has been an increase in power usage owing to summer and Covid-19-induced lockdown, with most people at home and the meter-reading suspended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-approaches-merc-to-bring-down-power-bills/story-dj3sXQS5KUi2jiK0Z0mCdO.html
30-07-2020||City||SSC results: Most students may join nearby colleges to avoid travel, risks||In light of the Covid-19 outbreak, some parents from the city are likely to send their children to nearby colleges to avoid travel and associated risks, said experts. Principals said this trend might be seen clearly in commerce and science streams, with several junior colleges spread across the eastern and western suburbs. Vidyadhar Joshi, vice-principal, VG Vaze College, Mulund, said top scorers from the science stream are more likely to opt for a nearby college. “Anyway, one can see a large number of top scorers opting for small junior colleges because they want to focus more on preparing for the entrance examinations. This year, more students are likely to do the same,” said Joshi. For students who live in the suburbs, travelling to colleges in central and south Mumbai, with the risks involved with local train travel, might be a big no-no.“My daughter wants to take commerce and pursue CA. She is a bright student and was planning to try for colleges in south Mumbai. But we don’t know how long the Covid-19 scare would last and hence don’t want to take our chances. We are convinced that her safety is more important than anything else and she agrees. We will look for a good nearby college for her,” said Tushar Mehta, a parent from Goregaon. Anushree Lokur, principal, Ramnarain Ruia college in Matunga, said the situation might be different for the arts stream. “For arts, students usually prefer good colleges as students come to these colleges to get an overall experience of the space. For science though, this might be the trend,” she added. The principal of a reputable college from the eastern suburbs said the trend might be for good.“It is time parents realised that any college which has relatively good infrastructure and teaching is a good college. There is a need to rethink the idea of what constitutes a top college. If parents start preferring nearby colleges, they will also get better with time and with meritorious students going there, their scores would be better too,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ssc-results-most-students-may-join-nearby-colleges-to-avoid-travel-risks/story-c52UrX34rQWrqtPsSxndxH.html

The four – Avinash Waghe, Dipali Katkari, Ravi Mali and Pooja Waghe – scored 52%, 50%, 49% and 51%, respectively, and wish to pursue commerce. “I had never imagined that I would pass the Class 10 exams. This is surreal. With the amount of hardships we underwent, the score is still good for me,” said Avinash. His sister, Komal, had dropped out in 2017, while in Class 9, after their mother died of cancer. His father does odd jobs and travels to Bhiwandi and Padgha everyday to make ends meet. Dipali said, “I want to continue my higher education and am hoping to enrol into a college in Padgha now.” Her father, Sakharam, a brick kiln worker who earns ₹1,000 a week, said he could not believe that someone from his family has passed Class 10. “I cross-checked with her twice, she told me that she had actually passed. I am happy for her and am willing to put any amount of hard work required to see her succeed,” he said. Aniket Salvi, a Vile Parle-based political science teacher, whose organisation Rajani Foundation India has been helping the students since 2015, said it was a big achievement for everyone. “We are happy that these students could become successful and persisted till the end,” he added. “The nearest college is also in Padgha so paying ₹30 for a one-way ride is also not easy. We will try to help them in every way possible,” said Salvi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-become-first-from-2-tribal-villages-near-mumbai-to-pass-class-10-exams/story-We6uiCefgaQ050iNgywdgL.html
30-07-2020||City||SSC paper correction: A challenge during lockdown||When the state entered its first lockdown on March 23 owing to rising Covid-19 cases, the Mumbai divisional board, which includes Thane, Raigad and Palghar, had lakhs of SSC answersheets in schools and custodies (where papers from a few centres are collected) of the board. The last paper for SSC was on March 21 (history). When the lockdown was announced, most answersheets for the paper were still lying across 68 custodies in the division, yet to be sent to the schools for assessment. In the days to come, officials at the divisional board, with the help of its support staff and schools, ensured evaluation was done, even with the restrictions. A total of 50 lakh answersheets were corrected and moderated in Mumbai division this year. Keeping in mind the challenges, the divisional board made several changes to make the process easy. First, it took feedback from all teachers on Google forms to understand how much work was pending. Along with this, it asked custodies to transport history answersheets to respective schools and gave them the travel allowance required for the purpose. Answersheets of other subjects were lying either in schools or with the teachers in their homes. “A teacher from our school had gone to Talasari when the lockdown was announced. He came all the way to the school and collected his papers without any delay,” said Sudam Kumbhar, former principal of Shailendra High School in Dahisar. “On May 8, we authorised teachers to travel to collect papers from their schools and submit them to the moderators, depending on what stage they were at. This stage, however, was very challenging,” said Sandeep Sangave, secretary, Mumbai divisional board. While a few teachers had tested positive for Covid-19, some others lived in places where travelling was not an option. “We waited for a few days and then sent our staff to get papers from them. Sometimes, our staff had to travel to the interiors to collect papers from a single teacher. In Raigad, for instance, we did that for a teacher who could not come to her school,” he said. At the board’s divisional office in Vashi, staff was being picked up and dropped and worked at 5% capacity. The board also allowed provisional online verification of documents to grant bonus marks for sports and other categories. By the end of June, the office had received all answersheets. “We trusted our staff and schools and they delivered,” said Sangave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ssc-paper-correction-a-challenge-during-lockdown/story-wnEmlrvhSU4V72Aevdyd2H.html
30-07-2020||Mumbai||With more students scoring above 90%, FYJC admissions set to get tougher for aspirants||Though the admissions to first-year junior colleges (FYJCs) get tougher year-after-year, this year, principals said, the aspirants are likely to face a stiffer competition to get into a college of their choice, as many more students across all the boards have scored in the 90-95% range. “The competition keeps getting tougher every year, and it won’t be any different this year. The cut-offs may go higher than last year and it is likely that more students will be vying for the same seat, especially in top colleges,” said Marie Fernandes, principal of St Andrew’s College, Bandra. Principals feel aspirants opting for quota admissions too, will feel the heat. “Generally, the rise in overall marks directly affects the cut-offs for general as well as minority quota admissions, and it will be a similar situation this year too. We will know the status once admissions to minority and management quota seats begin,” said Parag Ajgaonkar, principal, NM College, Vile Parle. While most Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) and Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) schools in the city earlier highlighted that the number of students who scored 95% and above was much higher as compared to 2019, the Maharashtra state board too, saw a surge in the high-scorers. As per the information shared by the board on Wednesday, 83,262 SSC students from SSC board managed to score 90% and above this year, of which 14,756 are from Mumbai alone. In 2019, the Mumbai divisional board received around 1.85 lakh applications from students for the general admission round. While nearly 1.68 lakh were from the state board, the second highest number of applicants (7,881) belonged to the ICSE board. With ICSE students scoring big every year, experts said that the state education department needs to come up with a solution for state board students. In 2019, the state board scores were abysmal and this had a big impact on the overall admissions. The cut-offs at HR College as well as KC College witnessed a surge from 92% and 88.6% respectively to 92.4% and 90.2% in the commerce stream. In the arts stream, St Xavier’s College closed its first list at 94%, a dip of 0.20% from 2018, while Ramnarain Ruia College and DG Ruparel College, with cut-offs at 92.6% and 86.2% respectively, saw a marginal increase. There was a clear dip in the cut-off marks for the science stream across prominent colleges, with some seeing a dip of nearly 6%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/with-more-students-scoring-above-90-fyjc-admissions-set-to-get-tougher-for-aspirants/story-T2M29AnQF6X8XLg6p75RiJ.html
30-07-2020||Mumbai||HC restrains Godfrey Philips from infringing ITC’s Flake pack design||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday restrained cigarette manufacturer Godfrey Philips (India) Limited from infringing the copyright of its rival ITC Limited’s ‘Flake’ packs that are popular in West Bengal and north-east India. The court also restricted Godfrey Philips from manufacturing or selling cigarette packs featuring any colourable imitations of the artworks appearing on Flake packs.Justice BP Colabawalla issued the pro-tem order after noticing that Godfrey Philips had substantially copied the patterns and colour scheme appearing on the Flake Refined Taste cigarette pack of ITC for its own ‘Select’ pack being sold in the same market – West Bengal and north-east India.ITC moved HC after Godfrey Phillips adopted a new design on its Select pack in December 2019. It alleged that the rival had infringed its trademark and sought an injunction contending that Godfrey Philips had tried to cash in on the popularity of the Flake packs in the north-east market.In support of its contention that the trademark had a considerable reputation in the market, ITC pointed out that since 1994, gross sales of cigarettes sold under the Flake mark was ₹50,475 crore. In 2018-19 this figure rose to ₹6,603.64 crore, including ₹3,675 crore from sales of only the Flake Refined Taste pack.Justice Colabawalla accepted the submissions made on behalf of ITC Limited, that the mark adopted by Godfrey Philips on its Select pack was a substantial copy of the Flake mark. He noted that the “strikingly similar artistic label is itself indicative of the defendant’s [Godfrey Philips] ill intent”.“Looking at the popularity of the Flake Refined Taste pack of the plaintiff in the market [north-east India and West Bengal], where the defendant has also launched the impugned pack, prima facie it appears that the defendant wants to boost its sales by coming as close as possible to the Flake Refined Taste pack of the plaintiff,” the judge added.HC noted that Godfrey Philips’s Select pack used boomerang-shaped devices comprising of concentric arcs in gold and red colours, which appeared to be a substantial replication of the boomerang appearing on ITC’s Flake Refined Taste pack.“It has the same white, gold and red colour scheme as that of the plaintiff’s Flake Refined Taste pack,” said the judge. “It cannot be a matter of coincidence that the stylised ‘S’ adopted [by Godfrey Philips] in the present case, is a substantial copy of the boomerang appearing on the plaintiff’s [ITC’s] pack.”Further, the judge said that even the colour combination and the brand name is written in red, bold font against a white background, which follows the pattern on the Flake Refined Taste pack. He noted that the adoption of the five-spiked crest device by Godfrey Philips, prima facie, appeared to be a substantial copy of the five-spiked crest device used by ITC on its cigarette packs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-restrains-godfrey-philips-from-infringing-itc-s-flake-pack-design/story-nscxyZ2O1Y3GFstqC3yoXP.html

It doesn’t seem like there was a motive behind the murder. The accused is a short-tempered person,” said an officer from Khandeshwar police station. The accused, Mehboob Alam, used to sell coconut water before the lockdown. On Sunday afternoon, Alam called the victim, Saddam Shaikh, 31, and abused him over the phone and threatened him. Shaikh then informed his two friends about the conversation and the three men went to Alam’s stall near Cidco garden in sector 11 around 6.00pm on Sunday. He told his friends that he will confront Alam about the conversation. As the argument between the duo escalated, Alam attacked Shaikh with a knife on his chest and repeatedly stabbed him in the stomach, the police said. The accused also attacked Shaikh’s friends and then managed to flee the spot. Shaikh’s friends then rushed him to MGM Hospital in Kamothe, where he succumbed to his injuries. After the incident, Alam switched off his phone and took a train from Lokmanya Tilak Terminus and left for Patna to his relative’s house. The police was able to trace his location to Arrah station when he called his relative using a co-passenger’s phone. On Monday, a police team from Khandeshwar, along with the railway protection force, took Alam into custody. He is booked for murder and a local court remanded him in police custody till August 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/22-year-old-held-from-bihar-for-navi-mumbai-fruit-vendor-s-murder/story-nAIcLDOSM7PwVqSBxZz6uO.html

30-07-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra board’s best Class 10 pass percentage since 2004||The return of oral exams and the state board’s decision to grant average marks for geography paper led to the massive jump in the overall pass percentage (93.31%) in the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) exams, highest since 2004, according to experts. The results were declared on Wednesday. In 2019, the state education department had scrapped oral exams and internal assessments for languages and social sciences, a move that had led to a massive dip in the pass percentage (75.53%) and the number of top scorers that year. After facing flak, the department reintroduced the 20-mark internal assessments this year. The number of students scoring 90% and above in the state saw a jump of 191% compared to 2019 – from 28,516 in 2019 to 83,262 this year. In Mumbai division, the number went up by 174% from 5,399 in 2019 to 14,756 this year. At Dadar’s Balmohan Vidyamandir, more than 70% of the class scored 90% and above. “There isn’t one particular subject where students have not done well and that has been the main reason for everyone scoring so well. Students were very anxious for the past few weeks, especially after ICSE results were announced. The state board managed to elevate the mood of our students as well,” said Rupa Roy, principal. This year, students were given average scores for geography exam which could not be conducted due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Of the total 600 marks, 480 marks are for written exams and 120 for internal assessments. With the cancellation of the 40 marks written paper of Geography, the written total was 440 this year. “This led to a higher success rate in social sciences, as students who managed to pass in history also cleared the geography paper,” said Jagdish Indalkar, principal, KVK school Ghatkopar. Rajesh Pandya, teacher at Fatimadevi English School in Malad, which recorded 100% result, said, “It is a good thing that the internal assessments were reintroduced. It helped students to score better and get marks on a par with the other boards,” he added. BMC schools score 93.25% Schools under the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) recorded a success rate of 93.25% in SSC results this year. Over 13,000 students had appeared for the SSC exams from 218 schools under BMC this year. Of these, 76 schools recorded a 100% result.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/the-great-comeback-maharashtra-board-s-best-class-10-pass-percentage-since-2004/story-ERMgwrf6pOBXVY3Pg4vRYI.html

30-07-2020||City||Trucks seized with goats worth ₹85 lakh||Palghar Police have seized goats worth around ₹85 lakh at Talasari in Palghar. The state government has banned sale of goats in open markets and has allowed only online sale in view of Bakri Eid scheduled this week. Many of the goats died as the transporters did not provide them with food and water during the journey. The carcasses of the animals were then dumped on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad highway.Various types of vehicles like trucks, tempos, pickup vans, cars loaded with the goats have been chased and stopped from entering Mumbai at Talasari, Vasai, Manor, Virar, Kasa and Waliv areas by the respective police stations.Palghar Police have also detained men accompanying the goats which were brought from Gujarat and Rajasthan to be sold in open markets in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and nearby areas, said sub-inspector Sachin Navadkar, public relations officer, Palghar Police. “We have registered cases under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and Motor Vehicles Act. Trucks loaded with goats have also been arriving from Uttar Pradesh, besides Rajasthan and Gujarat and many vehicles have been stopped on the Maharashtra-Gujarat border at Talasari in Palghar district, while smaller vehicles like cars and pick-up vans managed to sneak into the state but were caught at Manor, Virar and Vasai,” said Navadkar.Most of the trucks entered the state at Talasari in the early hours of Monday and the animals were dumped in the vehicles without following rules of transportation, said Navadkar. Talasari police caught two men in a Nissan Evalia who had dumped four goats with their necks and limbs tied on the rear seat.“Manor police intercepted a tempo carrying 52 goats worth ₹10 lakh while we caught a pick-up van illegally transporting goats worth ₹51 lakh,” said Navadkar adding that none of the trucks or vehicles had the permission or documents to permit the transportation of the goats.Police confirmed that the price of goats seized between Monday and Tuesday is more than ₹85 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/trucks-seized-with-goats-worth-85-lakh/story-nApX5t24rm8J3ZkMXamRdM.html

The state also graded the criterion based on the areas where the investment will be made. The government said maximum benefits will be given to units investing in districts such as Gadchiroli, Nandurbar, Osmanabad and Hingoli. For instance, if an investor is making an investment of between ₹50 crore and ₹100 crore in these districts, then the project can be considered for all the benefits given to a large project under the industrial promotion subsidy scheme. “If a project sees an investment of over ₹100 crore or creates 200 jobs, it will be considered as a mega project,” said an official from the industries department. To qualify as large project in Marathwada and Vidarbha regions and in districts such as Dhule, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg, the investment should be in a range of ₹50 to ₹200 crore. If the investment is more over ₹200 crore or creates 300 jobs, it will be considered as a mega project in the above areas and also get all the determined benefits, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-govt-to-provide-more-benefits-to-agro-based-food-processing-units/story-E5YA0YH5NEbfob0uwD7RuI.html

30-07-2020||Mumbai||HC asks government to file affidavit as reply to plea by Nirav Modi’s son||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday directed the Central government to file an affidavit in reply to a petition filed by Rohin Modi, son of fugitive diamond trader Nirav Modi who is a prime accused in the ₹13,500-crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud, challenging confiscation of properties purportedly belonging to a trust under his name.On June 8, the special court for trying offenders under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) ordered confiscation of movable and immovable properties worth about ₹1,396 crore belonging to Nirav Modi. The order was passed in accordance with section 12 of the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2019, on an application filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which is probing money laundering aspects of the massive fraud at state-run PNB.The special court has in December 2019 declared Nirav Modi a “fugitive economic offender” as contemplated under the 2019 Act.The properties ordered to be confiscated include bank accounts in India and England, residential and commercial properties in India, the United Arab Emirates and England, allegedly purchased by the fugitive diamond trader from proceeds of the crime.However, Rohin Modi has moved high court contending that the confiscated properties also include properties owned by Rohin Trust and challenged confiscation of trust properties primarily on the grounds of breach of principles of natural justice that the order was passed by the special court without making him party or giving him notice.The petition came up for hearing on Tuesday before division bench of justice RD Dhanuka and justice VG Bisht which directed the Centre to reply to the petition in one week and posted the petition for further hearing on August 7.On January 31, 2018, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered an offence under various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act and relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code against Modi and several others, including two PNB officials. According to the complaint lodged by PNB, between February and May 2017, Modi and his partnership firms namely, M/s Diamond R US, M/s Solar Exports and M/s Stellar Diamond got fraudulently issued 150 Letters of Undertaking (LOUs) from Brady House branch of PNB and duped the public sector bank to the tune of USD1,015.35 million (approximately ₹6,498.20 crore).A similar offence was registered against Nirav Modi’s maternal uncle Mehul Choksi for duping PNB of crores of rupees by using the same modus operandi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-asks-government-to-file-affidavit-as-reply-to-plea-by-nirav-modi-s-son/story-Nh8VXsfDXHgmzS9uOad2YO.html

30-07-2020||Mumbai||After Opposition, Sharad Pawar’s remarks, Uddhav Thackeray to visit Pune to review Covid-19 situation||Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray will kickstart the first leg of his state tour today with a one-day visit to Pune to review the Covid-19 situation. Thackeray will review the pandemic situation and the measures taken to contain the infection in Western Maharashtra comprising Pune, Kolhapur, Solapur, Satara, and Sangli districts. The development comes after criticism by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) despite the CM’s assurances that he was using technology to monitor the situation from Mumbai.Even Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday said that a chief minister is expected to visit other parts of the state, but that was not happening in Maharashtra. Pawar said that he is more visible than Thackeray as he keeps travelling to check on the situation.“Being head of the government, he [Thackeray] is expected to monitor the situation from one place, but that doesn’t mean he should do so permanently. In between, he is also expected to tour the state, by taking out some time from his schedule to meet people and take them in confidence, which [in this case] is yet to happen,” the veteran leader told a Marathi news channel.“The chief minister will cover all the six regions one by one. He is starting with Pune — headquarters of Western Maharashtra — and will review the Covid situation of the region on Thursday. It will be a one-day tour. Dates for visits to other regions are yet to be finalised,” said an official from the CM’s office.At present, Pune is the worst affected among the cities in Maharashtra and is contributing more cases compared to Mumbai.Thackeray has been reviewing the Covid-19 crisis at regular intervals by holding virtual meetings but had not visited any of the areas outside Mumbai. Considering his history of cardiac problems (angioplasty in 2016), Thackeray may have been opting on the side of caution by mostly operating from his home ‘Matoshree’ in Bandra and his official residence at ‘Varsha’ bungalow in Malabar Hill.Dismissing the criticism over not stepping out, Thackeray told his party mouthpiece Saamana recently that he is using technology to take stock of the situation in the state.“Technology has advanced to such an extent now. I am meeting officials and public representatives. I am covering the entire state and taking decisions. When it is important to visit physically, then you do go to that place. With video-conferencing, you can cover the entire state,” he said in the interview. State BJP chief Chandrakant Patil had taken a dig at the CM over the issue. “Even a school student can say that our Uddhavji is not going anywhere,” Patil had told a Marathi news channel. Pawar came to Thackeray’s defence, saying that the latter is working day and night to flatten the Covid-19 curve as a one-point agenda. Significantly, Pawar has been visiting various cities and districts along with his party colleague and health minister Rajesh Tope, to review preparations made by local authorities to contain the pandemic outbreak. On Saturday, he was in Aurangabad to take stock of the situation. He also launched a campaign ‘Mission Zero — Aurangabad’ that aims to bring the city’s death rate down to zero.On Friday, the 79-year old leader was in Nashik, and before that he visited Solapur district on July 20.Leader of Opposition in the legislative Assembly Devendra Fadnavis and his counterpart in the legislative Council Pravin Darekar also visited several places to get a first-hand account of the Covid-19 situation from the ground.Maharashtra has the highest number of Covid-19 cases and deaths in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-opposition-sharad-pawar-s-remarks-uddhav-thackeray-to-visit-pune-to-review-covid-19-situation/story-91ZUq6CjiS3s4WyvgU1BVJ.html
30-07-2020||Mumbai||State seeks to club all petitions in HC challenging appointment of administrator to gram panchayats||Expressing anxiety over the July 23 order of the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) which stayed the operation of a government resolution (GR) to appoint administrators to the 14,000 gram panchayats, the state requested the chief justice of the Bombay HC to club all petitions challenging the GR and an ordinance, filed at the three seats of the HC at Mumbai, Nagpur, and Aurangabad. The GR is based on an ordinance promulgated by the state on June 25, which empowered it to appoint administrators to the various gram panchayats as elections could not be held due to the Covid situation. The GR empowered zilla parishad chief executive officers (CEOs) to carry out the appointments.The chief justice said he would look into the request to club all the petitions but refused to restrain coordinate courts from hearing petitions or passing orders. On Tuesday, the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Sarang Kotwal, while hearing one of five petitions filed at the principal seat, was informed by advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni that 11 petitions were filed at the Aurangabad bench and four at the Nagpur bench, dealing with similar challenges. Kumbhakoni further informed the court that after the benches at Mumbai and Aurangabad refused to pass any interim orders, the petitioners moved the Nagpur bench and managed to get an interim stay on the operation of the GR.Kumbhakoni then submitted that though the state was not alleging that the petitioners were resorting to forum shopping, it would be better if all the petitions were clubbed together and heard at only one of the seats. He also requested the chief justice to restrain the coordinate benches from hearing the petitions and passing orders till the praecipe for clubbing all petitions was decided. After hearing the submissions and request, the chief justice stated that he could not dictate what cases could be heard at the other seats. He said that while he had the discretion in administrative matters, he had no say in the judicial side as he was only a judge like the other judges. He, however, assured Kumbhakoni that he would look into the request to club all the petitions, and posted the matter for hearing next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-seeks-to-club-all-petitions-in-hc-challenging-appointment-of-administrator-to-gram-panchayats/story-gdRbK4W6QoB32kiG1o7F7L.html
30-07-2020||Mumbai||Govt contractors to get 6-month work extension due to Covid lockdown||In a bid to offer some relief to government contractors whose work has been hit by Covid-19 lockdown, the state government on Wednesday announced measures including a six-month work extension for projects. Following the footsteps of the Central government, which offered its contractors an extension of three to six months to complete the projects, the state finance department issued a government order to grant a work extension deadline of six months to contractors who seek the same. The six-month period will stretch from March 15 to September 15, and contractors will not be penalised for the delay in completing their works for their period. This will also mean a delay in most government works and projects by six months.The finance department noted that the lockdown had adversely hit construction and infrastructure works by impacting supply chains, access to labour, manpower, etc.“The guidelines issued by the finance department are applicable to all government contractors as well as those hired by local authorities, civic corporations, and public companies. However, individual authorities have the right to implement the guidelines in toto or make changes as required. The underlining motive is to give relief to contractors in these unforeseen circumstances,” said a senior bureaucrat. The other measures include offering relief via payment of security deposits (a percentage of the total work contract) and performance deposit. The security deposit is paid partially at the time of tendering, and the rest is paid through running bills raised by the contractor in the course of the project. The contractors will now get additional time to pay the deposit. For instance, contractors who were expected to pay 1% of the security deposit through their running bills will now be allowed to pay this amount until as much as 75% of the work gets completed. In the case of performance guarantee, if a contractor has finished work that is 50% of the total project cost, then 50% of the cost of the work done will be paid back as deposit to the contractor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/govt-contractors-to-get-6-month-work-extension-due-to-covid-lockdown/story-HWlNTOPRELXAnCx14oKZiK.html

The state government on Wednesday decided to extend the lockdown till August 31 but has eased several restrictions.The state has further decided to allow outdoor non-team sporting facilities such as golf courses, outdoor firing ranges, outdoor gymnastics, tennis and badminton courts, and mallkhamba sites to function from August 5, with conditions of physical distancing and sanitation measures.However, it is yet to allow gyms even as the Central government has allowed them to operate while unlocking more lockdown restrictions.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday said the government has to exercise caution while relaxing restrictions as Covid-19 cases are still increasing in the state. As far as Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) are concerned, the state will have to be extra cautious, he said.“In exercise with the powers conferred under section 2 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and all the other enabling provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, it is expedient to extend the lockdown in the entire state till midnight of August 31,” states the notification issued by state chief secretary Sanjay Kumar.“Malls and market complexes will be operational from 9am to 7pm with effect from August 5 without theatres, food courts, and restaurants. However, the kitchen of restaurants and food courts will be allowed to operate in malls, wherein home delivery through aggregators will be allowed,” it stated.“Outdoor non-team sports like golf courses, outdoor firing range, outdoor gymnastics, tennis, outdoor badminton, and mallakhamba will be allowed with physical distancing and sanitation measures with effect from August 5. Swimming pools will not be allowed to operate,” it added.The standard operating procedure (SOP) for operations will be decided by the local bodies such as municipal corporations, etc.“Gyms are yet to be allowed to operate in the state. They will be allowed only after framing an SOP,” the chief secretary told HT.The issue of relaxing lockdown restrictions was discussed in the state cabinet meeting held on Wednesday. “We will be issuing more relaxations but have to be cautious while doing so. We will have to be extra cautious when it comes to Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR),” said a senior minister who attended the meeting.He said that the authorities will have to be more vigilant and focus more aggressively on tracing and treating patients in time. The state has also requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to continue providing personal protective equipment (PPE) and masks after the Centre decided to stop their supply from September 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/unlock-3-0-malls-and-market-complexes-to-open-from-august-5/story-Vh3Z9ErwAjKewRGoWj7PXO.html

A whopping 191.98% more students scored 90% and above in the state, from 28,516 in 2019 to 83,262 this year. In Mumbai division, the rise was 173.30%, from 5,399 in 2019 to 14,756 this year.Konkan division retained its first position among all nine regions in the state with a success rate of 97.71%. Mumbai division, which includes Thane, Raigad and Palghar, recorded 93.06%, also a jump of 18 percentage points, and stood fifth. This year, over 17.54 lakh students (including regular and repeat candidates) had appeared for the Class 10 examinations, of which over 16.37 lakh students passed. Last year’s success rate was 75.53%.This year, a total of 8,360 schools (37.04%) in the state recorded a cent percent result. Also, 242 students scored a perfect 100%, which includes two students from the Mumbai division. Social sciences, which included the cancelled Geography paper of 40 marks, recorded a 100% result. The number of students scoring 90% and above was also at an all-time high with 83,262 students from the state and 14,756 from the Mumbai division achieving the feat. In 2019, the numbers were 28,516 and 5,399 respectively. “This can be seen as the best performance of the state at least in the last many years. One can attribute it to the reintroduction of oral examinations and activity-based answer sheets that were introduced by the education department to make it easier for students to write their papers,” said Shakuntala Kale, chairperson, Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE). While the results are usually declared in June, this year, owing to the Covid-19 outbreak and resultant lockdown, the assessment was delayed thus leading to a delay in declaration of results. The education department had also cancelled the last paper, Geography, which was scheduled on March 23, and students were awarded an average of the marks obtained in the other five subjects for the paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/93-31-students-pass-ssc-exam-192-more-score-90-and-above/story-UzbXT3JahXwRbZ1wmaUZ8I.html
30-07-2020||Mumbai||Maha Covid-19 tally goes past 400,000||Maharashtra on Wednesday breached a grim milestone of 400,000 Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, amid Mumbai and other neighbouring cities witnessing a fall in cases over the past few days and authorities claiming that the state has reached the peak of the virus curve. With the addition of 9,211 new infections in the past 24 hours, the state tally went up to 400,651.It took Maharashtra 143 days to reach 400,000 cases, with the first 100,000 taking 96 days, while the latest took just 11 days. The second and third 100,000 took 22 and 14 days respectively. The state has 1,46,129 active cases after the total of recovered patients went up to 239,755, taking the recovery rate to 59.84%, against the national rate of 64.24% as on Tuesday, according to data released by state health department. The state reported 298 deaths in 24 hours for the second time in a week — highest single day spike —taking the toll to 144,63. Of the new deaths, 60 were in Mumbai, 60 in Pune district (40 in Pune city, 10 each in Pune rural and Pimpri-Chinchwad), 15 in Kalyan-Dombivli and 13 each in Thane city and Thane rural. State’s case fatality rate (CFR) stood at 3.61%, against the national rate of 2.25% on Tuesday.Pune city remained on the top of the chart in daily infections, with 1,458 cases in the past 24 hours.Mumbai’s tally touched 111,991 with the addition of 1,109 cases.July has so far reported 225,890 cases, accounting for 56.38% of the total cases. Mumbai’s share in the state’s case tally was 27.95%. It was 33.35% when it breached 3 lakh cases and 41.61% when the state figures crossed 2 lakh cases. Mumbai accounted for 54.83% when state crossed its first 1 lakh cases. While the state breached grim milestone of 4 lakh cases, its positivity rate has shown a steady drop and reached 19.32%. The positivity over the week (July 21-28) was 19.64%, down from 22.17% during July 15-21 and 23.88% during July 8-14.“The improvement in the positivity rate is a good sign and will help us in moving fast towards flattening of the curve,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope.“Steady fall in the positivity rate, despite the rise in the daily tests, indicates that we are moving in right direction in containing the virus spread. From just 13,000 tests a month ago, to more than 45,000 tests a day today, we have been ensuring that no suspected contact is left tracing. We have been tracing about nine contacts per positive patient, which earlier was just three.This would help us in bringing down the CFR and contain the spread effectively,” said a top government officer who did not want to be named.Experts expect the flattening of the curve to begin in next few weeks after it reaches the peak by mid August. They however have a word of caution. “If there is no discipline of social distancing and wearing of mask, which I call social and mask vaccine, there could be reverse wave of the infection. Mumbai has certainly gone past the peak and MMR is on the verge of it, so will be the case of Pune. We may see a different trend in different cities and areas, but the plateau is expected in next couple of weeks,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, an intensivist and member of the state -appointed task force for critical patients.Cases in MMR have witnessed a steady fall in its share in the state tally to 28.80% on Tuesday, from 35.57% in July 21 and 42.91% two weeks ago on July 14. According to state officials, following Mumbai, eight other municipal corporations in MMR have successfully contained the spread.Kalyan-Dombivli was one of the worst hit cities in MMR two weeks ago. Its daily count of cases came down to 219 on Wednesday, from 661 on July 12. The city was one of the worst hit in MMR after Mumbai with positivity rate reaching more than 40% and doubling rate dropping to 15 days. “The positivity rate has come down to 21% in last couple of days, and doubling has reached 34 days with a recovery rate of 69%. This could be achieved through aggressive tracing of contact and their effective management through ward-level war-rooms. The patients are attended to within hours of the test reports we get from ICMR at 8.30am. We have 10 ambulances per ward and ramped up facilities of Covid centres and hospitals,” said Vijay Suryavanshi, commissioner, Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC).The commissioner said that the city is past its peak and expect the virus curve to stabilise in next few days and then beginning of flattening of the curve in couple of weeks. “Central government’s projection of peak for KDMC was 535-560 cases, which was crossed 15 days ago and now we expect our daily tally to go below 200 cases a day,” he said. Currently 888,623 people are in home quarantine, while 40,777 are under institutional quarantine in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-covid-19-tally-goes-past-400-000/story-YdLnaStkQw54sXLUqYd89N.html
30-07-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University scraps UG entrance tests this year||Panjab University has decided to scrap the undergraduate entrance tests that were scheduled for October this year and grant admission on the basis of Class-12 results. The decision was taken on the recommendation of a coordination committee headed by Navdeep Goyal.“As admissions have already been delayed, members of the panel were of the opinion that instead of waiting, students should be given admission on basis of Class-12 results,” Goyal said.It has been decided that the admission process will start in August and online classes will commence on September 1.For admission to UG courses, PU conducts common entrance test and separate tests are conducted for BA/BCom LLB honours (five years) and hotel management.NO APTITUDE TEST Also, PU has decided no aptitude test will be conducted for BSc fashion technology and BA and BEd courses and admission to these courses will also be on the basis of Class-12 results.It has also been decided that for courses where examination fee has been received, it will be converted to counselling fee.Former PU vice-chancellor Arun Grover, said, “The university should have made the decision earlier. As Class-12 results have already been declared, students won’t wait for long and may join other universities instead. This way, PU will lose out on quality students.” The varsity is yet to take a decision on entrance tests for postgraduate courses.ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT STUDENTSStudents of current batches of Panjab University and its affiliated colleges will be assessed on the basis of internal assessment and their performances in all previous semesters. They will be promoted provisionally for now and online classes for the next semester will commence.Regarding promotion of University School of Open Learning (USOL) students, the chairperson has been requested to send a proposal regarding this and admission to the next session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-scraps-ug-entrance-tests-this-year/story-RJRUe2WovHnGnbh2HBqT2I.html

The head of the organisation, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, has been declared as a designated terrorist by the Centre.The state responded to fresh application filed by one Bikramjit Singh Bajwa, a Mohali resident, who had demanded that necessary steps be taken against the SFJ, which, he said, has suddenly become very active furthering the cause of separate state for Sikhs. Earlier, the high court had disposed of his plea on July 3 on assurance of necessary action by Punjab as well as Centre. On Wednesday too, the plea was disposed of both the parties promising prompt action against the banned group.In fresh plea he had told court that in spite of assurance on July 3 anything in relation to the threat perception extended by the organization to the life of the petitioner has been done.State had told court that they are already examining the matter and all possible steps and measures are being taken agains, state has not taken requisite action against the group.However, government counsel said that government is examining prayer of petitioner for security and all possible steps and measures are being taken against the group. Centre too made similar assurance. Earlier, the HC was told that as many as sixteen FIRs have been registered and 116 WhatsApp groups have been blocked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/websites-launched-by-sfj-being-blocked-punjab-to-hc/story-dlJG3UVGT45LTO6Vd0mrlO.html

In this instance, the body of a man in his 62, Inderjit, of Basti Jodhewal, was ferried all the way from Rajindra Hospital to the Civil Hospital, Ludhiana. The second body involved in the horrific mix-up was that of a man in his 80s, who is from Sangrur.The incident took place in morning was resolved by the evening. Both hospital authorities claim the kin of the patient was at fault. Dr Preetinder Chahal, who is assigned the duty of disposing of bodies, at the Rajindra Hospital, said, “The son of the 62-year-old man had identified the body of his father in the presence of a representative of the civil surgeon’s officer and another doctor. Despite that he took the wrong body. Later in the evening, he told us in written that he was not in the condition to identify the body as he was in shock, due to death of his father.” “We have resolved the matter,” said Dr Paras Pandove, medical superintendent. Ludhiana civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said, “The son told us that he got panicked and could not identify the body when it was shown to him in Patiala. The person has committed a blunder. Fortunately, it was during the re-verification process at civil hospital the body turned out to be of someone else.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-bodies-swapped-at-rajindra-hospital-patiala/story-mslgZYrWVAjHRXGkcKP9tM.html
30-07-2020||City||J&K mulls utilisation of water flowing from railway tunnels in Reasi||The Jammu and Kashmir administration on Wednesday decided to explore the utilisation and conservation of water springs flowing from railway tunnels in its hilly Reasi district.It may be stated here that the railway tunnels, which are part of the ambitious Kashmir rail link project, damaged natural water resources in Reasi.“The Reasi district administration is mulling to utilise and conserve the springs flowing from railway tunnels to meet the water shortage,” said an official spokesperson.District development commissioner Indu Kanwal Chib on Wednesday visited these tunnels in the Gran Morh area of Reasi. She said the water flowing from the tunnels could be preserved and provided to the areas facing shortage in the district.She asked the public health engineering (PHE) department to conduct a survey of T3 and T5 tunnels and explore the possibility of the water use.“Because of various factors, water supply may not adequately meet a community’s needs. Its conservation will ensure fresh supply for everyone, today and tomorrow,” she said.PHE executive engineer Sanjeev Malhotra, the village sarpanch and other officials accompanied the district commissioner.While the under-construction railway bridge, having a staggering height of 359 metres, over the Chenab river is being touted an engineering marvel, villagers had in the recent past complained that the water resources in the hills had dried up because of the tunnels.On March 24, 2013, at least eight labourers were injured during blasting at the T5 tunnel in Gran Morh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-mulls-utilisation-of-water-flowing-from-railway-tunnels-in-reasi/story-qUUGBw6eyf3usEyXLhOEHN.html
30-07-2020||Delhi||Being hounded for exposing graft: AAP MLAs||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders Atishi and Raghav Chadha on Wednesday said the North Delhi municipal body’s Leader of the House, Yogesh Kumar Verma, had issued them defamation notices over a press conference last week during which they questioned the municipal body’s inability to pay salaries of doctors and health workers in Kasturba and Hindu Rao hospitals and accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of corruption.All three municipal corporations in the Capital are ruled by the BJP.Atishi, AAP’s spokesperson and Kalkaji MLA said, “The BJP has not paid the salaries of doctors of Kasturba and Hindu Rao hospitals in times of the Covid pandemic. The AAP demanded (on July 24) that the BJP should pay the salaries of the doctors within three days, but they did not take cognisance. Now, they are trying to silence our voice with a defamation notice.”She said, “North MCD house leader and BJP councillor Yogesh Kumar Verma has sent these notices of defamation of Rs 1 crore to both of us. These notices are for raising questions against the BJP’s corruption at the MCDs. They have been exposed. The BJP believes they can intimidate us by sending defamation notices.”Responding to the allegations, Verma, leader of the House in the north corporation, said AAP had a history of blaming people without proof. “They said the Delhi government released their due funds but the councillors embezzled the amount. This is a lie. We have asked them to prove it but they have no evidence to substantiate their claim. Putting such baseless allegations on councillors is not fair and that is why I have sent them notices. If they do not apologise for these uncalled for remarks, I will drag them to court,” Verma said.Chadha, AAP’s national spokesperson and Rajendra Nagar MLA, said: “The leader of the House in North MCD has issued both criminal defamation and civil defamation notices against us. This means the BJP has claimed we have disrespected the North MCD. It clearly shows that the BJP‘s intention is to do corruption with the money of people and if you raise a question or expose them, then you will be slapped with defamation notices.”“I want to remind the BJP that the Aam Aadmi Party is not a political party that will be scared by such arbitrary defamation notices. The Aam Aadmi Party will stand with the people of Delhi and take to the streets against the BJP-ruled MCDs. We will go door to door and expose the BJP’s corruption. We will fight against the BJP at the courts and also at the streets,” he said.Verma said the Delhi government had to give Rs 1,181 crore to the north civic body but in the last two quarters, it had given only Rs 383 crore.“Whatever funds came from the Delhi government were used to pay salaries of our employees. We could pay the salaries to our employees until April. Their salaries of May and June are still pending and so the state government should clear our dues. We have requested the chief minister to release funds but to no avail. The AAP leaders (Chadha and Atishi) should come clean on their allegations and produce documents that how much money the government had given to North MCD,” the BJP leader said.Resident doctors of Hindu Rao and Kasturba hospitals have not been paid salaries for May and June. They had in June threatened to tender mass resignations if their salaries were not released but had withdrawn their threat after the high court had directed the civic body to pay their salaries at the earliest.In a press conference on July 24, Chadha and Atishi had said AAP would start a protest if the salaries of doctors are not cleared by the North MCD in three days and accused the BJP of corruption in the corporations. Dr Sunil Kumar, president of the Resident Doctors’ Association of Kasturba Hospital said salaries for two months — June and July — are pending. Kumar said they get salaries on the 25th of every month and received the salary of May earlier this week. He warned there should be no politics on the matter but a permanent solution should be devised.“Our salary is pending for two months. This has become a regular scene. The MCD blames the government and they blame the civic body but this blame-game is not the solution. If MCD has no funds, then the government should help them in arranging funds so that doctors, who are risking their lives amid the coronavirus pandemic, do not have to wait for salaries,” Kumar said. He said they would again write to the authorities next month to clear pending salaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/being-hounded-for-exposing-graft-aap-mlas/story-wjQZr1QjjIftAa2qzyRsoJ.html
30-07-2020||Noida||13 psychiatric patients, 6 staff of Greater Noida facility test Covid positive||A total of 13 patients and six staffers at a Greater Noida psychiatry rehabilitation centre tested Covid-19 positive on Wednesday. A rapid response team was soon dispatched to the centre, along with the Covid-19 nodal officer. While the patients and doctors were all asymptomatic, an entire floor of the rehab centre itself has been converted into a special Covid-19 isolation centre where the patients are kept. According to the management staff at Shanti Home mental health and rehabilitation centre, a special psychiatric centre at alpha-2 in Greater Noida, a total of 70 people that includes 40 patients took the rapid antigen test as a precautionary measure on Wednesday at a special testing nearby camp. “We have 40 patients here who have psychiatric needs and are being treated and rehabilitated by specialists so that they can move back to society and undertake the normal routine themselves. Though the patients did not go out since March, not even on an outing, we still decided to take the test at a camp held at a community centre nearby. Later the day, a total of 19 people were found positive. Soon officials arrived and after several brainstorming, it was decided to convert an entire floor into a special isolation ward. They will stay in quarantine for at least 14 days. We have also received the medicines from the team and are in touch with them,” said Dr Sumit Kumar, the resident doctor of the Shanti Home. Officials said that since the patients required special attention, they took the situation as an opportunity and decided to convert a section of the rehabilitation centre into a specially designated isolate centre where if the need arises other mental or psychiatric patients from elsewhere could also, be quarantined. “The rapid response team was rushed to the centre as we go to know about the case. They are in constant touch with the doctors at the centre. The issues here was that the psychiatric patients have different needs and medical history, so it did not seem right to send them to other Covid-19 hospitals. Even as we have enough beds at the designated hospitals, the staff there is not specially trained to take care of psychiatric patients. We inspected the rehab centre and found it had good infrastructure, and isolated all the patients there only,” said Alok Pratap Singh, Tehsildar Sadar and the Covid-19 Nodal officer of the region. He added that since the district doesn’t have any designated Covid-19 centre to take care of patients with special needs or psychiatric disorder, they now have an option. “The centre already has its specialist, rest the rapid team will keep visiting and assist them with Covid-19 care. We can also use the rehab centre in case someone with special needs is found Covid-19 positive,” said Singh. One of the most affected districts of the state, a total of 4,962 people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Gautam Buddh Nagar. On Wednesday, 65 new cases were reported in the city, while one fatality of Covid-19 happened after a gap of eight days, pushing the death toll in the district to 41. Meanwhile, 97 patients got discharged since Tuesday. The number of active cases, however, stands at 679, while 4,242 patients have got discharged till date. The recovery rate of patients in the district is 85.48 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/13-psychiatric-patients-6-staff-of-greater-noida-facility-test-covid-positive/story-Sa7DYckbuSdtK4pbuu5rQL.html
30-07-2020||Pune||Rapid test gives false negative for pregnant woman before delivery: doctor||A 20-year old pregnant woman was rushed to Sassoon general hospital (SGH) as a case of premature rupture of membranes for four hours from a hospital in Bhosari. The woman had to be operated on and so was tested for Covid-19 using the rapid antigen detection kit in which she tested negative. She had neither symptoms related to Covid-19 nor any history of contact with any patient. However, after delivery when the RT-PCR tests came forward it was found that the patient was positive for Covid-19 infection. Although the operation was conducted with full precaution, such incidents raise questions on the accuracy of the tests which are often the final decision for ground-level health workers. The woman who came from Bhosari was admitted on July 23. Dr. Shilpa Naik, associate professor at the hospital said, “The rapid antigen test is done to isolate the patient, but its sensitivity is lesser if compared to RT-PCR and so we did send a sample for RT-PCR. For both the tests we took the nasal sample. One she tested negative in the antigen test, we proceeded with the operation. All necessary precautions were taken inside the operation theatre assuming the patient to be a Covid-19 suspect including wearing of PPE kits and also following social distancing norms.” Dr Naik further said, “She delivered in the afternoon at 2pm, a healthy male baby. The baby’s swab test was negative for the Covid-19 infection. However, there was a rare complication post-delivery. After delivery, the uterus everted out of the introitus (III degree uterine inversion was seen). The patient had sudden tachycardia and hypotension so we gave immediate resuscitation and manual correction reposition of the uterus. So basically the uterus was inverted inside out which is a rare event as it happens once in 2,000 to 50, 000 deliveries. To put it in perspective, in my 20-year career at the hospital I have only seen three incidences of uterine inversion.” Due to vigilant monitoring, quick diagnosis, and immediate manual repositioning of the uterus, major complications of uterine inversion like neurogenic and haemorrhagic shock and severe blood loss could be prevented, Dr Naik added. “However, we cannot yet connect Covid-19 to these complications because a lot needs to be studied in placenta pathology to understand how much does Covid-19 affect a pregnant woman and the foetus,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/rapid-test-gives-false-negative-for-pregnant-woman-before-delivery-doctor/story-V3Rvpumwq1UTohp6Sk6o1L.html
30-07-2020||Pune||CM to visit city today as state, Centre’s focus shifts to Pune||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will visit Pune on Thursday to take a review of the city’s Covid-19 preparedness. In Pune, Thackeray will conduct a review meeting with district administration and Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials. He is also likely to interact with public representatives from all parties before returning to Mumbai in the evening. This will be Thackeray’s first visit to Pune after the Covid-19 outbreak started on March 9. The city’s Covid-19 infection graph is on the rise with 53,577 cases while the death toll stands at 1,215 as of July 28. Earlier, the chief minister concentrated on Mumbai while coordinating about the rest of Maharashtra through meetings via video conferencing, according to opposition party leaders. Thackeray visited Konkan after Nisarga cyclone hit the Maharashtra coastline and also performed the Ashadhi Ekadashi puja in Pandharpur. However, there was no visit scheduled for Pune, even though the city has been facing a shortage of ICU beds amid the rising cases. As Thackeray avoided visiting Pune, opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis and Shivajinagar legislator Siddharth Shirole criticised the chief minister for neglecting the city in the hour of crisis. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state unit chief Chandrakant Patil said, “The state has got two CMs, with one only sitting at Matoshree - Thackeray’s official residence – and the other (without naming Ajit Pawar) visiting other parts of the state.” Besides the CM’s visit, the central team led by Kunal Kumar has also arrived in Pune. The team suggested measures to the district administration to bring down Pune’s case fatality rate, which is currently at 2.38%. “We have suggested the administration some measures to bring down the case fatality rate. There are suggestions to install close circuit television (CCTV) camera in hospitals and follow ICMR protocol while treating patients,” said Kumar.To take a stock of the situation in Pune, Union minister Prakash Javadekar held a meeting with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and others on Tuesday through video conferencing. During the meeting, Javadekar promised 100 ventilators to the city. These ventilators will be in addition to the 21 ventilators that PMC has received from the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/cm-to-visit-city-today-as-state-centre-s-focus-shifts-to-pune/story-55I8dNLctFsS90RXZ9cggL.html
30-07-2020||Pune||Pune has four times more oxygen stock than required: Mhaisekar||The Pune division has enough oxygen supply and there’s no need to worry about oxygen supply in any crises, claimed Pune divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar. Many Covid positive patients require oxygen as oxygen levels drop after catching the Covid-19 infection. Mhaisekar said, “I myself conducted the meeting with oxygen suppliers for various hospitals and various medical units. All the manufacturers had given details and made clear that oxygen cylinders are available at large numbers and they have four times more stock than the requirement.” According to Dr H K Sale of Noble hospital, the oxygen supply is regular but it is true that all of a sudden the demand has increased. “Earlier we use to need a vehicle once in a week but now requirement has been increased and daily there is a supply requirement. Though the demand has increased, the supply has been regular but some hospitals or small units might be receiving a late delivery,” Dr Sale said. The government is monitoring all the oxygen supply vehicles by GPS to identify the locations of the vehicles, Dr Sale added. Dr Bharat Purandare from Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital said, “There is no shortage in the number of oxygen supply as such but there is a shortage in the number of oxygen beds. We are not yet facing any shortage in oxygen supply for the beds that we have.” Mhaisekar promised that at any given crisis, there would be no medical oxygen supply crises.There were complaints that citizens are not getting oxygen in some hospitals but the administration claimed that there are no such specific complaints with them. However, the administration accepted that there are complaints about not getting oxygenated supported beds or ICU beds. Yash Gunjal, one of the contractors who are involved in oxygen supply related business said, “Almost all the suppliers have enough stock of oxygen cylinders. Even at their industrial units, enough oxygen is available. On the supply side, there are no issues at all.” Dr Sanjay Lalwani from Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital said, “We have our own oxygen plant which ensures that we have a constant supply of oxygen. To depend on oxygen cylinders at this time is suicidal because a Covid-19 patient requires a lot of oxygen and so we cannot depend on an external factor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-has-four-times-more-oxygen-stock-than-required-mhaisekar/story-ZbcyQSbTJJ3LNaqpdVW7ZK.html
30-07-2020||Gurugram||Haryana forest dept uses drone to plant 5 lakh seeds in Aravallis||The forest department of Haryana on Wednesday concluded a drive using drone technology to shower seed bombs in the Aravallis . The aerial seeding has been primarily used in an attempt to green inaccessible terrain having steep slopes, fragmented or disconnected areas having no forest routes for normal tree plantation activities. The drones are an easy and efficient way to increase green cover in the Aravallis, said forest officials. The exercise, officials said, had commenced on July 18 and ended on Wednesday and covered as many as four districts of Faridabad, Yamunanagar, Panchkula, and Mahendergarh. The initiative was first started in 2019 with officials stating that the seed germination rate then being around only 15% due to little late dispersal. This year,however, the dispersal is very timely and 20-30% germination is expected. Species whose seeds were disseminated included Peepal, Pilkhan, Amaltash, Bael Patra, Pahari Papri, Ronjh and Khairi. The total drone seeding exercise was done on 100 hectare area in the four districts, with an average of 5,000 seeds per hectare. Of nearly five lakh seeds disbursed, 50,000 seeds were showered in Aravallis in Faridabad district, said a second forest department official, adding that they used two drones for this exercise. The drone-based tree planting technology has a very high chances of success if seeding is done timely, preferably, before the onset of monsoons, said officials. The technology requires a proven artificial intelligence-based system to assess the area for plantation sites selection of the site-specific local species. Soil moisture, choice of species, seed pellets, and mechanism of drone seed planting are the main deciding factors for successful aerial tree planting, officials said. Additional principal chief conservator of forests, Vinod Kumar, said, “The seeding drone is programmed to take a load of 2kg and is equipped with a precise delivery mechanism to drop seeds of different sizes at encoded intervals from a low height of 10 to 15 metre,” he said. Forest officials said that a single drone is capable of planting 20,000 to 30,000 tree seeds in a day. Dr Amrinder Kaur, principal chief conservator of forest, said that geo-location of blank patches and low-density areas can be mapped using satellite imageries in Aravallis. Data generated can be directly fed into drone software for auto plantation, which is an easier method. “The forest department is currently working on the development of mobile-based application to collect forestry intervention and monitoring data from the field for better management of forest areas,” she said. Kaur said drone-based seeding will boost vegetation enrichment in denuded and low-density areas. It will also enable plantation in inaccessible and tough terrains, which is otherwise difficult to reach. “The objective of this exercise is to ensure that all areas including difficult sites is brought under green cover. Seed dispersal using drones help in reaching difficult sites in short times. As the monsoon has come, we expect good germination this time,” she said. Environmentalists pointed out that since the Aravalli landscape is semi-arid with little rainfall, re-greening has always been a challenge. “I have been working on restoration and rewilding of Aravallis for the last 12 years. I have tried several native species of Aravallis such as Doodhi, Dhak, Dhok, Barna, Basa, Ronjh, and Khairi with seed balls and I can reasonably say that we have failed. I have tried this over several years in plots and monitored the plots.. Except for a few Doodhi germinating once in a while, I didn’t see any other species doing well,” said Vijay Dhasmana, curator, Aravali Biodiversity Park. Experts said that if the forest department is doing drone seed ball propagation, they must make sure it is studied, else they would not develop any knowledge as to how and what works in the Aravallis. “The most efficient technique for us at the Aravalli biodiversity park has been sowing seeds of diverse species on the landscape. Some of the pioneers have shown remarkable results,” said Dhasmana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-forest-dept-uses-drone-to-plant-5l-seeds-in-aravallis/story-83j75VA5ox3bhzNgAUp9OO.html
30-07-2020||Gurugram||Use, purchase of ACs in MCG, HSVP come under scanner||Officials of both Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) have been asked to provide an explanation as to why they purchased air-conditioners, and switched on the air-conditioning system in their offices. despite directions prohibiting so. In April, the Haryana government had banned the use of central air conditioners fearing an increase in spread of Covid-19. Similarly in May, the state government had directed that austerity measures be adopted due to shortage of revenue and had hence prohibited the purchase of luxury items, including air conditioners. Last week, HSVP officials received a complaint that some of their staff members had switched on the central air-conditioning systems. Similarly in MCG, an internal complaint was raised that at least seven officials have purchased air-conditioners, some using public funds, and placed them in their respective office cabins. Separate internal investigations have been initiated in both matters. Incidentally, both MCG and HSVP share an office in sector 34. While the HSVP owns the building and occupies its ground floor, MCG pays a monthly rent of Rs 20 lakh to the HSVP for operating out of the remaining three floors of the building. “As per the guidelines issued by the Haryana government, central air-conditioning system is not permitted inside government offices for the time being. The scenario will remain the same until a direction is received stating otherwise. Any report of violations is being promptly examined and concerned officials are being asked for an explanation. We are monitoring all developments related to violations,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.MCG officials began working from the Sector 34 office from April 24, even as a nationwide lockdown remained in place. Just five days later, on April 29, the Haryana government issued an advisory to all government offices to stop using central air conditioning systems to prevent the possible spread of Covid.In May, there were several occasions where MCG officials were found to have violated this rule and turned on the central air-conditioning system, following which the MCG commissioner had cautioned workers and warned that a repeat could lead to disciplinary action.Due to the lack of air-conditioning, a lot of MCG officials ,in the meanwhile, opted to work from only on alternate days or come to office only twice a week.“The problem with the office is that there are no windows. Even if it is raining outside, the office remains stuffy due to lack of any air outlet/circulation. Hence, I am only going to office when there is teamwork needed or a presentation needs to be given. On all other days, I am continuing to work from home,” said an MCG official, in the taxation wing.Regarding last week’s incident, Vivek Kalia, estate officer, HSVP said he has also asked officials for an explanation on the issue.The problem arising from a lack of air-conditioners, however, is not limited only to public offices. Employees of several private offices too have been forced to sweat it out in heat and humidity, with the air conditioning in their building being switched off .In May, HT had reported that the Haryana government had issued standard operating procedures (SOP) only allowing companies and industrial units to use window or split AC units. As a result, many office spaces located in commercial buildings with a common central air-conditioning system had extended the work from home option to their employees rather than making them sweat it out in their otherwise swanky offices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/use-purchase-of-acs-in-gurugram-civic-body-offices-come-under-scanner/story-2aytByyThmw3l68FUXSqlM.html
30-07-2020||Delhi||As number of active cases declines, hotels released from Covid duty in Delhi||With Delhi now having only 10,770 active Covid-19 cases, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government on Wednesday released from Covid duty around 40 hotels that were converted into extended hospitals since May 29. Senior government officials said the administration is now considering allowing hotels and even banquet halls to resume normal operations, provided that they strictly adhere to the norms of social distancing, sanitising, mask wearing and restrictions on the number of people in gatherings. The decision to delink the hotels that were attached to various hospitals in the city was taken by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a meeting after consulting with the state health and revenue departments. “A few hotels were attached to hospitals to increase the number of Covid beds. In view of the improving situation and because most of these hotel beds are lying vacant for the past many days, these hotels are now being released,” Kejriwal tweeted after the meeting.On June 12, when Covid cases in the capital were rapidly rising, the Delhi government had released a list of 77 banquet halls and 40 hotels that were to be converted into Covid facilities to cope with the requirement of beds. A total of over 15,800 beds were identified in these hotels (4,628 beds) and banquet halls (11,229 beds). The model was a first in the country and it was approved by the Delhi government on May 29, when it had identified the five hotels to be converted into extended Covid hospitals. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThese hotels were Crowne Plaza (attached to Batra Hospital); Hotel Surya ( attached to Apollo Hospitals); Hotel Siddharth ( attached to BL Kapur Memorial Hospital); Hotel Jivitesh (attached to Sir Gangaram Hospital); and Sheraton Saket ( attached to Max Super Speciality Hospital).Of these, only Sheraton Saket operated as an extended hospital for the longest time; the rest did not receive any patients.An official of Max Super Speciality Hospitals, which was operating the Covid centre at the Sheraton hotel in Saket, said on condition of anonymity that the facility was discontinued “a while ago” as all Covid patients being treated there were cured and no new patient has opted for the hotel.A spokesperson of the Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, which was allotted three hotels, said it did not have to use any of the hotels for Covid patient management as the hospital was able to handle the patient intake.Ramesh Dang, president of Delhi Banquet Federation, said Delhi is losing out a lot of revenue since all social gatherings are now being booked at hotels in Gurugram, Noida or other NCR cities. “Under the Unlock guidelines of the Central government, hotels and banquet halls are allowed to operate. But, Delhi had banned it in view of the high number of Covid-19 cases here. But, now that the cases have come down, these establishments must be allowed to open. We all are losing a lot of revenue since weddings and other social gatherings are being shifted to other NCR cities,” he said. Hotel and tourism associations welcomed the Delhi government’s move, but demanded that hotels now be allowed to resume services and tourism be promoted. “Tourism is one of the largest economic multipliers and we believe that each rupee spent on tourism could have an economic multiplier of upwards of 3- 4 times more for India. We have been requesting over the past five months for the revival of tourism,” the Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism and Hospitality said in a statement.The government in a statement said, “With the efforts of the chief minister, the coronavirus situation in Delhi has improved significantly and at present, only about 10,000 cases are active and more than 88% of patients have recovered. As on Wednesday, the Delhi government has more than 15,000 Covid beds, of which more than 12,000 are vacant. So, the demand of hotel owners and associations to relieve them of Covid duty was accepted on Wednesday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/as-number-of-active-cases-declines-hotels-released-from-covid-duty/story-k5qdQKV6MTPhI1ymP0H0kJ.html
30-07-2020||Delhi||Mixed response to new education policy, Sisodia welcomes move to rename MHRD as ministry of education||The reforms and policies announced under the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 on Wednesday evoked mixed responses from the teaching community and educationists across the national capital while the Delhi government said it would study the changes in detail before offering its opinion, though it welcomed the step to rename the Union ministry of human resource development as the ministry of education. The changes include increased focus on multidisciplinary courses, multilingual and digital learning, a revised curricular structure, reduced course load, and a pre-primary education curriculum. Meeta Sengupta, an educationist, said she largely supports the NEP for its visionary and idealistic nature. “The revised policy challenges schools and teachers to step up to the future. However, in some areas, the policy hasn’t done enough,” she said. “While the multidisciplinary approach and multiple entry-exit points in higher education are a welcome step, more work could have been done with respect to class 10 and 12 board exams by allowing students multiple options. Increased attention towards foundational learning is also a good move,” she said. “The focus on digital education, which comes amid a pandemic, also needs a robust implementation mechanism ensuring equity among all children,” Sengupta said, expressing concern over the usage of Artificial Intelligence to analyse inputs for the “holistic report card” proposed by the policy.Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia, welcoming the Centre’s step to rename the Union HRD ministry as the ministry of education, said they will offer its opinion on Thursday, “National Education policy after so many years of wait is welcome step. But as I have said earlier, an education policy cannot be a compilation of all wishful thinking about education...Its important to say ‘what we’ll do’ but it’s more important to tell ‘how we’ll do that”.“We are studying #NEP announced today in greater detail. Will express our opinions tomorrow...Edu. policy has to be the road map to fulfill those good wishes we already have about education.” he wrote on Twitter.Earlier in the day, he said, “It is of utmost importance that education be about developing human beings rather than develop ‘human resources’. A much needed step in the right direction.”Addressing privacy concerns, Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini and governing body member of the Central Board of Secondary Education, said any new development will have its own challenges and authorities will work towards it.“The policy seems to be progressive and it also promotes home language, Indian knowledge system, culture, and values. Focus on early childhood development is appreciable and the 5+3+3+4 schooling structure instead of the previous 10+2 system will ensure a strong base of early childhood care. Inclusion of 21st-century skills like coding for middle-school students and vocational courses is welcome since they are the need of the hour. However, the government must ensure that there is a standardised form of teaching and training across the nation,” she said.Mary Jyotsna Minj, principal of a government school in Kondli, said, “Introducing vocational courses at an early stage will help students who may not perform well in subjects like Maths and Science and then get a compartment. Many of our students come with the idea of setting up a business to support their family and they often show a tendency of doing better in vocational subjects. An early introduction to these courses will help such students.”In higher education, the major reforms include scrapping of MPhil course, the introduction of multiple entry-exit points in graduate courses, fees and charges to be fully disclosed, graded autonomy on the basis of performance, and multidisciplinary courses.Jawaharlal Nehru University vice-chancellor Mamidala Jagadesh Kumar and Jamia Millia Islamia V-C Najma Akhtar called the new policy “a positive step forward” and “groundbreaking.”The JNU students’ union, however, said the government used the pandemic to approve the objectionable policy. “Ever since the draft NEP was introduced last year, students across the country were on the warpath against it as it is another move in the neoliberal agenda to commercialise education,” it said in a statement.The Delhi University Teachers’ Association also condemned the move to approve the policy amid a pandemic. “Our opposition to the draft NEP rested, among other things, on its proposal to dismember universities and hand over every higher educational institution to a Board of Governors...DUTA calls upon the government to desist from bulldozing changes and instead to engage in a dialogue with the academia,” DUTA president Rajib Ray said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mixed-response-to-new-education-policy-sisodia-welcomes-move-to-rename-mhrd-as-ministry-of-education/story-u0VPRe5neHeolo4iRuC4mL.html
30-07-2020||Delhi||Ensure no construction takes place in Sanjay Van without DDA, police nod, says Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Wednesday directed the city police and the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to ensure that no construction is carried out in Sanjay Van area, a protected forest area in south Delhi, without their permission.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan issued the direction while hearing a PIL initiated by the court on its own on July 8 after coming across videos and photos circulated by visitors and joggers on social media of what appeared to be the construction of new ‘mazaars (mausoleums)’ near Mayur Pahadi, a spot inside the forest. On the last date of hearing, the court had directed the police and the DDA to carry out an aerial drone survey drones and inform it about the number of mazaars in the park and since when they were in existence.On Wednesday, the police in their affidavit filed through advocate Rahul Mehra, standing counsel of the Delhi government (criminal) and advocate Chaitanya Gosain, said there are 77 mazaars, which are old and no fresh construction of any mazaar was found there.The police also said, “Structures like a mandir (temple), kabristhan (graveyard), dargah and idgah have been there inside the Sanjay Van since a long time and no fresh construction or encroachment in the shape of any mazaar is going on or has come up in Sanjay Van in the recent past (especially during lockdown period).” But residents claim that construction has been going on inside the forest. Sandeep Bali, president of Mehrauli residents’ welfare association (RWA), said, “A group of morning walkers shot the videos of the construction activities -- fresh earth was dug up and cement was being used. There have been encroachments within the forest in the past as well. The police on duty there were not allowing walkers to approach the Mayur Pahadi part of the forest.” “We did a comprehensive survey using drones and did not find any encroachment. On the night of July 21, anti-social elements desecrated the old mazaars. The following day, police were informed about this after which they reconstructed the broken graves in order to avoid any communal tension,” a senior DDA official, privy to the development but did not wish to be named, said. When Hindustan Times visited the spot last Friday, and again on Tuesday, the site was found guarded by the local police. Although the cemented portions on some of the structures looked like an add-on to the old structure, there was no way to ascertain when these portions were added. DDA’s horticulture director and the in-charge of the forest Ashok Kumar said, “On July 22, we had written to the deputy commissioner of police about the broken graves. They sent a team to look into the matter. The complaint copy has also been submitted to the high court,” Kumar said. The matter would be now heard on August 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ensure-no-construction-takes-place-in-sanjay-van-without-dda-police-nod-says-hc/story-a0MWQgSq4JYg0dTkfTEspO.html
30-07-2020||Delhi||North body postpones proposal to levy professional tax||The BJP-ruled North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Wednesday postponed the proposal to levy tax on professionals, increase in the rates of electricity tax and property transfer duty --- the same which were passed by the SDMC House on Monday -- following stiff resistance from the opposition parties. The corporation’s standing committee, however, approved hiking tax on rented commercial properties, guest houses and banquet halls -- just like the SDMC. The SDMC had doubled the tax on such properties. However, the North body announced that a separate committee will be formed to evaluate the percentage of tax hike. The North body standing committee also proposed to enhance licensing by fee for various commercial establishments in industrial areas at least three times.“We want to improve the financial health of the corporation and for that we may have to take strong measures but it cannot be done without proper discussion. We have decided to postpone the proposals of professional tax, increase in the rates of electricity tax and property transfer tax till the next meeting of the House in August for discussion. We are not implementing these taxes for now,” Jai Prakash, mayor, North Delhi Municipal Corporation said.The proposal will now be tabled for discussion in the North DMC House. The opposition Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had strongly objected to the corporation’s tax proposals. Vikas Goel, leader of opposition in the north civic body and an AAP councillor, said the AAP is against any kind of new tax or the hike in tax rates especially when the people are battling the coronavirus pandemic.“People are already suffering due to Covid-19 pandemic and more tax will only make things worse for them. We have strongly opposed tax proposals in the standing committee meeting and following which those were postponed. We will oppose it further if need be,” Goel said.Adesh Gupta, Delhi BJP president, said he has asked the SDMC to roll back the proposal to levy professional tax. “We will not let the corporations levy professional tax. North corporation has already deferred the move. We did not approve increase in the electricity tax. The corporations are in bad financial shape because the state government is not giving the corporation their due funds. The government should help the civic bodies in these testing times and should not do politics on the matter,” Gupta said. Mayor Jai Prakash said the proposal to hike tax on rented commercial property was in line with the recommendations of Municipal Valuations Commiittee-3, which proposed doubling the tax on rented commercial properties and also to increase tax on commercial establishments such as guest houses, banquet halls, private schools among others. “We have passed this but a committee will be formed to review the recommendations and check viability. We will see how much tax we can increase on different type of commercial establishments. We have also approved the proposal to increase factory licensing fee for industries and storage houses. We had to pass these proposals because licensing fee has not increased for over last 10 years,” Prakash said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/north-body-postpones-proposal-to-levy-professional-tax/story-QF7mFB8HvPhYbBZBifVgWO.html

His wife works in a factory in Narela and they have two children.“A few masons, including the victim, worked under him at the construction site. Singh and the workers had got to know each other and their family members well in these past months,” said a senior police investigator who is not authorised to speak to the media.Among the relatives of the mason’s Singh was acquainted to was the victim’s 13-year-old relative who lives with her parents in the same neighbourhood.“According to the victim’s family, a few days ago Singh had approached the girl’s father with his proposal to marry her, but Singh was scolded and asked to keep away from the child,” said the officer.On Monday night, Singh allegedly met the girl’s 48-year-old relative to seek his help in convincing the girl’s father. “Singh also offered to help the victim and the girl’s family with money, but the victim reminded Singh of the age difference between him and the child and chided him for thinking about marrying a minor girl,” said the investigator.This led to an argument during which Singh allegedly manhandled the victim before his relatives arrived at the scene to intervene. Minutes later, Singh allegedly picked up an iron rod from the construction site and beat the victim to death.While Singh fled the crime spot, the victim’s family told the police about their past confrontations with him.“We registered a murder case and began searching for the suspect. Since he belonged to Bihar, we deployed police teams on possible routes he could take, such as bus stands and railway stations. He was caught in the early hours of Tuesday, within hours of the murder,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/denied-marriage-with-13-year-old-girl-contractor-kills-her-relative/story-P2epptZKdRQah9I7bsfgRL.html

Admissions will be done on the basis of marks scored in qualifying examinations up to the graduation level, followed by an online interview.A notification issued by the institute on its official website said on Tuesday, “In view of the worsening situation of Covid-19 in many regions and receipt of enquiries from concerned candidates and parents about the need to travel to centres for appearing in the entrance examination, the institute has, now, decided to go for a marks-based selection process, as a special case, this year.”The institute said it has decided to adopt a new admission process for this year, in which more weightage will be given to marks scored by candidates in the qualifying examinations, up to the graduation level, including the marks scored in class 10 and 12, followed by an online interview. IIMC, an autonomous institute under the ministry of Information and Broadcasting, offers eight postgraduate diploma courses, including English journalism, Hindi journalism, Radio and TV journalism and Advertising and Public Relations. Besides Delhi, it has campuses in Amravati, Dhenkanal, Kottayam and Jammu.The institute asked students not to apply again in case they have already done. “But they need to submit via email a written (200 words) or video (1 to 2 minutes) Statement of Purpose describing why she/he wants to join the course,” it read.The institute will issue a detailed notification on the marks-based admission process by July 30.IIMC has also announced online classes for the first semester considering the prevailing situation. “The first semester of all PG diploma courses will be conducted in the online mode only in this academic year. It is expected from all the prospective students that they have access to a good quality laptop or computer with strong internet connection at home or their place of stay,” the notification read.Satish Nambudiripad, additional director general (admissions), said, “After a due consideration, the institute has decided to switch to merit-based admission this year. We cannot call students to entrance examination centres and it won’t be feasible for many to take entrance exams online. The marks will carry 80% weightage and the remaining 20% will be for the interview.”Nambudiripad said the decision to conduct online classes for the first semester was taken to ensure safety of students. “Educational institutions worldwide are switching to the online mode of learning this year. We cannot take risk by calling students to the campus amid the pandemic,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-iimc-to-skip-entrance-exams-this-year-first-semester-classes-to-go-online/story-ugJ0WRMeQ2IgfiVXk37iII.html

30-07-2020||Chandigarh||Covid victim’s body swapped in Ludhiana, kin cries foul||The dead body of a Covid-19 victim was swapped and ferried all the way from Government Rajindra Hospital in Patiala to a civil hospital in Ludhiana. The incident came to light when the son of the 65-year-old Covid-19 victim raised an alarm. The development sent the doctors present into a tizzy. Senior medical officer (SMO) Dr Amarjeet Kaur said the patient’s son had identified the body at Government Rajindra Hospital, Patiala, but when the body was brought to Ludhiana and shown to the relatives for re-verification, one of the relatives claimed that it was not the body of the deceased. The patient’s son and other relatives were shown the picture of the victim’s dead body. After identification the body was ferried from Patiala to the Ludhiana civil hospital and the dead body of another Covid-19 patient was ferried back to the mortuary. Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga blamed the victim’s son. “He told us that he panicked and could not identify the dead body when it was shown to him in Patiala. People need to be brave enough to at least identify their kin.” On the other hand, the victim’s son said that the body shown to him at Rajindra Hospital, Patiala, was that of his father while the body that was ferried to Ludhiana was someone elses. He said even the name and details on the bodysuit were also different. This is the second such incident this month. On July 19, the bodies of two Covid-19 patients were swapped at Amritsar’s Guru Nanak Dev Hospital. What is re-verification? As per the re-verification process, the aadhaar card of the deceased and other family members is verified before handing over the body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-victim-s-body-swapped-kin-cries-foul/story-RX3PFpS5jHNJI8QnjhYNWM.html

The application mentioned that before the Covid-19 pandemic, his counsel visited him regularly and he could pass handwritten instructions and documents.“Since March 17, the visits of my counsel have been discontinued due to Covid -19 and as a result safe-keeping and proper organisation of the case-related documents has become difficult,” he stated. He has requested the court to pass instructions to the superintendent of Model Jail “to use the computer in the office of a jail officer for three hours a week under his watch” so that he can prepare his defence and related material.The application was rejected by the superintendent, as there is no such provision existing in the Punjab jail manual wherein undertrial prisoners can be allowed to access computers to prepare their own case.The jail superintendent said due to security reasons, no inmate is allowed to use a computer in the office. “He was advised to prepare handwritten notes, if he desires so. He can also discuss case via e-mulaqat, and can use telephone,” the superintendent mentioned.In the second application, Zaidi stated that he is a postgraduate and an income tax payer, hence, is entitled for better class facility that is “B” class status.

One of them is Malhar Kamalapur from Bal Shikshan Mandir English Medium school, Pune. Talking about his achievement, Malhar said, “I am very fortunate to get 100 per cent marks in the SSC exams and the credit goes to my teachers, parents and friends who always encouraged me. I studied all the subjects throughout the year and did revision during the exams. I will opt for the Science stream and later decide on career opportunities.” Like Malhar, Aneeha Dsouza from SPM English Medium School also scored 100 per cent marks in the SSC exams. Shivani Sane, a student from Ahilyadevi High School who scored 99.80 per cent marks and is the school topper, said, “All my efforts and regular studies have borne fruits and I am very happy. During this year, I focused on all the subjects and did revision several times. Our teachers from the school helped me a lot to understand the subjects. I was a bit nervous initially while writing the papers. I am going to take the Science stream as Mathematics and Science are my favourite subjects.” Most of the prominent schools from Pune have scored 100 per cent passing results. Jyoti Masand, principal of Jai Hind High School and Junior College, one of the schools that secured 100 pass percentage, said, “It’s a success we truly deserved, an achievement which students have earned.

30-07-2020||Chandigarh||Brick kiln owner’s murder: Close to cracking case, say Ludhiana police||A day after a 65-year-old woman was hacked to death outside her brick kiln in Shahpur village of Payal sub-division, the Khanna police chief claimed that they were on the verge of solving the case. Ruing out robbery as a possible motive, Khanna senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harpreet Singh said closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage and the nature of injury suggested the assailants intended to murder the victim, Rachhpal Kaur. “We are exploring different angles, including personal enmity and property dispute. I cannot divulge details but I am sure we will crack the case in a day or two,” said the SSP. The police officer said the accused may have conducted a recce of the area before committing the crime. He also did not rule out the possibility of contract killers being hired to commit the murder. “They knew the victim was present at the brick kiln that evening,” said the SSP. The victim’s son Vishweshver Pal Singh is an advocate while her daughter Taranbir Kaur and son-in-law Simarjit Singh are doctors. Rachpal Kaur was killed while she was standing outside her brick kiln around 7pm on Monday evening. The bike-borne assailants pulled out a dagger and attacked her neck. She was rushed to a hospital where doctors declared her brought dead. Dr Simarjit Singh said the death of his father-in-law Sukhdev Singh, who was killed in a road accident on 2017, was also shrouded in mystery. He alleged that the crime was related to a dispute over an acre of land where the brick kiln stood. He added that for the past month his brother-in-law and mother-in-law had been receiving threats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/brick-kiln-owner-s-murder-close-to-cracking-case-say-ludhiana-police/story-xvzR4f1taSYVQpFBR3xGdL.html
30-07-2020||Delhi||Customer shot at during robbery bid at Tilak Nagar jewellery store, cops chase and nab suspects||Less than 30 minutes after five men allegedly shot and injured a customer during a robbery bid at a jewellery shop in west Delhi’s Tilak Nagar on Monday evening, three of them were caught after a dramatic, 10km high-speed motocycle chase by policemen who stopped the getaway car, followed by a shoot-out in Patel Nagar. The injured customer is undergoing treatment at the hospital and he is out of danger, said deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit. A case of robbery attempt and attempt to murder was registered at the Tilak Nagar police station in connection with the firing incident. More than two dozen police officers were involved in the entire operation that lasted for nearly 25 minutes and was reminiscent of the high-speed adrenaline pumping pursuit seen on screen. Shots were fired by the police and the robbery suspects but nobody was hurt. The main suspect Sachin Jangra,31, who was driving the i20 getaway car, was caught after a police officer slid his motorcycle to a halt in front of the moving car, forcing it to stop. Two more suspects were overpowered in the shoot-out that followed with DCP Bhatia and his security officer firing one bullet each, police officers present at the spot said. “The two were identified as Shehzad,21, and Mohammad Anas,22. A fourth suspect, Manish Sharma,22, was arrested from Uttam Nagar after late night raids. He had managed to flee during the police chase from Patel Nagar along with Mohammad Nadeem, who is yet to be nabbed,” DCP Sanjay Bhatia said. Police said the whole incident started around 5.30pm when five men reached a jewellery shop near the Tilak Nagar Metro station and tried to rob it. Before that, around 4.30pm, they first tried robbing a jewellery store in Avantika, Rohini, about 10km from Tilak Nagar but failed as the jeweller sensed something wrong when all five persons insisted on being allowed inside together. They were turned away by the jeweller who told them that official work was going on inside. He, however, did not alert the police as he didn’t know the men were robbers, said a police officer associated with the matter. Jangra was disowned by his family a couple of years ago because of his criminal activities, police said. His father runs a jewellery shop in Tilak Nagar itself and Jangra knew some of the jewellers in the area. He had planned the robbery in Avantika and when that did not go as planned, he convinced his associates to strike the Tilak Nagar jewellery shop which was known to him, Bhatia said. To avoid being identified by the jeweller, Jangra remained in the car while the other four went into the shop on the first floor. The robbers faced resistance from those in the shop during the robbery bid and a commotion broke out. They panicked and in their attempt to flee, they fired a shot that hit customer Chand Chadha in the abdomen. The suspects fled in Jangra’s car which was waiting outside. Almost immediately, a message regarding the firing and suspects fleeing in a Hyundai I20 car was flashed on the police wireless, the DCP said. Four policemen who were on motorcycle patrolling spotted the i20 car near Shadipur Metro station and began chasing it. Seeing the police on their tail, Jangra took a U-turn and drove towards Moti Nagar. The policemen on motorcycles surrounded the vehicle from all sides. The car driver managed to ram one motorcycle and its rider fell off. Police said as the car slowed down in the impact of the crash, another policeman slid his bike to a halt in front of the vehicle. The motorcycle got trapped under the car as the driver tried to speed away and brought the vehicle to a stop, said one of the police officers, who was involved in the chase. His statement was later converted into an FIR registered at the Ranjeet Nagar police station under Sections 186 (obstructing public servant) 353 (assault), 307 (attempt to murder), 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 25,27,54, and 59 of the Arms Act. Jangra was caught while the other occupants fled after brandishing firearms. Soon, DCP Bhatia who was briefing personnel at the Patel Nagar police station also reached he spot and learnt from the public that two suspects had entered a bungalow, about 100m away from the spot where the car was intercepted. The police surrounded the bungalow and asked the suspects to surrender, but they fired at the police party. “DCP Bhaita and his security officer fired two bullets to scare the suspects who tried to flee through the rear door while firing once more at the police party. The policemen chased them on foot for nearly 500m and overpowered them after a brief exchange of fire. Two firearms with nine cartridges were seized from them,” said assistant commissioner of police (Patel Nagar) Piyush Jain, adding that Jangra was previously involved in three crimes, including two robberies in Dwarka district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/customer-shot-at-during-robbery-bid-at-tilak-nagar-jewellery-store-cops-chase-and-nab-suspects/story-LiJZQlakybNeCp1sWw1MCI.html

Sushant’s father K K Singh, a retired senior government official, had on July 25 lodged an FIR with the Rajiv Nagar police station in Patna station against Rhea Chakraborty and her family under the various sections of the Indian Penal Code, said IG (central range) Sanjay Kumar Singh. “The FIR names Rhea Chakraborty and her family members, including Indirajeet Chakraborty, Sandhya Chakraborty, Suruti Modi, Souvik and others, under Sections 341, 342, 380, 406, 420, 306 and 120 (B) of the IPC. Sushant’s father has made a very serious allegation against Rhea and her family. He had alleged she had kept Sushant away from his family and completely kept him in her possession. She was also handling his bank account. It was also reported crores of rupees were withdrawn from his bank account.” Sushant was found dead at his Bandra flat in Mumbai on June 14. “The four-member police reached Mumbai Tuesday afternoon and is looking into the case from all angles,” the IG said. The Patna police team will also be looking at the statements of 38 persons, including of Mahesh Bhatt, Karan Johar’s secretary, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, which were recorded before the Mumbai police. A police officer said the SHO of Rajiv Nagar police station, Nishant Singh, has been made the investigation officer of the case. “K K Singh met a senior police officer of Patna and narrated his woes to him. He did not trust the Mumbai police in this regard,” he said. Sushant’s father, in his FIR, has said that on June 8, when Rhea found that bank balance of Sushant was depleting, she decamped with cash, jewellery, laptop, credit card, its pin number and password and important documents and doctor’s receipts. Singh further says in the FIR, “Sushant called his sister and told her that Rhea had threatened him to show the doctor’s receipts before the media and would prove him mad. Thereafter, no person would give him work. On June 8 night, Sushant’ secretary Disha committed suicide. Rhea had appointed her as Sushant’s secretary. Later, Rhea blocked Sushant’s number on her cellphone. Sushant was afraid that Rhea could have made him responsible for his manager’s suicide as she had threatened to frame him in the secretary’s suicide case.” Sushant’s father has expressed his inability to go to Mumbai to fight the case due to his health issues. Therefore, the case was filed in Patna.Rhea Chakraborty had earlier shared a post on social media to request Home Minister Amit Shah to initiate a CBI investigation in Rajput’s death case. The ‘Chehre’ actress addressed Sushant as her boyfriend in her post.Meanwhile, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has said the state government will initiate a CBI probe into Rajput’s case if needed. LJP chief Chirag Paswan had earlier spoken to Thackeray on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sushant-s-father-lodges-fir-patna-police-team-in-mumbai-to-quiz-rhea-others/story-oNZsGip8Vd5DmTUhdYtkaP.html

Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe bleak milestone comes amid signs that the nation’s outbreak is beginning to stabilise in the Sun Belt but heating up in the Midwest, fuelled largely by young adults who are hitting bars, restaurants and gyms again.The Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker put the nation’s confirmed infections at nearly 4.4 million, also the highest in the world.The current surge in the number of people infected and killed by the disease has been accompanied by a burgeoning outbreak of misinformation and conspiracy theories about supposed cures and the effectiveness of masks.People with travel links to China, Iran, and Italy accounted for nearly two-thirds of the initial cases outside mainland China in the pre-pandemic period between December 31, 2019 and March 10 this year, a study published in the medical journal Lancet says.The study says one in four of the first cases originated in Italy, and one in five in China. It also found four large clusters and outbreaks triggered in different countries to be linked with “transmission in faith-based settings”.Scientists have been researching how the coronavirus rapidly spread outside China since March when the World Health Organization declared the disease a pandemic.Meanwhile, the Emmy Awards show, slated for this September, may go virtual due to the pandemic, with celebrities having to appear online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/150-000-fatalities-america-crosses-bleak-milestone/story-1V8sdHEE5EF4XCV9t6y4PK.html

As per reports, Pakistan is planning to hold protests and reach out to several countries against India’s decision to scrap Article 370 that extended special status to Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-indulging-in-activities-to-deflect-attention-from-support-to-terror-india/story-9Rafm5HAQJK7aslGSaho3H.html
30-07-2020||World||Donald Trump kicks up storm with suggestion to delay polls||President Donald Trump kicked up a new storm Thursday with a suggestion to delay November 3 elections until people can vote “properly, securely and safely” in view of the Covid-19 epidemic, which has killed more than 150,000 Americans, including a former presidential candidate Herman Cain.Trump’s suggestion was part of his ongoing opposition to broadening the use of mail-in voting that is being actively discussed to encourage people to cast their votes in the polls. He has alleged it could lead to large-scale fraud, despite the fact he himself and many of his aides have voted by mail in the past.“With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???,” President Trump wrote in one of the many tweets he went out Thursday morning.The push back from critics was instantaneous. “Never in American history—not even during the Civil War and World War II--has there been a successful move to “Delay the Election” for President,” wrote Michael Beschloss, an expert on US presidential history.Ellen L Weintraub, a member of the Federal Election Commission, questioned a president’s authority and power to do change the election date. “No, Mr. President. No. You don’t have the power to move the election. Nor should it be moved. States and localities are asking you and Congress for funds so they can properly run the safe and secure elections all Americans want. Why don’t you work on that?”Republican leaders have also disputed the president and one of them told a reporter elections dates are set in stone.Other critics suggested President Trump’s suggestion was another of his attempts to distract attention from the rising death toll and infections from the Covid-19 epidemic, which is raging through the souther and western parts of the country in a resurgence partly triggered by lapses in mitigation efforts.Herman Cain, a restauranteur who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 (lost it to Mitt Romney), fell to Covid-19 related complications after weeks in hospital.“Herman Cain – our boss, our friend, like a father to so many of us – has passed away,” said an announcement on his website. “We all prayed so hard every day. We knew the time would come when the Lord would call him home, but we really liked having him here with us, and we held out hope he’d have a full recovery.”Dan Calabrese, the writer of that, post confirmed to the Washington Post that Cain had died of Covid-19.Though it was not known where and how he was infected, less than two weeks before his diagnosis, Cain had attended Trump’s election rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where many on the president’s campaign staff had tested positive for the infection.“Herman Cain embodied the American Dream and represented the very best of the American spirit,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany wrote in a tweet. “Our hearts grieve for his loved ones, and they will remain in our prayers at this time. We will never forget his legacy of grace, patriotism, and faith.”By Thursday morning, 150,765 American had been killed by the coronavirus and more than 4.43 million been infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-kicks-up-storm-with-suggestion-to-delay-polls/story-57iWXAEmeV9ZuaYT8un2QN.html
30-07-2020||World||Pompeo tells US senators ‘tide is turning’ against China, cites India’s actions||Secretary of State Michael R Pompeo on Thursday said US efforts to lead an “international awakening” against the Chinese government is working and the “tide is turning” as a result. He went on to cite Indian ban on Chinese apps as a manifestation of it along with the closer interactions of the Quad, and separate actions by other countries.Testifying at a US senate hearing on the 2021 budget for the state department, Pompeo also said he is not yet certain about the shape or form of the “new grouping of like-minded nations — an alliance of democracies” that he recently mooted to confront the global threat from China in a major policy speech from a California library named after President Richard Nixon, whose 1972 visit let to the thaw in US-China relations. Pompeo had then called for a global compact, arguing US policy of “bling engagement” with China had failed.The top US diplomat was pressed repeatedly by both Republican and Democratic senators on China, more than on any other foreign issues, reflecting the urgency felt among American policy makers on the issue.Calling the Chinese Communist Party — US officials insist on treating the Chinese government as an entity separate from the people — “the central threat of our times” as he has before, Pompeo told senators, the “incursion” against India and the “real-estate claim” against Bhutan and other conflicts around the world were indicative of Chinese intentions to expand their reach and to bring “socialism with Chinese characteristics” to the world.“Our vigorous diplomacy has helped lead an international awakening to the threat of the CCP,” he said, adding, “Senators, the tide is turning.”The secretary of state listed some of the global developments, he said, were the result of the American lead on international awakening against China: the growing ostracism of Chinese firms from the rollout of 5G networks, increasing rejection of Chinese claims in the disputed South China Sea, and the condemnation of the new laws in Hong Kong.“We’re proud to have stepped up maritime maneuvers in that body of water (the South China Sea) alongside friends like Australia, India, Japan, and the UK,” Pompeo said in his full and prepared remarks, which were different from the brief summary he read out as his opening statement.He added: “India has banned 106 Chinese apps, including TikTok, that threatened its citizens’ privacy and security.” The secretary of state had earlier indicated the United States had played an “assist” role in the first round of bans of 59 apps, without providing details. The US has since said it was considering a ban on TikTok and other Chinese apps and devices and companies threaten the security of the country.Pompeo said the US, Australia, India, and Japan have “reinvigorated” the “Quad” as part of an effort to confront China through multilateral bodies. He went on to say this “grouping is stronger than it has ever been and maybe we were gifted by General Secretary Xi (Jinping).”“He took actions that caused each of the leaders of those countries to recognize the value of this group,” he added. The secretary of answering a question about India’s invitation to Australia to join the upcoming military exercises with the United States and Japan.The top US diplomat went on to specify the many actions the Trump administration has taken against China in recent months: sanctions against Chinese officials for the mistreatment of Uighur muslims in Xinjiang; imposition of export controls on companies supporting it; termination of trade benefits for Hong Kong and the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston, which, he said, had become a “den of spies”.As further indication of the Trump administration’s intentions for the region, Pompeo said the state department was seeking $1.49 billion for foreign assistance to the Indo-Pacific region, a 20% increase from the FY 2020 request. “We want that part of the world to be free, open, and prosperous,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-tells-us-senators-tide-is-turning-against-china-cites-india-s-actions/story-CySZyPu9gyzNxnoScG1byN.html

30-07-2020||World||1.4 million seek jobless aid as coronavirus keeps forcing layoffs||More than 1.4 million laid-off Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, further evidence of the devastation the coronavirus outbreak has unleashed on the U.S. economy.The continuing wave of job cuts is occurring against the backdrop of a spike in virus cases that has led many states to halt plans to reopen businesses and has caused millions of consumers to delay any return to traveling, shopping and other normal economic activity. Those trends have forced many businesses to cut jobs or at least delay hiring.The Labor Department’s report Thursday marked the 19th straight week that more than 1 million people have applied for unemployment benefits. Before the coronavirus hit hard in March, the number of Americans seeking unemployment checks had never exceeded 700,000 in any one week, even during the Great Recession.The number of new applicants was up by 12,000 from the week before, the second straight increaseAll told, 17 million people are collecting traditional jobless benefits, a sign that unemployment checks are keeping many American families afloat financially at a time of big job losses and agonizing economic uncertainty.The pain could soon intensify: An supplemental $600 in weekly federal unemployment benefits is expiring, and Congress is squabbling about extending the aid, which would probably be done at a reduced level.A resurgence of cases in the South and the West has forced many many bars, restaurants, beauty salons and other businesses to close again or reduce occupancy. Between June 21 and July 19, for example, the percentage of Texas bars that were closed shot up from 25% to 73%; likewise, 75% of California beauty shops were shuttered July 19, up from 40% just a week earlier; according to the data firm Womply.And many states have imposed restrictions on visitors from states that have reported high level of virus cases, thereby hurting hotels, airlines and other industries that depend on travel.The virus and the lockdowns meant to contain it have hammered the American economy: Employers slashed a record 20.8 million jobs in April, restoring about 7.5 million of them in May and June as many states began to reopen their economies.Last week, an additional 830,000 million people applied for jobless aid under a new program that extends eligibility for the first time to self-employed and gig workers. That figure isn’t adjusted for seasonal trends, so it’s reported separately.Altogether, the Labor Department said that 30.2 million people are receiving some form of unemployment benefits, though the figure may be inflated by double-counting by states.Since she was laid off by a tech industry nonprofit May 15, Miranda Meyerson, 38, has been trying to find another job and to sign up for unemployment benefits. ”It’s just incredibly frustrating and demoralizing,’’ she said. Potential employers seem to be delaying hiring decisions. “Nobody gets back to you,’’ she said. “You feel like there’s only so long you can submit (applications) into a void.’’Meyerson and her partner moved from New York to Oakland, California, in March, just as the virus began to spread rapidly across the United States. The move to a new state has complicated her so far futile efforts to collect benefits from a swamped California unemployment benefits system. ”They’re obviously totally overwhelmed,” she said. “You can’t even get on the phone to talk to anybody.’’Allegra Troiano, 64, was stunned when the Milwaukee English language learning center she ran was closed in May. “They got through SARS. They got through the Ebola scare,’’ she said. “Nobody ever thought it would get to the point where we were shutting down.’’The extra $600 in unemployment pay has been a lifeline as she contends with a $2,200 mortgage and $600 in monthly health insurance expenses. “It means surviving,” she said.Laid off from his job as a bank security guard in March, James Adams, 53, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, said that “losing that $600 a week would be devastating. I have been having a hard time sleeping.’’A Trump voter, Adams has a message for Republican senators reluctant to spend more money on unemployment aid: “I know they want to be fiscal hawks, but swallow the bitter pill and help out the people who need this help.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-4-million-seek-jobless-aid-as-coronavirus-keeps-forcing-layoffs/story-BvwR5nsrPgsQ5xFnEllQEO.html

The US embassy in Islamabad said in a statement that the shipment was handed over to Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority as a symbol of “working together to fight Covid-19”. The ventilators, provided through the US Agency for International Development, arrived in Islamabad on July 28 and will be deployed in hospitals across Pakistan, it said. “The arrival of these ventilators delivers on President Donald Trump’s promise to Prime Minister Imran Khan to stand with the people of Pakistan and bring additional critically needed supplies and support to Pakistan’s urgent response to the pandemic,” the embassy said. The first batch of 100 ventilators had arrived on July 3 and have already been delivered to hospitals and healthcare facilities throughout Pakistan. “The United States is a proud partner with the Government of Pakistan to help stem the tide of this deadly pandemic and these ventilators will help with that fight,” US Ambassador to Pakistan Paul W Jones said. The ventilators can also be used to provide non-invasive respiratory therapy for patients before they become critically ill and help avoid the need for more extreme care. They can help treat a number of other respiratory ailments outside of the Covid-19 virus, including pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Through a specialised training programme developed with the National Disaster Management Authority and the Federal and Provincial Ministries of Health, and with funding from USAID, Pakistan will have a stronger arsenal with which to fight Covid-19 and other respiratory illnesses, said the embassy. It said that the US-Pakistan partnership in the health sector was strengthening the country’s ability to fight coronavirus by improving and expanding laboratory testing, disease monitoring, case tracking, infection prevention and control, and patient care. The United States is contributing more than USD 28 million in new funding so far for Covid-19 response to this vital partnership that is growing every day, the embassy said. A ventilator takes over the body’s breathing process when disease has caused the lungs to fail. This gives the patient time to fight off the infection and recover. Pakistan’s coronavirus tally reached 277,402 with the detection of 1,114 new cases, with the nationwide death toll standing at 5,924, the Ministry of National Health Services said on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-donates-100-ventilators-to-pakistan-to-combat-covid-19-pandemic/story-XOyDInYcj4yY5Slhb4CykN.html
30-07-2020||World||Oxford vaccine shows protection against Covid-19 in monkeys: Study||A Covid-19 vaccine candidate developed by the University of Oxford in the UK elicits an immune response and reduces the viral load in monkeys exposed to SARS-CoV-2 virus, according to a study published in the journal Nature on Thursday. The researchers from National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the US and the Oxford University found that the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine protects the macaques from Covid-19 pneumonia -- a complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection in which the lungs become inflamed and may fill with fluid. Preliminary results from this research were used to facilitate the start of clinical trials of the vaccine in humans, the researchers noted. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is made from a weakened chimpanzee adenovirus -- a group of viruses that can cause a range of illnesses, including the common cold -- that expresses the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a structure that enables the coronavirus to enter human cells. The researchers show that a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, given to six macaques 28 days before exposure to SARS-CoV-2, is effective in preventing damage to lungs and drastically reduces the viral load, when compared with six control animals. A further six macaques were given a booster course of two doses of the vaccine, at 56 and 28 days before challenge, which increased the immune response, the team found. The vaccinated animals showed no evidence of immune-enhanced inflammatory disease, which has been observed in some preclinical studies of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, according to the researchers. They noted that there was no difference in viral shedding from the nose between vaccinated and control animals. This finding indicates that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 may not prevent infection or transmission, but may reduce illness, the researchers noted. The study has led to clinical trials of the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine, which have enrolled more than 8,000 volunteers as of the beginning of July 2020, they said. Another study on 52 adult rhesus macaques published in the journal Nature on Thursday found that a single dose of a vaccine made from an adenovirus, a group of viruses that are linked to illnesses such as the mild cold, protected the animals against SARS-CoV-2. The optimal version of the vaccine is currently being evaluated in clinical trials, said the researchers of this study from Harvard Medical School in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-vaccine-shows-protection-against-covid-19-in-monkeys-study/story-BxPWAZQVJYh63j2WDkOM5J.html

The Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan have overlapping claims.The US wants to portray itself as “referee” over the SCS issue but is actually the one that disturbs regional peace, destroys regional cooperation and sows discord among regional countries, Ren said, in response to a US State Department release that accused China of causing instability in the region by conducting military drills in the Xisha Islands. The US according to a Chinese academic has conducted six Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) so far this year, compared with four times in 2017, six times in 2018 and eight times in 2019.In addition, the U.S. military has conducted nearly 2,000 close-in reconnaissance operations on China from the air this year.”According to the think tank, US air force E-8C surveillance planes have come within 185km or less of the southeast coast of Guangdong province on four separate occasions in the past week.Last Sunday, an US anti-submarine warplane came within 100 km from Shanghai in eastern China, the closest that an American fighter aircraft has come close to the Chinese east coast shoreline in recent years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-pla-exercises-in-tibet-over-south-china-sea-sends-message-to-india-the-us/story-Kumxspy9Amfd0lIrX7xDdL.html

It is the same with this vaccine. Russia will have got there first,” he added.The CNN reported that Russia is planning for approval of the vaccine by August 10, which has been created by the Moscow-based Gamaleya Institute.It will be approved for public use, with frontline healthcare workers getting it first, Russia reportedly said.As per reports, the Russian vaccine is yet to complete its second phase while some vaccines being researched worldwide are already in the third phase of trials.The Russian Defense Ministry has reportedly said that the soldiers have participated in volunteering in the human trials.Alexander Ginsburg, the director of the project, was quoted as saying that he has already injected himself with the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-plans-to-approve-world-s-first-covid-19-vaccine-by-august-10-report/story-xz0IpJ3l0EuDeUcsRYcXSP.html
30-07-2020||World||China, India got lot richer but refused to take on any more responsibilities: Top US Senator||Countries like China and India have got a lot richer over the last two decades but they have refused to take on any more responsibilities, a top US Senator has claimed, as he applauded President Donald Trump for taking on this “imbalance” to make the World Trade Organization (WTO) relevant.Senator Chuck Grassley, Chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, made the comments during a Congressional hearing on WTO on Wednesday.“No one expected the Uruguay Round to be the last global trading round. Over the last two decades, countries like China and India got a lot richer, but they’ve refused to take on any more responsibilities,” he claimed.“In fact, they claim they are entitled to special treatment in any future negotiations because they are developing countries,” he said.The Senator said that the notion that China and India should get the same consideration as a country like Cameroon is ridiculous. “So I applaud the President for taking on this imbalance, and pushing to make the WTO relevant.” As part of reforms at the WTO, the US wants formulation of some guidelines that countries with high economic growth are prevented from taking benefits of special and differential treatment (S&DT), which is meant for developing and poor nations.The S&DT allows developing countries to enjoy certain benefits including taking longer time periods for implementing agreements and binding commitments, and measures to increase trading opportunities for them. Currently, any WTO member can designate itself as a developing country and avail these benefits.The US has submitted its suggestions to the WTO which states that self-declaration puts the WTO on a path to failed negotiations and it is also a path to institutional irrelevance.India is of the view that the matter needs to be negotiated comprehensively in the WTO and a consensus-based decision needs to be taken on S&DT. The country has also maintained that this is an essential principle of the WTO and the WTO reform process should not dilute this principle.Trump last year asked the WTO to define how it designates developing-country status, a move that was apparently aimed at singling out countries like China, Turkey and India which are getting lenient treatment under global trade rules.In a memorandum, Trump empowered the US Trade Representative (USTR) to start taking punitive actions if any country, advanced economies, are inappropriately taking benefits of the WTO loopholes.“The WTO is now 25 years old, but we have yet to see any major outcomes liberalising trade. The President has said we need dramatic change at the WTO. He’s emphasised to me that other countries’ tariffs and barriers are too high. He’s right,” Grassley said.Observing that when the WTO works right, Americans benefit, he said WTO rules allow the US to reap the rewards of that leadership.“When India refused to provide patent protection for American pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical products, we took them to the WTO - and won. You often hear about how important the ‘global box office’ is for Hollywood. It’s become lucrative because the WTO requires our trading partners to provide copyright protection and market access for US films,” he said.Grassley said that the WTO needs to be an effective forum for negotiating agreements again. That means not only concluding the fisheries negotiations, but also new agreements, including an ambitious agreement on e-commerce.When Congress ratified the WTO Agreements, there was no digital economy. Today, it accounts for nearly USD 2 trillion of the US economy. Again, this is an area of US leadership where we need rules to make sure we get a fair share from its trading partners, he added.“Second, we have to fix dispute settlement. I absolutely believe that we need enforceable rules. It’s much better to solve our trade disputes over legal briefs than through tariffs,” he said.“However, WTO dispute settlement has been breaking down for years. Fifteen years ago, I warned at a hearing like this one that the WTO Appellate Body wasn’t enforcing rules; it was legislating new ones. I don’t like that history proved me right,” he added.Calling for WTO reforms, Ranking Member Senator Ron Wyden said that the rules that underpin the WTO were crafted more than two decades ago, when China was an economic middleweight.At that time, many hoped and predicted that joining the WTO would drive China further away from abusive, one-party control of government, economy and society. That obviously did not happen, he said.“Under (Chinese) President Xi (Jinping), the government tightened its grip on power. The Chinese government identifies weaknesses in the WTO system, and other multilateral fora, and it seizes on them to further its own self interests.“Fixing the WTO is also going to require addressing its Appellate Body, which hampers the application of US trade enforcement laws to the detriment of American workers. There is a broad bipartisan view that WTO Dispute Settlement must be fixed to clamp down on judicial overreach,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-india-got-lot-richer-but-refused-to-take-on-any-more-responsibilities-top-us-senator/story-bwEUCAu05CBfiIpoPpNmCN.html
30-07-2020||World||Donald Trump says India, China and Russia don’t take care of their air||US President Donald Trump has alleged that India, China and Russia do not take care of their air, while America does, noting that he withdrew from the “one-sided, energy-destroying” Paris climate accord which would have made it a “non-competitive nation”. Trump, in his address on energy and the Permian Basin in Midland, Texas on Wednesday, said that by imposing these punishing restrictions -- and beyond restrictions – “the Washington radical-left, crazy Democrats” would also send countless American jobs, factories, industries to China and to other foreign polluting states. “They want us to take care of our air, but China doesn’t take care of its air. In all fairness, India doesn’t take care of its air. Russia doesn’t take care of its air. But we do. Not on my watch, it’s not going to happen -- I can tell you that. Because as long as I’m President, we will always put America first. It’s very simple,” he said. “For years and years, we put other countries first, and we now put America first. As we have seen in cities and towns across our nation, it’s not just Texas oil that the radical Democrats want to destroy; they want to destroy our country,” he said. Such radical Democrats, he alleged, do not love the country in any way, shape or form. “There’s no respect for the American way of life. There is no way of life ever in history that’s been like the great American way of life. There is no respect, but there is by you, and there is by 95 per cent of our people. Our people love our country, and our people love our anthem and they love our flag,” he said. Trump said that under the last administration, America’s energy industry was under relentless and unceasing attack. “But the day I took the oath of office, we ended the war on American energy and we stopped the far-left assault on American energy workers,” he said. Observing that he withdrew from the one-sided, energy-destroying Paris climate accord, he said this was a disaster and cost the US billions of dollars. The US in November last year formally notified the UN of its withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, a global agreement in which President Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama had played a key role. Although Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the historic pact on June 1, 2017, the process began last year with the formal notification and the US will be out of the pact on November 4, 2020. “It (Paris climate accord) would have made us a non-competitive nation. We cancelled the Obama administration’s job-crushing clean power plan,” he said as he listed some of the steps being taken by his administration. “For the first time in nearly 70 years, we have become a net energy exporter. And the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on the face of the Earth. To ensure we maintain this dominant position long into the future, my administration is announcing today that export authorisations for American liquefied natural gas can now be extended through the year 2050,” Trump added. India is the fourth highest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, accounting for 7 per cent of global emissions in 2017, according to the projection by the Global Carbon Project published in December, 2018. The top four emitters in 2017, which covered 58 per cent of global emissions, were China (27 per cent), the US (15 per cent), the European Union (10 per cent) and India (7 per cent), it said. In January 2019, the Indian government launched the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) to combat the rising level of air pollution. The NCAP, a five-year action plan, focuses on 102 polluted Indian cities and aims to reduce PM2.5 levels by 20-30 per cent over the next five years. It also aims to build a pan-India air quality monitoring network and improve citizen awareness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-india-china-and-russia-don-t-take-care-of-their-air/story-TGR4WdMIOUUPvOl1kscR4N.html
30-07-2020||World||UK worried about second wave of coronavirus in Europe, more quarantine measures possible||The British authorities are worried about a second wave of coronavirus infections in Europe and will not hesitate to bring back more quarantine measures, possibly within the next few days, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Thursday.Britain last week re-imposed a 14-day quarantine period on people arriving from Spain, a move that caused havoc to plans to reopen the continent for tourism in the summer high season.Hancock stopped short of naming other European countries that might also end up back on the UK quarantine list, but cited France as an example of one where infections have lately risen.“I am worried about a second wave. I think you can see a second wave starting to roll across Europe, and we’ve got to do everything we can to prevent it from reaching these shores, and to tackle it,” Hancock said during an interview on Sky News.“We have significant concerns about the second wave that is coming across Europe. And it’s not just Spain ... but there are other countries too where the number of cases is rising. And we are absolutely determined to do everything that we can to keep this country safe,” he said.When asked whether Britons should be prepared for more measures to be announced within the next few days, he said yes.“The number of cases have gone up sharply in some countries in Europe ... France now has more cases than we do, per day, and in Spain we saw the numbers shoot up which is why we had to take the rapid action that we did,” he said on Talk Radio.France reported almost 1,400 new cases on Wednesday, the highest daily increase in more than a month.Hancock said the British authorities were working on possible ways to shorten the quarantine period for people coming from Spain, but no change was imminent.“We are working on whether by testing people during that quarantine it is safe to then be able to release them earlier ... But we are not imminently making an announcement on it,” he said in a BBC television interview.He said that in Britain, the number of cases had stopped falling and was at best flat, which was a result of increased social contact as lockdown measures have gradually been eased. He urged people to keep following social distancing guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-worried-about-second-wave-of-coronavirus-in-europe-more-quarantine-measures-possible/story-xhz0FdfMbm3maloez3tlWK.html
30-07-2020||World||Scientists map how coronavirus spreads indoor via aerosol||Scientists have simulated how the novel coronavirus spreads indoors via aerosols as infected people speak or exhale, and have found the features of good ventilation that can filter virus particles out of the air, information that may help businesses and schools reduce Covid-19 transmission when they reopen. The researchers, including Jiarong Hong from the University of Minnesota in the US, modelled indoor airborne virus transmission via aerosols, which are tiny droplets ejected from people’s mouths when they exhale, speak, or cough. According to the yet-to-be peer reviewed study, published in the preprint server arXiv, when an infected person does this, the virus particles hitch a ride on the aerosols as they land on nearby surfaces, or are inhaled by another person. Using precise experimental measurements of aerosols released by eight asymptomatic individuals with Covid-19, the scientists numerically modelled the external flow of the virus through the air in three interior spaces -- an elevator, a classroom, and a supermarket. They then compared the virus transmission among different levels of ventilation, and with different spacing among the rooms’ occupants. “This is the first quantitative risk assessment of the spatial variation of risks in indoor environments. You see a lot of people talking about what the risks are of staying in confined spaces, but nobody gives a quantitative number,” Hong said. “I think the major contribution we’ve made is combining very accurate measurements and computational fluid dynamics simulation to provide a very quantitative estimate of the risks,” he added. Based on their experiments, the researchers found that in indoor spaces, good ventilation will filter some of the virus out of the air, but may leave more viral particles on surfaces. “Our results show that the design of ventilation is critical for reducing risk of particle encounters. Inappropriate design can significantly limit the efficiency of particle removal, create local hot spots with orders of magnitude higher risks, and enhance particle deposition causing surface contamination,” they wrote in the study. In the classroom setting, after running a 50-minute simulation with an asymptomatic teacher consistently talking, only 10 per cent of the aerosols were filtered out, the scientists said. The majority of the particles were instead deposited on the walls, they added. “Because this is very strong ventilation, we thought it would ventilate out a lot of aerosols. But 10 per cent is really a small number,” said Suo Yang, another co-author of the study. “The ventilation forms several circulation zones called vortexes, and the aerosols keep rotating in this vortex. When they collide with the wall, they attach to the wall,” Yang explained. However, the mechanical engineer said it’s very hard for the aerosols to reach the vent and actually go out since “they are basically trapped in this vortex.” In each scenario, the scientists mapped the air flow to find locations of virus “hot spots” in the indoor environment, or where the aerosols congregated. With the right combination of ventilation and interior organisation, they said it could be possible to mitigate the disease spread and avoid these hot zones. Citing the example of a classroom setting, the scientists said the virus aerosols spread significantly less throughout the room when the teacher, who is likely doing the most talking, was placed directly under an air vent. The researchers believe the findings could inform how classrooms are arranged and disinfected, and also help places like movie theatres and concert venues reopen with the proper precautions. “If you do a good job, if you have good ventilation at the right location, and if you scatter the seating of the audience properly, it could be much safer,” Yang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-map-how-coronavirus-spreads-indoor-via-aerosol/story-XwL7WD7oKYD9LEpxbAJ61L.html
30-07-2020||World||US, Australia reaffirm commitment to Quad consultations with Japan, India||The US and Australia have reaffirmed their commitment to Quad consultations with India and Japan, stressing that they are working side-by-side with other partners to maintain a secure, prosperous and rules-based Indo-Pacific, amidst China flexing its muscles in the region.The top ministers from the two countries on Tuesday reaffirmed that the Indo-Pacific is the focus of the alliance and that the US and Australia are working side-by-side, including with ASEAN, India, Japan, South Korea, and Five Eyes partners, to strengthen their networked structure of alliances and partnerships to maintain a region that is secure, prosperous, inclusive and rules-based.Quad or quadrilateral coalition represents four countries - India, Japan, Australia and the US. It was set up with an aim to ensure peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific and check China’s increasing efforts to expand military influence in the region.“I’m confident that our partners all across Europe and, frankly, democratic friends all across the world, whether that’s in India or Japan or South Korea - our Australian partners are here today - understand that the challenge of our times is to make sure that those nations that do value freedom and do want economic prosperity based on the rule of law will join together to deliver that for our people,” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a joint news conference.Pompeo was accompanied by US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne and Australian Defence Minister Linda Reynolds.The leaders committed to continue to work together with Indo-Pacific partner countries to mitigate any impacts of Covid-19 on exacerbating the regional terrorist threat and to support regional counter-terrorism partner countries in addressing these threats, including any potential movement of foreign terrorist fighters within the region.Pompeo commended Australia for publicly condemning China’s disinformation campaign and insisting on an independent review into the origin of the coronavirus.Pompeo said he talked at length at the meeting about the Chinese Communist Party’s malign activity in the Indo-Pacific region, and indeed all around the world.“The United States commends the (Scott) Morrison government for standing up for democratic values and the rule of law, despite intense, continued, coercive pressure from the Chinese Communist Party to bow to Beijing’s wishes,” Pompeo said.“It is unacceptable for Beijing to use exports or student fees as a cudgel against Australia. We stand with our Australian friends,” he said.In a joint statement issued after the Australia-US Ministerial Consultations, the two countries affirmed that China cannot assert maritime claims in the South China Sea based on the “nine-dash line,” “historic rights,” or entire South China Sea island groups, which are incompatible with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).China claims almost all of the South China Sea as its sovereign territory. It has been building military bases on artificial islands in the region also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.“They noted that the 2016 Arbitral Award is final and binding on both parties and emphasised that all claims in the South China Sea must be made and resolved in accordance with international law. They also expressed their support for the rights of claimants to lawfully exploit offshore resources, including in relation to long-standing oil and gas projects as well as fisheries in the South China Sea, free from harassment and coercion,” the statement said.“They welcomed the recent ASEAN Leaders statement that a South China Sea Code of Conduct should be consistent with UNCLOS, and emphasised that any Code should not prejudice the rights or interests of States under international law or undermine existing regional architecture, and should strengthen the commitment of parties not to engage in actions that complicate or escalate disputes, notably militarisation of disputed features,” the statement said.Payne said Australia and the US are deeply committed to strengthening health security efforts in the Indo-Pacific to help states combat Covid-19 and to prevent the emergence of future pandemics.“The rules-based global order is a constant, notwithstanding or perhaps even more so given the impact of the pandemic. We reiterate our commitment to holding states to account when they breach international norms and laws, as we have done and will continue to do so in relation to China’s erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong,” he said.“Together we share a common vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific where all nations, big and small, can enjoy the benefits of sovereignty; where free, fair, and reciprocal trade are the norm; where states adhere to international rules and norms; and where international disputes are resolved peacefully,” Esper said.During the meeting, they discussed a range of issues regarding the future of the region, including the impact of the global pandemic as well as the security situation in the South China Sea specifically and the Indo-Pacific more generally, the statement said.“We appreciate Australia’s significant contributions to Covid-19 response efforts, and we spoke in detail about the Chinese Communist Party’s destabilising activities and the fact that Beijing is increasingly resorting to coercion and intimidation to advance its strategic objectives at the expense of other nations,” Esper said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-australia-reaffirm-commitment-to-quad-consultations-with-japan-india/story-qb2tpqGJagQ4d6v3nDhdKO.html

Tahir Ahmad Naseem, from the minority Ahmadi community, was shot dead in a courtroom in Peshawar on Wednesday. He was on trial for blasphemy for allegedly claiming to be a prophet.“Condolences to family of Tahir Naseem, an American citizen who was killed today inside a courtroom in Pakistan. We urge Pak to take immediate action and pursue reforms that will prevent such a shameful tragedy from happening again,” tweeted Bureau of South & Central Asian Affairs, US State Department.Naseem, who was arrested in 2018, was accused of having violated Pakistan’s blasphemy laws that carry the death penalty for certain offences. He was shot in the courtroom by the person who had filed charges against him.In a related development, a member of Sindh assembly from the ruling PTI party has changed his DP on his social media page to display a picture of the murderer to pay tribute for his action. Ahmadis, a four million-strong minority group in Pakistan, have faced death, threats, intimidation and a sustained hate campaign for decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pursue-reforms-us-to-pak-after-man-killed-in-court-during-blasphemy-trial/story-s82PW4O7nPb2WLH12glqiL.html
30-07-2020||World||A new nuclear model could upend how countries count bombs||Nuclear analysts from the US and Russia settled on a new method to account for atomic weapons that may shrink estimates on the size of North Korea’s arsenal and could be used to aid future disarmament.Accounting for nuclear material stockpiled by countries is at the heart of the global arms-control system and plays a central role in verifying disarmament agreements. Publication of the new model in a forthcoming edition of Janes Intelligence Review comes as diplomats from the two countries with the biggest nuclear stockpiles convene in Vienna to discuss an extension of a treaty to limit the number of deployed weapons.“You cannot agree to get rid of something unless you know how many there are,” said Robert Kelley, a former nuclear-weapons engineer at the Department of Energy, who helped create the new accounting method with Vitaly Fedchenko, a Russian nuclear physicist who works at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.While figuring out the number of warheads in the arsenals of nuclear states has long been the focus of intelligence and military-planning officials, it’s also increasingly become an important number for researchers and diplomats promoting new approaches to eliminating atomic weapons.“Accounting for weapons-fissile material is one important piece of the puzzle,” said Alicia Sanders-Zakre, who coordinates research around the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. That document is gaining traction, requiring ratification from only 10 more countries for it to come into force.“This sets up an international framework for the elimination of nuclear weapons and technical research on weapons material accounting helps fill out that framework,” said Sanders-Zakre from the Geneva-based headquarters of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, which won the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize.The new model challenges public nuclear stockpile figures that “generally estimate the size and proliferant stockpiles by using simple models, largely ignoring thermonuclear stages and competing demands for nuclear materials and tritium,” wrote Kelley and Fedchenko in their paper, which was reviewed by U.K. defense and security officials to ensure classified information wasn’t divulged.Using North Korea as a case study, the researchers deconstructed the plutonium and highly-enriched uranium requirements for a two-stage thermonuclear weapon, which differ dramatically from simple single-stage devices modeled in most current studies. Countries with thermonuclear devices -- the likes of which Kim Jong Un is now widely suspected to possess -- have greater challenges when it comes to managing the material demands of plutonium, uranium and tritium in their weapons, according to the authors.The new model may prompt security experts to reassess their figures.“Janes concludes that North Korea’s nuclear arsenal is most likely to be in the range of 10-20 weapons if Pyongyang committed its highly-enriched uranium to thermonuclear weapons production,” the article said, which will appear in the IHS Markit Ltd. publication this week. That figure is at least two-thirds lower than the 60 nuclear-warhead estimate formulated by the Defense Intelligence Agency and published July 14 by the Congressional Research Service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-new-nuclear-model-could-upend-how-countries-count-bombs/story-i9pHohvE25gWEqLbVEzqhN.html
30-07-2020||World||Lord Ram’s images to be displayed in Times Square on Ram Temple groundbreaking day||Images of Lord Ram and 3D portraits of the grand Ram Temple in Ayodhya will be beamed across the giant billboards in the iconic Times Square here on August 5 to celebrate the temple’s groundbreaking ceremony, with organisers describing the commemoration as a one-of-a-kind and historic event. Prominent community leader and President of the American India Public Affairs Committee Jagdish Sewhani on Wednesday said that arrangements are being made to celebrate the historic moment in New York on August 5, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to lay the foundation stone for construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Sewhani told PTI that among the prominent billboards that are being leased for the occasion are the giant Nasdaq screen and the 17,000-square-foot wrap-around LED display screen, considered among the largest continuous exterior displays in the world and the highest-resolution exterior LED screen in Times Square. Beginning from 8 AM on August 5 till 10 PM, images of the words ‘Jai Shri Ram’ in Hindi and English, Lord Ram’s portraits and videos, 3D portraits of the temple’s design and architecture as well as pictures of the laying of the foundation stone by Modi will be displayed across several billboards, which are among the most striking and popular features of Times Square, one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. Sewhani said that members of the Indian community will also gather at Times Square on August 5 to mark the celebration and distribute sweets. “This is not a once in a lifetime or a once in a century event. This is an event that comes once in the life of mankind. We had to give it a befitting celebration and what better place than the iconic Times Square to commemorate the ‘Ram Janma Bhoomi shilanyas’ (groundbreaking ceremony). “Under Prime Minister Modi, the construction of the Ram Temple is a dream come true for Hindus all over the world. Till six years back, we never thought that this day will come soon but due to Modi’s leadership, this day has come and we want to celebrate it in a befitting way,” he said, adding that on August 5, images of Lord Ram will flood Times Square. Sewhani said that the Times Square commemoration is being made possible with the help and support of the community and sponsors. Prime Minister Modi had announced the formation of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust in February. The Trust has invited Modi to lay the foundation stone of the grand Ram Temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lord-ram-s-images-to-be-displayed-in-times-square-on-ram-temple-groundbreaking-day/story-EseELoxhtNSB0tRsAIZnzJ.html
30-07-2020||World||‘Pre-pandemic Covid-19 cases linked to China, Italy, Iran’: Report||People with travel links to China, Iran, and Italy accounted for nearly two-thirds of initial Covid-19 cases outside mainland China in the pre-pandemic period between December 31 and March 10, a new study in the medical journal Lancet says.The study is the first of its kind to use publicly available global case data to describe travel exposure and case cluster characteristics among early Covid-19 cases in different countries, revealing where the first cases of Covid-19 outside China may have originated based on case travel histories. The study also found four large clusters and outbreaks triggered in different countries to be linked with “transmission in faith-based settings”.The novel coronavirus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei province late last year before spreading within China and then triggering the worst global pandemic in recent histories. Scientists have been researching how the virus rapidly spread outside China March onwards when the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared it a pandemic.Also read: China logs another 105 Covid-19 cases in new surge, silent about virus link in XinjiangThe new study published on Wednesday in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal compiled publicly available information from the pre-pandemic period until March 10, the day before when the WHO declared it a pandemic.“Of the first confirmed Covid-19 case in each affected country outside mainland China, almost two-thirds had travel links to Italy, China, or Iran. Study suggests 1 in 4 of these first cases originated in Italy, and 1 in 5 in China,” the researchers found.The study said that many small clusters of household transmission were reported among early cases but clusters in occupational and community settings tended to be larger—supporting the role of physical distancing to slow the spread of Covid-19. The researchers went through available data from 99 countries including India.As much as three-quarters or 75 countries outside mainland reported the first Covid-19 case in people who had “…recently travelled to an affected country—with almost two-thirds of these first cases linked to travel to Italy (27%), China (22%), or Iran (11%),” according to the new research. Incidentally, in January, the first two confirmed cases of Covid-19 – then only known as an unidentified strain of coronavirus – were reported in South Korea and Thailand, both with travel history to Wuhan in central China.In India, the first three Covid-19 cases were diagnosed in three students who had returned from Wuhan in the first evacuation flight launched by New Delhi.“Our findings suggest that travel from just a few countries with substantial SARS-CoV-2 transmission may have seeded additional outbreaks around the world before the characterisation of Covid-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020,” says Dr Fatimah Dawood from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC), who co-led the research.“In this study, researchers examined publicly available online reports from national ministries of health and other government agency websites, social media feeds, and press releases on a daily basis to identify newly confirmed cases of Covid-19 reported between December 31, 2019, and March 10, 2020 (ie, during the pre-pandemic period, corresponding to weeks 1-11 of the outbreak).”During the first 11 weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak, 32,459 Covid-19 cases were identified from 99 countries and locations outside mainland China.“Travel to Italy was linked with half (3/6 cases) of the first-reported cases in Africa, and over a third (36%, 16/45) in Europe and the Americas (38%, 5/13). Travel to mainland China accounted for 83% (10/12) of the first reported cases in the Western Pacific and over half (57%, 4/7) in Southeast Asia.”Seven or 44% of the first reported cases in the Eastern Mediterranean region had a history of travel to Iran. Analysing the data, the researchers found that household transmission was reported in three-quarters (76/101) of clusters, with an average of 2.6 cases in each cluster.“By contrast, the 11 clusters related to community gatherings (ie, tour groups, faith-based groups, and dinner parties; average 14.2 cases per cluster), and the 14 clusters reported in non-health-care occupational settings (average 4.3 cases per cluster), tended to be larger—supporting a possible role for physical distancing in slowing the spread of Covid-19,” researchers said.One of the authors suggested the importance of coordinating with religious groups in preventing cluster infections.“Four large clusters in our analysis, and large outbreaks reported elsewhere, have been linked with the transmission in faith-based settings, highlighting the need to partner with faith-based organisations when designing and implementing community mitigation efforts,” said co-author Dr Philip Ricks from the US CDC.Limitations of the study include the fact that the first confirmed case in each country might not have been the first true case of infection in some countries, since early case detection efforts varied substantially.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pre-pandemic-covid-19-cases-linked-to-china-italy-iran-report/story-NFg1TGfFNSgLZT4mUEpvsI.html

30-07-2020||World||China logs another 105 Covid-19 cases in new surge, silent about virus link in Xinjiang||China logged 105 new Covid-19 cases, 102 of them locally transmitted, for July 29, up from 101 cases for Tuesday and marking more than 100 cases for two consecutive days for the first time in months.Of the new infections, the national health commission (NHC) said, 96 were from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) in the northwest and five from the northeastern province of Liaoning, two of the new hotspots for fresh Covid-19 cases in China.One case was reported from Beijing, which has now recorded cases for three consecutive days, after not logging any for nearly three weeks.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The new outbreak in Dalian, the capital of Liaoning province, has been linked to a seafood company, health authorities have said.The NHC, however, is yet to reveal the source of the new Covid-19 cluster in Xinjiang, which has been under heavy surveillance – and strict censorship of information – because of tension between ethnic Muslim minorities and central authorities. Most cases in XUAR, which now has 418, have been detected in the provincial capital, Urumqi, where widespread nucleic acid testing has been ordered and some residential communities isolated.In the northeastern city of Dalian, a 58-year-old man working with a local seafood company was the first to be diagnosed with Covid-19 in the latest outbreak.The city has now logged 57 locally transmitted cases most of whom were either employees of Dalian Kaiyan World Seafood company or their family members, state media reported.So far, cases related to Dalian have been found in other cities of Liaoning, and in other provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Fujian, as well as in Beijing.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage All the 344 people working at the company have been quarantined.“A total of 17,595 medics have been mobilised to conduct nucleic acid tests at 2,698 testing sites across the city, with nearly 3.53 million samples collected by midnight Tuesday,” Zhao Lian, deputy director of the municipal health commission, told state media.Meanwhile, one of China’s top epidemiologist has said the Covid-19 outbreaks in the central Chinese city of Wuhan – where the coronavirus first emerged in late 2019 -- Beijing and Dalian share certain similarities “…as they all took place in the cold contaminated environment of seafood markets, and the virus may have infected people through aerosols.”In an interview with Chinese media on Wednesday, Wu Zunyou, the chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said their humid and low-temperature environment is more conducive for the coronavirus to survive. Wu told Chinese media that an experiment carried out in Beijing’s Xinfadi market, which was linked to the June outbreak in the capital, in which a fluorescent powder was used to simulate the virus, showed that if the environment was contaminated, the virus could infect people through aerosols. Workers could then pollute the environment after becoming infected, forming a mixed transmission mode, Wu added.The Chinese media reports did not mention if Wu shed any light on the source of the new outbreak in Xinjiang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-logs-another-105-covid-19-cases-in-new-surge-silent-about-virus-link-in-xinjiang/story-urh9MMWvnq1rO9cR8thmiP.html
30-07-2020||World||Pandemic advice ignored by Trump helps Vietnam fight virus||Vietnam beat back its first wave of coronavirus infections by embracing US-supported pandemic strategies that the Trump administration largely ignored.Now the Southeast Asian country is using the plan to combat its first cases in more than three months, seeking to keep its record as one of the few places in the world that hasn’t reported a single Covid-19 death as of this week.Even before Vietnam confirmed its first cases in late January, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc ordered officials to break out the blueprint developed in 2014 during a global health security project, funded in part by US-AID and created with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other organizations. Strict adherence to the plan allowed the country to claim victory over the virus this spring, stamping out clusters.Faced with a resurgence that has similarly confounded Japan, Hong Kong and Australia, Vietnamese authorities are moving to contain a fresh cluster that has led to 36 new cases in the past week, for a total of 459 cases as of Thursday morning. Officials imposed strict quarantines on thousands of people who may have been exposed in the coastal city of Danang, reimposed stay-at-home measures and tightened border and immigration controls to prevent illegal entry. The government is now warning the virus could spread to other regions, including Ho Chi Minh City and the capital of Hanoi, where officials are suspending large gatherings such as religious activities and ordering bars to close.“The CDC has been working with us and helped us build up a plan that put in place steps to fight against pandemics,” said Tran Dac Phu, senior adviser at the Public Health Emergency Operations Center under the nation’s Ministry of Health. “The government is now very concerned about a second wave. We continue to work with the CDC and World Health Organization on this.”Key to the government’s success so far has been its ability to move quickly to test patients, isolate those who are sick, aggressively trace contacts and quarantine for 14 days those who come in contact with positive cases. It’s also been essential to have consistent and transparent communication with the public, said Dr. Matthew Moore, director of the CDC’s Global Health Security Program in Vietnam.The agency, which has been in Vietnam for 20 years and has a staff of 58 in the country including eight Americans, works with the government on testing protocols, guidelines to prevent transmission in health-care settings and training in epidemiology.“Time and time again they have shut down chains of transmission,” he said.Laser-Like FocusVietnam, a country whose 96 million citizens had a gross domestic product per capita of $2,715 last year, has been able to control the outbreak because of the government’s laser-like anti-virus focus, a one-party political system and a population that didn’t need convincing as a result of past disease outbreaks. The U.S., with a gross domestic product per capita of $65,280 in 2019, has not.Vietnam’s success has been globally lauded. The U.S., meanwhile, has surpassed 4.3 million cases and 149,000 deaths while President Donald Trump has consistently downplayed the spread of the virus. Rather than following the advice of the experts, in July he retweeted a post claiming the CDC was lying about the virus.There have been dramatic differences between how Vietnam and U.S. approached the contagion crisis. Within weeks of Vietnam’s first reported cases in late January, the government closed schools. The Trump administration continues to resist school shutdowns, and has even threatened to withhold federal funding from schools that don’t bring back students.Hanoi quickly deploys tests to anyone suspected of exposure to the virus, while the U.S. continues to face testing shortcomings. Danang’s authorities shut down two hospitals where two victims visited and ordered patients, medical staff, caregivers and family members -- about 8,800 people in total -- to be quarantined for 14 days at centralized bases, hospitals and homes, according to the city’s health department. A third hospital also was closed.Vietnam has some key advantages the U.S. doesn’t in combating the virus. The Communist Party-controlled government dominates a society with a culture of collectivism, and its tough measures, like willingness to put in place lockdowns when needed, has been met with little resistance from the population.This comes despite the fact that its quarantine regime is uncompromising and one of the strictest in the region. The government has placed Vietnamese and even foreigners seen at high risk of infection into isolation, sometimes at remote military camps.Still, an edge Vietnam has over the U.S. is the consistent message it has sent to the public about combating the virus, said Dr. Todd Pollack, an infectious disease specialist with the Harvard Medical School Partnership for Health Advancement in Vietnam.The government’s communications campaign includes posters in residential and office complexes, text messages, an app to help Vietnamese trace cases near them, regular updates on the Ministry of Health’s website and even a pop song encouraging hand-washing and social distancing.Past EpidemicsHelping the country fight the virus has been the memory of past epidemics. The SARS outbreak in 2003 during killed five people in Vietnam and the bird flu led to 52 deaths in repeated outbreaks between 2004 and 2008. The country is also currently coping with a diphtheria outbreak that has caused three deaths, leading the government to isolate 700 people in a village in the coffee-growing Central Highlands province of Dak Lak.Vietnam’s aggressive anti-virus measures have come at a cost: Almost 31 million workers have experienced job losses or pay cuts amid the restrictions. Vietnam’s economy could grow 3% to 4% this year -- half the official target of 6.8%, according to a government advisory council.Meanwhile, the government is getting pushback from some overseas-based companies as it strives to maintain its second-wave vigilance. Companies from South Korea, Vietnam’s second-largest foreign investor, are pressuring the government to lift mandatory two-week quarantines of their workers traveling to Vietnam, local media outlet VnExpress reported.Yet the country’s decisive actions may have burnished its reputation among companies seeking to diversify supply chains away from China. Some Japanese companies, with financial incentives from their government, are looking to relocate operations to Vietnam. Taiwanese company Inventec Corp., Apple Inc.’s assembly partner for AirPods, is preparing to establish a unit in Vietnam and other suppliers of the Cupertino, California-based company may follow.Now the government’s all-hands-on-deck counterattack is kicking in again. “We are improving our quarantine facilities to be able to isolate more people when needed,” the Ministry of Health’s Phu said.(Updates with more virus cases in the fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-advice-ignored-by-trump-helps-vietnam-fight-virus/story-tZskuBfTTazioJ8YtLM8GJ.html
30-07-2020||World||With Mauritius development package India aims to bring Indian Ocean states closer||India’s development and security cooperation with smaller Indian Ocean states has been a key part of its “neighbourhood first” policy, with work continuing on projects in areas ranging from healthcare to defence amid the Covid-19 pandemic, people familiar with developments said on Wednesday. Mauritius has benefited from a special economic package of $353 million, with one of the key projects – the new Supreme Court building – set to be inaugurated by the prime ministers of the two countries during a virtual event on Thursday. The other infrastructure projects that were part of the package are the Metro Express project worth $275 million, the first phase of which has been completed, a $14-million ENT Hospital, which has been completed, and a social housing project with nearly 1,000 units. India is the largest development partner for Mauritius, for which it has provided lines of credit worth $600 million at concessional terms, with the focus on developmental projects. India is assisting in the building of healthcare facilities such as a renal unit, four medical clinics and two health centres, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. Mauritius is also one of the largest beneficiaries of the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) programme, with 210 civilian and 169 defence training slots being offered to the country during fiscal 2018-19. India has revitalised its relationship with the Maldives over the past 18 months after President Ibrahim Solih came to power, and the two sides have signed 18 agreements and MoUs, and new areas of cooperation include the judiciary, customs and healthcare, the people said. A financial aid package of $1.4 billion announced during Solih’s visit to India in December 2018 has been fully activated, and includes budgetary support, investment in the Maldives Monetary Authority’s treasury bills, a currency swap agreement and a new line of credit for $800 million, they said. Several big ticket infrastructure projects, such as an international cricket stadium, expansion of Hanimadhoo airport and the Gulhuifalhu port project, are part of this line of credit. India is also assisting in modernising the Maldives’ defence sector and gifted a fast interceptor vessel last December, the people said. India has also undertaken several developmental, connectivity and capacity-building projects in Sri Lanka, where the total development assistance portfolio exceeds $3.45 billion, including $560 million in grant assistance. The Indian Housing Project to build 50,000 houses is the flagship grant assistance project, and more than 48,600 houses have been built so far. Another 10,000 houses will be built for Indian-origin Tamils in the upcountry region, the people said. India also played a key role in improving connectivity in Sri Lanka by restoring railway lines that were damaged by the 2004 tsunami and by reconnecting the northern region with the rest of Sri Lanka by establishing railway signalling systems and supplying rolling stocks, the people said. All three Indian Ocean countries also benefited from India’s assistance to counter the Covid-19 pandemic. India was the first country to send a medical consignment to Mauritius, which included hydrocloroquine tablets and other medicines. An Indian medical assistance team was also deployed to Mauritius. The Maldives was the biggest beneficiary of India’s Covid-19-related aid among neighbouring countries, and received two consignments of medicines, 600 tonnes of food supplies and a 14-member medical rapid response team. Sri Lanka received four consignments of Covid-19-related essential medicines and equipment in April and May, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-mauritius-development-package-india-aims-to-bring-indian-ocean-states-closer/story-TmzrrnJOGsNgswWow8QLSM.html
30-07-2020||World||CSIR experts lead effort to prove unique mutation of Sars-Cov-2||Researchers from the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) are trying to establish the prevalence of a unique mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 that was discovered in samples of patients a couple of months ago.The researchers from the CSIR’s Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) and Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology sequenced about 64 genomes and found the unique variant called Clade I/A3i. A virus variant is defined as an isolate (or a set of isolates) whose genomic sequence differs from that of the reference virus. It is also termed as a genetic mutation in the original virus.Hospital-based clinical data is being used to determine the prevalence of Covid-19 infections due to the variant discovered, and to also establish whether the mutation found is functionally silent or has some virulence. In some cases, mutations of disease-causing viruses causes a decline in virulence, but that is yet to established in the case of this mutation. “More research is needed to get a prevalence of this particular variant among cases of Covid-19 in India, and also (to find out) how virulent is the strain. It can happen only through analysing data from hospitals. Initially, we picked up 30 odd samples but we would need at least five times more samples,” said CCMB director Dr Rakesh Mishra. The datasets of Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data till May 25 were used for the analysis. “What we have managed to sense so far is that this particular variant is dying down and other strains are infecting (people) more but this needs to be scientifically established.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/csir-experts-lead-effort-to-prove-unique-mutation-of-sars-cov-2/story-KgRSWKnpz76osjxzYpaAhL.html
30-07-2020||World||4 arrested under new Hong Kong security law for online posts||Hong Kong police have signaled their intent to enforce a new Chinese national security law strictly, arresting four youths Wednesday on suspicion of inciting secession through social media posts.Three males and one female, aged 16 to 21, were detained, a police official said at an 11 p.m. news conference. All are believed to be students.“Our investigation showed that a group has recently announced on social media that they have set up an organization for Hong Kong independence,” said Li Kwai-wah, senior superintendent of a newly formed unit to enforce the security law.The 1-month-old law has chilled pro-democracy protesting as activists along with academics and others wonder if their activities could be targeted.The central government in Beijing imposed the national security law on the semi-autonomous Chinese territory after city leaders were unable to get one passed locally. The move has raised fears that Hong Kong’s freedoms and local autonomy are being taken away.Police did not identify the suspects or their group. An organization called Studentlocalism — which announced it was disbanding just before the law took effect — said on Facebook that four former members had been arrested on secession charges, including ex-leader Tony Chung.The police action appeared to target the Initiative Independence Party, which says on its Facebook page that it consists of former Studentlocalism members who have completed their studies and are overseas.The party, which also posted the news of Wednesday’s arrests, advocates for independence because it believes full democracy for Hong Kong is impossible under Chinese rule, its Facebook page says.Li said only that the group in question had set up recently and that the posts were made after the law took effect late on June 30.“They said they want to establish a Hong Kong republic, and that they will unreservedly fight for it,” he said. “They also said they want to unite all pro-independence groups in Hong Kong for this purpose.”He warned anyone who thinks they can carry out such crimes online to think twice.Police have made a handful of other arrests under the new law, all of people taking part in protests and chanting slogans or waving flags deemed to violate the law.China promised Hong Kong would have its own governing and legal systems under a “one country, two systems” principle until 2047, or 50 years after Britain handed back its former colony in 1997.China, in justifying the new law, says issues such as separatism are a national security concern and, as such, fall under its purview.The latest arrests came one day after a leading figure in Hong Kong’s political opposition was fired from his university post.Hong Kong University’s council voted 18-2 to oust Benny Tai from his position as an associate law professor, local media reported.Tai has been out on bail since being sentenced to 16 months in prison in April 2019 as one of nine leaders put on trial for their part in 2014 protests for greater democracy known as the Umbrella Movement.In a posting Wednesday on his Facebook account, Tai said he intended to continue writing and lecturing on legal issues and asked for public support.“If we continue in our persistence, we will definitely see the revival of the rule of law in Hong Kong one day,” Tai wrote.While the 2014 movement failed in its bid to expand democracy, protests returned last year over a legislative proposal that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to face trial in mainland China.Although the legislation was eventually shelved, protester demands expanded to include calls for democratic change and an investigation into alleged police abuses. They grew increasingly violent in the second half of the year.In a statement issued after the vote to remove Tai, the Chinese government’s liaison office in Hong Kong said it was “a punishment for evil doing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4-arrested-under-new-hong-kong-security-law-for-online-posts/story-PSEKqQuF8hHbEYlYWBWuwM.html
30-07-2020||World||In underground ballistic missiles launch drill, Iran fires at fake US Nimitz carriers||Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard launched underground ballistic missiles Wednesday as part of an exercise involving a mock-up American aircraft carrier in the Strait of Hormuz, highlighting its network of subterranean missile sites.Although state television documentaries have focused on operations at underground bases, all have avoided showing geographic details revealing their locations. Wednesday’s launch from what appears to be central Iran’s desert plateau may have changed that amid heightened tensions between Tehran and the US over its tattered nuclear deal with world powers and as economic pressures grow.“We have carried out the launch of ballistic missiles from the depths of the earth for the first time,” Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the Guard’s aerospace division, told state TV. “That means without utilizing conventional launchpads, the buried missiles suddenly rip out of the earth and hit their targets precisely.”Drone footage captured by the Guard showed two missiles blasting out from covered positions in the desert early Wednesday morning, with debris flying up into the air in their wake. The Guard did not identify the location of the launch, nor the missiles involved.The launch, six months after the Guard shot down a Ukrainian jetliner and killed all 176 people on board, appeared geared toward demonstrating the strength of its missile program to a domestic audience, missile expert Melissa Hanham said. The above-ground footage shown on state television, coupled with investigative techniques, make it possible to locate the site, she said.“Once you find the silo, it’s really not a safe place to keep your missile anymore,” said Hanham, who works as the deputy director of an Austria-based group called the Open Nuclear Network.Since its bloody 1980s war with Iraq, which saw both nations fire missiles on cities, Iran has developed its ballistic missile program as a deterrent, especially as a UN arms embargo prevents it from buying high-tech weapons systems. The underground tunnels help protect those weapons, including liquid-fueled missiles that can only be fueled for short periods of time, Hanham said.“What they’re trying to do is increase the survivability of their missile forces,” she said. “They feel that their missile forces are exposed and that they could be taken out preemptively. By building this elaborate tunnel scheme, they’re trying to increase the survivability.”Iran also could have used missiles buried in hermetically sealed canisters for the launches without the need for a major underground base, said Michael Elleman, a missile expert and the director of the nonproliferation and nuclear policy program at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Solid-fuel propellant could allow such missiles to be buried for years, he said.“Presumably, these missiles can be launched remotely, without a launch crew on site,” Elleman said. “Perhaps the launch crew is nearby, and has operational control of several to a handful of missiles.”However, he said he suspected the US likely knew where the missiles were buried.“Maybe not all of them, but a large percentage,” Elleman said. “If so, they are vulnerable to pre-launch strikes during a crisis.”The drill, called “Great Prophet 14,” also sends a message to the United States. Iran has been firing at a fake aircraft carrier resembling America’s Nimitz-class carriers towed out to the strait by a tugboat. Adm. Ali Reza Tangsiri, the Guard’s naval chief, said its armed drones attacked the bridge of the fake carrier Wednesday, the semiofficial Tasnim news agency reported.During Wednesday’s drills, footage showed a missile striking a target resembling an American missile defense system known as a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD.Tasnim published a graphic overnight that altered the image of an American carrier into the shape of a casket with a set of crosshairs on it, with a caption quoting Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei pledging to seek revenge for the U.S. drone strike that killed a top Iranian general in January.The drill — and the American response to it — underline the lingering threat of military conflict between Iran and the U.S. after a series of escalating incidents last year led to the January drone strike. Tehran responded to that strike by firing ballistic missiles that wounded dozens of American forces in Iraq.While the coronavirus pandemic has engulfed both Iran and the US for months, there has been a growing confrontation as America argues to extend the yearslong UN weapons embargo on Tehran that is due to expire in October. A recent incident over Syria involving an American jet fighter approaching an Iranian passenger plane also has renewed tensions.Economic pressure from the collapse of the nuclear deal, caused by President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrawing America from the accord, has seen Iran’s rial currency drastically drop in value. At the time of the deal in 2015, $1 cost 32,000 rial. Today, $1 is worth some 235,000 rials.Ballistic missile fire detected from the drill Tuesday resulted in American troops being put on alert at Al-Dhafra Air Base in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates and Al-Udeid Air Base, the forward headquarters of the US military’s Central Command in Qatar, the military said. Troops briefly sought cover during that time.Both bases are hundreds of kilometers (miles) away from where Iran placed the replica aircraft carrier in the strait, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all oil traded passes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-underground-ballistic-missiles-launch-drill-iran-fires-at-fake-us-nimitz-carriers/story-caZ7IKdA0aUukkadgtvYsL.html
30-07-2020||World||Covid-19 surges in China, Hong Kong fears mass spread||China reported 101 new Covid-19 cases over the past 24 hours, the highest since April, according to the national health commission (NHC) on Wednesday, as Beijing is expanding nucleic acid testing and contact tracing for new clusters mushrooming in various cities.Fear also gripped Hong Kong, which is in the spotlight of a US-China tussle these days, whose leader Carrie Lam warned that the city is on the brink of a large-scale outbreak of the coronavirus and urged people to stay indoors as much as possible. Lam said, “We are on the verge of a large-scale community outbreak, which may lead to a collapse of our hospital system and cost lives. I appeal to you to strictly follow social distancing measures and stay at home.”In China, 89 cases were reported from Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, in a record single-day spike. It took the total number of infections in the province to more than 320.Also on Wednesday, the BBC reported that US attorney general William Barr will undergo a Covid-19 test since he had recently come into contact with Texan Republican congressman Louie Gohmert, who has tested positive. Barr had reportedly met Gohmert while testifying before the House judiciary panel on Tuesday.Coronavirus deaths in the US rose by more than 1,200 on Tuesday, the biggest one-day increase since May. California and Florida reported a one-day record spike in deaths on Tuesday, together accounting for 362 of the 1,227 new fatalities.US President Donald Trump issued a stout defence of the antimalarial drug HCQ as treatment for Covid-19, hours after social media companies took down videos promoting its use as misinformation. In Saudi Arabia, Muslims began the hajj on Wednesday, circling Islam’s holiest site along socially-distanced paths in this year’s downsized pilgrimage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-surges-in-china-hong-kong-fears-mass-spread/story-yeMJexDKZ0j0XgxIT4jQ6L.html
30-07-2020||World||Australia sets Covid-19 record as Melbourne lockdown struggles||Australia has suffered its worst day of coronavirus infections with Victoria state recording 723 new cases, dashing hopes that a lockdown in the city of Melbourne was bringing the outbreak under control.Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters that 13 more people had died, bringing the state’s death toll to 105. Infections had gradually decreased earlier this week, with the state recording 295 new cases on Wednesday, raising hopes the six-week lockdown of the city of 5 million people was working.“Most of today’s cases are in metro areas,” Andrews said in a statement. “But we have seen a significant jump in regional communities. It’s vital we stop this virus further seeping into regional Victoria.”He said mask-wearing would be mandatory across the state, extending the order from just Melbourne. Residents in several regional centers, including Geelong, would not be allowed to have visitors in their homes from midnight.There are mounting concerns that the stay-at-home order in Melbourne, begun three weeks ago, will need to be extended, inflicting further damage on the economy. Health authorities are also concerned the virus is spreading to other states and territories, most of which have gone weeks without recording community transmissions.The Australian dollar fell 0.2% to 71.72 US cents as investors sold the currency on the spike in cases.New South Wales state on Thursday reported 18 new cases in the past 24 hours.Queensland, which has closed its border to Victoria and the Greater Sydney area, is ramping up testing after two women who visited Melbourne didn’t self-isolate on their return and instead went to schools, restaurants and shopping centers for eight days unchecked before returning a positive result.The resurgence in Victoria is taking a heavy toll on residents of age-care homes and is placing the health-care system under stress. The state said Tuesday it will suspend all but the most urgent elective surgeries in Melbourne as it seeks to free up hospital beds and nurses to fight a spike of cases in such facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-sets-covid-19-record-as-melbourne-lockdown-struggles/story-pXseRWwgSRC2oeKQYTOCiM.html

It is yet to show action on 13 out of 27 items of its FATF Action Plan. This is despite all the deadlines of completing the action expired long ago,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said.“The continued Greylisting of Pakistan vindicates our position that Pakistan has not taken appropriate action against terror financing and safe havens which exist in that country,” he added.This came after Pakistan received another extension on the Grey List during the FATF plenary session.Pakistan will likely remain in the Grey List till February 2021 even if it completes all its action plan items by October 2020 as an on-site visit by the FATF team would have to be held to confirm completion of the plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fatf-related-legislation-will-move-pakistan-from-grey-list-to-white-list-claims-minister/story-KXGG9PYoa8urgzFlPwzv2N.html
30-07-2020||World||Ghislaine Maxwell seeks appeal of judge’s order to unseal documents||A US judge rejected Ghislaine Maxwell’s request to delay or reconsider her order unsealing the British socialite’s 2016 testimony in a defamation lawsuit, calling the request “extraordinary” and saying it came at the “eleventh-hour.”US District Judge Loretta Preska dismissed Maxwell’s arguments that disclosing the British socialite’s sworn testimony, along with other sealed evidence in the civil case, could harm her right to a fair trial on sex-trafficking charges and “inappropriately influence potential witnesses or victims.”Maxwell’s lawyer Laura Menninger immediately notified Preska that she will ask the federal appeals court in Manhattan to review the decision. Preska’s ruling late Wednesday came almost a week after she ordered the documents unsealed -- including portions of Maxwell’s deposition and emails the socialite exchanged with Epstein.Earlier Wednesday, Maxwell again argued against the release of the material, prompting Preska to respond that the socialite’s arguments were going over “plowed ground.”In her four-page ruling, Preska ordered that some evidence collected in the lawsuit can be released as early as Thursday. The judge said the sworn testimony Maxwell gave in 2016, as well as the account of an alleged victim identified only as “Doe 1,” could be unsealed Aug. 3.Maxwell, 58, is in a federal jail in Brooklyn, New York, after having pleaded not guilty to sex-trafficking charges tied to her former boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein. She is charged with trafficking girls as young as 14 to be sexually abused by Epstein and also accused of sometimes participating in the abuse.Her sworn testimony and other evidence were collected as part of a defamation suit filed by Virginia Guiffre, who claims Maxwell and Epstein lured her into becoming the financier’s sex slave when she was 16. She sued Maxwell for calling her account “obvious lies.” The lawsuit was settled out of court.Maxwell will now take her challenge to the same appeals court that last August ordered the unsealing of at least 2,000 pages of documents filed in the case. Epstein was found dead of an apparent suicide in his Manhattan jail cell a day after the ruling was handed down.Maxwell earlier argued against further disclosure of the materials, saying one document pertained to Giuffre’s efforts “to compel Ms. Maxwell to answer intrusive questions about her sex life” during her deposition.Perjury ChargesThe socialite’s testimony in the lawsuit became a crucial matter for the government, which used some of it as the basis for two perjury charges in the new criminal case. Prosecutors say the socialite was lying when she denied having any knowledge about Epstein’s sexual interactions with underage girls or being present when they occurred.The testimony in the civil case -- which was ordered sealed by a judge under a settlement agreement -- should never have been given to prosecutors, Maxwell’s lawyers argued. They questioned how the government got its hands on the information.The defense team accused Guiffre’s lawyers of having leaked or “caused someone to leak the evidence” to prosecutors and argued the government and Guiffre set a “perjury trap,” for the socialite.If not for the promise of confidentiality for her testimony, Maxwell would have invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during the deposition, her lawyers said.Jim Margolin, a spokesman for acting Manhattan US Attorney Audrey Strauss, didn’t have an immediate comment. Evan Ezray, a spokesman for Guiffre’s lawyers, Sigrid MacCawley and David Boies, didn’t immediately return an email seeking comment.The civil case is Guiffre v. Maxwell, 15-CV-07433, US District Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan); The criminal case is US v. Maxwell, 20-CR-330, US District Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ghislaine-maxwell-seeks-appeal-of-judge-s-order-to-unseal-documents/story-DAeW29NQll91Y3lJoMbCCI.html
30-07-2020||World||Brazil hits record 69,000 daily coronavirus cases as restrictions eased||Brazil set daily records on Wednesday for new Covid-19 cases and related fatalities, as the world’s second-worst outbreak hurtles toward the milestone of 100,000 dead amid easing lockdowns.Brazil is the country worst hit by Covid-19 outside of the United States in both its death toll and case count. The 69,074 new confirmed cases and 1,595 additional deaths reported by the Health Ministry pushed the country past 2.5 million infections and 90,000 killed.President Jair Bolsonaro has fought against restrictions on economic activity, and the disease has advanced as governors and mayors have yielded to the pressure. In some cases, Brazilians have packed into bars and crowded public squares without masks, often in defiance of local rules.Last week, Brazil recorded 7,677 deaths from Covid-19, the most fatalities in any week since the pandemic began, defying repeated predictions that the outbreak had peaked.“Brazil is experiencing the worst phase of the pandemic,” said Alexandre Naime, head of the department of infectious diseases at Sao Paulo State University. “Paradoxically, public policy and personal behavior are going in the opposite direction, as if we are not living through a daily tragedy,” he added.Bolsonaro’s government announced Wednesday that it will lift a ban on foreign travelers flying into the country that has been in place since March, so long as they have health insurance coverage for their trip.Easing restrictions come as new hotspots within Brazil are gaining steam daily.Sao Paulo, Brazil’s most populous and hardest-hit state, has been working through a backlog of previously unregistered cases, reporting more than 26,000 cases on Wednesday alone.While Sao Paulo and neighboring Rio de Janeiro were hit first by the virus, health officials have expressed rising concern over outbreaks in the center-west and far south of the country, where the arrival of winter favors contagion.“We present national data but it’s like we have (multiple) Covid-19 pandemics with different regions of the country behaving differently,” health vigilance secretary Arnaldo Correia de Medeiros said in a televised press briefing.Those conditions have turned Brazil into a global testing ground for drug companies to test potential vaccines.A Brazilian research institute on Wednesday said it had reached an agreement with China’s Sinopharm to start what would be the fourth major trial of a potential vaccine in the country.Bolsonaro himself has flouted social distancing guidelines by joining supporters at rallies around Brasilia, the capital, in recent months. He fell ill with coronavirus this month, and spent weeks in partial isolation before recovering.The right-wing populist has argued that the economic damage from lockdowns is worse than the disease itself, which he has played down as “a little flu” that can be cured by unproven treatments, involving the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine.

30-07-2020||World||US Congress ask Bezos if small firms are forced to rely on Amazon||Big Tech executives faced an onslaught of criticism from US lawmakers Wednesday at a high-stakes antitrust hearing which could lay the groundwork for tougher regulation and legal actions against the major internet platforms.CEOs Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google were grilled for more than five hours in the unprecedented joint appearance -- by video -- before a House of Representatives panel investigating market dominance.While the hearing was called to focus on whether the companies have abused their dominant positions in the market, it veered quickly into other topics including political bias, privacy, dealings with China and how platforms deal with misinformation.“Simply put, they have too much power,” said Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island who chairs the panel conducting a year-long investigation into the business practices of the four companies.Cicilline said the hearing made clear that the firms “have monopoly power -- some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable.”Congress has no formal role in antitrust enforcement, but several lawmakers appeared intent on revising US laws to deal with the extraordinary market power and dominance of large technology firms.Pandemic strengthCicilline said the coronavirus outbreak has strengthened the economic clout of the four, saying: “They are likely to emerge (from the pandemic) stronger and more powerful than ever before.”A few comments from lawmakers sought to play down the competitive harms of the companies, which have also won praise for innovating and introducing new technologies and offering lifelines during the virus lockdowns.“Being big is not inherently bad,” said Jim Sensenbrenner, a Republican from Wisconsin. “Quite the opposite, in America you should be rewarded for success.Abusing platforms?Some lawmakers sought to highlight problems with tech companies operating platforms while competing with rivals on those systems.Democrat Pramila Jayapal of Washington state question Pichai on how Google operates its ad platform, claiming that this hurts other online services such as news outlets.Google “is running the marketplace it’s acting on the buy side and it’s acting on the sell side, which is a major conflict of interest,” Jayapal said.Apple’s Cook faced tough questioning over the market power of the company’s App Store and its treatment of developers.“We treat all app developers the same,” Cook said. “We do not retaliate or bully people.”Bezos, in his first appearance before a congressional committee, defended Amazon’s dealings with third-party sellers after a blistering attack from Cicilline.“Isn’t it true that small businesses have no real option but rely on Amazon to connect with customers to make online sales?” the committee chair asked.“We’ve heard from third party sellers again and again during the course of our investigation that Amazon is the only game in town.”Bezos disputed the characterization while adding, “There are a lot of options for small firms.. I think we are the best one.”Playing politicsPresident Donald Trump, who has accused Facebook and Twitter of censoring his remarks and being biased against conservatives, weighed in with a tweet shortly before the hearing began, and some Republican lawmakers echoed those remarks.“If Congress doesn’t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,” Trump said. Representative Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio, said during the hearing: “I’ll just cut to the chase -- Big Tech is out to get conservatives. That’s not a suspicion. That’s not a hunch. That’s a fact.”Democrat Jamie Raskin of Maryland rejected the argument, saying Facebook and other platforms have failed to contain misinformation from Trump and his supporters, including unverified COVID-19 claims.“If Facebook is out there trying to repress conservative speech they’re doing a terrible job,” Raskin said. “I don’t understand this endless whining” from Republicans.Moving forwardSome analysts said the hearing could set the stage for revising US antitrust laws, which at present make it difficult for enforcers to target companies simply for being large or dominant without also showing harm to consumers or abuse of market power.“There was considerable skepticism toward the tech sector as legislators worry about unfair competition and unfair practices,” said Darrell West, director of the center for technology innovation at the Brookings Institution.“If Democrats gain control in the (November elections), this hearing will serve as a blueprint for enhanced regulatory oversight,” West said.Michael Carrier, a Rutgers University professor of antitrust law, said that “the hearing showed that the representatives did their homework” and showed documents hinting at anticompetitive actions.“I don’t think any immediate changes will result from the hearing, but it will provide support for the continuing momentum to challenge these companies,” he said.Avery Gardiner, a former government antitrust lawyer who follows competition for the Center for Democracy & Technology, said the hearing was “an opportunity squandered” which failed to demonstrate specific anticompetitive actions, leaving the matter now to regulatory agencies.“Congressional hearings, which by their nature are broad-ranging, do not lend themselves well to thoughtful analysis about what Big Tech does that could affect competition,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lawmakers-pummel-big-tech-ceos-at-us-antitrust-hearing/story-RtJ6mhNo4laoRP9DfgXkSM.html
30-07-2020||World||US tech giants too powerful, antitrust panel chair warns||Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook are too powerful and will likely emerge from the coronavirus pandemic even stronger, the head of a US congressional antitrust committee said Wednesday at a high-stakes hearing featuring the CEOs of the four US tech giants.“Simply put, they have too much power,” Representative David Cicilline said in his opening remarks at the hearing expected to feature a grilling of the leaders of the technology companies.Also read: Documents show Facebook bought Instagram to quash competitor“Whether it’s through self-preferencing, predatory pricing, or requiring users to buy additional products, the dominant platforms have wielded their power in destructive, harmful ways in order to expand,” the Democrat from Rhode Island said.“Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, these corporations already stood out as titans in our economy,” Cicilline said. “In the wake of Covid-19, however, they are likely to emerge stronger and more powerful than ever before.”Republican Representative Jim Sensenbrenner struck a more moderate tone, saying “being big is not inherently bad.”“Quite the opposite, in America you should be rewarded for success,” Sensenbrenner said.The unprecedented joint appearance -- remotely by video -- before the House Judiciary subcommittee features Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google and its parent firm Alphabet.The hearing is part of a probe into the competitive market landscape and antitrust law, but questioning is likely to veer into other areas such as hate speech and content moderation, economic inequality, privacy and data protection and even claims of political “bias” from President Donald Trump and his allies.Ahead of the hearing, the top executives of the firms sought to offer an upbeat assessment of the tech landscape, highlighting their roots and values and how the companies have benefitted average Americans.“An important way we contribute is by building products that are helpful to American users in moments big and small, whether they are looking for a faster route home, learning how to cook a new dish on YouTube, or growing a small business,” Pichai said in his remarks.Only in America Cook said Apple is “a uniquely American company whose success is only possible in this country,” and that the California giant is “motivated by the mission to put things into the world that enrich people’s lives.”Bezos, in his first appearance before a congressional committee, spoke of his modest upbringing and initial backing from his parents to start Amazon and its early losses of billions of dollars.Also read: Bezos, Zuckerberg and Musk have made $115 billion this year“I walked away from a steady job into a Seattle garage to found my startup, fully understanding that it might not work,” said Bezos, who is the world’s richest person based on his Amazon stake.Zuckerberg called social media colossus Facebook a “proudly American company” and added that “our story would not have been possible without US laws that encourage competition and innovation.”But hours ahead of the hearing, fast-growing video app TikTok accused Facebook of “maligning attacks” that are part of a movement “disguised as patriotism and designed to put an end to our very presence in the US.”TiKTok welcomes “fair competition” chief executive Kevin Mayer said in a blog post, while adding that “without TikTok, American advertisers would again be left with few choices.”Political theater? The hearing is part of a congressional probe into “online platforms and market power” and takes place against a backdrop of antitrust investigations in the United States, Europe and elsewhere.Current US antitrust laws make it difficult for enforcers to target companies simply for being large or dominant without also showing harm to consumers or abuse of market power.The committee, however, could lay a blueprint for antitrust in the digital era that would require a fundamental rewrite of the century-old competition rules.Some analysts say the hearing could offer fresh insights into how Big Tech “platforms” squelch competition by buying rivals or copying products from rivals. Apple’s hefty commissions for its App Store and Amazon’s dealings with third-party sellers are expected to come under scrutiny.Google, which has faced antitrust investigations in Europe, will face questions on whether it favors its own services to the detriment of rivals and Facebook for its dominance of the social media landscape including its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.Robert Atkinson of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank often aligned with the sector, said the political theater may distract from the issue of competition and focus on issues “from privacy to political speech.”“These companies create enormous value for hundreds of millions of users and small businesses,” Atkinson said. “Congress shouldn’t twist antitrust law to launch an ill-defined broadside on internet platforms as a class.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-tech-giants-too-powerful-antitrust-panel-chair-warns/story-RZrbVgjro3iLcg9expQByO.html

30-07-2020||World||Antitrust probe: Documents show Facebook bought Instagram to quash competitor||Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg bought Instagram because he was concerned about the nascent company’s potential to turn users away from Facebook, according to documents obtained by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.That makes it “exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition that antitrust laws were intended to prevent,” US Representative Jerrold Nadler told Zuckerberg at a hearing Wednesday. After Zuckerberg reminded committee members that the Instagram acquisition was allowed to proceed by the Federal Trade Commission, Representative David Cicilline said the FTC’s failure in 2012 has no bearing on whether the acquisition violated the law.Zuckerberg didn’t deny that his company acquired Instagram in part so it wouldn’t compete with Facebook on photo sharing. According to emails with Facebook’s chief financial officer in 2012, Zuckerberg wanted to do the deal to buy time -- a year or more to integrate Instagram’s features so Facebook would be up and running on photo sharing before anyone else could reach the same scale.Instagram, which had 13 employees and no revenue at the time of the Facebook purchase, was already becoming popular at a dramatic clip, surpassing other photo-sharing apps with the size of its network. After six years as part of Facebook, Instagram surpassed 1 billion users. Today, the app contributes more than $20 billion to Facebook’s annual revenue, people familiar with the matter have said. Zuckerberg is still concerned about the potential for Instagram to cannibalize Facebook’s growth, and has restricted its resources and worked to integrate it more tightly with Facebook.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antitrust-probe-documents-show-facebook-bought-instagram-to-quash-competitor/story-pRtJlKjkiTm4lloIPzOMWP.html
30-07-2020||World||With Kamala Harris in his notes, Joe Biden says vice-president pick next week||Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said Tuesday he will announce his vice-president next week. He did not say who it will be, but notes he held during the speech to unveil his economic plan for racial equality, had one name in it: Kamala Harris, the senator from California.Harris’s name was followed by five attributes, as captured by an AP photographer. “Do not hold grudges,” was at the top. It was a reference to an exchange at one of the primary debates when Harris had questioned Biden’s position on busing, a practice used in the 70s to racially desegregate schools. The four other attributed were: “Campaigned with me & Jill”, “Talented”, “Great help to campaign”, and “Great respect for her.”.“I’m going to have a choice in the first week in August and I promise I’ll let you know when I do,” Biden said when asked about his running mate pick.Harris is on a long list of 13 names Biden is understood to have considered seriously in a guessing game he triggered in march when he first announced he will pick a woman.Harris will not be the first woman to run for vice-president if does indeed get the nod — there have been at least two before Geraldine Ferraro and Sarah Palin. But she will be both the first African American (father is from Jamaica) and the first Indian American (mother, who is no more came, from India).Others on the list include Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Duckworth, Congressional Black Caucus chair Karen Bass, Representative Val Demings, Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, former National Security Advisor Susan Rice, Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottom, and Georgia politician Stacey Abrams.Biden spoke about his VP pick in response to questions from reporters after unveiling his racial economic equality plan, the fourth plank of his “Build Back Better” economic plan. It was a repackaged mix of plans and schemes from the whole spread of his presidential platform.Key elements included a Small Business Opportunity Fund of $30 billion from his $300 billion domestic innovation funding.; one-time debt reduction for students; $15 hourly wage; scheme to encourage housing for low-income communities and a legislation to make the Federal Reserve trace and report trends on racial inequality gaps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-kamala-harris-in-his-notes-joe-biden-says-vice-president-pick-next-week/story-PyW2vEZCkAn3wXIVMlk7pK.html
30-07-2020||World||Trump administration to reject new DACA applications||The Trump administration on Tuesday announced it will continue to reject new applications from undocumented immigrants brought as children as it reviews an Obama-era regulation that protects them from deportation. During the review of the programme, Deferred Action on Childhood Arrival (DACA), those already signed up will be granted shortened renewal from 2 year to 1 and all applications for “advance parole”, which allows these immigrants to travel abroad, will be denied barring “exceptional circumstances”.This new arrangement is likely to be challenged in court as it violates a federal court’s order preventing the administration from rejecting new applications and denying advance parole.There are an estimated 644,000 undocumented immigrants protected from deportation under this regulation and they are also called DREAMERs, including at least 2,500 from India.“The administration is now undertaking a comprehensive review of the DACA program and the justifications that have been offered for winding DACA down, including its illegality and the negative effect the program has on what I’d call ‘immigration behavior’,” a senior Trump administration official told reporters.The Trump administration has had this programme in its crosshairs from Year 1, and rescinded it in September 2017, arguing, chiefly, for congress to legislate a resolution, to replace the Obama-era regulations instituted through an executive order. “As the Department continues looking at the policy and considers future action, the fact remains that Congress should act on this matter,” said Chad F. Wolf., acting secretary of the department of homeland security on Tuesday.The Supreme Court in June blocked the administration’s September order saying it had not provided adequate legal justification for rescinding the Obama-era regulation.But the Trump administration argued the court had not upheld the Obama regulation as lawful. “The issue that the Court reached in its decision was only that the administration had insufficiently justified its wind-down of the DACA program,” the official said. “The court agreed that the administration can, in fact, pursue a wind-down of the DACA program.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-to-reject-new-daca-applications/story-LQ24YUqwowoSeOD3PW1wgK.html

So it was rather normal that the prince served pints and ‘curry’ to Peter Crouch and others during a recording of the former England football star’s podcast on BBC5Live.They joked about the ‘curry’ being delivered to the palace by an Uber driver who was frisked at the gates, as the food seemed to go down rather well. The prince dwelt on his love for football, mental health and losing patience with his children during lockdown.Prince William, whose title is Duke of Cambridge, is also president of Football Association (FA). Part of the podcast was recorded before the lockdown, but figured prominently in news discourse on Wednesday as sport in Covid-secure conditions begins in the UK.Since becoming a father, William said football has become his “release”, particularly when he needs to “go and be amongst other guys and let out some steam, shout a bit,” joking that he couldn’t abuse the referee since he is the FA president.Amidst blokey banter, William says: “It (football) has become a lot more relevant to me and I need it. Talking about football helps a lot…This period of time has allowed us to all revalue things”. “The thing about lockdown is that it has been a little bit of an awakening that we maybe take our lives a bit for granted sometimes and there’s a lot of things out there that can wobble all of us at any time”.“I think particularly now, as a parent, it starts to make you look a bit more to the future at what kind of world we are going to hand over to the next generation. There’s been a lot of time to think - and you can also have too much time to think, and that’s also what worries me,” he adds.On the challenge of keeping his children entertained during the lockdown, the prince says: “I found it pretty testing, trying to keep the children engaged and interested in some sort of work. It’s been an interesting few months”.“I’ve learned my patience is a lot shorter than I thought it was. That’s probably the biggest eye-opener for me, and my wife has super patience.”An ardent supporter of Aston Villa, William revealed that he is not allowed to operate the twitter account of the ‘Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’, but said he could not hold himself back in May 2019.“They deliberately keep me away from that. When Liverpool won that amazing Champions League semi-final against Barcelona (in May 2019), I grabbed hold of the Twitter thing and just posted”.“It was an amazing match, I was blown away by it. It was one of the best games of football I’ve ever seen. I got completely out of control. I was like: ‘Tweet that! Get it out!’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-papad-pint-williams-serves-indian-food-to-guests/story-X8zPPtBoiAIUfUMJRH5nSO.html

The defendants accepted they entered into various guarantees but challenged the jurisdiction of the English court to hear the bank’s claim and also raised technicalities about notices served in India.After a recent two-day hearing, conducted remotely due to the coronavirus pandemic, Justice Sara Cockerill rejected the defendants’ arguments put forth by solicitor Karishma Vora, who came in for praise in the judgement.“In conclusion, although Ms Vora for the Applicants has done an excellent job of marshalling and presenting her many and various points, the challenges brought are a collection of issues, all of which lack merit. I therefore dismiss the applications”, the judge said.On the point of whether a certificate of good service from a foreign (in this case Indian) judicial authority can be valid service of English judicial proceedings, Cockerill also found that there is a strong presumption of service and that a claimant need not look beyond the certificate.Paul Gair of law firm TLT that represented PNB, said: “This is a significant victory for PNBIL as it means it can now pursue its enforcement action against the defendants in the English courts”.TLT is currently advising a consortium of 13 Indian banks on a £1.05 billion debt recovery action in the UK against controversial businessman Vijay Mallya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-uk-ruling-on-pnb-may-influence-mallya-debt-recovery-case/story-tFkKkJJHp5ao6op9Pj8RaM.html
30-07-2020||India||Pompeo cites LAC tension, says tide turning on China||American efforts to lead an “international awakening” against the Chinese government is working and the “tide is turning”, US secretary of state Michael Pompeo said on Thursday, citing India’s ban on China-origin mobile apps, closer interactions of the Quad countries and actions by several other nations that have been seen as aimed at Beijing. Testifying at a US senate hearing on the 2021 budget for the state department, Pompeo also said he is not yet certain about the shape or form of the “new grouping of like-minded nations — an alliance of democracies” that he recently mooted to confront the global threat from China in a major policy speech. The reference was to his remarks last week at a California library named after former President Richard Nixon, whose 1972 visit led to the thaw in US-China relations. Pompeo had then called for a global compact arguing US policy of “blind engagement” with China had failed.The top US diplomat was pressed repeatedly by Republican as well as Democratic senators on China, more than on any other foreign issue, reflecting the urgency among American policy makers on ties with Beijing.Calling the Chinese Communist Party — US officials insist on treating the Chinese government as an entity separate from the people — “the central threat of our times” as he has before, Pompeo told senators that the “incursion” against India and the “real-estate claim” against Bhutan and other conflicts around the world were indicative of Chinese intentions to expand their reach and to bring “socialism with Chinese characteristics” to the world.“Our vigorous diplomacy has helped lead an international awakening to the threat of the CCP,” he said, adding, “Senators, the tide is turning.”The secretary of state listed some of the global developments he said were the result of the American lead on international awakening against China: the growing ostracism of Chinese firms from the rollout of 5G networks, increasing rejection of Chinese claims in the disputed South China Sea, and the condemnation of the new laws in Hong Kong.“We’re proud to have stepped up maritime manoeuvres in that body of water (the South China Sea) alongside friends like Australia, India, Japan, and the UK,” Pompeo said in his full and prepared remarks, which were different from the brief summary he read out as his opening statement.He added: “India has banned 106 Chinese apps, including TikTok, that threatened its citizens’ privacy and security.” The secretary of state had earlier indicated the United States had played an “assist” role in the first round of bans of 59 apps, without providing details. The US has since said it was considering a ban on TikTok and other Chinese apps, devices and companies that threaten the security of the country.Pompeo said the US, Australia, India, and Japan have “reinvigorated” the “Quad” as part of an effort to confront China through multilateral bodies. He went on to say this “grouping is stronger than it has ever been and maybe we were gifted by General Secretary Xi (Jinping).”“He took actions that caused each of the leaders of those countries to recognise the value of this group,” he added. The secretary was answering a question about India’s invitation to Australia to join the upcoming military exercises with the United States and Japan.The top US diplomat went on to specify the many actions the Trump administration has taken against China in recent months: sanctions against Chinese officials for the mistreatment of Uighur muslims in Xinjiang; imposition of export controls on companies supporting it; termination of trade benefits for Hong Kong and the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston, which, he said, had become a “den of spies”.As further indication of the Trump administration’s intentions for the region, Pompeo said the state department was seeking $1.49 billion for foreign assistance to the Indo-Pacific region, a 20% increase from the FY 2020 request. “We want that part of the world to be free, open, and prosperous,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pompeo-cites-lac-tension-says-tide-turning-on-china/story-roUS11IzTVyR6mOMvcHduI.html
30-07-2020||India||India rejects China’s claims on completion of disengagement||New Delhi/Beijing: India on Thursday rejected China’s contention that disengagement has been completed at most locations along their disputed border, with New Delhi calling on Beijing to work sincerely for complete de-escalation and full restoration of peace along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava acknowledged there has been “some progress” towards disengagement and de-escalation along the LAC, though the process is far from complete. Senior military commanders from the two sides are set to meet for the fifth time to work out steps to complete the process, he said.India’s stance is markedly different from the position taken by China, which said on Tuesday frontline troops had “completed disengagement in most locations and the situation on the ground is easing”.“There has been some progress made towards this objective but the disengagement process has as yet not been completed,” Srivastava said during the weekly virtual media briefing.“As we have stated earlier, the maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the border areas is the basis of our bilateral relationship. Therefore, we expect that the Chinese side will sincerely work with us for complete disengagement and de-escalation and full restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas at the earliest, as agreed to by the Special Representatives,” he said.People familiar with developments said the sizeable Chinese troop presence at friction points, particularly Pangong Lake and Depsang, remains a concern. The people, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Chinese side is yet to deliver on understandings regarding disengagement reached during the July 5 phone conversation of the Special Representatives on the border issue and meetings of corps commanders.The people said the next meeting of the corps commanders is expected to be held before the end of the week though a date is yet to be finalised.Srivastava referred to the July 24 meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs, which reviewed the situation in Ladakh sector, and said the two sides had agreed that “early and complete disengagement” of troops and de-escalation in line with bilateral agreements and protocols is essential for the smooth development of bilateral ties.In Beijing, Chinese defence ministry spokesperson Ren Guoqiang stuck to the line that troops from both sides were disengaging at friction points on the LAC.“At present, the situation on the ground is tending to ease, and the border guards of the two countries are gradually disengaging from contact,” Ren was quoted as saying in a statement.Since the June 15 clash in the Galwan Valley, the two countries have had “effective communication and coordination through diplomatic and military channels”, Ren said.He added: “We hope the Indian side and the Chinese side will meet each other halfway, in accordance with the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, and always proceed from the overall situation of maintaining...China-India relations and regional peace and stability.”The two sides should focus on “cooperation and properly addressing differences”, he said.Chinese ambassador Sun Weidong, speaking at a webinar on the theme “India-China relations: The way forward”, sought to blame India for both the standoff and the June 15 clash that resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and unspecified Chinese casualties.He repeatedly accused Indian troops of crossing to the Chinese side of the LAC and of building infrastructure such as roads and bridges in the Galwan Valley since April. “The right and wrong of the Galwan Valley incident is very clear and I must make it very clear that the responsibility is not on the Chinese side,” he said.Sun also accused Indian troops of breaking consensus reached by the corps commanders during their June 6 meeting and provoking the clash in the Galwan Valley. In response to a question on China not providing details of its casualties, he indicated this was part of goodwill from the Chinese side not to increase tensions.The envoy also sought to imply that India’s position on interpreting the LAC could lead to new disputes. Noting the purpose of clarifying the LAC was to maintain peace in border areas, he said: “However, if one side unilaterally delimits the LAC as per its own understanding during the negotiations, that could create some new disputes and that will be a departure from the original purpose.”Sun sidestepped most questions during the seminar, answered a query on why the Galwan Valley was in focus, even though both sides didn’t have a dispute in the area for decades, by giving details on Pangong Lake and made vague generalisations about “win-win cooperation”, consensus developed through the informal summits and civilisational contacts dating back thousands of years.Strategic affairs expert Brahma Chellaney believes Beijing is trying to impose a new status quo along the LAC. “China’s intentionally false claim that ‘disengagement is complete in most places’ is part of its effort to impose the new status quo its aggression has created in five Ladakh hotspots: Pangong Lake, Gogra, Hot Springs, Galwan Valley and Depsang. The ball is in India’s court now,” Chellaney tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rejects-china-s-claims-on-completion-of-disengagement/story-GjJGQaZ2nRVMFah4QwfxrM.html
30-07-2020||India||Final-year exams vital: UGC||New Delhi: The July 6 directive asking universities to hold final year and terminal semester exams by September-end is intended to protect the academic future of students that will be irreparably damaged if these tests are not held, the University Grants Commission (UGC) told the Supreme Court on Thursday. The decision has been taken keeping in mind the students’ health and safety and courts should not normally intervene in academic decisions and policies concerning standards and quality of education, the higher education regulator added.“All universities/institutions in the country are obliged to conduct terminal semester/final year examination by the end of September 2020. The UGC took the decision to protect the academic future of students across the country while also keeping in mind their health and safety,” UGC said in an affidavit.The affidavit was filed in response to a batch of petitions challenging the July 6 directive. A Covid-19 positive student is among the petitioners who have sought cancellation of the examinations in view of the pandemic. The Shiv Sena’s youth wing, Yuva Sena, is also one of the petitioners.The petitioners have sought directions for UGC to consider scrapping the tests and to declare results by July 31 based on past performance or internal assessment of students.A Supreme Court bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah issued a notice to UGC on Monday.UGC on July 6 said universities and colleges will have to hold their final-year or final-semester examinations by September 30 after the Union home ministry approved the holding of these tests. It said the examinations can be held either online, or offline , or using a combination of both. For other students, UGC allowed universities and colleges to choose their own method to close the academic session. Students missing the exams in September will get another chance, and universities will conduct special exams “as and when feasible”, UGC said on July 6.The UGC said its directive adequately takes into account the evolving situation of the pandemic as sufficient time is being provided to conduct the examinations after following the prescribed procedures and protocols related to Covid-19. “It gives sufficient flexibility to universities to conduct exams online offline or blended (online and offline) mode and provide for examination through special chance for students who are unable to appear for the examinations by September 2020. Concerns of the petitioners have been more than adequately addressed by UGC,” the affidavit said.Prof Atul Khosla, Pro Vice Chancellor of Himachal Pradesh based Shoolini University, which has already competed the semester after holding online examinations, said it was important for the students to move on.“For many Indian universities that have a continuous assessment system, performance in midterm examinations and assignments can be used to calculate grades in times like today. For others, if end semester exams are not feasible, assignments or project work can also be used as an alternative to calculate grades,” he said.“Many new age universities like ours have used proctoring and AI based Technology for conducting online examinations”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/final-year-exams-vital-ugc/story-S5dQaGju4IugRMf0bKePHN.html

BSP national general secretary Satish Mishra and BJP lawmaker Madan Dilawar filed a separate petition in the HC against the merger on Tuesday, saying the move by the MLAs was unconstitutional as neither the state BSP nor the party at the national level had merged with the Congress — a contention the Congress has rejected. Garg said the next hearing in the case would take place on August 11 by when the six BSP MLAs — Sandeep Yadav (Tijara), Wajib Ali (Nagar), Deepchand Kheria (Kisangarh Bas), LakhanMeena (Karauli) and Rajendra Gudha (Udaipurwati) — assembly speaker CP Joshi and secretary of assembly secretariat have been asked to submit their replies. While BSP national general secretary Satish Mishra Garg appeared for the BSP, Harish Salve attended the hearing for the BJP MLA. Both appeared through video conferencing. The Congress argues that two thirds of the members of a legislature party are eligible to join another political party or form a separate party. It says that since all six BSP MLAs in the assembly changed camps, the move is not illegal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raj-hc-issues-notices-to-speaker-six-bsp-mlas/story-4lEsUIVpQB4h7Jq2TPcqNL.html

The water was filled with debris, due to which the MLA from Dharchula received minor injuries. Those accompanying him managed to get him out of the flowing rivulet. When contacted over phone, Dhami said he had gone to Lumti and Mori village affected by heavy rainfall. “While I was returning and crossing a rivulet, there was a sudden rise in the water level. The water was filled with heavy muck and flowing debris. I lost control and fell. I got carried away for some distance, but over a dozen people who were accompanying me, managed to save me and get me out of the rivulet,” he said. Dhami said he was given first aid by army personnel deputed nearby. “I have injured my leg. Now I am moving to Dharchula town where I will get myself checked by doctors,” he said. “The situation in these affected areas is very serious. Water and muck is flowing down the hillside in huge quantities. The villagers have taken shelter in a nearby area and want to be shifted. I have been demanding chopper service for the last three years to help people in this affected area,” he said. Due to heavy rainfall in some areas and higher reaches of the state, the water level has risen and connectivity to many villages has been affected. In hilly areas, the mountain rivulets are flowing with more water along with muck and debris like rocks and branches of trees, making it dangerous for locals to cross them. State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) media in-charge Praveen Alok said SDRF teams shifted 50 people from Pithoragarh’s Byula village, a landslide prone area to a safer area six km away. The SDRF personnel also built a temporary bridge in Lumti village in Pithoragarh and helped around 40 villagers to cross the swollen rivulet, he said. In Chamoli district’s Trikhola village, five cows were buried under the debris after a landslide. On getting information about the incident, a SDRF team left for the area One vehicle also fell into a river in Dehradun district near Laldhang. There were two people in the vehicle. One swam back to the bank on his own while the other person got washed away. His body was fished out by a SDRF team. He has been identified as Ajay Kumta, 24 from Shimla, Alok said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-congress-mla-slips-and-falls-into-flooded-rivulet-video-goes-viral/story-MB1Q6BdtTkUQ540ntY7S0J.html

30-07-2020||India||As Odisha’s Covid-19 tally crosses 30k-mark, BJP tells state govt to seek Centre’s help||As the Covid-19 cases in Odisha crossed the 30,000-mark on Thursday, opposition BJP said that the ruling-Biju Janata Dal should rise above politics and seek Centre’s help to fight the coronavirus pandemic.The state reported 1,203 new cases in the past 24 hours, taking its tally to 30,378 while 10 deaths in the same period took the toll to 169. With 9,857 active cases, Odisha now has more active cases than MP, J&K, Haryana, Assam and Punjab. Ganjam, its hotspot district, now has close to 10, 000 cases. Advocating the need to seek Centre’s help in tackling the pandemic, BJP state general secretary Bhrugu Buxipatra said that when Delhi lost its grip on Covid crisis management, the Aam Aadmi Party approached Union home minister Amit Shah for help. “Maharashtra also sought Centre’s help. Similarly, the Odisha government should now seek Centre’s help in managing the crisis and curb the spread of virus in the state. In the last four months, BJP has extended its help in containing the situation in Ganjam. However the state has completely mismanaged (the situation),” alleged Buxipatra. “Even though the situation remains grim in Ganjam, the BJD government is not paying any heed to our demands.”The BJP leader said that after demands grew louder, the state government announced setting up of a 100-bed hospital for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in Ganjam. “Fifteen days later, the hospital is only on paper. Moreover, we have demanded to increase testing in the district; that is also falling on deaf ears. The state government has failed in all aspects to put a brake on the spread of the virus,” said Buxipatra.The BJD did not comment on the BJP’s demands. However, a health official said that the state’s Covid fatality ratio is the lowest in the country and the state has the capability of conducting around 20,000 tests a day.“Odisha has all necessary infrastructure in adequate quantity. Today, Odisha has 54 labs in all 30 districts where samples can be tested for novel Coronavirus. Out of these, 35 are government labs while nine are private. We have sufficiently increased our testing capacity. So come forward for testing. Our case positivity rate is low, the testing rate is increasing and Covid fatality ratio of our state is the lowest in the country. All our labs have been approved by the ICMR and their reports are very much authentic. I request people not to suspect the labs based on the results of Covid tests,” said NHM mission director Shalini Pandit.Pandit said in Ganjam district, the state government is carrying out 1,500 to 2,000 tests per day. “We could test more people and isolate them. Due to this, over the last three to four days, the positivity rate in Ganjam has reduced,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-odisha-s-covid-19-tally-crosses-30k-mark-bjp-tells-state-govt-to-seek-centre-s-help/story-SQBb8mhtVf7g8RQveLcepM.html
30-07-2020||India||Delhi youth arrested in Bhopal for defamatory videos against CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan||A young man from New Delhi was arrested from a hospital in Bhopal by the crime branch of Bhopal Police on Thursday for allegedly spreading rumours related to Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, additional superintendent of police (ASP), Crime Branch, Bhopal said. Rajan Singh called a press conference in Bhopal around noon on Thursday but he was arrested by the crime branch in the morning. Earlier, the police had registered an FIR on Tuesday against Rajan Singh, 21, under Sections 501 (Printing or engraving matter known to be defamatory), 505 (making statements conducing to public mischief) and 188 (punishment for disobedience to an order duly promulgated by a public servant) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). ASP, crime branch, Gopal Dhakad said, “Since CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan declared on Twitter on Saturday that he had tested Covid-19 positive, Rajan Singh has been spreading rumours on social media by showing some fake reports and claiming that the CM is lying.” “We arrested him from a hospital on Thursday. Singh is presently residing in Bhopal to carry out some research on malnutrition as he claims but his credentials are doubtful. Initially, he claimed to be a medico and later he said he was conferred a doctorate degree by a private university. We are interrogating him to know as to why he is spreading rumours. Is this a part of a publicity stunt or is there someone else who is using him to malign the image of the CM.” Rajan Singh on Tuesday released a video questioning the Covid-19 reports of CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and also the credibility of a hospital administration where the CM is taking treatment. In another video released on Wednesday from a private hospital, Rajan Singh said, “I have just requested the CM to show his reports but police registered an FIR against me.

30-07-2020||India||Deliberations being held to identify first group of people to receive Covid-19 vaccine: Officials||Policymakers are actively holding deliberations to identify groups of people who will first receive the Covid-19 vaccine when it is developed, officials said. Speaking at an international symposium on Novel Ideas in Science and Ethics of Vaccines against Covid-19 pandemic, Officer on Special Duty (OSD) in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Rajesh Bhushan said prioritising who should get the vaccine first is a topic being discussed both within and outside the government. “There is an emerging consensus that frontline workers are the people who have the best claim over who should get the vaccine first. But while that question engages us and there is no finality on the question, the issue of who will be on priority list and who comes after frontline healthcare workers and that is if they come first, then who are the people that would follow them,” he said. He said deliberations are on whether it will be the elderly or it will be people with co-morbidities or whether it will be people placed in socio-economic disadvantage whose immunity has been weakened because of prolonged exposure to poverty and malnutrition. “So these are the questions presently engaging the policymakers within Government of India,” he said. NITI Aayog member V K Paul who is also part of the Covid-19 national taskforce said policymakers are actively deliberating to prioritise the groups of people who will first receive the Covid-19 vaccine once it is developed. “India’s journey for a safe, effective and affordable Covid-19 vaccine shall be driven by the best scientific and ethical principles and for that our regulatory and scientific mechanisms are already in place,” he said at the symposium. He said India’s journey to scale up and access to vaccines by all will be in full compliance with the high principles of equity and human rights. “We cannot accept a situation where the rich have the vaccine and not the poor. This is simply unacceptable. We will ensure that pathways are created. We are also working actively to prioritise the groups that should receive the vaccine before the other group and those decisions are in the active stage of being deliberated upon,” he added. Paul said India visualises its capabilities against Covid-19, including the vaccines, not just for the country and its citizens but for the world and humanity. “The Indian government values and welcomes international partnerships, technical exchange, knowledge sharing and collective discourse in this journey,” Paul said. Indian Medical Research Institute (ICMR) Director General Balram Bhargava said once a safe and effective vaccine is developed there will be four major challenges. “One is prioritisation and fair distribution to vulnerable groups, second is logistics of vaccine rollout, including cold chain, and third is stockpiling and fourth is training people who will administer this vaccine,” he said. “In context of these four points, India will have to play a significant role and I can assure you that it is a part India will play with great care and responsibility. It will require immense collaboration across borders keeping in mind the noblest principles of science and humanity,” he added. Underlining that the need for a vaccine is both great and urgent, Bhargava said a dilemma is that the pandemic is going at a devastating pace and to develop a vaccine one needs time and it is not only for science part of it, but ethics and the regulatory and social considerations that need to be kept in mind. “We need to crystallize a mix and match of these ideas which may run in parallel with the right balance of the speed and safety. A balance between speed and safety has to be maintained once we crystallize novel ideas,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deliberations-being-held-to-identify-first-group-of-people-to-receive-covid-19-vaccine-officials/story-E3gJDbc9RgR9o2KTUGkOHO.html

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has dedicated this ‘achievement’ to good planning of the government and the hard work of health officials and asked people to continue the vigil as the battle has only been half won.“The state’s mortality rate in 0.3 per cent whereas the national average is 2.21 per cent. With good planning and vigil we have contained the spread to an extent. In 6 months our total cases are 22,302 but in some states this is the daily number,” said the CM. He said the state had formulated its disease-control protocol even before the Indian Council of Medical Research formulated its guidelines. He added there were many attempts to “belittle the state’s track record and portray its achievements in bad light” but the government continued its work without any distraction and results are there to see. “Our effective management and planning have helped contain the spread. Our contract tracing method and route maps of the infected were the first in the country,” said the CM.However, the opposition accused the state of fudging data to maintain its records. “The CM is taking credit for everything including people’s general awareness and the state’s grassroot health system. Many deaths fail to appear in the government’s list these days. And its testing rates are the lowest in the country, 212 in 10 lakh population,” opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said.Kerala has reported 506 fresh cases today taking the total to 22,302. Out of this, active cases are 10,060 and 12,618 patients have recovered. With two more casualties, the death toll has gone up to 72 in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/battle-only-half-won-says-cm-as-kerala-completes-6-months-since-detection-of-1st-covid-19-case/story-iOsnYVUS6ZpLvG9k30fWJL.html

30-07-2020||India||A dose of comedy is the need of the hour, says Yogesh Tripathi||Shooting back-to-back for two daily soaps during ongoing Covid 19 crisis is nowhere an easy task. But, for actor Yogesh Tripathi — best known as ‘daroga’ Happu Singh — it was his calling and passion that made him one of the first few actors who resumed shooting and today he is glad to be back to work. “When we commenced shooting, we had no bank of episodes left with us. So we had to start from square one. During the initial days of the shoot for the show ‘Happu Ki Ultan Pultan’ I was literally in every frame. Kids were not there and as some were joining from different cities so they were quarantined for 15 days. Ultimately, the pressure was on me. Thankfully, now, it’s better and we have started building a bank of new episodes,” said the UPite over the phone. The actor is shooting six days a week. “In this ‘coronakaal’ people need light entertainment and stories that they can connect with and something that can make them laugh. During the lockdown, audience was just watching repeat shows and intense OTT series so a daily dose of laughter was a miss. The repeat of our previous shows came as a big relief when everything was on hold,” he said. Giving an insight about the safety measures he is taking, Yogesh said, “We are talking lot of safety precautions right from the entry point. It starts with sanitation, check-ups with health machines and then rooms are sanitised multiple times. Besides, you can’t write scenes which attracts many people close-by and scheduling is also done in a way that artistes don’t have to be together for long time. Hope vaccines are out soon and we go back to the old normal.” The versatile actor prefers to carry home-cooked food and warm water to the sets. “Now, everyone eat separately in their own corners and no luncheons are happening so home-cooked food is the best for now. Everyone in the team has got their medical tests done. Besides safety measures, I am working on my immunity as that is the only thing we can take care of at present.” Since the sets of ‘Bhabiji Ghar Par Hain’ and ‘Happu…’ are on walking distance it’s easier for him. “When I was doing both ‘Bhabiji…’ and ‘Jajaji Chhat Per Hain’ then it was little tough but now with these two shows I play the same character it’s much easier. I have been shooting for them for years now. I started with playing ‘atrangi’ (different characters) in the hit show ‘F.I.R.’ with same producer and director so when you work with same team for 12 years then the comfort level is high.” Coming from district Rath near Jhansi, Yogesh has a close connection with the state capital. “Lucknow se to ‘gehra rangmanch ka naata hai’ (I have deep theatrical connect with the city). I have done theatre here for four years. I was living in Indira Nagar and have done NSD workshop that were held in Lucknow. I was closely working with Bhartendu Natya Academy (BNA) mainly with Urmil Kumar Thapliyalji. I am looking forward to come to the city again.” His UP background helped him in developing his character for the ongoing shows, “The unique speaking style of my character was my own idea where I thought to combine Bundelkhandi and Brijbhasha to create an interesting lingo. The writer Manoj Santoshi also hails from Lucknow so he too added a lot of local flavour to my character,” he shared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/a-dose-of-comedy-is-the-need-of-the-hour-says-yogesh-tripathi/story-6R5RCRBPaq1Jhn4dAOqH6O.html

Over 39.6 lakh people in 972 panchayats in 108 blocks of 14 districts have been affected by floods while 11 people have lost their lives.Most of the rivers are flowing above danger marks at several places while others are showing a rising trend, an official of the water resource department of north Bihar said on Thursday.The Burhi Gandak was flowing nearly 1.5 meter above the danger mark at Sikandapur in Muzaffarpur town while the Bagmati had touched 56 meter at Kataujha, nearly 0.75 meter above the danger mark. Gandak was flowing at 54.31 meter near Rewaghat, barely 10 cm below the danger mark.A Darbhanga-based lawyer Sudhir Kumar Choudhary, who is stranded in his native village under Hanuman Nagar block for a week due to floods, said, “The power supply was snapped in the entire area after inundation of Poariya sub-station over a week ago.”The state-highway between Darbhanga and Samastipur was flooded at several places between Taralahi village to Bishunpur. The district administration has enforced restrictions on plying of heavy vehicles through the marooned region.A bulletin issued by the Central Flood Control Room stated that extreme flood situation continued even as the Adhwara river at Bishunpur was flowing at 48.71 metre, 1.31 metre above the danger level on Thursday morning.The flood situation in Kusheshwar Asthan block continues to remain grim even as swollen Kosi, Kamla Balan and Kareh rivers inundate villages. Darbhanga district magistrate Thiyagrajan SM said district administration was taking all measures to mitigate the miseries of flood-hit people by setting up community kitchens, providing boats and medical assistance.Muzaffarpur district disaster management officer Atul Kumar Verma said all precautionary measures were being taken to save the town from Budhi Gandak as its water had entered into six places around the town periphery and breached the safety and ring bunds.“We are focusing to save the national highway 77 apart from the railway track along the Muzaffarpur-Sitamarhi sections of NHAI and East Centeral Railway,” he said, apprehending that the flood water would enter in Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital if any breach will occur along NH 77.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/11-dead-40-lakh-affected-as-flood-situation-worsens-in-bihar/story-MxrrSu1cjwOY5F0c1OyP6L.html

30-07-2020||India||Bihar engages ex-AG Mukul Rohatgi to oppose Rhea Chakraborty’s plea in SC||In a major development on Thursday in the case of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, the Bihar government has hired India’s former attorney general Mukul Rohatgi to oppose Bollywood actress Rhea Chakraborty’s interim prayer that the probe by the state’s police be stayed till the Supreme Court decides her plea on transfer of investigation from Bihar to Mumbai. Principal additional advocate general, Bihar, Lalit Kishore confirmed that Nitish Kumar’s government is set to oppose Rhea Chakraborty’s plea before the top court and support Sushant’s family in the case. “The caveat has already been filed,” he said. Soon after Rhea moved the Supreme Court, Sushant Singh’s family filed a caveat seeking that her petition not be allowed to be heard “ex-parte” in their counter-petition. The family’s lawyer Vikas Singh will be present in the court for the proceedings. Caveat is a type of petition filed to pre-empt any ex-parte order on the plea filed by opposite side.Rhea Chakraborty, who has been accused of abetting Sushant’s suicide, moved the apex court on Wednesday pleading for the transfer of the investigation from Bihar to Mumbai, as the investigation in Mumbai was still pending. Following pressure by Sushant’s family members, the Bihar government is also likely to recommend a CBI probe into the ‘’mysterious’’ suicide of the actor.Officials at the state police headquarters said he police was already investigating the case, but the government might recommend a CBI inquiry into the matter in following the demand of the bereaved family members.Officials said a four-member Patna police team has made progress in the case and had extensively interrogated six members including cook of the actor. The official said that Bihar government had the right to recommend a CBI probe. The government is waiting for the return of police team from Mumbai after collecting evidences. The Patna police team also visited Kotak Bank’s Bandra West branch in Mumbai where the late actor had an account.The visit of the Patna police team has caused friction with Maharastra with the state’s minister of state for home Shambhuraj Desai alleging that Bihar policemen did not follow protocol.“Whenever a police team from a state visits another state for investigation, there are some protocols which are to be followed. These were not followed,” Desai told a news channel.But Central Range IG (Bihar) Sanjay Singh told HT that the Patna police team left Bihar following his order and informed Mumbai police when team arrived there.Y V Giri, a senior advocate in the Patna high court said that if Sushant’s family moves the SC for a CBI probe, court will hear the plea and recommend the probe. He said if state government wants to transfer the matter to the CBI, it can also do so legally.Another senior advocate Yogesh Chandra Verma told reporters said that Bihar government is well within the right to recommend a CBI probe. Meanwhile, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has asked Bihar police to give the copy of the FIR registered by it. The ED is likely to probe into the alleged money laundering angle in the sensational case.Reports had claimed that the actor’s father in his complaint had mentioned that around Rs 15 crore was transferred to various unknown accounts from Sushant’s bank account. The central probe agency has stepped in to probe the alleged financial irregularities in the late Bollywood actor’s two companies Vividrage Rheality and Front India for World Foundation. Rhea and her brother Showik are the directors in the first company. Showik is also a director in the second one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-engages-ex-ag-mukul-rohatgi-to-oppose-rhea-chakraborty-s-plea-in-sc/story-Uk2wPjHeeSbM84RvkLG99O.html

Gandhi on July 1 was asked to vacate her bungalow, 35 Lodhi Estate in Delhi, within a month on the ground that she is ineligible for the entitlement, as she no longer enjoys the security cover of the Special Protection Group (SPG).She will be residing in a temporary accommodation until a more permanent accommodation in Delhi rented by her is ready for use, Congress said in a statement on Thursday.“Priyanka Gandhi Vadra handed over the possession of 35 Lodhi Estate, previously allotted to her on Security Grounds, to the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) today. JE of CPWD Shri. P Senthil Kumar in the presence of Shri. Vikas Rana, CE (NDZ-I) CPWD, Shri. Yogesh Kumar Kardam, AE (PAWD-I, CPWD), Shri. Manoj Kumar Chauhan, AE, CPWD Services, Shri B.S. Rana, JE (PAWD-I, CPWD) accepted the keys to the bungalow on behalf of the CPWD after a full inspection establishing that the house was handed over in good condition. They have issued her a “Vacation Report” for the premises on behalf of the CPWD,” Congress said in a statement on Thursday.Hindustan Times has reviewed a copy of the vacation report issued on Thursday. The department of estate confirmed the development to HT. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs did not comment on the matter when contacted by HT.“Smt. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has also passed on to the CPWD and the Directorate of Estates, a full inventory of privately installed fittings, fixtures etc. She has paid all electricity, water and previous dues and is awaiting the final assessment for the licence fee of the month of July from the Directorate of Estates due to her on the 31st July to close all accounts with reference to the allotment and subsequent cancellation of the lease of the government bungalow,” Congress said.She was allotted the Lodhi Estate bungalow on February 21, 1997, as an SPG protectee.Priyanka Gandhi on July 14 had rubbished claims that she had requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi for an extension of the tenure beyond August 1.“This is FAKE NEWS. I have not made any such request to the government. As per the eviction letter handed to me on July 1, I will be vacating the government accommodation at 35 Lodhi Estate by August 1,” she had tweeted.Urban affairs minister Hardeep Puri had alleged that a “powerful Congress leader” had requested him to let her stay on at 35 Lodhi Estate on July 4, three days after the eviction notice was served on her.“Facts speak for themselves! A powerful Congress leader with much clout in the party called me on July 4 at 12.05 pm to request that 35, Lodhi Estate be allotted to another Congress MP so that Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra can stay on. Let’s not sensationalise everything please,” Puri had tweeted.In the order issued by the department of estate, the ministry had stated that any stay longer than August 1, the government order said, will attract “damage charges and penal rent” as per rules.Hours after the notice was served to her on July 1, she paid off all her pending dues, amounting to Rs 3,46,677, until June 30, the ministry had said.“Upon withdrawal of SPG protection and grant of Z+ security cover my ministry of home affairs, which does not have provision for allotment/retention of government accommodation on security grounds to you, the allotment of Type 6B house No 35, Lodhi estate is cancelled,” the notice had said.The allotment of Central government bungalows is done through the General Pool Residential Accommodation (GPRA) Rules, 2017, of the directorate of estates.The ministry has already allotted the bungalow to Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Rajya Sabha member and party spokesperson, Anil Baluni. Officials familiar with the development told HT that the ministry has allotted the type 6B bungalow to Baluni.“Talked to Mr Anil Baluni and his wife today. I pray to God for his good health and happiness. I give my best wishes to them for the new house and hope that they too get as much happiness in the house as I and my family got,” Gandhi had tweeted on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-vacates-delhi-bungalow-will-be-residing-in-temporary-accommodation-says-congress/story-cvgSVttHQXlh6AxGRjvjVO.html
30-07-2020||India||Meet 95-year-old ‘Rani of Jhansi’ who beat coronavirus||When 95-year-old Maan Kunwar walked out of the Rani Laxmi Bai Medical College, Jhansi, having been victorious in her battle against the coronavirus disease there were cheers and applause from the medical fraternity and the public. “She is the ‘Rani of Jhansi’. She battled coronavirus for seven days and defeated the disease despite being 95,” said a person from the crowd.Maan Kunwar, who seemed ‘anxious’ on July 19 when she was admitted to the Covid ward of the medical college, is now undergoing the mandatory seven-day home quarantine. “This (her cure) has happened because of her indomitable spirit and the medical staff’s dedication, who did not mind her occasional flare-ups,” said Dr Anshul Jain, superintendent in-charge of the Covid-19 hospital. “She was worried at first as it was the first time she was in a hospital and away from her family members. She was asymptomatic but the RT-PCR test had found her Covid positive,” said her son Chote Lal living in Talpura, Jhansi. She largely remained inside the ward and had no medical condition but episodic blood pressure, the son added. On day one, she was scared of the doctors and medical staff in their protective gears around her. She called them ‘Betaal’, a ghost, and thereafter struggled to beat her fears and eventually the coronavirus. Jain said the patients at this age take time to adapt to the hospital environment. “She gelled in well, the junior doctors made her talk with her family members on the phone and arranged video calls too,” he said. “She was given a turmeric (haldi) mixed milk and food on her bed, the staff grew fond of her. She was comfortable from the second day,” he said. After recovery, she was discharged on July 25 but advised seven-day home quarantine in accordance with the Covid protocol. While leaving the ward, a woman medical staff member joked with her: “Ammaji ham log ‘Betaal’ nahin hain (we are not ghosts).”Maan Kunwar chuckled and said ‘Tu toh pari hai beti (you are a fairy)” while walking out of the ward, giving hope to others who continue to fight the virus. District magistrate, Jhansi, Andhra Vamsi said whoever has good immunity and does not lead a sedentary lifestyle, has a fairly good chance of overcoming this infection.“Healthy diet, physical exercise and boosting immunity through a balanced lifestyle and diet improves lymphatic activity,” he said. In Jhansi, 2,166 people have tested positive so far and 1,180 people recovered in the last 57 days with the recovery rate being at 54.57%. Whilethere are 921 active cases, 65 people have died in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meet-95-year-old-rani-of-jhansi-who-beat-coronavirus/story-caLeDvwVDe4kYCokrP6AlI.html

30-07-2020||India||Bihar extends lockdown to combat rising cases of Covid-19||Failing to arrest the surge of Covid-19 cases, the Bihar government on Thursday decided to extend lockdown till August 16. The state government had reimposed lockdown from July 16 till July 31. Bihar has reported 48,001 Covid-19 cases to date, including 2,082 on Thursday. In fact from July 25 till July 30, cases have jumped from 36,314 to 48,001. A notification issued by the state home department said that restrictions will remain in force in State headquarter, district headquarter, sub-divisonal headquarter, blocks and all municipal areas in the state of Bihar with effect from August 1 till August 16. No public transport would be allowed to ply in areas falling under fresh lockdown norms, but there would be no bar on construction activities, state officials said.

30-07-2020||India||Tax on auto fuel in India is fifth highest after UK, Italy, France and Germany: EY Report||Taxes on petrol and diesel in India is about 66% of their pump rates, which is the fifth highest after the United Kingdom, Italy, France and Germany, an EY India’s report said.Taxes on auto fuels in Spain, Japan, Canada and the US are; however, lower than India, the consultancy firm said in its latest edition of Economy Watch.“According to our estimate, the share of petroleum taxes in India in the case of petrol and diesel accounted for 66.4% and 65.8% respectively in June 2020. These rates indicate the average share for the month in Delhi which is taken as representative of the Indian situation,” it said on Thursday.While the UK had the highest tax rates among the nine countries – 71.1% of the retail rate of petrol and 68.1% of diesel in June -- the levy was the lowest in the US at 23.1% on petrol and 23.3% on diesel, it said.“Since retail prices of petroleum products have a potential inflationary impact through transport and energy costs, this matter needs to be carefully monitored as the fiscal year progresses,” the report said. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released on July 13 recorded an inflation rate of 6.1% in June 2020.DK Srivastava, chief policy advisor of EY India said the CPI inflation rate was in excess of the prescribed upper tolerance limit of 6% in December 2019, January 2020 and February 2020 at 7.4%, 7.6% and 6.6%, respectively, indicating that the monetary policy framework has been breached in the Covid-19 period and some months preceding it.“The Centre’s Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBMA) threshold for fiscal deficit is also likely to be breached in FY21 with the Centre’s estimated fiscal deficit at 5.6% or above of the estimated GDP [gross domestic product]. These exceptions may well be justified given the extraordinary situation created by the global pandemic. These also point to weaknesses in the monetary and fiscal policy frameworks since these were not designed to cope with such structural economic breaks as posed by a calamity like Covid-19,” he said.Srivastava said as petroleum products still remain outside the Goods and Services Tax (GST) both central and state governments have been increasing the non-GST taxes on them leading to high retail prices even as global crude prices remain low.Anupam Manur, assistant professor at the think-tank Takshashila Institution, said, “While it is understandable for the government to find any means of raising taxes and revenue at this point, it is unwise to further squeeze the consumers. By imposing higher taxes on an inelastic product such as fuel, the government might get additional revenue, but at the risk of shrinking disposable income and dampening consumer expenditure, which is vital to the revival of the economy, which will ultimately lead to higher tax collection.”“Apart from choking consumer spending, higher taxes on fuel will also have a cascading effect on prices of commodities, which can be severe when combined with the ongoing supply shock. It would end up exacerbating the cost of production to industries which are reeling at the moment,” he said.SC Sharma, an energy expert and former officer on special duty at the erstwhile Planning Commission, said that some developed countries deliberately impose high taxes on petrol and diesel on the grounds of protecting environment.“There are large number of developed and developing countries which have been levying high taxes on petrol and diesel as a source of revenue. India is not an exception. Also current rationalization of excise on both MS [motor spirit or petrol] and HSD [high speed diesel or diesel] has been able to bring price parity of both diesel and petrol like many other countries, which is a good sign,” he said. While, diesel is costlier than petrol in most of the countries, in India diesel rates were lower than petrol due to duty differential. Pump prices of diesel crossed petrol for the first time on June 24, 2020, when petrol was sold at Rs 79.76 per litre and diesel at Rs 79.88 a litre in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tax-on-auto-fuel-in-india-is-fifth-highest-after-uk-italy-france-and-germany-ey-report/story-o1udDvZdXeyAfvyXtzFZuK.html
30-07-2020||India||BJP bets big on Somu Veerraju to resurrect party in Andhra Pradesh||The appointment of senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader Somu Veerraju as president of BJP Andhra Pradesh unit is believed to be part of a well-laid out strategy of the saffron party to emerge as a powerful political force in the state.The BJP, in 2019 failed to win a single Lok Sabha or state assembly seat and got just 0.84 of the total vote share, is aiming at replacing the Telugu Desam Party as a potential alternative to the ruling YSR Congress Party in the next four years.It is for this reason that the party is learnt to have chosen Veerraju as the state BJP president. Unlike his predecessor Kanna Lakshminarayana, who defected to the BJP after enjoying several positions in the Congress party till 2014, Veerraju is a hardcore loyalist of the party with strong Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh background. He has been with the party for quite a long time, holding several positions in the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, later in the state BJP and in the national council of the party.Importantly Veerraju has been the hardest critic of the TDP, with which the BJP had an alliance in the 2014 elections. “Politically, I have been opposing TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu because he had not allowed the BJP to grow independently in Andhra Pradesh, before or after the bifurcation,” he said.He pointed out that it was Naidu who always benefited from the BJP by forging an alliance to suit his party’s interests. “He had allied with the BJP in 1999 elections to take advantage of the image of Vajpayee in the post-Kargil war scenario. He conveniently dumped the BJP after losing the elections in 2004. He again returned to the BJP fold after realising that there was a Narendra Modi wave in the country,” Veerraju told a local television channel after taking over as the state BJP president on Tuesday.In the 2019 elections, the TDP faced a humiliating defeat winning only 23 seats in the 175-member state assembly and only three out of 25 Lok Sabha seats in the state. The TDP party has been facing a series of desertions since then – three of its MLAs and a large number of powerful party leaders defected to the YSRCP, while three of his Rajya Sabha members switched loyalties to the BJP. Many others are also said to be looking towards greener pastures.“That is precisely why the BJP sees an opportunity to grow independently in Andhra. While the YSRCP is too powerful, the TDP is weakening gradually. Naidu is ageing and one does not know whether he will have the energy to defeat the YSRCP in 2024. And there is no second rung leadership in the TDP. So, the BJP is hoping to fill the vacuum with the support of Jana Sena Party floated by actor Pawan Kalyan,” political analyst S Rama Krishna said.Second, like Lakshminarayana, Veerraju also represents Kapu community, a powerful and politically strong caste group in the state. Since Pawan Kalyan is also from the same community, the BJP wants to consolidate this Kapu vote bank which accounts for nearly 15.2 per cent of the population in the state.“As the YSRCP led by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is going all out to decimate the TDP, we may see a largescale exodus of the TDP leaders and cadre into the BJP. At the same time, the BJP will aggressively take up the fight on issues concerning the people so that it would be seen as a powerful opposition party,” Rama Krishna said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-bets-big-on-somu-veerraju-to-resurrect-party-in-andhra-pradesh/story-U04LAaEzzVoslBhhJJ8MjK.html

The court issued the notices on a petition by the BSP seeking disqualification of these MLAs.“With two-third majority, a party can merge and defect, here all six merged into Congress…Mayawati’s complaint is not justified as all six MLAs joined the Congress. I believe she is making statements on directions of the BJP. The way BJP is misusing CBI, ED, IT to threaten all has never been seen. Mayawati is also fearful and is making statements under pressure,” Gehlot said outside the Fairmont hotel on the outskirts of Jaipur, where MLAs loyal to him have been camping. The BSP said Gehlot’s comments were baseless. BSP state president Bhagwan Singh Baba said the merger of six MLAs was illegal as a national party cannot be merged at state level without the approval of the party chief. “The CM allegations are baseless. The BSP chief had conveyed her annoyance twice as Gehlot poached our MLAs. It’s not the first time but in 2008 when they first poached, we had approached court and the Speaker. Then, the BSP was supporting the Congress at the Centre and there was no BJP at the Centre. Mayawati had stated that Gehlot wants to wipe out BSP in Rajasthan,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mayawati-targeting-congress-under-bjp-s-pressure-says-ashok-gehlot/story-08sDkHD0F5s9mCa8RCLu2H.html

30-07-2020||India||Eid-ul-Adha to be low key affair in south India due to Covid-19 pandemic||Eid-ul-Adha is likely to be a low-key affair in most southern states in view of the steep surge in Covid-19 cases. In Telangana, it will be celebrated on August 1 but in Kerala and parts of Karnataka, Eid it will be on Friday (July 31).In Telangana, the government has said that there will be no mass congregation prayers nor will there be open slaughtering of cattle, goats, and sheep for distribution of meat among the poor, which is an integral part of the festival. Muslims normally sacrifice an animal on Eid-ul-Adha.In Karnataka too the government has said that only 50 people would be allowed at a time in mosques for prayers and there will be no mass congregations due to the pandemic.The historic Mecca Masjid near Charminar in the old city of Hyderabad will not open for the general public to offer Eid namaz. It was a similar case for Eid-ul-Fitr on May 24 due to Covid-19 pandemic.Maulana Hafeez Mohd Rizwan Qureshi, Imam of Mecca Masjid said the mosque would not be opened for namaz because of the alarming situation prevailing in Hyderabad. “In fact, even after the lifting of the lockdown for places of worship, we have not been allowing the general public regular as well as Friday prayers. Only five persons are being allowed for prayers every Friday,” he said.The Maulana appealed to the people to visit mosques in their respective areas and attend the prayers following guidelines like social distancing and wearing masks. “Stay at your homes after prayers,” he said.Telangana State Wakf Board chairman Mohd Saleem said no congregations for mass prayers would be allowed in any Eidgahs across Telangana for Eid-ul-Adha on August 1. “Namaz-e-Eid will not be held at Eidgah or the open grounds which see large congregations of Muslims. We shall, however, allow prayers in local mosques for a limited number of people,” he said.The Wakf Board chairman said not more than 50 people should offer prayers at each mosque, that too by following the social distancing norms and other precautions to contain the possible spread of the virus. “If necessary, the prayers may be held twice during the day to allow more worshippers,” Saleem said.The mosque committees have been asked to advise senior citizens and children below 10 years not to come to mosques for Eid prayers. Those suffering from cold, fever, cough and comorbidities like diabetes and blood pressure have also been urged to pray at home. The Wakf Board also advised imams to keep their Eid sermons brief.The authorities have also imposed restrictions on sale of cattle, sheep or goats in view of the possibility of spread of Covid-19 at the markets.The Telangana high court on Thursday directed the municipal authorities to see that the slaughtering of cattle, sheep or goats should be done only according to the prescribed norms and there shall be no indiscriminate slaughtering of animals, including camels.The high court pointed out that there were reports of diseases being spread through meat as well. “We know how coronavirus has spread from bat meat in China. So, we need to take all precautions,” the court observed.The municipal authorities have appealed to the people to avoid visiting public places to buy sheep or goats and instead avail the facility provided by officials in every town by earmarking a place on the outskirts for sale and purchase of the animals. “For slaughtering, they should visit the slaughterhouses instead of doing it in public places,” a GHMC official said.In Kerala, Muslim religious leaders during a video conference with chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan last week pledged support to the state government’s fight against the pandemic and decided to limit Eid celebrations this time.The maximum number of devotees at a time in all mosques in Kerala on Friday will be limited to 100 and respective mahal committees will keep an eye on them. There won’t be mass prayers at public places and Covid tests will be conducted on those who are involved in animal sacrifices. Religious leaders said there will be no mass slaughtering of animals and their number will be limited just for the sake of ritual and asked believers to go by the protocol of the government.Governor Arif Mohammad Khan and the CM greeted people on the eve of Edi-ul-Adha which will be celebrated on Friday in Kerala.“Bakrid which glorifies sacrifice and eternal faith in the almighty inspires us to remain united through love, compassion, and mutual support, both in our daily lives and in our fight against the Covid-19,” Khan said in his greetings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eid-ul-adha-to-be-low-key-affair-in-south-india-due-to-covid-19-pandemic/story-o2uSnxhtAuoPsizmwUKTIP.html
30-07-2020||India||Red flags in Delhi over Erdogan’s Turkey funding anti-India activities: Official||Islamist radical organisations in parts of the country including Kerala and Kashmir are being supported and funded by Turkish outfits backed by Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government in Ankara, people familiar with the development have told Hindustan Times.“There is an effort to radicalise Indian muslims and recruit fundamentalists coordinated from Turkey,” a senior government official said, underlining that a recent assessment in New Delhi had noted the emergence of Turkey as “the hub of anti-India activities” next only to Pakistan.Ankara’s attempt to expand its influence among South Asian muslims comes against the backdrop of President Erdogan’s continuing pitch to challenge Saudi Arabia’s dominance in the Islamic world at a global level and offering a reshaped, conservative Turkey with Ottoman traditions as the model for other Islamic nations to follow.The reconversion of the Byzantine cathedral Hagia Sophia to a mosque last week was a giant step in this direction, counted by commentators as a milestone in Turkey’s rebirth as a powerful, muslim nation. The church had been converted into a mosque after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople, now Istanbul - and from mosque to museum in 1934.The change fits in with Erdogan’s long-term plan to project himself as a global protector of muslims, much like the Ottoman Caliphs. He had last year taken baby steps to build an alliance of non-Arab Islamic countries along with a handful of countries including Pakistan’s Imran Khan and Malaysia’s Mahathir Mohamad. Iran and Qatar were also roped in.Pakistan watchers say Islamabad latched on to Turkey’s Erdogan after India deepened its ties with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.Imran Khan, however, backed out of the meeting at the last minute due to pressure from Riyadh but has made up by feting Erdogan - called Sultan by some supporters - at home, even emulating some of his policies back home.Officials believe that Erdogan’s political agenda has driven his government to expand its influence with South Asian muslims, particularly those in India.Indian officials said the Turkish government had funded Kashmir’s hardline separatist leader such as Syed Ali Shah Geelani for years. But it is the rapidly expanding scale of the effort that recently nudged security agencies to carry out an extensive review.The Erdogan government has been funding religious seminars in India, recruiting fundamentalists to radicalise people and even take freshly-minted radicals on all-expense trips to Turkey to reinforce their learnings.The security review also referred to a Kerala-based Islamist radical organisation that had been funds from Turkey for some time.“We are also aware of some people from this group travelling to Qatar to meet some people from Turkey to seek funding for their activities,” a government official said. “That amounts as high as Rs 40 lakh are being offered to preach radical Islam in Kerala”. Besides, officials said Turkey, along with Pakistan, have also been funding Zakir Naik, the controversial Islamic preacher accused of radicalising muslims, via Qatar, a senior official said.Turkey has become Pakistan’s “new Dubai” at a smaller scale, the official added, a reference to the United Arab Emirate’s city that used to be a second home to Pakistan’s ISI between 2000 and 2010 and the epicenter of anti-India activities in west Asia.During this decade, Pakistan’s ISI was able to radicalise some Indians and turn them against their own country. It is also here that the founders of terror group Indian Mujahideen were first radicalised. Since 2014, however, the United Arab Emirates has turned into one of India’s closest partners with no protection or sanctuary for anyone indulging in anti-India activities.Turkey also stepped in early this year when protests broke out over India’s amendment to the citizenship laws, not just to criticise the change that was perceived to potentially hurt the interests of muslims but also with money to keep the protests going, according to an intelligence assessment accessed by HT.Indian security officials believe that much of this radicalisation effort being bankrolled by Ankara was being carried out in coordination with Pakistan’s deep state. To be sure, Erdogan was the only world leader to speak out against India in the UN general assembly over Kashmir.On a visit to Pakistan earlier this year, he went on to assert that Kashmir is as important to Turkey as it is to Pakistan. “Kashmir is and will be the same for us. It was Çanakkale yesterday and it is Kashmir today, he said in February.Turkey is the only country that actively backs Pakistan’s Kashmir agenda in OIC and is also forging close economic ties with China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/erdogan-s-turkey-doesn-t-stop-at-kashmir-barbs-funds-radicalisation-too-official/story-Ct1HpX1q0WLW0exZx8Hv5N.html
30-07-2020||India||Odisha: 78% of poor households about to exhaust PDS rice: Survey||A survey of pension beneficiaries from the four migration- prone districts of Odisha by a non-governmental organisation (NGO) has found that 78% of the households have either exhausted the rice that they had received from the state-run public distribution system (PDS), or about to exhaust their stock over the next fortnight. The dire projections of an acute food shortage came to the fore on the completion of four months of lockdown restrictions, which were imposed in end-March in a bid to prevent the spread of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak and the despite the largesse from the state government for 94 lakh beneficiaries between April and June. The telephonic survey of 63 pension beneficiaries in the four migration-prone districts of Bargarh, Balangir, Kalahandi, and Nuapada was conducted by Odisha Khadya Adhikar Abhiyan, an NGO, between July 1 and 15. The survey found that 16% of the families reported that rice from the PDS was exhausted. While 24% of the families said that the stock of rice would last between two and seven days. Another 38% of the families had a quota that would see them through between eight and 15 days. An overwhelming 73% of the families reported that they had run out of cash to buy rice. The survey also found that 54% of the households had consciously reduced their daily food intake during the lockdown restrictions in a bid to ensure that the ration could last longer amid the pandemic. Out of the 35 families, who had reported eating less during the lockdown restrictions, 37% of them had either no rice at home or the stock could last between two and seven days. On March 21, at the cusp of the viral outbreak in the state, the Naveen Patnaik-led Odisha government had announced largesse for 94 lakh beneficiaries for the next three months. It had pledged to distribute five kilograms (kg) of rice/wheat per head at Re 1 a kg and two litres of kerosene oil for free to ride out the pandemic-triggered lockdown restrictions. The government had also announced Rs 1,000 one-time cash assistance to each of the 94 lakh ration cardholders. It had distributed five and three kg of rice and arhar dal, respectively, to each of the cardholders under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, an initiative under the Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Yojana. The government had also announced Rs 2,000 as an advance for an old-age pension for all the beneficiaries between March and June. However, the NGO, in its survey, found that many of the families spent the pension money on medical and food expenses for their household members. “We found that 57% of the families are worried about food scarcity because of an acute cash crunch. Similarly, 69% of the households reported that they had to borrow money and/or buy food on credit from a local grocer,” said Sameet Panda, who had conducted the survey along with Vipul Kumar. Another telephonic survey, conducted by the Delhi-based National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER), a non-profit economic think-tank, in Bargarh and Dhenkanal districts of Odisha in June, has revealed that 81% of the households experienced a drastic dip in their monthly income. Around 27% of the households in these two districts had no income during the lockdown, while 59.3% had to fall back on their savings or sale assets to tide over the unexpected economic crisis due to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-78-of-poor-households-about-to-exhaust-pds-rice-survey/story-kdzLifUMQmNzHcrmLomAxK.html

It’s my responsibility to ensure that they are seen standing with the government in front of the public,” Gehlot said amid a bitter power struggle with rebel leader Sachin Pilot.After turning down a Cabinet proposal three times, Governor Kalraj Mishra has finally agreed to convene a session of the legislative assembly next month on August 14.ALSO READ | Haryana hotel, resort say Rajasthan MLAs weren’t their guestsAmong the 107 Congress MLAs in the 200-member Rajasthan assembly, Pilot and 18 other dissident legislators have openly defied the party whip and refused to attend Congress party meetings despite being asked to do so.Expressing confidence in his government and MLAs who are supporting him, Gehlot further said, “I’m happy that the Governor finally accepted my request to call the Assembly session sooner as any more delay could have resulted in further horse-trading. Everyone knows horse-trading took place but that won’t affect us, we will complete our full term.” The Congress numbers include six Bahujan Samaj Party MLAs who merged with the ruling party after the 2018 assembly polls. The merger is now being challenged in the high court by the BSP and a BJP MLA.Amid the political turmoil continuing in the state, the Rajasthan high court on Thursday issued notices to the Speaker of the assembly, secretary of assembly secretariat and the six MLAs who had contested elections on Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) tickets and then merged with the Congress later.The court issued the notices while hearing a petition filed by the BSP against the merger of the MLAs into the Congress.The six BSP members of the Rajasthan legislative assembly (MLAs) who had merged with the Ashok Gehlot–led Congress government are Sandeep Yadav, Tijara MLA, Wajib Ali (Nagar), Deepchand Kheria (Kishangarh Bas), Lakhan Meena (Karauli), and Rajendra Gudha (Udaipurwati).The Bharatiya Janata Party has 72 MLAs in the Rajasthan assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/want-those-unhappy-mlas-to-attend-assembly-session-gehlot-on-rebel-legislators-camping-with-pilot/story-IAdbvDpuMJ5MkEdErudb0K.html

The lockdown will be in place until August 12. The lockdown which came into force at 4 am caught most people unawares and even those involved related to essential services were stopped at various places.“There was some confusion in the morning but the administration will consider the issues and smoothen things,” Alwar collector Anadi said Superintendent of police Tejeswani Gautam said that 38 points have been made by the police and 400 police personnel have been deployed in the area to maintain law and order. Barricades have been set up in all areas under the Kotwali police station. According to the lockdown guidelines, there will be relaxation from 7 am to 11 am for essential items such as groceries and milk, but on Thursday this was not followed. The district collector said the lockdown will be a smooth affair from Friday.The business community of the city said that the partial lockdown was unfair to some. They said they requested the district collector for complete lockdown. Alwar has 3,662 Covid-19 cases, out of which 2,157 are active. Rajasthan’s Covid-19 tally stands at over 40,000 cases out of which 11,097 are active cases. The number of deaths in the state is 663. In Udaipur, district collector Chetan Devra extended night curfew from 9 pm to 5 am under section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 and also restricted some commercial activities in the city on the weekend. Devra issued the order on July 27. The restrictions don’t apply to the police officials, medical stores and other essential services. Businessmen, shopkeepers and hoteliers of the city are unhappy with the decision. Some of them met the collector on Wednesday and requested him to allow commercial activities until 11pm. Members of chamber of commerce also had a meeting with the administration and said the community had already suffered losses during the three months of statewide lockdown. In Jodhpur, a night curfew from 8 pm to 6 am is still in force. In Barmer, after a 7-day lockdown in the first week of July, the city is now under a 15-hour curfew between 5pm and 9am.

30-07-2020||India||Australia opposes unilateral actions to change status quo along LAC||India’s position on the border standoff with China was backed on Thursday by Australia, which said it opposed attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) as that could increase the risk of instability. Australian high commissioner Barry O’Farrell conveyed his country’s position to external affairs minister S Jaishankar during a meeting, at which the two sides discussed developments across the Indo-Pacific region amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The Australian side urges restraint along the LAC and supports continued moves towards de-escalation, said a statement from the Australian high commission. “As I told the external affairs minister of India today, Australia opposes any attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo, which only serve to increase tension and the risk of instability,” O’Farrell was quoted as saying in the statement. “It is important that the bilaterally-agreed principles and norms that have helped prevent escalation or miscalculation in the border areas over many decades continue to be observed,” the statement added. India has repeatedly said in recent weeks that it is opposed to any unilateral efforts to change the status quo along the LAC, along which tens of thousands of Indian and Chinese troops continue to be deployed. There has been growing convergence between India and Australia on security issues and the role of China in the Indo-Pacific in recent months. The two sides elevated their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership and signed an agreement for reciprocal access to military logistics during a virtual summit last month. Australia, which is set to be invited to join the Malabar naval exercise conducted by India, Japan and the US, has also backed India’s calls for reform of international bodies such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and sought a probe into the origins of the pandemic. During a meeting of the US and Australian defence and foreign ministers in Washington on Tuesday, the two countries envisaged a key role for India in defence cooperation and post-Covid-19 recovery efforts in the Indo-Pacific. The Australian mission’s statement further said that “Australia remains vigilant about strategic trends inimical to our vision of the region” even as it focuses on the health and economic impacts of the Covid-19 crisis. Australia envisages an Indo-Pacific that is an open, free, rules-based region that is “resilient to coercion” and supported by inclusive institutions, the statement said. “Territorial disputes and competing claims should be resolved peacefully by the claimant countries, and in ways consistent with international law,” it added. Australia also continues to be deeply concerned by China’s actions in the South China Sea that are “destabilising and could provoke escalation”, the statement said. On July 23, Australia lodged a note with the UN Secretary General refuting China’s “unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea”. It added: “It rejects China’s claim to historic rights and internal waters, its assertion of certain maritime zones, and its contention there is wide international recognition of its South China Sea sovereignty claims.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/australia-opposes-unilateral-actions-to-change-status-quo-along-lac/story-cf8iYjXX2yA7XhZBgbNmAM.html

The Senior Commanders of the two sides will be meeting in the near future to work out steps in this regard,” said Anurag Sriavastava, spokesperson, the ministry of external affairs. The spokesperson underlined that “maintenance of peace and tranquility in the border areas” is the basis of the India-China bilateral relationship. “Therefore, we expect that the Chinese side will sincerely work with us for complete disengagement and de-escalation and full restoration of peace and tranquility in the border areas at the earliest as agreed to by the Special Representatives,” he added. Earlier, responding to a specific query on whether Indian and Chinese soldiers had completed disengagement at Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra areas, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said disengagement was completed in most areas. “The front-line frontier defence forces of the two countries have disengaged in most locations, and the current situation continues to develop in the direction of easing and cooling,” said Wenbin.Differences between India and China on the disengagement process along the LAC emerged following the meeting last Friday, with New Delhi calling on Beijing to “sincerely implement” the understandings on troop withdrawals reached by senior military commanders of the two sides.Northern Army commander Lieutenant General YK Joshi last week said that disengagement between forward deployed Indian and Chinese soldiers from friction areas along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) was a “complex and intricate process” that required “diligent execution”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disengagement-process-along-lac-not-yet-complete-india-rebuts-china/story-NpYy0IRVdhMBg11OANuNJJ.html
30-07-2020||India||Covid-19 herd immunity can’t be a strategic option for country of India’s size: Govt||Given the size of India’s population, herd immunity “cannot be a strategic choice or option”, the health ministry said on Thursday as it urged people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour till a vaccine is developed.At a press briefing, when asked whether India was approaching herd immunity against the coronavirus infection, Officer on Special Duty in the Health Ministry Rajesh Bhushan replied that herd immunity is a kind of indirect protection from an infectious disease like Covid-19.It happens only when a population becomes immune either through vaccination or immunity is developed through a previous infection, he said.“In a country with the size of the population like India, herd immunity cannot be a strategic choice or option. It can only be an outcome, and that too at a very high cost as it means lakhs of people would have to be infected, get hospitalised and many would die in the process,” Bhushan said.He said herd immunity can be achieved through immunisation but that is in the future.“Are we approaching herd immunity? The health ministry believes it still far away and in the future. For now, we have to follow COVID-appropriate behaviour like wearing masks, avoiding gatherings, following hand hygiene and maintaining ‘do gaz ki doori (maintaining distance of two yards),” the OSD said.“Till a vaccine comes up, following COVID-appropriate behaviour is the social vaccine against the disease.” The officer also said phase 1 and 2 human clinical trials of two indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine candidates have started.Bhushan also said the government has so far received 131 claims under the Rs 50 lakh Covid-19 insurance scheme for healthcare providers and payments have already been made in 20 cases.“Under the scheme, we have received 131 claims. The claims are a bit slow in coming as the families are initially in a state of shock and therefore it takes time to sign and fill up the necessary paperwork. “Out of these 131 claims, in 20 cases payments have already been made. In Sixty-four cases payment has been processed and would be made in the coming few days while 47 cases are with different state governments,” he said.About the spread of coronavirus infection in the country, Bhushan said Maharashtra, Delhi and Telangana have reported the maximum number of cases.Due to enhanced testing infrastructure, on an average 4,68,263 Covid-19 tests have been conducted daily from July 26 to 30. The recovery rate among Covid-19 patients too has increased from 7.85 per cent in April to 64.44 per cent on Thursday, the officer said.“Recoveries are now 1.9 times the number of active coronavirus cases. Bhushan further said that 21 states and Union Territories have case positivity rate less than 10 per cent, while in four it is less than five per cent. The Covid-19 positivity rate in Rajasthan is 3.5 per cent, Punjab 3.9 per cent, Madhya Pradesh 4 per cent, and Jammu and Kashmir 4.7 per cent, he said.The OSD also stressed that effective clinical management has led to a decline in Covid-19 case fatality rate from 3.33 per cent on June 18 to 2.21 per cent on July 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-herd-immunity-can-t-be-a-strategic-option-for-india-govt/story-mcC9daX3QMFIMVFwflPZ0H.html

The mother and the baby have been admitted to the state-run Govind Ballabh Pant (GBP) Hospital, a dedicated Covid-19 facility, in Agartala. The mother, who belongs to Unakoti district, had tested Covid-19 positive on Tuesday evening and was referred to GBP Hospital, located about 130 kilometres (km) from her native place after the district hospital authorities had refused to admit her because of the complications of her health condition.The ambulance, which was ferrying her to GBP Hospital, was also entrusted with the responsibility to drop a Covid-19 patient at Kumarghat Hospital in Unakoti district. However, she went into labour, when the ambulance was crossing Atharamura range in Khowai district, 50 km away from Agartala, and she gave birth to a male baby in the vehicle. The ambulance reached the hospital in the intervening night between Tuesday and Wednesday before 2 pm. “The mother and the child are doing fine. The baby has been kept with the mother in the Covid-19 isolation ward since he requires to be breastfed,” said Dr. Bidhan Goswami, resident medical officer (RMO), GBP Hospital. Tripura Directorate of Health Services has served a show-cause notice to the Unakoti district hospital seeking a reply within 24 hours, ascribing reasons for refusing admission and referring the patient to GBP Hospital. “There is a complaint against the on-duty doctor of the hospital, who refused to admit her after she had tested Covid-19 positive. Action will be taken against him, if he is found guilty,” said Dr. Subhasish Debbarma, director of health services, Tripura. Dr. Samarendra Debbarma, medical superintendent, Unakoti district hospital, cited infrastructure inadequacy that prompted the referral to GBP Hospital. “The district hospital has only one labour room and an operation theatre (OT) and a Covid care ward. We refer serious pregnancy and Covid-19 cases to GBP Hospital, as per the instructions. She, too, was referred following discussion with senior health authorities,” Dr. Debbarma said.

30-07-2020||India||In Madhya Pradesh, woman sets herself on fire protesting crop destruction||A woman farmer set herself ablaze to protest an anti-encroachment action taken by the administration in Dewas district, 153 kilometres west of Bhopal, as per police. Shabra Bi, 45, a resident of Atwas village under Satwas police station, about 55 kilometres from the district headquarters received 20% burns. She was referred to a hospital in Indore where her condition is stated to be stable, said police. The incident, which took place on Tuesday, came to light on Thursday after a video went viral on social media in which the woman is seen setting herself ablaze in front of a team of government personnel while a JCB machine is seen destroying the crop in her farm field. Former chief minister Kamal Nath tweeted the video, attacking CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and urging the government to conduct an investigation into the case.CM Chouhan is currently undergoing treatment for coronavirus in a hospital. “A sister is setting herself afire under the rule of who calls himself Mama (maternal uncle). A hapless woman had to resort to setting herself on fire to protest her crop being destroyed with a JCB machine,” Kamal Nath tweeted. The woman’s husband, Ramzan Khan, alleged that the authorities ignored their pleas to stop. “A joint team of revenue and police departments came with a JCB machine and wanted to destroy our soybean crop. They refused to hear our pleas for not destroying the crop.“We are very poor and solely depend upon this crop which was sown in 2 bigha land. The team of government personnel beat us up and pushed Shabra Bi. I don’t know from where Shabra got kerosene and poured it on herself. Before we could understand what had happened she set herself afire,” said Khan. However, Dewas superintendent of police (SP), Shivdayal Singh said, “Shabra Bi and 10 other members of her family attacked the team of police and revenue departments personnel resulting in injuries to two patwaris, Kishor Chawre and Dileep Jat and a revenue inspector Rajendra Dhurve.” The Satwas police station registered an FIR against Shabra Bi and 10 others under section 147 (rioting), 353 (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 332 (voluntarily causes hurt to any person being a public servant in the discharge of his duty as such public servant,), 294 (using obscene language), 506 (criminal intimidation) and under a section SC/ST Act.The SP said, “There was a complaint that Shabra bi and her family had encroached upon government land. The matter was settled in the revenue court last week and the revenue team had gone to the village to remove the encroachment with the help of police when Shabra Bi and her family members pelted stones and hurled abuses on the team. Later she set her dupatta afire that caused burn injuries to her.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-madhya-pradesh-woman-sets-herself-on-fire-protesting-crop-destruction/story-CLWcx2GntERrDHRr9OQbFO.html

Ltd., Imphal said, “With no effective therapeutic drugs or vaccine available at the moment to treat this dreaded viral disease, mankind has to resort to herbal medicines which are time tested through civilizations. These concept health drinks will act as immunity boosters as well as concoctions for respiratory infections including cold, cough, and flu.”“Therapeutic use of the blend of these (three) gingers for treatment of Covid-19 can only be verified after a systematic scientific investigation along with proper clinical trials,” Dr Kishor, a Cancer survivor himself said.The scientist who conceptualized the beverages solely for prevention of cancer because of their inherent anti-cancer properties, while he was undergoing treatment for AML-a type of blood cancer in Mumbai, was inspired by the research work on gingers at the laboratory of Prof GJ Sharma of the Department of Life Sciences, Manipur University.Stating that all three gingers including the common ginger (Zingiber officinale) have been investigated scientifically for their rich antioxidant properties and contains many health beneficial bioactive molecules - phenolic compounds, polyphenols, flavanoids, etc, he said, “A teabag of 3Gingers tea may be brewed in boiled water for five or more minutes and the infusion served. Anybody having flu can have 2 servings a day, while a healthy individual can have a cup a day.”In 2018, Dr Kishor had successfully produced the ‘hottest hybrid chilli derived from capsicum frutescens cultivar, capsicum chinense cv, and the hybrid of the two. Bhut Jolokia, or U-morok in Manipur, is currently India’s hottest chilli, after being certified by the Guinness Book World Records as the world’s hottest chilli in 2007.The average pungency of the hybrid chilli is 287,400 heat units (SHU) on the Scoville scale with capsaicin (spicy chemical compound in the chillies) content of 1.80%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipur-scientist-brews-ginger-tea-says-beverage-may-defend-against-covid-19-infection/story-wiMJwlLc7dnEp0Sk2ta2qL.html
30-07-2020||India||Nepal tells India not to restrict movement of its people in contested areas in Uttarakhand||Nepalese authorities have insisted that Limpiyadhura, Kalapani, Lipulekh in Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh district fall under Nepal’s territory where their citizens can move in and said that “no hindrances should be put in their movement by Indian authorities”. Nepalese authorities claimed that they wrote the letter after officials on the Indian side raised the matter of ‘illegal’ entry of Nepalese citizens into the Indian territories of Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Gunji under the sub-division of Pithoragarh through a communiqué. The letter of July 28 written by Darchula district administration of Nepal is said to be in reply to a letter purportedly sent by sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Dharchula sub-division of Pithoragarh in which he had apprised his Nepalese counterparts to look into the ‘illegal’ entry of Nepalese citizens into the Indian territories of Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Gunji under the sub-division of Pithoragarh. The letter from the Nepalese stated that “the movement of Nepalese people in those areas (disputed areas) is natural. No hindrances should be put in their movement by Indian authorities.” Hindustan Times has copies of both the letters.Tek Singh Kunwar, assistant chief district officer of Neoal’s Darchula district said after Indian officials raised the issue of illegal movement of “our people in Kalapani, Gunji and Limpiyadhura and asked us to stop it, we immediately apprised our higher authorities in Kathmandu on this and later wrote a letter from our side two days ago as per their directions”. In the letter written on the official letterhead of Home Ministry, Government of Nepal which also carries the name of the Darchula District administration office, Kunwar stated that “As per the Treaty of Sugauli signed between Nepal and erstwhile British East India Company in 1815, the areas east to Kali (Mahakali) river which includes Limpiyadhura, Kalapani, Lipulekh, Gunji, Nabi and Kuti fall under Nepal’s territory. Hence, the movement of Nepalese people in those areas is natural. No hindrances should be put in their movement by Indian authorities.” The Treaty of Sugauli between the British and Nepal was signed in December 1815 and ratified in March 1816. It defined river Kali as the western border of Nepal. India asserts that the river begins in Kalapani as this is where all its tributaries merge, but Nepal claims that the river begins from Lipulekh Pass. Kunwar said “as per the new map released by our government, these areas fall under Nepal’s territory. However, as far as the question of our people going there is not possible because of the existing lockdown.” “There is a battalion of Nepal’s armed forces deployed near it in our area who are also carrying out the survey work for construction of a road in our Tinker village near Lipulekh. Indian officials might have got to know about it only,” said Kunwar. Meanwhile, AK Shukla sub divisional magistrate of Dharchula in Pithoragarh district denied writing any letter to the Nepalese authorities. “I have not written any sort of letter to them,” said Shukla when contacted on the issue. District magistrate Pithoragarh Vijay Jogdande also said he was not aware of any letter sent by Nepalese officials. Relations between India and Nepal have soured recently after the former inaugurated a road connecting Dharchula to Lipulekh near border with the Tibet Autonomous Region in China on May 8 to facilitate pilgrims going to Kailash Mansarovar.Following the development, Nepal’s Parliament on June 18 passed a constitutional amendment under which it unanimously voted to endorse the new political map that shows the areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-tells-india-not-to-restrict-movement-of-its-people-in-contested-areas-in-uttarakhand/story-sK1rC6mIF3uhfaPZbwLoEM.html

30-07-2020||India||Hit by Covid, out-of-work Varanasi weavers selling fruits and vegetables||Reverberating with the sound of powerlooms till four months ago, the lanes of Kazaakpura - in Lallapura of Varanasi - are eerily quiet. The weavers are jobless, sans any orders for sarees. Many have even started selling fruits and vegetables to make ends meet. Shailesh Kumar Patel, a weaver from Korhuwan village, who used to be busy preparing sarees and stoles, is now selling vegetables. “What to do, there have been no orders for the last three months,” he said. Ramesh Patel, a master weaver of the same village, owns five powerlooms. All are silent. “I haven’t received any order for weaving sarees, brocade, angavastram for the last three months. It’s a livelihood crisis before weavers like me. We are now selling vegetables in the village to meet our daily household expenses,” Patel said. “This pandemic has crippled us,” he added. In normal days, a weaver would earn Rs 250 to Rs 350 daily. There are around 3 lakh weavers associated with the famous Banarasi saree and textile sector in Varanasi. After wholesalers or big shop owners place orders, the weavers purchase silk yarn and weave saree on handloom or powerloom installed at their homes. Once the saree is ready it’s sold to wholesalers who sell the same to retailers from where the Baranasi sarees reach the customers. “There are no orders. No one knows how long this situation would last. Therefore, I started selling fruits to make an earning for meeting daily expenses,” says Shailesh. Ramesh said that powerlooms owned by Ashok Kumar Rai, Sheetla Prasad Rajbhar too have gone silent and which is why they have now taken to farming or some other work to sustain themselves. Master weaver Matin Kaifi works for the welfare of weavers. “Till four months ago, the lanes in Lallapura, Madanpura, Kazzakpura, Bunkar colony used to reverberate with the sound of powerlooms and handloom. At present, silence prevails here as wholesalers are not placing the orders due to general slump in demand,” Kaifi said. He demanded the government should provide relief to the weavers devastated by the pandemic. “Banarasi Vastras, including sarees traders, have decided to keep their shops closed till August 6 due to no orders and no customers in the market. Situation will improve only when fresh orders pour in,” Banarasi Vastra Udyog Association general secretary Rajan Bahal said. “Banarasi Vastra Udyog has a chain which connects the weavers, wholesalers, retailers, and silk yarn sellers. When there are customers in the market, the sale is good and retailers place new orders for Banarasi saris, brocades and other clothes. As soon as we get fresh orders, we place orders to the weavers and they get work. But at the moment this chain is broken,” he said. “Due to the pandemic, marriages and other auspicious events aren’t happening and this has further compounded our miseries. In these functions, people would gift sarees and dress up nicely. Now, I think the situation would improve only after the pandemic dies out,” he said. “This is the toughest period of my three-decade long business career. With each passing day, the situation is worsening. We are managing the show, somehow. Now, we have received some orders for exports and this has offered a ray of hope,” Mukund Agarwal, former president of eastern UP Exporters Association. Assistant Commissioner Handloom and Textile, Varanasi region, Nitesh Dhawan said steps have been taken to mitigate the problems of the weavers. “A number of steps with a holistic approach have been taken to generate work for the weavers and improve their condition. The steps include capacity building and training to the weavers on designs, export promotion and marketing of different handloom and textile products,” he said. Dhawan said the efforts made by his department would start showing results over the next couple of months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hit-by-covid-out-of-work-varanasi-weavers-selling-fruits-and-vegetables/story-CDEr42pypiLP02srMZsvxJ.html

During arguments, examples from the previous Supreme Court rulings were cited,” said Dinesh Kumar Garg, counsel for BSP.They have to submit their replies by August 11 which is the next date of hearing, Garg said.The six BSP members of Rajasthan legislative assembly (MLAs) who had merged with the Ashok Gehlot–led Congress government are Sandeep Yadav, Tijara MLA, Wajib Ali (Nagar), Deepchand Kheria (Kishangarh Bas), LakhanMeena (Karauli), and Rajendra Gudha (Udaipurwati).The petition is being heard by single-judge bench of justice Mahendra Kumar Goyal. Garg told the bench that the merger was unconstitutional. The BSP did not merge with the party neither at the national level nor state level. As per law, parties merge, not legislators.The BSP had earlier issued a whip to the six MLAs to vote against the Ashok Gehlot government in any proceedings of the House, including a no-confidence motion. A session of the assembly has been convened on August 14.“Also, these six MLAs did not submit their resignations and so the whip was issued by the national secretary of BSP. Hence, they are liable to be disqualified under the 10th Schedule of the Constitution of India,” said Garg.On Wednesday, BJP legislator Madan Dilawar had also filed two petitions in the high court requesting disqualification of the BSP lawmakers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-hc-sends-notices-to-speaker-6-bsp-mlas-who-joined-congress/story-UC5CJU0WXJWpH8xpssaLHK.html

In two separate cases, two arrested accused have tested Covid-19 positive in the past week, leading to the quarantine of at least 15 police personnel. On Tuesday evening, an alleged drug dealer (26), who was busted at Jaspur in the district, tested Covid-19 positive, leading to the quarantine of 15 police personnel, including an inspector, an official said. “The accused was apprehended with contraband on Tuesday evening. Later, he tested Covid-19 positive,” said Rajesh Bhatt, additional superintendent of police (ASP), Kashipur. “Eight police personnel, who came in direct contact with the accused, are under institutional quarantine at a hotel-turned-Covid Care Centre in Kashipur. While seven others have quarantined themselves at the police station itself,” Bhatt added.

30-07-2020||India||Indo-Pacific encouraged by India standing up to China: US NSC official||India showed “will and capability to stand up to China” in the recent border conflict, said Lisa Curtis, senior director for South and Central Asia, US National Security Council. The rest of the Indo-Pacific countries are “watching this carefully” and have been “encouraged by India’s resolve.” Curtis said this during a Brookings Institution webinar on Wednesday assessing China’s growing regional influence. India, she noted, had “played the economic card” by banning Chinese apps and putting a hold on Chinese investments.“Thankfully,” she said, we are “beginning to see disengagement of forces” and “hoped it continues.” But the “pressure that China put on India on the Line of Actual Control” will have a long-term impact on how India views China and will “change the dynamics between the two.” An experienced South Asia hand who has served the US government in both India and Pakistan, Curtis said, “Few countries are more familiar with China’s malign influence than India.”China’s “recent aggressive stance [in Ladakh] fits with the larger pattern of Chinese aggressiveness in other parts of the world.” Strengthening the US-India defence and security relationship has been a major element of Washington’s response and seeks to make India a “net security provider.” The relationship is more than just defence, she said, and cited the highlights of US President Donald Trump’s state visit to India in areas like economics and the present scientific collaboration in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. Twenty-five years ago China did not take India seriously, she said. India was seen as “inward-looking and lagging in its economic indicators.” Fifteen years ago, as India’s growth and military capabilities began taking off, there was a line of thinking that India and China would work together and “usher in a new Asian century.” From about 2010 or so differences over the long standing border dispute reemerged and each side became “uncomfortable” with the rise of the other. China’s influence in India’s neighbourhood, such as in Sri Lanka and Nepal, moved from economic to “more and more interference in domestic politics.” Curtis said China’s influence in South Asia had grown significantly over the past 20 years. And Beijing’s actions were causing blowback. The Maldivian people had “pushed back” attempts by former president, Mohammed Yameen, to make his country dependent on Chinese debt by voting him out of office. Yameen had “awarded construction contracts to Chinese companies at inflated prices and without transparent bidding, leaving the Maldivian people with enormous debt.” While the US had provided counterterrorism help to Sri Lanka after the 2019 Easter terrorist bombings, Beijing had “tried to obstruct Sri Lanka’s investigations and spread disinformation about US assistance.” Bangladesh was “carefully balancing” between China and the rest, but praised their acceptance of one million Rohingya refugees.Nepal and Bhutan were examples of China disregarding the sovereignty of its neighbours. Chinese official media in May had claiming the the entirety of Mount Everest for China and, more recently, Beijing claiming a natural park in eastern Bhutan. After discussing US attempts to roll back Chinese influence in Central Asia, Curtis mentioned Pakistan at the end of her written comments. “Nowhere in South and Central Asia has Chinese influence been more invasive than in Pakistan.” The $ 60 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor was neither aid nor an equity investment of the kind that had propelled China’s own growth. CPEC is being financed through sovereign debt which means the “risks are borne by the Pakistani people and the benefits accrue to China.” However, she cited Beijing and Washington’s common support for an end to violence in Afghanistan as evidence the two countries could work together and stressed the US had “deep and abiding respect for the Chinese people.”India had been a sceptic of China’s Belt Road Initiative “from the beginning” and proven “very prescient” and its scepticism “was bearing out.” Countries in the region recovering from the pandemic should turn to international financial institutions to help their recovery or new US agencies like the Development Finance Corporation. It was “disappointing” that Muslim majority countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh were not speaking out about China’s mass imprisonment of its Muslim Uighur and Kazakh minorities. The goal of US engagement in South and Central Asia, she said, was to allow them to “maintain their sovereignty and be able to make choices” in economic and other spheres. Early in his presidency, she said, Trump had asked the NSC staff to reevaluate the assumptions behind the US’s China policy. She said, one assumption that was discarded was that greater engagement with China would lead to greater liberalisation. It was also concluded that China was exporting its coercive model to other parts of the world.

She questioned the tearing hurry behind the move when the monsoon session was just weeks away.“BJP reducing Parliament from RubberStamp to NoStamp. How is something as vital as comprehensive new education policy for India not discussed in Parliament before announcing it? If monsoon session in Aug why not wait few more weeks?” the leader posted on Twitter.The cabinet on Tuesday approved National Education Policy 2020 bringing major reforms in higher education, including a target of 50 per cent Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) by 2035 and provision for multiple entry and exits.Amit Khare, Higher Education Secretary, said the country has got a new education policy after 34 years.Congress leader and former HRD minister Shashi Tharoor welcomed the new policy, but questioned the government for not introducing it in Parliament first.Making board exams easy, reduction of curriculum to core concepts, replacement of 10+2 structure of school curricula with a 5+3+3+4 structure and teaching up to at least class 5 in the mother tongue or a regional language, are among the many school education reforms outlined in the new National Education Policy.CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury also accused the Centre of “bypassing Parliament” while announcing the policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-reducing-parliament-to-tmc-after-new-education-policy-announcement/story-6rKBZ1dzhlzytA1GwSMK4M.html
30-07-2020||India||Covid-19 deaths top 150,000 in worst-hit US as it deals with renewed surge in infections||Southern and western regions of the United States were grappling Thursday with a renewed surge of coronavirus infections as the death toll in the world’s worst-affected nation passed 150,000.Brazil is second to the US in terms of cases and fatalities, and also reported a sobering figure as it surpassed 90,000 deaths.Exactly six months after the World Health Organization declared an international emergency over the deadly pathogen, countries around the globe are seeing rises in infections that are damaging economies and forcing disruptive protection measures.Even nations that believed they had largely curbed the disease are being gripped by worrying second and third-wave resurgences, with Australia on Thursday reporting a record number of new infections and its deadliest day of the pandemic so far.Despite efforts in place to contain the virus, Covid19 has killed more than 666,000 people around the world and total infections have passed 17 million, according to an AFP tally.Global daily cases are now approaching the 300,000 mark, with the curve showing no sign of flattening -- it took just 100 hours for one million new cases to be recorded.Surge in AustraliaDays after Australian authorities expressed hope that a Melbourne lockdown -- now in its third week -- was bringing persistent outbreaks under control, the surge is a potent warning that initial successes in managing Covid-19 can quickly unravel.Thirteen deaths and 723 positive tests were reported in the southeastern state of Victoria alone, well beyond the previous nationwide record of 549 cases set on Monday.Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the steep rise in numbers was “very concerning”.In Hong Kong, where authorities fear a worrying third-wave of infections could cripple the healthcare system, the government reversed a day-old ban on restaurants serving dine-in customers following widespread public anger.All restaurants in the city of 7.5 million were ordered to only serve takeaways as part of a raft of ramped-up social distancing measures aimed at combating the fresh wave of virus cases.But social media was quickly swamped by photos of primarily blue-collar workers forced to eat on pavements and in parks -- and even inside public toilets to escape a torrential downpour.The United States, however, is still battling its first wave, having never taken control of the virus, and on Wednesday alone the country recorded 1,267 new deaths in the past 24 hours and notched more than 68,000 new daily cases.Southern and western states have been particularly hard-hit -- especially Florida, where more than 6,300 people have died.EU travel list The EU is due Thursday to update its list of countries approved for travel to the European bloc, which it reviews every two weeks. The United States was not on the list and is not expected to be included.The EU’s safe list does, however, include Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay.The bloc is expected to announce that Algeria is being removed from the list after a resurgence of coronavirus.Meanwhile several countries in Europe have slapped restrictions on travel to and from Spain, while officials elsewhere bicker over the seriousness of the current outbreak. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, fresh from announcing quarantine for travelers returning from Spain, suggested the rest of Europe could be facing a second wave -- despite his own country’s dismal figures.France’s health minister hit back on Wednesday, saying his country was categorically not in a second wave. Spain, one of the countries hit hardest by the pandemic, insists it is a safe destination and was critical of Britain’s blanket quarantine, which includes islands without significant outbreaks.Brazil also wants visitors back, and on Wednesday reopened travel to foreigners arriving by plane, hoping to revive its lockdown-devastated tourism industry. The country closed its air borders to non-residents on March 30, at a time when the virus was just taking hold in South America.Neighbouring Peru on Wednesday passed 400,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, the health ministry said, after the largest daily increase in infections for more than six weeks. Nearly 19,000 people have died as a result of the disease nationwide, and the country has recorded more Covid-19 cases than anywhere in Latin America except for Brazil and Mexico.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-deaths-top-150-000-in-worst-hit-us-as-it-deals-with-renewed-surge-in-infections/story-eWphrrycUCE8snOFp8RaKN.html

He described the move as “Sanjeevani booti” that would revive the economy.“Diesel is the lifeblood of Indian economy, the driver of economic growth. Reduction in diesel prices by Delhi CM @ArvindKejriwal will act as “sanjeevani booti” in reviving an unconscious economy,” Chadha tweeted. Chadha slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party-led central government, accusing it of adopting “an extortionist approach” and increasing the excise duty on diesel and petrol.“On the other hand, BJP led Central Government adopted an extortionist approach and increased Excise Duty on Diesel and Petrol 22 times over 22 continuous days from June 7th 2020 to June 29th 2020. They should take a leaf out of CM Kejriwal’s book and rollback,” he tweeted. Diesel is the lifeblood of Indian economy, the driver of economic growth.Reduction in diesel prices by Delhi CM @ArvindKejriwal will act as "sanjeevani booti" in reviving an unconscious economy.Chadha said that in June, the central government had increased the excise duty on diesel by Rs 11.14 per litre and on petrol by Rs 9.17 per litre. “We demand that at the very least this increase should be rolled back immediately,” he said.Earlier in the day, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that his cabinet has decided to reduce VAT on diesel from 30% to 16.75% . The move will reduce the price of diesel in Delhi by Rs 8.36 per litre. Diesel will now be sold for Rs 73.64 instead of Rs 82 across the national capital. On the other hand, BJP led Central Government adopted an extortionist approach and increased Excise Duty on Diesel and Petrol 22times over 22 continuous days from June 7th 2020 to June 29th 2020.They should take a leaf out of CM Kejriwal's book and rollback.“This is one of the several measures taken by our government to revive Delhi’s economy. Earlier this week, we had launched a portal to connect job seekers with potential employers,” Kejriwal said.

30-07-2020||India||Plan to increase Covid-19 tests to 10 lakh per day in 1-2 months: Harsh Vardhan||India is currently conducting around five lakh Covid-19 tests every day and the plan is to double the number in next one-two months, Union Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Thursday.During the launch of a compendium on ‘Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Technologies for Covid-19 Mitigation’, Vardhan, who is also the Union health minister, said the country’s recovery rate of over 64 per cent is the best in the world while the fatality rate is nearly 2.2 per cent.He also hailed the scientific community for fighting alongside the medical community in the battle against the virus.The first Covid-19 case in India was detected on January 30 and it has been six months since then but the fight against the virus is still on. Despite the vastness of the country and its population, the war against the virus has been successfully taken up in every corner, Vardhan said.About ramping up health infrastructure in the country, the minister said six months ago India was importing ventilators, but it has now developed a capacity to manufacture three lakh ventilators.“Most of the ventilators are being made within the country now. India is supplying hydroxychloroquine drug to nearly 150 countries,” he said.“In April, we used to conduct 6,000 tests daily. Today, we are conducting over five lakh tests every day. Our plan is to take it to 10 lakh tests daily in 1-2 months and we are working towards it,” Vardhan said.There was a time when exports related to Covid-19 were stopped to meet the requirements within the country. However, on Friday, in the Group of Ministers, there will be a presentation on what can be again opened up for the exports, he said.“This is possible because of the efforts undertaken by the country to ramp up production of critical equipment.” Vardhan asserted that while global efforts are on to find a vaccine against the novel coronavirus, India is not behind.“We have been able to do detailed sequencing of over 1,000 coronavirus genomes,” Vardhan said, adding that India was among the five nations who could isolate the virus.Referring to human trials of vaccine candidates being conducted by Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila, he said India is among the very few countries to reach that stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plan-to-increase-covid-19-tests-to-10-lakh-per-day-in-1-2-months-harsh-vardhan/story-RnEf3EhmCXSHAoEOwLA5cO.html

30-07-2020||India||Islamabad high court forms special bench to hear Kulbhushan Jadhav’s case||The Islamabad high court has formed a special bench to hear the case of former Indian navy commander Kulbushan Jadhav from next week, Geo News reported on Thursday. Jadhav, a former Indian navy commander, has been sentenced to death for alleged involvement in a spying caseIslamabad high court chief justice Athar Minallah will be heading the bench. A lawyer will also be appointed for Jadhav on Monday. Earlier this week, the Pakistan government presented the International Court of Justice (Review and Reconsideration) Ordinance, 2020, in Parliament for approval. This legislation will pave the way for Jadhav to appeal his death sentence handed to him by a military court in 2017.The ordinance will have an overriding effect as its provisions shall have effect notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any law for the time being in force, including the Pakistan Army Act 1952.On July 22, the Pakistan government had approached the Islamabad high court to appoint a legal representative for the Indian spy.The move was made in the light of the International Court of Justice’s July 17, 2019 decision, following which the International Court of Justice (Review and Reconsideration) Ordinance, 2020 was enacted to implement the court’s verdict.According to the government’s petition, Jadhav refused to file a petition against his sentence. Jadhav cannot appoint a lawyer in Pakistan without India’s assistance. The petition claimed that New Delhi is also reluctant to avail the facility under the ordinance. The government, in the petition, has asked the court to appoint a legal representative for Jadhav so that Pakistan can fulfil its responsibility to see to the implementation of the ICJ’s decision.On July 17, Pakistan had offered Jadhav consular access for a third time, after the second opportunity was not “fully availed”.Last week, India had accused Pakistan of blocking all avenues for an effective review of Jadhav’s case and said it reserved its rights to avail of further remedies.The external affairs ministry had accused Islamabad of systematically blocking access to the former naval officer, not providing documents related to his case and violating the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) order for a review of his conviction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/islamabad-high-court-forms-special-bench-to-hear-kulbhushan-jadhav-case/story-8QGm3udJ88IZibOTtYnAcP.html

The government order had said that Gandhi is no longer protected by the Special Protection Group (SPG) and hence not eligible anymore.The directorate of estate department of the ministry of housing and urban affairs had issued a notice to her on July 1 to vacate her house within a month.“Any stay beyond 01.08.2020 will attract damage charges/penal rent as per rules,” the department had said in its order.Days later, the same bungalow was allotted to BJP MP and party spokesperson Anil Baluni.According to the current norms, there are no provisions for allotment or retention of government accommodation to those with Z+ security unless exceptions are made based on recommendations given by the home ministry.The allotment of central government bungalows is done through the General Pool Residential Accommodation (GPRA) Act under the administrative control of the directorate of estates.Priyanka Gandhi was allotted the 35, Lodhi Estate bungalow in New Delhi in 1997.News reports quoted some Congress leaders as saying that she is now expected to shift to her relative’s house ‘Kaul Niwas’ in Uttar Pradesh’s capital Lucknow.It is being called her political base camp as Gandhi is expected to spend most of her time in UP in the coming days in view of Assembly elections in the state in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-vacates-govt-bungalow-in-delhi-s-lutyens-zone/story-yS2zXpDuIPjqjkHOkaNDQK.html
30-07-2020||India||India’s development aid comes without conditions, says PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday held up India’s track record of providing developmental aid to neighbours without any conditions and in line with their priorities as he and his Mauritius counterpart Pravind Jugnauth inaugurated the new Supreme Court building in Port Louis. Modi didn’t refer to other countries involved in development cooperation in the neighbourhood, though he appeared to be making a distinction between Indian aid and Chinese-backed projects that have led to several countries in the region falling into a debt trap. India’s approach to development is human-centric and its development partnerships are marked by respect, diversity, care for the future and sustainable development, he said in his speech during the virtual inauguration ceremony. “For India, the most fundamental principle in development cooperation is respecting our partners. This sharing of development lessons is our only motivation,” Modi said. “That is why our development cooperation does not come with any conditions. It is not influenced by political or commercial considerations.” In the Indian Ocean region, Sri Lanka leased the strategic Hambantota port to a Chinese firm for 99 years in 2017 after the country was unable to repay Chinese loans for developing the facility. The current government of the Maldives has sought India’s assistance to cope with massive loans taken from China by the previous regime. Modi highlighted his government’s vision of “Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR)” for the Indian Ocean region and said: “Our development partnerships reflect the development priorities of our partner nations.” India is not only providing help for the present but is also trying to create a better future, for which training and skilling is an important part of development cooperation, he said. This will ensure future generations in India’s partner nations are self-reliant and more confident, he added. Modi also outlined the projects taken up and completed in diverse fields through India’s development partnerships, including the Parliament building in Afghanistan, the Mahatma Gandhi Convention Centre in Niger, an emergency and trauma hospital in Nepal, and emergency ambulance services in all nine provinces of Sri Lanka. An oil pipeline project being implemented with Nepal will help ensure the availability of petroleum products while another project will provide drinking water and sanitation in 34 islands of the Maldives. “We have tried to make cricket popular in countries as diverse as Afghanistan and Guyana by helping build stadiums and other facilities,” he said. India is also focusing on sustainable development through institutions such as the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. “Both initiatives are of special relevance to island countries,” he said. The new Supreme Court building in Port Louis, built with grant assistance of $28.12 million, is part of a special economic package of $353 million provided by India. Other infrastructure schemes taken up under this package are the Metro Express project worth $275 million, the first phase of which has been completed, a $14-million ENT Hospital, which too has been completed, and a social housing project with nearly 1,000 units. India is the largest development partner for Mauritius, for which it has also provided lines of credit worth $600 million at concessional terms. India is assisting in the building of healthcare facilities such as a renal unit, four medical clinics and two health centres. In his speech, Jugnauth thanked the government and people for their solidarity in trying times amid the Covid-19 pandemic. He said Mauritius had benefited from medicines and medical equipment supplied by India and the three-week-long deployment of a medical team on board the Indian warship INS Kesari. He described the new Supreme Court building as a milestone in the modernisation of the infrastructure of Mauritius that will enable the judiciary to use new technologies to make justice more accessible to all. Judges often had to wait to use the limited number of courtrooms at the old building to hear cases, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-development-aid-comes-without-conditions-says-pm-modi/story-0DoslDXk3zE7R81PLZAV0O.html

30-07-2020||India||Mayawati wades into row over Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. Congress is her target||Bahujan Samaj Party boss Mayawati on Thursday waded into the row over the probe into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, saying that it would be better that the Central Bureau of Investigation takes up the probe rather than police officers of Bihar or Maharashtra. She also attacked the Congress for speaking in two voices in Maharashtra and Bihar, accusing the party of using the case to serve its political interests.Mayawati’s remark came days after the 34-year-old actor’s father KK Singh filed a complaint with Bihar police accusing actor Rhea Chakraborty and six others of abetting the actor’s alleged suicide. A team of Bihar police was also sent to Mumbai.This line of investigation appeared to be a contrast to the probe by Mumbai police that was seen to be focused at exploring the professional rivalry angle.Rajput was found hanging from the ceiling of his apartment in Mumbai suburb Bandra on June 14. In two tweets, Mayawati referred to the mystery around Sushant Singh Rajput’s death.“The mystery around the death of a young actor of Bihar origin Sushant Singh Rajput is deepening following new facts emerging every day and his father filing an FIR with Patna police. Now it would be better if the case was investigated by the CBI instead of Maharashtra and Bihar police,” Mayawati said in a tweet.Rhea Chakraborty has already moved a petition in the Supreme Court to request that the Bihar police probe be transferred to Mumbai police which was already investigating Sushant Singh Rajput’s death.Maharashtra home minister and Congress leader Anil Deshmukh has rejected demands for a CBI probe into the actor’s death on more than one occasion, insisting that the Mumbai police is doing a fine job.Congress leaders in Bihar, like most other state politicians, have supported demands for a CBI inquiry.Mayawati referred to this difference in the stand taken by Congress leaders in Maharashtra and Bihar, asserting that this implied that their real objective was not to get justice for Sushant Singh Rajput’s family but use it to serve their political interests. “This is not appropriate. Maharashtra government should get serious (about the case),” she said.Mayawati’s pointed attack that aimed at Congress leaders comes against the backdrop of worsening ties between the two opposition parties that had, ahead of the 2019 elections, considered having some kind of an agreement. The BSP had an alliance with Akhilesh Yadav’s Samajwadi Party for the general election but it collapsed after the elections.Mayawati has been particularly upset with the Congress last year after the Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan lured the BSP’s 6 lawmakers in the state to join the Congress rather than support the state government from outside.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-mayawati-backs-cbi-probe-in-suicide-probe-slams-congress/story-qQJiKdBHfD6q6pEhHIAbgP.html

Maoists are holding them responsible for supporting new private mining parties in the area,” Superintendent of Police (SP) Abhishek Pallava told HT.“I have been informed by the senior police officials about the threat from the Maoists... I have always reported facts..” said the journalist who preferred not to be named.Also read: NIA arrests 3 in murder of Chhattisgarh MLA Bhima Mandavi“Maoists have incurred severe casualties in the past few years in Kirandul area and many local boys and girls have been recruited from the region in the police. Therefore, Maoists are fast losing grip over the villagers in the area and as a result, there is growing frustration across all ranks of Maoists. Thus, senior Maoists are trying to find scapegoats, turning blame to them for their failures,” the SP added.Meanwhile, Prabhat Singh, a journalist based in Dantewada district alleged that police launched a surveillance against him and his family for unknown reasons.“For last one week, the police and surrendered Maoists of Barsoor police station are collecting information about my family from other family members and neighbours. The police are asking for the bank account number and information related to my seven-year-old daughter’s education,” said Singh.Also read: Chhattisgarh registers 314 more Covid-19 cases, state tally mounts to 8,600He further claimed that he has written a letter to the chief minister and provided all the details about his assets.“I urge the chief minister to stop this surveillance because my family is in fear,” said Singh. Reacting to the allegation, SP Dantewada said that Prabhat’s allegations are baseless.“Neither Prabhat Singh nor his family members have been questioned by police officers.

30-07-2020||India||Customs dept busts agarbatti smuggling racket from Vietnam that misused FTA||The Customs department on Wednesday caught illegal imports of restricted items – agarbattis (incense sticks) and its powder – from Vietnam in large quantities in blatant violation of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-India Free Trade Agreement (FTA), a finance ministry official said. “In a major drive against the smuggling of agarrbattis from Vietnam, Customs officials on Wednesday arrested Bharat H. Shah and his son, Ronik Shah in Chennai after seizing 161.94 MT [metric tonnes] of agarbattis and 68.36 MT of agarbatti powder, which were found concealed in containers imported by Indian Agarbatti Manufacturers (IAM), Bengaluru. This is one of the biggest seizures of restricted items in recent times at the port,” the official said requesting anonymity. IAM did not respond to HT’s queries. While Bharat H Shah and his son Ronik could not be contacted. The official said the importer had declared to the Customs that these containers contained joss powder and premix powder for making incense sticks. “Joss powder is normally attracts a 15% Customs duty. However, the duty is ‘nil’ under the FTA with ASEAN, which includes Vietnam,” he said. Joss powder is a herbal substance used for manufacturing mosquito coils and incense sticks. “The importer was trying to take advantage of the FTA as well as smuggle restricted agarbattis,” he said. Agarbattis are placed in the restricted category since August 2019 to protect domestic manufacturers and cannot be imported without a licence. Acting on inputs that some unscrupulous importers were clandestinely smuggling agarbattis from Vietnam after the item was restricted for import last year, the Customs used data analytics to identify the suspect importer, IAM, the official said. “A strict vigil was kept on its six imported containers that had landed at Chennai port. The containers said to contain joss powder and premix powder for making incense sticks revealed huge quantities of undeclared agarbatttis and agarbatti powder concealed behind the declared goods,” he said. The Customs officers searched the office and residential premises of the importer at Bengaluru and apprehended the Shahs, both of whom had planned the smuggling, he said. “Upon enquiry they disclosed that they had ordered two more containers from Vietnam, which were in the pipeline. At Chennai port, these two containers were identified and searched, which again revealed concealed agarbattis in huge quantities,” he added. The seizures and arrests are part of a nationwide drive by Customs officials to stop the smuggling of agarbattis, which are on the restricted list of import, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/customs-dept-busts-agarbatti-smuggling-racket-from-vietnam-that-misused-fta/story-EH4ZZ21M61is08oath3obO.html

Sharma, a Member of Parliament (MP) from Khajuraho parliamentary seat, tweeted on Wednesday night that he has tested Covid-19 positive. Sharma posted a statement on his Twitter handle. “My third Covid-19 test report has come positive. I request all my colleagues and party workers, who came in contact with me in the past few days, to undergo Covid-19 tests. I shall quarantine myself for the next few days, as per the doctors’ advice.” Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Sharma had travelled to Lucknow along with CM Chouhan, a state minister and a state BJP general secretary, all of whom have tested Covid-19 positive since then, on July 21 to attend the funeral of MP governor Lalji Tandon, who had passed away at a hospital in his hometown on that day. CM Chouhan, who had tested Covid-19 positive last Saturday, is undergoing treatment at a private medical college-run hospital in Bhopal. At present, the CM, his three ministerial colleagues, Sharma and a state BJP general secretary have been found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease. The minister, who accompanied Chouhan and the state BJP president to Lucknow, was the first person from Chouhan’s cabinet to have been struck by the viral infection on July 22 and is undergoing treatment along with the CM at Chirayu Medical College-run hospital in Bhopal. The third cabinet member, who tested Covid-19 positive on Wednesday is a minster of state (MoS) from MP’s Vindhya region. Meanwhile, CM Chouhan has been put in a spot of bother by his party colleague and a member of the MP legislative assembly (MLA) from Jabalpur, Ajya Vishnoi. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The MLA sought a response from the CM about the reason behind political dignitaries checking into a private hospital for treatment. “I wish CM Shivraj Singh Chouhanji, who is being treated at Chirayu hospital, a speedy recovery. But, I’d like to know what can Chirayu hospital offer that is not available in a government-run medical college and hospital in the state that has been treating Covid-19 patients for the past four months, Why does all dignitaries of MP are making a beeline for Chirayu?” Vishnoi asked CM Chouhan via a tweet. The main opposition, the Congress, was quick to seize the opportunity and sought to put the ruling BJP on the mat. “The CM must respond to the question raised by a senior BJP leader. This is not a question of only four months. The CM must tell the public about the BJP government’s failure not to upgrade a single government-run medical college and hospital, despite being in power for 15 long years. Why can’t these hospitals treat dignitaries? The state’s healthcare services are in shambles,” alleged Narendra Saluja, state Congress president’s media coordinator. State BJP leader Dr Hitesh Bajpai tried to play down the political slanging match. “I have not seen the BJP MLA’s (Vishnoi) tweet. But, if the question indeed arises, then the Congress has a lot to answer for it because the party was in power, when the Covid-19 outbreak was first reported in MP. It was the then Congress CM Kamal Nath’s failure that not a single government-run hospital was equipped to treat Covid-19 patients,” Bajpai said as a counter-point to the Congress’s allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-bjp-president-vd-sharma-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-iML7Yu5dUmfEY8POr3G81O.html

A number of suggestions made by some of us seem to have been taken into account. However, the question remains why this was not brought before Parliament first for discussion,” Tharoor said in his first tweet. There is much to welcome in what we have seen of the #NewEducationPolicy2020 announced by @DrRPNishank. A number of suggestions made by some of us seem to have been taken into account. However,the question remains why this was not brought before Parliament first for discussion.He then went on to highlight the features of the policy, which he said present tangible and realisable targets. He said that the government should ensure that aspiration is matched by implementation.“I’ve advocated revision of the 1986 National Education Policy since my days in MHRD, to bring it into the 21st century. I am glad the Modi Govt has finally grasped the nettle, even if it took them six years to do so. Challenge is to ensure aspiration is matched by implementation,” Tharoor said.“For instance, the goal of 6% of GDP to be spent on education was first articulated in 1948! Every Govt articulates this target& then comes up against its own Finance Ministry. In the last 6 years, ModiGovt expenditure in education has declined in real terms. How will it reach 6%?” he added.Talking about the spend of the government in education sector, he said, “The goals of 50% Gross Enrolment Ratio in higher education and 100% in secondary school are laudable, but when you realise it’s currently 25.8% in Higher Edn & 68% in Class 9, you wonder if such targets are any more realistic than the Govt’s solar-energy commitments at Paris.”“The NEP should have offered more tangible&realisable targets for research. Total investment on research& innovation in India declined from 0.84% of GDP in 2008 to 0.6% in 2018. There are currently only 15 researchers in India per 100,000 of population, compared with 111 in China,” Tharoor said in his final tweet on the issue.The Union Cabinet on Wednesday passed India’s first new National Education Policy in at least 28 years, recommending primary education in local languages, facilitating the possible entry of foreign universities in India, creating a single higher-education regulator, and easier board examinations.These wide-ranging reforms are aimed at making the Indian education system more contemporary and skill-oriented.

30-07-2020||India||Madhya Pradesh HC issues direction to railways to consider re-prioritisation of berths||Madhya Pradesh (MP) high court’s (HC) principal bench at Jabalpur on Wednesday directed Indian Railways to consider re-prioritisation of berth allotment by giving the highest priority to pregnant women and people suffering from terminal or life-threatening ailments followed by the dignitaries.A two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices Sanjay Yadav and Sreedharan, said in its order, “As regards to the prioritisation of berth allotment is concerned, the respondent Indian Railways is requested to consider re-prioritising the berth allotment by giving the highest priority to pregnant women, then to senior citizens and followed by other dignitaries.” The bench gave the order after it had registered a public interest litigation (PIL) suo motu (on its own motion) to consider certain measures regarding railway journeys in the interest of the public. The PIL was registered after a HC judge on his official visit to Jabalpur from Gwalior in January got off a train at Katni-Murwara railway station for a cup of tea and suddenly the train started moving without blowing a whistle, and had a tough time in boarding a running train.The HC had put forth three suggestions to the railways in January. They included the fixing of some light signal/sound on each bogie enabling the passengers’ outside the train to be alert prior to the departure of a train in a bid to avoid an accident; updating of the railways’ website/mobile application by displaying the position of the seats/berths to be allotted at the time of making reservation and also increasing of the size/number of doors of the bogies or alternatively increasing stoppage of train duration from two minutes to at least five minutes. The bench disposed of the petition and made the following observation. “As far as dignitaries and officials being given a priority in the reservation of seat/berth is concerned, the rationale of officials being given a priority is understandable, as they are required to travel at a short notice for their official duties. However, as regards to the priority of allocation of the lower berth is concerned, it is non-pragmatic.” It cited that pregnant women are most vulnerable on account of their medical condition and it would cause them great inconvenience in occupying the middle or upper berth.“The senior citizens, who on an account of their advanced age and attendant medical issues, should be considered as the next priority followed by the dignitaries, who are usually serving state functionaries and are blessed with a better health condition,” it added. The bench took note of the inconvenience caused to the judge. “The judge was put to great inconvenience and the accompanying hazard of boarding the running train. The incident made the brother judge put forth three suggestions to the Indian Railways, which, if implemented, would go a long way to ensure passengers’ comfort during the journey,” the order added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-hc-issues-direction-to-railways-to-consider-re-prioritisation-of-berths/story-W8suCfva6jyM2hp0x9GnyH.html

The campaign seeks to open up commercial activities in a bid to revive economic activities that have been battered by the pandemic. Follow latest updates on coronavirus hereHowever, Mumbai-based retailers have written to CM Thackeray, urging him to let all shops in the city open after lockdown 3:0 ends on Friday (July 31). Shops in Mumbai, the epicentre of Covid-19 in the state and the country as well, have been allowed to open on alternative days. Salons and hotels, too, are operating under strict protocols, including maintaining social distancing norms to keep the contagion at bay. Viren Shah, president, Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association (FRTWA), said the current arrangement is economically unviable for retailers. “Shops are allowed to open for only around 12 days a month. This doesn’t help our cause, as we can’t even pay our monthly rents or salaries to staff due to restricted economic activities,” Shah said. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage However, in a recent interview to Saamana, the Shiv Sena mouthpiece, the CM had made it clear that the lockdown wouldn’t be abruptly lifted in a bid to guard against a second wave of viral infection in Maharashtra, a trend that has been reported from other countries that have been in the grip of the pandemic. He explained that a gradual easing of lockdown restrictions is the only way forward to flatten the viral curve. On Wednesday, the state extended the lockdown until August 31, albeit with a few more relaxations. Markets and shopping malls have been allowed to re-open from August 5, but movie halls, theatres, food courts, restaurants and gymnasiums are still off-limits. Eateries, operating out of shopping malls, have been allowed to operate as takeaway services. The spike in Covid-19 cases in the densely-congested Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and other cities such as Pune have derailed the state government’s plan to allow more transport facilities and additional workforce in offices. State government officials said that the easing of lockdown restrictions have also taken into account the upcoming religious festivals such as Bakr Eid, or Eid-al-Adha, on Saturday (August 1) and the 11-day Ganeshotsav that starts from August 22. On Wednesday, Maharashtra reported 9,211 new Covid-19 cases, as it breached the unenviable 400,000 mark. At present, the state has 1,46,129 active cases and the recovery rate is at 59.84%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-unlockdown-retailers-demand-permission-to-keep-shops-open-on-all-days/story-We79MieN9pT0XYOuuz3qJO.html

A distinguished social reformer and one of the pillars of Bengal Renaissance, who played a major role towards women empowerment. His relentless efforts eradicated many social evils and made Widows’ Remarriage Act possible,” Shah tweeted on Wednesday. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and Lok Sabha member Abhishek Banerjee took on Shah on Twitter. Also read: West Bengal Congress president Somen Mitra dies, cremation today; leaders pay tributeIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar was a great social reformer who still stands tall as an inspiration for secular, free-thinking society.

Ironic how @AmitShah ji had scant regard for Vidyasagar’s values when his men vandalised the latter’s bust. Please drop this facade of petty tokenism!” tweeted Banerjee who heads the TMC’s youth wing. He also quoted Shah’s tweet. The TMC too targeted Shah in a tweet written in Bengali. CM Mamata Banerjee, however, did not join the war. “Tribute to Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, social reformer and educationist, on his death anniversary. He is one of the tallest figures of the Bengal Renaissance. His contribution in women’s education and legalising widow-remarriage is undeniable,” she tweeted. Vidyasagar’s bust was vandalised inside Vidyasagar College in central Kolkata during a Lok Sabha campaign rally led by Shah in May 2019. The TMC alleged that Bharatiya Janata Party workers stormed into the college and damaged the bust. The opposition party alleged that TMC workers damaged the bust and attacked the rally by pelting stones from the college and adjacent buildings. This became a raging issue in the Lok Sabha polls but the BJP managed to win 18 of the state’s 42 seats, marking its best-ever performance in Bengal. Though police started an investigation, the real culprits are yet to be named by the government. “It is the state’s responsibility to probe the incident. The government has failed there. Mamata Banerjee never showed respect to the great sons of Bengal. She only used their names for political gain,” Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh told the media on Wednesday afternoon. This is the second time the vandalism issue has been raised by the TMC in less than a month. In the second week of July, a BJP worker was arrested in Purulia district in connection with the breaking of a statue of Kanhu Murmu, one of the four leaders of the 1855 Santhal rebellion against the British and local landlords. The incident triggered political tension. The alleged vandalism on July 7 took place at the village of Sandhya Rani Tudu, a TMC tribal leader and minister of state for backward classes welfare. The village is located in the Manbazar assembly constituency that Tudu represents.“@BJP4Bengal has sworn to attack and destroy every grain of Bengal’s cultural heritage. First, they vandalized Vidyasagar’s statue and now they have vandalized the statue of revered tribal hero Kanho Murmu in Purulia. We strongly condemn such acts of iconoclasm,” TMC tweeted after the incident. The BJP has alleged that the vandalism in Purulia is a conspiracy to malign it as TMC is fast losing ground in the state’s tribal belts before the 2021 assembly polls.The BJP won the Lok Sabha seats of Purulia, Bishnupur and Midnapore where tribals constitute a sizeable section of the vote bank because local people have lost faith in the TMC, said Khagen Murmu, BJP Lok Sabha member from the Malda North seat and president of the party’s scheduled tribe front in Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-leader-abhishek-banerjee-takes-on-amit-shah-over-2019-vandalism-on-vidyasagar-s-death-anniversary/story-HC2isukXpTeZO2L3pKJYdJ.html
30-07-2020||India||Lobbying intensifies in Karnataka BJP amidst talks of cabinet reshuffle||Just two days after 24 legislators of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were named to head various boards and corporations run by the Karnataka government, there is mounting speculation that changes are in the offing for the saffron party-led government, including a cabinet expansion and reshuffle.Eight term legislator and ministerial aspirant Umesh Katti, speaking to reporters in Chikkodi on Wednesday, said that the time is not far off when he and G H Thippa Reddy would-be ministers. Thippa Reddy is a BJP MLA from Chitradurga and was amongst the 24 nominated to head various boards and corporations. He had, however, rejected the offer to head the Devraj Urs Backward Classes Corporation saying ‘the offer was an insult to him’ as he was a senior MLA and a ministerial aspirant.Subsequently, four names, including him, that had been announced were withdrawn by the government. Katti hinted that he and Thippa Reddy would be amongst those who would join the cabinet during the upcoming reshuffle. “It is the prerogative of the CM to decide on the cabinet. I am confident that both Thippa Reddy and I, who are senior MLA’s, will be in the cabinet shortly.”Also read: HD Kumaraswamy’s Rajasthan comment sparks Twitter war with CongressMeanwhile, a couple of cabinet ministers in the Yediyurappa ministry rushed to Delhi to meet the leaders of the BJP high command. Deputy CM Lakshman Savadi, who is camping in Delhi for the last three days, speaking to reporters said that he was not an aspirant for the CM’s post and Yediyurappa would continue in that position for the next three years.He also claimed that he was not in the national capital to lobby for any position but to meet union ministers regarding pending works of his department. Savadi handles the transport portfolio. Shashikalla Jolle, minister of women and child development also rushed to Delhi to meet party leaders. Several loyalist MLAs of the party are also upset at being offered ‘insignificant’ and ‘non-lucrative’ chairmanships of boards and corporations while defectors from Congress and JDS have been made ministers.Apart from Thippa Reddy, Mudigere MLA MP Kumaraswamy too had publicly expressed his unhappiness. Kumaraswamy refused to become the Chairman of Karnataka Marketing and Consulting Agencies Ltd saying he does not want the position and had even boycotted the first expansion of the Yediyurappa cabinet after being denied a berth.A senior cabinet minister speaking to HT on condition of anonymity said, “Four to six minister may be dropped and others were given an opportunity. Talk of the CM himself being replaced is all hogwash. At least immediately it will not happen.”Noted political analyst professor Harish Ramaswamy said that the BJP in Karnataka had a task on its hands in finding a successor to Yediyurappa as well as in keeping MLAs who have been with the party for a long time happy. “To form the government, the defectors were rewarded with ministerships and now there is a backlash from the loyalists. The party has to do a delicate balancing act even as in the mid to long term it has to find a successor to replace Yediyurappa.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lobbying-intensifies-in-karnataka-bjp-amidst-talks-of-cabinet-reshuffle/story-BZza0aR59ap1WF1QKmMMMJ.html

Mitra was 78 and is survived by his son Rohan Mitra, state youth Congress leader, and wife Sikha Mitra, a former legislator. “Saddened to hear about the passing away of veteran leader, former MP and West Bengal Congress president Somen Mitra. My deepest condolences to his family, followers and well-wishers,” tweeted chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Mitra was admitted to the hospital a week ago and underwent dialysis twice. He will be cremated later in the day, said members of the family. “All my love and support to family and friends of Somen Mitra at this difficult time. We will remember him with love, fondness and respect,” tweeted Rahul Gandhi.Mitra was elected legislator from the Sealdah constituency in central Kolkata seven times. He was also elected to the Lok Sabha as a Trinamool Congress candidate in 2009 when he left the Congress for a few years only to return to the party again.Mitra was state Congress president twice. During his first stint between 1992 and 1998, Mamata Banerjee left the party and formed the Trinamool Congress, alleging that Congress had become a weak Opposition against the Left Front government.Leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha and former president of the party’s West Bengal unit Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said he has lost a guardian. “I started my career under his leadership. He helped me become a people’s representative for the first time.” BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, “Mitra was the face of the old political culture that was marked by decency and courtesy.”CPI(M) politburo member and former Lok Sabha MP Md Salim said, “Mitra was one of those old timers who stayed in touch with people and knew individuals by their names and faces. He knew constituencies like the palm of his hand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-congress-president-somen-mitra-dies-cremation-today-leaders-pay-tribute/story-ACeO9DGqRvQnw7eCO03LaN.html

30-07-2020||India||Somen Mitra: Master organiser who failed to stop spilt in Bengal Congress||West Bengal Congress chief Somen Mitra will go down in the history as a master strategist of his time who failed to stop the spilt in the party, leading to the formation of TMC and the decline of the Congress as a political force in the state. Known as a bête noire of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, it was during Mitra’s second term as Congress president in late ‘90s that the Congress lost its status as the principal opposition of the then mighty Left Front regime to the Trinamool Congress (TMC). Mitra passed away at a city hospital in the early hours of Thursday at the age of 78. He was in the hospital for 17 days due to heart and kidney-related problems. He died following a cardiac arrest, hospital sources said. Born on December 31, 1941 in Jessore district of erstwhile East Bengal (now Bangladesh), Mitra was the eldest of five siblings. A stalwart in Bengal politics, Mitra’s political career began during the tumultuous ‘60s as a student leader and spanned over five decades. After being baptized in politics as a student leader in 1967, when Bengal had its first non-Congress government, Mitra, through his organisational and oratory skills, quickly rose through the ranks and became one of the most popular leaders of the party along with late union minister Priya Ranjan Dasmunsi.Also read|  ‘Will remember him with love, fondness and respect’: Rahul condoles Somen Mitra’s death Mentored by Congress stalwarts such as A B A Ghani Khan Chowdhury, Mitra’s first brush with electoral politics came in 1972 when he became the youngest MLA in the West Bengal Assembly from the Sealdah seat at the age of 26. Except 1977, Mitra continued to win the Sealdah assembly segment, which now ceases to exist after delimitation, for six consecutive terms from 1982-2006. Commonly known as ‘Chhorada’ (younger brother), Mitra was one of the most firebrand politicians of the 1960s and ‘70s and played a crucial role in the fight against the Naxals in Kolkata during that period. He was considered as “favourite” of the Congress high command, who enjoyed an excellent rapport with the Gandhi family. But that did not stop him from defeating Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s handpicked candidate D P Roy during the 2000 Rajya Sabha poll by pitting a rival candidate. Mitra, who went on to become three-time president of the Congress’ West Bengal unit from 1992-1996, 1996-1998 and then again from September 2018, was instrumental in clocking the best tally of 82 seats against the Left Front in the 1996 assembly polls. But with Congress and the Left Front coming together at the Centre to support the United Front government, its credibility as the principal opposition to the CPI(M) in Bengal reached a nadir. It was then Mamata Banerjee, then West Bengal Youth Congress president, was emerging as the main opposition force who had an uncompromising approach against the Left Front. Mitra and Banerjee got involved in an inner-party struggle within the Bengal Congress unit. The relations between the two hit rock bottom when Banerjee pitted herself against Mitra for the post of state Congress president. Mitra, a veteran of Congress politics, managed to win the internal party election by 22 votes, following dramatic scenes at the Maharashtra Niwas in South Kolkata. It is alleged that he along with the then Congress national president Sitaram Kesari cornered Banerjee in the party, following which she broke away to form the Trinamool Congress in 1998. With the TMC aligning with the BJP and replacing Congress as the main opposition of the Left Front in Bengal by bagging seven seats in the 1998 parliamentary polls, Mitra resigned as state Congress president. He left the Congress in 2008 to form his political outfit Pragatisheel (Progressive) Indira Congress. But as the saying goes there are no permanent enemies or friends in politics, Mitra merged his outfit with the Banerjee’s TMC ahead of the 2009 Lok Sabha polls and won the election on a TMC ticket from the Diamond Harbour parliamentary seat that year. Following differences with Banerjee, Mitra quit the TMC in 2014 to rejoin the Congress. Battered by infighting and defections to the TMC, Mitra was again made Congress president in 2018, to revive the fortunes of the party. He was one of the chief architects behind the CPI (M)-led Left Front and Congress alliance in West Bengal during the 2016 assembly polls. He was keen on having an alliance with the Left during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, but after the talks failed and both the parties faced a drubbing, he was instrumental in bringing them together after the elections. Mitra, along with Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, was a strong advocate against any form of alliance with the TMC in Bengal, as they felt, “The TMC lacks credentials as a force against the BJP and it was due to TMC that the saffron camp had gained ground in the state”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/somen-mitra-master-organiser-who-failed-to-stop-spilt-in-bengal-congress/story-WL1g8V9nlCZjy1MguMxPBL.html
30-07-2020||India||Tribute to ‘corona warriors’ at Red Fort: India gears up for Independence Day amid Covid-19 crisis||The Covid-19 pandemic has been the biggest spoiler of the year, affecting economies, crores of industries and businesses along with dampening spirits. The crisis is likely to affect this year’s Independence Day celebrations as well. The ramparts of the Red Fort will not be the same as on August 15 every year. The government has made many amends to this year’s celebrations and plans to make arrangements keeping preventive measures in mind in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The number of guests attending the ceremony will be limited this year while children, who are the centre of attraction of Independence Day celebrations every year, will also be absent.Many agencies are involved in the preparation of the Independence Day event at Red Fort, including the Archaeological Survey of India, Jal Board, Municipal Corporation, Public Works Department (PWD), Delhi Police, among others.As per a report by HT’s Hindi language publication Live Hindustan, the following are some of the measures taken to ensure that this year’s Independence Day celebrations take place keeping the coronavirus situation in mind. Social distancing will be the most important aspect kept in mind while organising the event. A minimum distance of six-feet will be kept while making seating arrangements for the guests. The guests will not be seated where the Tricolor flag is hoisted from the ramparts of the Red Fort. Arrangements are being made for guests to sit at the lower level of the ramparts with limited seats. It is likely that the authorities give a miss to children’s participation during this year’s Independence Day celebrations in the national capital. Nation’s ‘corona warriors’, from healthcare professionals like nurses, doctors, paramedical staff to policemen, among others, are likely to be invited to the Red Fort ceremony in limited numbers. Apart from this, the guests may also be able to watch the ceremony on an LED screen. This year’s Independence Day celebrations in the national capital shall consist of the ceremony at the Red Fort which will include the presentation of a Guard of Honour by the Armed Forces and the Delhi Police to the Prime Minister, unfurling of the National Flag accompanied by playing of the National Anthem and firing of 21-gun salute. The prime minister’s speech shall be followed by the singing of the National Anthem and the release of tricoloured balloons at the end. “At Home” reception at Rashtrapati Bhawan will take place.In an advisory issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs last week, the government pressed for the use of technology “in the best possible manner” for Independence Day events across the country. The government has strictly directed to avoid large gatherings and congregation of people in large numbers.“The events organized could be web-cast in order to reach out people at large, who are not able to participate,” the release issued by Ministry of Home Affairs stated.“Performance of Police/Military bands may be recorded at places of historic importance associated with the Independence movement; and recorded versions thereof may be displayed through large screens/digital media, during public functions and on social media,” the release noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tribute-to-corona-warriors-at-red-fort-india-gears-up-for-independence-day-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-L21JIjYUK8RZs2gpU3o7yH.html

30-07-2020||India||House panel seeks inclusion of migrants in social security code||The Parliamentary labour committee asked for the universalization of social security to cover migrant workers and the unorganized domestic workers even as it adopted a report on the much-awaited Social Security Code on Wednesday. The parliamentary committee, led by Biju Janata Dal leader Bhartruhari Mahtab, demanded the creation of an unemployment insurance or social security fund which can come handy for workers at the time of job losses—which has also happened because of the coronavirus disease pandemic—and special social security numbers for migrant workers so they can avail the benefits of government schemes. The panel has also sought an expansion in the definition of migrant workers, adding that the proposed social security fund must cover all workers who are not covered under provident fund or Employees’ State Insurance. While there are social support measures such as MGNREGA for rural workers, the social security fund can provide immediate financial help if an unorganized sector worker loses job. The panel has also expanded unorganized sector to include workers who are hired through contractors, those who join a factory directly and the self-employed workers. According to two members of the panel, the social security fund or the unemployment fund can be created with contribution from employers and employees, through donations and even using CSR funds. “This fund can be helpful for workers in case of job losses and in situation arising out Covid-like situations,” a panel member said. Meanwhile, the code, one of the four key measures of labour sector reforms, face opposition from CPI(M)’s Elamaram Kareem and a DMK member, who are also likely to push a dissent note to register their protest. According to a senior leader, DMK’s D Ravikumar, K Subbarayan of CPI and a Congress leader demanded that the meeting on Wednesday should be deferred as many people could not attend due to Covid-related reasons. According to government estimates, 1.09 crore migrant workers have returned home in the past three months after the pandemic swept India. A portable social security number for India’s unorganized workforce is a key issue for the labour committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-panel-seeks-inclusion-of-migrants-in-social-security-code/story-wZscNiNcdLWmhQmIqDfh8I.html

Balabhaskar, his wife Lakshmi and daughter Tejaswini were returning from Thrissur to Thiruvananthapuram on September 25, 2018 in their Innova car, which was being driver by their driver Arjun K Narayan, when the car hit a tree on NH-66. The daughter died on the spot while Balabhaskar died a week later in hospital. Lakshmi survived the incident. His father C C Unni wasn’t convinced with Kerala police probe and alleged that the suspects in the case had connections with gold smuggling racket and that there were transactions in the account of Balabhaskar after his death. The DRI had also arrested few persons in 2018 in gold smuggling cases who knew Balabhaskar.

More than 15,000 migrant workers of the district who have returned were troubled with the thought of an uncertain future, but a local NGO Kandhamal Zilla Sabuja Baidya Sangathan exhorted them to think about ways to irrigate their farmland.One of the workers Tusharkant Pradhan of Guhibadi village in Daringibadi block was sitting idle when local NGO Kandhamal Zilla Sabuju Baidya Sangathan called a meeting to do something for the village during lockdown. “The primary reason we all migrated out was lack of work during non-monsoon days. After monsoon, there was no water in our farmlands. Though there was a stream flowing at the nearby hill, the water was of no use to us due to lack of canal. We were sitting idle during lockdown. So when the NGO proposed digging up a 750-metre long canal from Patangi hill in lieu of clothes and food. We decided to give it a try,” said Pradhan.Like him, several migrant workers as well as other non-migrant people in Ranipanga village of neighbouring Kotgarh block too followed suit by digging canals from the nearby stream. Armed with crowbars, hoes and shovels, people from 77 tribal families in the village led by sarpanch Johan Pradhan would gather in the morning and work till evening.“As there was no explosive to smash the huge boulders, we would heat up the boulders for the entire night by lighting fires then let it cool in the morning by dew. The stress caused in the rocks by the expansion and contraction made it easy for us to break them with shovels,” said Pradhan. It took about a month before the one-kilometre-long canal with depth of about four feet to Ranipanga from the nearby stream could be completed.The first phase of bringing water to the village was completed early this month. Now the villagers are building smaller canals to get the water to individual fields.Like Guhibadi and Ranipanga, people in Kangadaka, Jidingmala, Ladangi, Lambabanda, Gadapakali and Gududi too have dug up around one-kilometre-long canal each in their villages that would irrigate over 1,000 acres of farmlands which otherwise remained parched.Dinabandhu Maharana, secretary of the NGO Kandhamal Zilla Sabuju Baidya Sangathan, which provided food and clothes to the tribals working on the project, said the whole work was done without expenditure of a single government rupee. “No NREGA money was spent. People saw that they stand to gain if they slog hard for a canal. We just motivated them through some food and clothes. The people deserve all the credit,” said Maharana.Now that the villagers have built rudimentary canals, the district administration plans to pitch in. Daringbadi block development officer Abhimanyu Behera said the administration would try to use the government resources to turn the canal into a concrete, permanent structures. “The villagers have shown exemplary spirit,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-300-migrant-workers-in-kandhamal-dig-canal-through-hills-to-bring-water-to-their-land/story-mXJHFifapX4fkjVQMSkKSL.html

30-07-2020||India||Supreme Court clears hurdle in highway connecting India, Thailand||The Supreme Court has cleared a major roadblock in the completion of a Trilateral Highway Connectivity project between India, Myanmar and Thailand by staying the litigation initiated by the defaulting contractor before the Manipur high court. The order passed on Tuesday came on a petition filed by the ministry of external affairs. India had signed an agreement with Myanmar on August 29, 2016 for construction and upgrading of 69 bridges of Second World War vintage as part of the ambitious road project beginning from Manipur till Thailand. But ever since the project was awarded to a joint venture of Mumbai-based Niraj Cement Structurals Limited and Manipur Tribal Development Corporation Limited in November 2017, delays lagged the project, as a result of which India acting through project consultant IRCON Infrastructure and Services Limited terminated the contract on December 24, 2018. The challenge to the termination order filed by the contractor is pending before a division bench of Manipur high court since April 2019. Earlier, the contractor’s petition was dismissed by a single judge citing lack of territorial jurisdiction to hear the case. The Centre has throughout claimed that Manipur HC lacks jurisdiction to hear the case. Moreover, the contractor has recourse to arbitration under the agreement. The MEA in its plea said that further pendency of litigation before Manipur HC will harm India’s bilateral relations with friendly neighbours and cast the country in a bad light jeopardizing other “trans-nationally significant development and connectivity initiatives”. Attorney General KK Venugopal appeared for Centre. The apex bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian issued notice on the Centre’s petition, directed stay of the writ appeal proceedings, and listed the matter after two weeks. The project was to complete by November 27 this year. Till date, not one bridge out of the 69 bridges is ready. The Indian Ambassador to Myanmar wrote to the Centre on June 24, 2020 apprising the Indian government of Myanmar’s expectation of early completion of the project. The project is a grant-in-aid initiative by India as part of its “Act East Policy” and will benefit Myanmar as the dilapidated bridges pose a danger to human life and property.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-clears-hurdle-in-highway-connecting-india-thailand/story-m4KcK0PypzswHb4xNanEAP.html

30-07-2020||India||Stolen in 1998, rare Shiva statue on way from London to India||An exquisite 9th century statue of Natesh Shiva stolen from the Ghateshwar temple in Chittorgarh district of Rajasthan in February 1998 and recovered in London will be on its way to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) on Thursday.Indian officials here said that British authorities were alerted in 2003 when it emerged that the statue had been smuggled into the United Kingdom. They interacted with a private collector, who had it in his possession and later voluntarily returned it to the Indian high commission in 2005.Since then the statue has been displayed prominently in India House. In August 2017 a team of the ASI experts examined the idol and confirmed that it is the same ‘murti’ that was stolen from the Ghateshwar temple in Baroli village.The statue’s return to India is the latest in recent such priceless items recovered in the UK and handed over to the Indian mission, which has been working with British law enforcement authorities to trace, seize and retrieve several stolen artefacts.Recent items recovered and repatriated to India include a 17th century bronze idol of Navanitha Krishna and a 2nd century limestone carved pillar motif returned by the US embassy on August 15, 2019; a 12th century bronze statue of Buddha handed over by Scotland Yard on August 15, 2018; and a Bramha- Brahmani sculpture, which was stolen from the world heritage site Rani Ki Vav in Gujarat, returned to ASI in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stolen-in-1998-rare-shiva-statue-on-way-from-london-to-india/story-Kre1LI6auXY5ayLqVSX5vN.html
30-07-2020||India||Supreme Court extends scope of Central Vista hearings||The Supreme Court on Wednesday expanded the scope of its hearing in the challenge to the Central Vista redevelopment project and will now also examine the validity of the June 17 environmental clearance (EC) given to it. This will be in addition to the issue surrounding the legality of the change in land use which is already under the consideration of the top court through two petitions pending before it.The court decided this after a former IAS officer and two environmentalists sought intervention in the matter and sought a recall of the apex court’s June 21 order which said that any petition or proceeding concerning the Central Vista project will have to be heard by the Supreme Court.The interveners, former secretary of Ministry of Environment and Forests, Meena Gupta, and environmentalists Pradip Krishen and Ashish Kothari in their intervention application filed through advocate Anshuman Srivastava on July 7, pointed out that the project involves other issues like grant of environmental clearance which can be challenged before the National Green Tribunal (NGT), but that the top court’s earlier order posed a hindrance to take recourse to other legal remedies.A three-judge bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar then asked the interveners to file a fresh petition before the apex court challenging the EC for the project on June 17.The Central Vista houses iconic buildings like the Parliament House, Rashtrapati Bhavan, the North and South Block buildings, which house important ministries, other buildings around Rajpath, and India Gate. The union government plans to redevelop the Central Vista by constructing a new Parliament house, a new residential complex that will house the Prime Minister and the Vice President besides several new office buildings.The petitions already pending before the SC challenge a notification issued by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on December 21, 2019 regarding changes in land use for the redevelopment.One of the petitioners in that case, Rajeev Suri has challenged the alterations envisaged by the central government on the ground that it involves changes to land use and standards of population density and that the DDA is not vested with the requisite power to bring about such changes. He submitted that the power, if at all, for bringing about such changes lies with the central government. Another petitioner, Lt. Colonel (Retd. ) Anuj Srivastava, challenged the public hearings held to raise objections to the exercise, arguing that the hearings were a mere formality .“This is a huge project involving many clearances. Other legal remedies available should not be put in one bucket due to this case,” senior counsel Shyam Divan, appearing for the interveners, said on Wednesday. The court, however, suggested that interveners should withdraw their application and file a fresh petition before the Supreme Court challenging the EC. Divan and advocate Shikhil Suri and senior counsel Sanjay Hegde who were appearing for the two petitioners agreed to the proposal.“In deference to the observations made by the Court, Mr. Shyam Divan submits that he would commend to the applicant(s) to file a substantive writ petition challenging the environmental clearance dated June 17 by way of writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution (before the Supreme Court)… As assured by Mr. Shyam Divan, learned senior counsel, the substantive writ petition will be filed within one week from today,” the court recorded in its order.The case will be heard again in the third week of August.The central government has maintained that the redevelopment is in conformity with the existing laws and will not harm any heritage buildings. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, on Wednesday, said the proposed new buildings belong to the nation and public and disapproved the language used by petitioners while making arguments||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-extends-scope-of-central-vista-hearings/story-L4a612plY5vvUiv0RhXqPJ.html
30-07-2020||India||UP Sunni Waqf Board forms trust to build mosque||The Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board formed a 15-member-trust on Wednesday to look after the construction of a mosque on five acres of land allotted by the Supreme Court that paved the way for a Ram Temple in Ayodhya town in a landmark verdict last year. Zufar Ahmed Faruqi, chairman the board – which was the main Muslim litigant in the title suit -- said the trust was named as Indo Islamic Cultural Foundation, which will ensure the development of the allocated land in Dhannipur village in Ayodhya, which the board accepted in February 2020. “The trust will ensure the construction of mosque and other facilities to facilitate the general public,” read a statement issued by the board. In November last year, the top court directed the Centre to set up a trust for the construction of a temple at the 2.77 acre disputed site in Ayodhya, and allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Sunni Central Waqf Board for building a new mosque. The verdict ended a decades-old dispute over the religious site, where the Babri Masjid was demolished on December 6. 1992.The board statement stated that the trust would have 15 members. The board’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) was nominated as founder trustee. Chairman Faruqi was nominated as the chief trustee. The board also nominated Adnan Farukh Shah, Athar Hussain, Faez Aftab, Mohammed Junaid Siddiqui, Sheikh Sauduzzaman, Mohammed Rashid and Imran Ahmed as the other members. “The Trust will co-opt the remaining six trustees. The secretary of the Trust will also be its official spokesperson,” said Faruqi.The development came on a day state police sounded high alert in all districts with stern direction to intensify vigilance and bolster security during the foundation-laying ceremony of the Ram temple, scheduled to be held in Ayodhya on August 5. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to lay the foundation stone around 12.15pm that day. Police officials said senior officers of additional director general (ADG), inspector general (IG) and deputy IG (DIG) rank were deputed in nine sensitive districts sharing a border with Ayodhya and located on the India-Nepal porous border. UP Director General of Police (DGP) Hitesh Chandra Awasthy’s order stated that police have to adopt zero-error policy to ensure no law-and-order problem, crime control and hassle-free VVIP programmes, following which senior officials were asked to supervise police preparations in some districts.State police officials said a similar alert was sounded in all districts in view of upcoming festivals and Independence Day celebrations. They said all district police chiefs were asked to intensify vigilance at market places, bus stations, religious places and other crowded areas. They said the directions have also been issued to carry out regular checking drives to keep check on movement of suspicious people. Meanwhile, in Ayodhya, with many raising objection over the limited number of people being invited for the ‘bhumi pujan’, Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust announced a plan to felicitate ‘Kar Sevaks’ (Hindu devotees) at another grand function — Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir Nirman Yajya — to be organised after the coronavirus pandemic is over. For the ‘bhumi pujan’ function, the trust has invited only 200 people, including Prime Minister Modi. Other invitees include Union ministers, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh office-bearers and industrialists.Champat Rai, general secretary of the Trust, issued an appeal to ‘Kar Sevaks’ to be patient and wait for the pandemic to get over. “In the Ram Mandir movement, large number of ‘kar sevaks’ had contributed. They all want to come to Ayodhya for the ‘bhumi pujan’. We also wanted the same but due to the Covid-19 pandemic this is not possible at present,” said Rai adding, “Bhumi pujan by the Prime Minister is necessary to start the construction work of Ram Mandir.”Assuring to invite ‘kar sevaks’ and all devotees in the near future, Rai said: “After the pandemic is over, the Trust will organise Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir Nirman Yajya in which all ‘Kar Sevaks’ and devotees of lord Ram will be invited.” He also requested people not to come to Ayodhya and instead watch the live telecast of the ceremony on Doordarshan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trust-to-build-mosque-announced/story-3AZl5SlxrITErj7iEPLYIP.html
30-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||On Tuesday, there were 10,887 active cases of the coronavirus disease in Delhi; the corresponding number for Kerala was 10,103. The difference is narrowing — Kerala, once touted as a global role model on how to manage the disease, saw more daily cases than Delhi, once criticised for its poor record in managing Covid-19, on Tuesday (1.167 to 1,056).Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIt’s important to look at active cases. According to the HT dashboard, India recorded 1.53 million coronavirus disease cases cumulatively till Tuesday evening, but almost a million of these (986,061) have recovered. Another 34,200 people have succumbed to the virus. That leaves 510,063 active cases. From helping identify new clusters of infections (or hot spots) to highlighting where health care efforts need to be focused, this is the relevant number (and it doesn’t get enough attention, including in this column).Interestingly, the number of recovered patients is certain to cross a million as I write this on Wednesday afternoon [Editor’s note: According to the HT dashboard, India ended Wednesday with 1,019,297 recovered patients]. That’s definitely a number worth celebrating.As is the Mumbai sero survey (antibody test) data that was released on Tuesday and showed that around 40% of the around 7,000 people surveyed in the city have Sars-CoV-2 antibodies — indicating that they have been exposed to the disease. Of this, 57% of the roughly 4,200 people tested from the city’s slums and 16% of the approximately 2,800 from residential societies showed antibodies. The sample was much smaller (a third) of a similar sero survey in Delhi, which showed that 23% of those surveyed were exposed to the disease; and unlike the Delhi survey, the Mumbai one was conducted in only three of the city’s 24 wards (the Delhi one covered all 11 districts). Still, the Mumbai survey is good news for two reasons: one, it means the death rate (as measured by the case fatality rate) in Mumbai is much lower than what it is on paper; and two, these people are probably immune to the disease now (at least in the short-term). The results of the sero survey in Mumbai come even as the city seems to have seen off the worst of the pandemic. As HT reported on Tuesday, the positivity rate in the city is finally nudging 10% (on the way down), and there is no shortage of hospital beds (about 48% of Covid-19 hospital beds in Mumbai are free).But Mumbai still had 19,990 active cases (as of Tuesday; the number is down from 28,924 at the end of June, showing the significant turnaround the city has achieved), and Maharashtra, with 144,998, the most in the country (the national aggregate is 510,063). The list of states by active cases is illuminating: the top three have around 50%, the top five, around 70%, and the top 10, 83%. This list (reproduced along with this column) merits watching.As does the number of daily deaths, which has been inching up steadily. Sure, it hasn’t grown at the same pace as cases, but barring spikes (caused typically by states reconciling their death data; Tamil Nadu, for instance, did this last week), the number has continued to rise. Through July, it has traversed the 400s, the 500s, and the 600s, and is now in the 700s. Between July 23 and 28, it was in the 700s five times. And the seven-day average of daily deaths has continued to inch up. India’s case fatality rate remains low when compared to that of other countries, but in absolute terms, only those worst affected by Covid-19 have seen deaths in excess of 700 a day. That isn’t a number we should forget even as we (justifiably) cheer our low case fatality rate and the high number of recovered patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-rASacRxcpwmM3jtXMZrRlM.html

The officer’s name is reported to be Sheshdhar Pandey.The inquiry was ordered after the incident invited condemnation from political fronts including the Bahujan Jagriti Manch of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). “This is how Mirzapur Police kicks the helpless from behind. A man standing near Ganga was kicked by the Kotwal (station incharge). The youth fell into river Ganga,” a tweet from the organisation’s official handle said. मिर्ज़ापुर-पुलिस ऐसे ही निरीह जनता को पीछे से दुलत्ती मारती है।विंध्याचल में गंगा के किनारे खड़े युवक को नवागत कोतवाल ने मारी पीछे से लात।युवक गिरा नीचे गंगा में। @myogiadityanath @Uppolice @adgzonevaranasi @digmirzapur @mirzapurpolice pic.twitter.com/vwkLw9IwmSA statement released by the Mirzapur police, however, defended Pandey’s behavior and claimed that he was only trying to enforce social distancing at the river bank, where a crowd had gathered to watch an ongoing search operation for the body of a man who had drowned in the river some time ago, according to a news report in the Print.It added that Pandey was only trying to nudge the man, which threw him off balance, resulting in the fall.A tweet by the Mirzapur police later claimed that the SHO had been served a warning and an initial inquiry in the incident has been ordered.“The station house officer of Vindhyachal was served a warning over the incident and a senior police officer has been asked to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the matter,” a tweet from Mirzapur Police’s official handle claimed.Uttar Pradesh police has recently been under scrutiny in Vikas Dubey encounter case and also in the murder case of a scribe in Ghaziabad. While it is accused of human rights violations by allegedly conducting a fake encounter in the first case, in the latter, it is under the spotlight for alleged inaction against local goons leading to murder of a journalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-falls-into-river-after-up-police-officer-kicks-him-video-goes-viral/story-r407BmSSCQ7CIHu5eQ42mJ.html

The soldiers fought off numerically superior Chinese troops in the remote sector. Colonel B Santosh Babu, the commanding officer of 16 Bihar, was among the 20 soldiers killed in the seven-hour deadly conflict near Patrolling Point 14 in Galwan Valley, where outnumbered Indian troops inflicted heavy casualties on the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA). The names of all battle casualties are inscribed on the memorial, the officials said.During a recent visit to Ladakh, defence minister Rajnath Singh met and acknowledged the bravery of the soldiers from 16 Bihar in the presence of the military’s top brass.Beijing has not disclosed the number of fatalities it suffered in the Galwan Valley clash but according to India’s assessment, the PLA suffered twice as many casualties.Apart from 16 Bihar, soldiers from 3 Punjab, 3 Medium Regiment and 81 Field Regiment were involved in the first deadly conflict between Indian and Chinese troops along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in more than five decades.The Indian soldiers confronted the Chinese troops, who refused to remove their installations and vacate the area, triggering a violent clash that involved more than 600 rival soldiers at its peak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/soldiers-killed-in-galwan-will-be-honoured-at-war-memorial/story-NVfPvHQOYzF4DaNWPw7vNJ.html
30-07-2020||India||Govt unveils sweeping changes for education||The Union Cabinet passed India’s first new National Education Policy in at least 28 years, recommending primary education in local languages, facilitating the possible entry of foreign universities in India, creating a single higher-education regulator, and easier board examinations -- wide-ranging reforms aimed at making the Indian education system more contemporary and skill-oriented. NEP also renamed the HRD (human resource development) ministry as the education ministry. Also read | Over 2 crore children will be brought back to schools: Amit KhareThe policy also sets ambitious targets: increasing the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) to 50% from the current 26%, creating an additional 35 million seats in colleges, and increasing the education budget to 6% of the GDP from the present 4%. The NEP lays down that by 2040, all higher education institutions (HEIs) shall aim to become multidisciplinary. It also says that by 2030 there will be at least one large multidisciplinary institution in or near every district. It also moots Special Education Zones (SEZ) in backward districts.Information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar, flanked by HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank and HRD secretaries Amit Khare and Anita Karwal, said it was after 34 years that India’s education policy was being overhauled. Indeed, while the last policy was announced in 1992, it was essentially a rehash of a 1986 one. The policy, drafted by a committee headed by former Isro chief K Kasturirangan submitted its report last year.The new policy brings with it a range of initiatives that touch every aspect of teaching and learning from the pre-school level to higher education including research.Some, like the recommendation on local languages or mother-tongues may be controversial. An early draft was criticised for this very issue, with allegations that the government was using it as a way to impose Hindi on people in non-Hindi speaking parts of the country. It is not clear whether the recommendation will be a rule or a guideline. SchoolsThe policy has emphasised that the mother tongue, local language or the regional language should be the medium of instruction at least till Grade 5, but preferably till Grade 8 and beyond. It also said that Sanskrit will be offered at all levels of school and higher education as an option for students, including in the three-language formula.“The policy makes it clear that mother tongue should be the preferable medium of instruction wherever possible. However, there is going to be no imposition of any language. It will be for the states to decide,” said a senior HRD ministry official who asked not to be named. Several foreign languages will also be offered at the secondary level. Indian Sign Language (ISL) will be standardised across the country, and National and State curriculum materials developed, for use by students with hearing impairment.The 10+2 structure of school curricula is to be replaced by a 5+3+3+4 curricular structure corresponding to ages 3-8, 8-11, 11-14, and 14-18 years, respectively. This will bring the hitherto uncovered age group of 3-6 years under school curriculum.The National Council for Education, Research and Training (NCERT) will develop a National Curricular and Pedagogical Framework for Early Childhood Care and Education (NCPFECCE) for children up to the age of 8. The NEP 2020 also calls for setting up of a National Mission on Foundational Literacy and Numeracy. A National Book Promotion Policy will also be formulated.Every state or district will be encouraged to establish “Bal Bhavans” as a special daytime boarding school, to participate in art-related, career-related, and play-related activities. Free school infrastructure can be used as Samajik Chetna Kendras.A common National Professional Standards for Teachers (NPST) will be developed by the National Council for Teacher Education by 2022, in consultation with NCERT, SCERTs, teachers and expert organisations from across levels and regions. Children with disabilities will be enabled to fully participate in the regular schooling process, it says.The NEP also envisages exams for students from Class 3 onwards. All students will take school examinations in Grades 3, 5, and 8, which will be conducted by the appropriate authority. Board exams for grades 10 and 12 will be continued, but redesigned with holistic development as the aim. A new National Assessment Centre, PARAKH (Performance Assessment, Review, and Analysis of Knowledge for Holistic Development), will be set up as a standards-setting body .The policy also suggests options to make exams stress-free. For instance, school boards could provide options to students on whether they want to take a tough maths exam or the comparatively easier version. It could be done for other subjects as well, secretary, school education, Anita Karwal, said at the press conference.Meanwhile, assessment reports will present a more holistic picture of the child’s development.Special emphasis will be laid on socially and economically disadvantaged Groups (SEDGs) which include gender, socio-cultural, and geographical identities and disabilities. This includes the setting up of a Gender Inclusion Fund and also Special Education Zones.For governance, the policy states schools can be organised into complexes or clusters which will be the basic unit of governance and ensure availability of all resources including infrastructure. The policy proposes that states and UTs set up independent State School Standards Authority (SSSA).Self-disclosure of all the basic regulatory information will be used extensively for public oversight and accountability. Higher educationIn higher education, NEP once again hopes to improve enrolment numbers, from a Gross Enrolment Ratio of 26.3% (2018) to 50% by 2035. It plans to add 35 million seats to higher education institutions.The policy also aims at encouraging top Indian institutions to establish campuses abroad and also pave way for the best foreign universities to come to India. This will be done through a separate legislation.The policy aims at breaking disciplinary barriers. Institutions, including the IITs, will become multi-disciplinary; degrees will have more flexibility; and students will get more choice in terms of subjects. Graduation can be in three or four years with multiple exit options and appropriate certification. For example, a certificate after 1 year, advanced diploma after 2 years, Bachelor’s Degree after 3 years and Bachelor’s degree with Research after 4 years.An Academic Bank of Credit is to be established for digitally storing academic credits. Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs), at par with the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) will be set up as models of best multidisciplinary education. A National Research Foundation will also be created.Regulatory bodies University Grants Commission (UGC) and the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) will pave way for a Higher Education Commission of India (HECI). HECI will be an overarching umbrella body for the entire higher education sector, excluding medical and legal education.The definition of university will allow a spectrum of institutions that range from research-intensive universities to teaching-intensive universities and autonomous degree-granting colleges. Affiliation of colleges is to be phased out in 15 years and a stage-wise mechanism is to be established for granting graded autonomy to colleges.The policy aims at making “India a global knowledge superpower”.The Indian way One of the stated aims of the policy is to instil a “deep-rooted pride” in being Indian, not only in thought, but also in spirit, intellect, and deeds, as well as to develop knowledge, skills, values, and dispositions that support responsible commitment to human rights, sustainable development and living, and global well-being.The policy also aims at “light but tight” regulation by a single regulator for higher education as well as increased access, equity, and inclusion.A National Mission for Mentoring will be established, with a large pool of outstanding senior/retired faculty – including those with the ability to teach in Indian languages.Efforts will be made to incentivise the merit of students belonging to SC, ST, OBC, and other socially or educationally disadvantaged groups. Private institutions will be encouraged to offer larger numbers of scholarships to their students.Online The policy, which comes at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic is raging, also suggests the creation of a dedicated unit for the purpose of orchestrating the building of digital infrastructure and digital content in the HRD ministry. An autonomous body, the National Educational Technology Forum (NETF), is to be created to provide a platform for the free exchange of ideas.To ensure the preservation, growth, and vibrancy of all Indian languages, NEP recommends setting an Indian Institute of Translation and Interpretation (IITI), National Institute (or Institutes) for Pali, Persian and Prakrit, strengthening of Sanskrit and all language departments in HEIs, and use mother tongue/local language as a medium of instruction in more HEI programmes .The policy also says that the Centre and the states will work together to increase public investment in Education sector to reach 6% of GDP.“The NEP 2020 advocates major reforms in higher education -- holistic and multidisciplinary education, flexibility of subject choices and programme durations, etc. The concept of a Multidisciplinary Education & Research University (MERU) will find resonance in our young campus. We welcome the creation of the National Research Foundation (NRF). With freedom comes responsibility. I am particularly appreciative of the forward-looking “common norm for public and private HEIs” -- every institution should be held accountable, in a progressive and fair way,” said Rupamanjari Ghosh, vice-chancellor, Shiv Nadar University, Greater Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-unveils-sweeping-changes-for-education/story-zSewHWq7IiCaOOLNXUiRcK.html
30-07-2020||India||GST compensation: ₹1.88L-cr needed to recoup states’ shortfall||The amount of compensation required to be paid to states for their revenue shortfall in the current financial year is expected to be at least Rs 1.88 lakh crore even if the Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection remains at the same level as last year, around Rs 12 lakh crore, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said. In 2019-20, the Centre paid a compensation of Rs 1,65,302 crore to the states; the last instalment of this was paid on this month. On Wednesday, The Hindu reported that revenue secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey told the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance on Tuesday that the government may not be in a position to pay compensation to states this year. The people cited in the first instance sad that this is likely given sluggish economic activity on account of the Covid-19 pandemic , the national lockdown that ended on May 31, and localised lockdowns that are still ongoing in some parts of the country. As per GST law, states have been assured a 14% increase in their annual GST revenue, but GST collection in 2020-21 is unlikely see any growth, they added. “There is virtually no money left to pay compensation to states from April 2020,” one of the three said. The states were paid Rs 1,65,302 crore GST compensation in 2019-20, even as total cess collection for the fiscal year was a mere Rs 95,444 crore. The gap was met from the balance in the compensation cess account of previous years and some money was transferred from the consolidated fund of India, he added.At the time of introducing the new indirect tax regime, the GST law assured states a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years (up to July 1, 2020) and the Centre committed to meet any shortfall in revenue through the cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liquor, cigarettes, aerated water, automobiles, coal and other tobacco products.According to a note circulated in the 40th GST Council meeting held on June 12, compensation cess collected in 2017-18 was Rs 62,612 crore, rose to Rs 95,081 crore in 2018-19 and further to Rs 95,444 crore in 2019-20. Compensation paid in 2017-18 was however, less than the total collection at Rs 41,146 crore and Rs 69,275 crore in 2018-19.The second person, who is a legal expert, said the law provides that the compensation will be paid out of the GST Compensation Fund, specifically created for this purpose. “Nowhere in the Compensation Act has been stated that in regard to a situation of shortfall in the GST Compensation Fund, the gap will be met by the central government,” he said. “It is now up to the GST Council to find a solution – how to augment revenue collection. Theoretically, the options before the Council for meeting the shortfall could be to rationalise tax rates, include more items under the compensation cess or increase the compensation cess, or recommend higher borrowing by states to be repaid by the future collection into the compensation fund,” the third person said.Finance ministers of some states, however, said paying compensation is the responsibility of the Union government. “According to news reports the hearing before Standing Committee on Finance, Centre has taken the stand that GST Compensation can’t be paid and present arrangements be revised by Council. Such a brazen betrayal of federal trust! Convene the Council meeting immediately as promised,” Kerala finance minister Thomas Isaac said in a tweet. The union finance ministry did not respond to e-mails seekinmg comment. GST Council is the apex federal body that takes all decisions related to the indirect tax. It is chaired by the Union finance minister. Finance ministers of states and union territories are its members and the council decisions are often unanimous.The third official said the Council will meet in August to resolve this matter. “This is not a systemic issue. The compensation cess fund has depleted because of the pandemic and not due to any system flaw in the GST regime. Covid-19 was an act of god, a force majure. The Council will take an appropriate view on this matter soon.” Pratik Jain, partner and leader of the indirect tax practice at PwC India said that a dialogue between the Centre and states is the only viable solution. “Increasing the ambit or rate of cess may not be a practical solution at this stage. The only viable option seems to be a renegotiation between the Centre and states about the quantum and period of compensation. Eventually, we will have to find a way to ensure that state finances are self sustainable and this compensation is not needed at all.” Abhishek Jain, tax partner at consultancy firm EY India said, “With expectations of lower cess collections in the next couple of months with already muted collections in the first quarter, the government possibly will need to explore avenues for funding the shortfall -- through increased tenure of compensation cess levy or rate increase in later years, etc.” According to government data, the GST collection in first three months of current financial year saw a decline of about 41% at Rs 1,85,220 crore compared to Rs 3,14,095 crore in the same period last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-88l-cr-needed-to-recoup-states-shortfall/story-biPq8yht5qf8BIfsrpRu7M.html
30-07-2020||India||Country records 11% monsoon rain deficiency; northwest 30% in July||Delhi and neighbouring Faridabad on Wednesday received light to heavy rain, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said and added weather stations in the national capital at Safdarjung, Lodhi Road, and the Ridge recorded 9.3 mm, 13 mm and 33.2 mm rainfall. Between 15.4 to 64.5 mm is categorised as moderate.There was a 26% rain deficiency in Delhi from June 1 until Wednesday morning. It was expected to fall by Wednesday evening. Extremely heavy rain (over 20 cm) was also recorded in parts of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday.Regional Weather Forecasting Centre head Kuldeep Shrivastava said the monsoon trough is passing very close to Delhi and bringing rain to the city. “The monsoon trough is passing along Ferozepur [Punjab], Hisar, Gurgaon, [Haryana] Daltonganj, Dumka [Jharkhand] and parts of Nagaland.” Shrivastava said moisture incursion from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal was likely to bring rain again on Wednesday night and on Thursday.The western end of the trough has shifted southwards and is near to its normal position from Ganganagar (Rajasthan) to the Bay of Bengal, IMD said.IMD said widespread and heavy to very heavy rain is likely in Uttarakhand, Jammu, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Rajasthan, sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala on Wednesday and Thursday. Extremely heavy rain (over 20 cm) was likely over places like Kerala.There has been just 1% excess rain since the beginning of the monsoon on June 1 across the country. Eastern and northeastern India have received 12% excess rainfall. There has been a 20% deficiency in rainfall in northwest India, 2% in central India, and 12% excess over the south peninsula. There is an 11% rain deficiency across the country in July with 30% over northwest India; 7.5% excess over east and northeast India; 20% deficiency over central India and 14.6% excess over the south peninsula.A good monsoon, which accounts for 70% of India’s annual rainfall, is critical to the fortunes of the agricultural sector on which at least 700 million people are dependent for a livelihood. The monsoon is crucial for the yield of rice, wheat, sugarcane, and oilseeds in a country where farming accounts for about 15% of the economy but employs over half of its people.“The formation of a cyclonic circulation around the South Bay of Bengal is a sign of weak monsoon. This is possibly the first time in several years…a historical record that there was no low-pressure system forming over the Bay of Bengal in all of July and so rains have been deficient in the core monsoon zone. At least 12 to 15 low-pressure systems form over the Bay of Bengal every monsoon most in July and August. This July rain deficiency is 11%,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, National Weather Forecasting Centre.Low-pressure systems are the main rain-producing systems during monsoon. Their formation depends on dynamics like the interaction of south-westerly and easterly winds, added Jenamani.IMD has also issued a moderate to severe thunderstorm and lightning warning for Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Yanam, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Karaikal, and Rayalaseema on Thursday.“I remember 2002 was a very bad year when hardly any low-pressure systems formed. Low-pressure systems over the Bay of Bengal are rain-bearing systems. When they move into the land, they bring a lot of rain so they are critical during monsoon. Along with global features, two local features are critical for the development of low-pressure systems--wind shear (change in wind speed and direction) and moisture,” said SK Dash, professor, Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/country-records-11-monsoon-rain-deficiency-northwest-30/story-11pdbKcaXSTJKynQwqN2HI.html
30-07-2020||India||New policy sets sights on total overhaul of education system||The New Education Policy (NEP) attempts to significantly overhaul several aspects of the Indian education system rooted in the previous policy of 1986 and in other areas, attempts to bring a more contemporary approach.For instance, the norms under the previous policy did not allow foreign varsities to set up campuses, while the 2020 policy does..The regulation system will be overhauled with one Higher Education Council of India in place of several regulatory bodies like the University Grants Commission (UGC) and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).The present policy has also mooted a gender-inclusion fund as an equity measure. The policy states that the Government of India will constitute a ‘Gender-Inclusion Fund’ to build the nation’s capacity to provide equitable quality education for all girls as well as transgender students.Also read: Over 2 crore children will be brought back to schools: Amit KhareFor schools, the purpose is to make learning less stressful and more learning-oriented, the policy states. For instance, all students will participate in a 10-day bagless period during classes 6-8, during which they will intern with local vocational experts, such as carpenters, gardeners, potters, artists,etc.New subjects like coding will be introduced at an earlier level, from class 6, to modernize the syllabi, as per the policy. Barriers like science, humanities and commerce, etc, have fallen and students will be given increased flexibility and choice of subjects to study, particularly in secondary school — physical education, arts and crafts, and vocational skills — so that they can design their own paths of study and life plans.Similarly, degrees have also become more flexible. The NEP also lays emphasis on online education, especially to counter situations like the present pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-policy-sets-sights-on-total-overhaul-of-education-system/story-WctmVsiqCmLy9DQpmAUAmO.html
30-07-2020||India||Emphasis on Indian culture reflects RSS sway on New Education Policy||The renaming of human resource development (HRD) ministry as education ministry, and the emphasis on Indian arts, languages, and culture reflect the Rashtriya Syawamsevak Sangh (RSS)’s influence on the New Education Policy (NEP).The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved NEP, which also seeks to increase public spending on education to nearly 6% of GDP from around 4%, cap fees, expand access to higher education and achieve universal adult literacy before 2035.An RSS functionary said the Sangh approves of the language NEP uses to describe its vision. It speaks of curriculum and pedagogy developing a “deep sense of respect towards the fundamental duties and Constitutional values, bonding with one’s country, and conscious awareness of one’s roles and responsibilities in a changing world”, the functionary added. “The policy refers to the need to instil a deep-rooted pride in being Indian, not only in thought, but also in spirit, intellect, and deeds, which is what we have been stressing on.”The RSS, which is the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s ideological fount, has been pushing for a review of the education policy to Indianize it further . It has also sought rewriting of History textbooks from what it calls an Indian perspective.RSS affiliates such as the Bharatiya Shikshan Mandal (BSM) and the Shiksha Sanskriti Utthan Nyas (SSUN) that are involved in areas such as education and culture submitted a slew of recommendations to the Narendra Modi government months soon it was voted to power at the Centre in 2014. RSS offshoots have long sought the renaming of the HRD ministry. The issue resurfaced at a BSM conference in 2018, where Modi and then HRD minister Prakash Javadekar were among those in attendance.SSUN secretary Atul Kothari said NEP fits well with the recommendations made by his organisation . “Within days of the coronavirus pandemic, we wrote to the PM [Modi] and the HRD minister to ensure the new policy should also give attention to online methods of teaching. We are happy that it has been included in NEP.”Another BSM functionary said the HRD ministry was known as the education ministry till 1985. “World over too education ministries are not known as resource development ministries.”RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat in August last year hoped NEP would make individuals self-respecting, self-sufficient and independent, and rooted in the country’s ethos and culture. He lamented the delay in finalising NEP in 2018 during a three-day lecture series in New Delhi. Bhagwat stressed the need for value-based education and expressed concern over the falling standards of pedagogy and research.NEP’s vision for an education system “rooted in Indian ethos” dovetails with RSS’s demand for an India-centric policy. RSS has sought education to be imparted in the mother tongue and based on a system that borrows from the ancient texts and cultural practices.RSS has long advocated teaching in the mother tongue, and implementation of the three-language formula to promote multilingualism. NEP addresses this too.NEP has emphasised the popularisation of Indian languages. “Sanskrit will be mainstreamed with strong offerings in school -- including as one of the language options in the three-language formula -- as well as in higher education. Sanskrit Universities too will move towards becoming large multidisciplinary institutions of higher learning.”BSM has also welcomed the move to establish a National Research Foundation as part of NEP.The creation of Prime-Minister-led Rashtriya Shiksha Aayog has also been on BSM’s wish list. BSM has urged the government to ensure academics and not bureaucrats are in charge of key positions in the education sector. It has called for encouraging teachers to become administrators and vice-chancellors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/emphasis-on-indian-culture-reflects-rss-sway-on-policy/story-f6767eyxWjikYNdJEgD1uK.html
30-07-2020||India||Over 2 crore children will be brought back to schools: Amit Khare||The New Education Policy will boost equity and access and provide education to millions of people, higher education secretary Amit Khare told Amandeep Shukla in an interview. Edited excerpts:What impact will the NEP have in the short and long run?The NEP will have major impact on access, equity and quality, all three of them. One, the universalisation of school education will be up to Class 12. More than two crore children will be brought to back to school. In higher education, access will be improved. The GER [gross enrolment ratio] will be raised from 26% to 50% which would mean another 3.5 crore seats. Multidisciplinary colleges including vacation and general education will improve the quality of learning. Similarly, research will be improved by the formation of the National Research Foundation (NRF). For improving equity, there will be gender inclusion fund. For SC [scheduled caste], ST [scheduled tribe] and other disadvantaged sections, the policy has recommended provisions. For backward regions, the policy advocates Special Education Zones. Thanks is due to Dr K Kasturirangan and his team for drafting it.Also read | New Education Policy 2020 Highlights: Key takeaways of NEP to make India a ‘global knowledge superpower’The NEP moots a single regulator. What will happen to existing regulators UGC and AICTE?Their functions will be redefined and they will be merged into the single regulator. A bill will be moved in the parliament for the formation of the HECI [Higher Education Commission of India]. There will be a repeal and saving clause in the bill. That bill is under process. Consultations are required, so may be in winter session it will be there.The NEP also allows foreign universities to come to India. Can you elaborate?Only the top 100 (foreign varsities). Indian universities’ quality will be improved so that they attract foreign students. Indian universities that are in the Top 100 will be allowed to set up campuses abroad. And since, we are allowing our universities to go abroad, we are also allowing top 100 world universities into India. Right now deemed universities, there are restrictions on having campuses, so regulatory provisions will be changed for Indian institutions to have campuses abroad. The policy says IITs will be encouraged to teach non-science subjects to turn multidisciplinary. Will it not dilute their core strengths?It actually improves. The quality of research improves when it is multidisciplinary. For instance, Covid has a medical side, a scientific side and also a social side about behavioural change. So if an institutions is looking at all (aspects), it will be more effective than only doctors doing the treatment or only sociologists looking at behavioural change. That ways multidisciplinary institutions will be better.What is the status of National Research Foundation?It is at an advanced stage. It will have 10 wings. Social science also has been included as a wing. A note has been circulated by the Principal Scientific Advisor. The initial draft had suggested that breakfast also be provided in schools?It has been included. It was felt cooking may not be easy early in the morning. So nutritious supplements like chana [gram] may be given.Foreign universities have been allowed, but will there be systems to ensure there is no commercialization?Any university coming here, policy clearly says commercialization will be curbed. If there is any surplus it will have to be invested in education sector. Funds cannot be taken out of education. Somebody makes money and then starts making telephones or opens transport business, that is not allowed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-2-crore-children-will-be-brought-back-to-schools-amit-khare/story-TIoirwpa3daPpldgz4CfwN.html
30-07-2020||India||Gehlot’s brother skips ED hearing on health grounds||New Delhi: Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s brother, Agrasain Gehlot, did not appear for questioning before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday citing health issues, people familiar with the matter said. Agrasain Gehlot has now been issued a fresh summons for August 4 while his son, Anupam Gehlot, was questioned on Wednesday, they added.The agency on Tuesday summoned Agrasain Gehlot to appear before it in Delhi on Wednesday in connection with its probe into alleged money laundering in the export of fertilizers.ED’s investigation against him in the case is based on a customs department and the directorate of revenue and intelligence probe in 2009 into the export of Muriate of Potash (MOP), a restricted commodity for export under the foreign trade policy. Agrasain Gehlot’s company is suspected to have diverted about 35,000 metric tonnes of MOP valued at Rs 130 crore in the international market.ED on July 22 conducted raids at his premises apart from several companies and individuals in Rajasthan, Delhi, and West Bengal.The Congress has linked ED’s actions to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s alleged attempts to topple the Ashok Gehlot government, which is facing a revolt from former deputy chief minister and 18 lawmakers loyal to him. The BJP has rejected the Congress’s allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gehlot-s-brother-skips-ed-hearing-on-health-grounds/story-VXAk3WEaplaYoyCDR2q9jK.html
30-07-2020||India||Rajasthan political crisis: Why Congress avoided mention of floor test in its proposals||The ruling Congress has repeatedly avoided the mention of a floor test in its proposals to Rajasthan governor Kalraj Mishra for an assembly session, fearing it could be used to bring down its government and for the imposition of President’s rule in the state, people familiar with the matter said. It has publicly sought a floor test to prove its majority but has not mentioned that in its recommendations to Mishra.“Our apprehension is that the moment we ask for a floor test, the governor will say the government is not confident of its majority and hence might recommend President’s rule,” said a Congress functionary on condition of anonymity. “There are some points in the governor’s letters to the Rajasthan government that force us to think on those lines.” He added even the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has demanded a floor test.Constitutional expert PDT Achary said in normal circumstances, there is not a possibility of the governor recommending President’s rule on the basis of the government seeking a floor test. “There is no need to mention the floor test in their proposals. In rules, there is no provision for confidence motion but only for a no-confidence motion. Confidence motion can be any motion and brought any time in the House by the government.”Achary, a former Lok Sabha secretary-general, said a session is mainly called by the government to transact business and it is under no obligation to inform the governor about its agenda. “His role is over once the session is summoned. The Speaker then takes over and has to control the House and conduct the proceedings.”Another Congress leader, who is involved in the crisis management, said there is another view that the state government should move court and get a direction for the governor. “But many of us are against any such move. These are not normal times. We are living in abnormal times and do not expect favourable verdicts from the courts. So, approaching the court will be futile,” he said. “So, it was finally decided to accept the governor’s condition of giving a 21-day notice for convening the assembly.”The Congress had decided to fight the Rajasthan battle politically and take to the streets. “Thrice, we wrote to the governor and urged him to call the assembly session. Obviously, he is under some kind of pressure from the central government to delay the summoning of the House. But one thing has happened and that is the Rajasthan governor and the BJP stand exposed before the public,” said the second functionary.The Congress has so far claimed that 109 legislators in the 200-member assembly support the Ashok Gehlot government. “...we are very confident and will easily cross the majority mark with at least a margin of 15-20 legislators in the final count,” said Congress leader Ajay Maken.Maken and Randeep Singh Surjewala were deputed to Jaipur this month to deal with the political crisis after former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and 18 other legislators rebelled against chief minister Ashok Gehlot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-cong-avoided-mention-of-floor-test-in-its-proposals/story-nEUJPDEVleCfM83svHvyyL.html

Joshi submitted that the high court order is in violation of legal principles laid down by the 1992 Supreme Court judgment in Kihoto Hollohan v. Zachillhu as per which courts cannot interfere with the speaker’s powers to decide a disqualification petition till he gives a final decision on such a disqualification plea.“The order (of July 24) restraining the speaker from performing his constitutional duties under the 10th schedule (for disqualification of MLAs) is a direct intrusion by the high court into the domain exclusively reserved for the Speaker”, the petition filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes said. The high court, by attempting to reopen the law laid down in Kihoto Hollohan committed “gross judicial indiscipline”, the plea added. On July 24, the Rajasthan high court issued a detailed order staying action by the speaker against the rebel Congress legislators while admitting the writ petition filed the Pilot camp against the disqualification notices. Pilot, the former deputy chief minister, is leading a rebellion in the ruling party after differences between him and the chief minister widened into a full-blown confrontation that threatens to knock the party out of power. The high court said that it will examine the constitutional validity of para 2(1)(a) of the 10th schedule of the constitution. The 10th schedule contains provisions relating to disqualification of lawmakers for defection. Para 2(1)(a) lays down that voluntarily giving up membership of the political party on whose ticket the lawmaker was elected, will be a ground for disqualification from the house. The Pilot camp had challenged the validity of para 2(1)(a) arguing that merely voicing opinion against party leadership does not amount to “voluntarily giving up membership” and para 2(1)(a), to the extent it prohibits expression of opinion, violates freedom of speech under Article 19 of the Constitution.“The constitutional validity of 10th schedule including para 2(1)(a) had been specifically challenged before the Supreme Court in Kihoto and the contention was negatived. In these circumstances, the high court could not have acted as appellate court over the correctness of the decision in Kihoto,” the speaker submitted. The Supreme Court should ensure that the authorities under the constitution, including the judiciary, exercise its jurisdiction within their boundaries and function within their respective ‘Lakshman Rekhas’, Joshi contended. This would be the second instance of Joshi knocking the doors of the Supreme Court. He had earlier filed an appeal before the Supreme Court on July 22 seeking a stay on a July 21 order of the high court which had asked him to defer action on disqualification notices till July 24. He also sought a stay on the high court proceedings in that plea. But the Supreme Court on July 23 declined the request paving way for the high court to pass its order on July 24 rendering Joshi’s petition before the apex court infructuous (ineffective). He had, subsequently, withdrawn that petition on July 27.Joshi submitted on Wednesday that the July 24 order of high court is violative of Article 212 of the Constitution as per which courts cannot inquire into the proceedings of the legislature.The notice issued by him to the Pilot camp on July 14 is purely procedural and in the realm of legislative proceedings under Article 212 and courts cannot review or examine the same, he contended. “The proceedings before the speaker till the final decision are in the nature of proceedings in the House and are not subject to judicial review… only the final decision of the speaker is amenable to judicial review and that too on limited grounds,” the petition said. The order of the High Court is a direct interference in the ‘proceedings of the House’ which is prohibited under Article 212 of the Constitution, the plea added.Pilot and other MLAs had approached the high court on July 15 challenging the speaker’s notice which had asked the 19 MLAs to furnish an explanation by July 17 on why they should not be disqualified from the assembly for their conduct which the Congress party alleged was detrimental to the interest of the party and showed their intention to quit the party. The speaker’s notice was based on the disqualification petition filed by Chief Whip of Congress party, Mahesh Joshi. Joshi in his plea had cited the absence of the MLAs from two Congress Legislature Party meetings, held on July 13 and 14, despite specific instructions to attend the same as the main reason which showed the intention of the MLAs to leave the Congress party.Pilot and other dissident MLAs have maintained that they never had the intention to leave the Congress party and were merely exercising their right to criticize party leadership and the functioning of the chief minister. In a democratic setup, voicing disagreement with the policies or decisions taken by the party does not amount to acting against the interests of the party so as to lead to disqualification, they had said in their petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/speaker-moves-sc-against-hc-order-on-19-cong-mlas/story-TgqzOSOdZ0jO1RCVJoTTpN.html
30-07-2020||India||New Education policy lays emphasis on learning in mother tongue||The New Education Policy approved by the Centre on Wednesday puts a focus on students’ mother tongue as the medium of instruction even as it sticks to the ‘three language formula’ while emphasizing that no language would be imposed on anyone.The policy document states that since children learn and grasp non-trivial concepts more quickly in their home language, which is often the mother tongue, it should preferably be the medium of instruction.“Wherever possible, the medium of instruction until at least Grade 5, but preferably till Grade 8 and beyond, will be the home language, mother tongue, local language or the regional language. Thereafter, the home or local language shall continue to be taught as a language wherever possible. This will be followed by both public and private schools,” the policy states.This, however, led to a question on the existence of thousands of English-medium schools that across the country. Many of these impart high-quality education and are leading institutions in their particular regions. When contacted, a senior HRD ministry official said the policy does not aim to impose any language at anyone.“Even with regard to instruction in mother tongue, the policy document emphasizes - wherever possible. There is no question of imposing anything. Moreover, it is for the state governments to take decisions in this regard according to requirements of the students,” the official said, asking not to be named.Language is a sensitive area as far as the education policy is concerned. Previously, the draft policy submitted by the panel headed by former ISRO chief K Kasturirangan to the HRD ministry suggested a bigger focus on Hindi as a teaching medium, a suggestion that triggered a controversy with criticism pouring in from southern states. Also read | Over 2 crore children will be brought back to schools: Amit KhareThere were apprehensions, especially in non-Hindi speaking states that the three language formula propagated in the policy would lead to Hindi being forced upon non-speakers. The HRD ministry had then doused the anger emphasizing that no language would be thrust upon anyone. The policy recommends high-quality textbooks, including in science, to be made available in home languages and mother tongue. Teachers will be encouraged to use a bilingual approach, including bilingual teaching-learning materials, with those students whose home language may be different from the mother tongue.According to the policy, states, especially states from different regions of India, may enter into bilateral agreements to hire teachers in large numbers from each other, to satisfy the three-language formula in their respective states, and also to encourage the study of Indian languages across the country.“The three-language formula will continue to be implemented while keeping in mind the Constitutional provisions, aspirations of the people, regions, and the Union, and the need to promote multilingualism as well as promote national unity.However, there will be a greater flexibility in the three-language formula, and no language will be imposed on any State. The three languages learned by children will be the choices of States, regions, and of course the students themselves, so long as at least two of the three languages are native to India,” the policy states.The policy document also lays emphasis on Sanskrit, which it calls an important modern language mentioned in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India. Sanskrit will thus be offered at all levels of school and higher education as an important enriching option for students, including as an option in the three-language formula, it added. The new education roadmap also provides for teaching other classical including classical Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia. In addition to these classical languages Pali, Persian, and Prakrit; and their works of literature too must be preserved for their richness and for the pleasure and enrichment of posterity, the document states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/education-policy-lays-emphasis-on-learning-in-mother-tongue/story-7yRtLx7AmFJrqyd1MbrB5K.html
30-07-2020||India||Governor okays CM proposal for House session from Aug 14||Rajasthan governor Kalraj Mishra on Wednesday allowed the state assembly’s session to run from August 14, approving a proposal by the government for summoning the proceedings after returning three previous recommendations to convene it from July 31 amid an impasse triggered by the rebellion of Congress leader and chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s dismissed deputy, Sachin Pilot.The Ashok Gehlot-led Cabinet on Wednesday sent another proposal to the governor for summoning the Rajasthan assembly, saying a session should be called on August 14. According to people aware of the developments, the government was of the view that the fresh plan met the 21-day notice requirement called for by the governor. The Cabinet is counting 21 days from July 23, when its first proposal was sent, they said.While rejecting the government’s proposals earlier, Mishra said a session can be called at short notice if the agenda is to seek a vote of confidence. He said if the government was not stating the reason for holding a short-notice session, it could call a regular session at 21 days’ notice.Also Read: Rajasthan Speaker moves SC on high court hearing Sachin Pilot camp’s plea, says it is judicial indiscipline“Governor Kalraj Mishra has approved the assembly session. The proposal sent by the Cabinet to begin the proceedings by August 14 has been accepted. The governor has given verbal directives on necessary arrangements to be made for prevention of Covid-19,” a statement released by the governor’s office said.The Rajasthan Cabinet on Tuesday said the governor did not have any locus standi in stipulating conditions to hold the session and asked him to abide by the proposal of the Cabinet. It said the agenda of the session will be determined by the business advisory committee of the House, and added that it was the assembly speaker’s domain to decide on social distancing norms in the assembly amid the pandemic.The governor had suggested a 21-day notice period to convene the House; sought clarity on the agenda of the session and advised live-streaming of the floor test, if such a test was to be held; and asked about Covid-19 related precautions in the assembly.While the Congress has accused that the current crisis is the result of moves by the Bharatiya Janata Party, the BJP said it was purely a result of the internal clash within Rajasthan’s ruling party. The Rajasthan political turmoil has seen an open tussle between Gehlot and his now-dismissed deputy CM Pilot and a set of rebel Congress legislators, who allege that Gehlot’s government is in a minority. Over the past few days, Gehlot has sought a quick assembly session based on the assessment that he has the numbers in the House, according to Congress strategists.Pilot has the support of 18 dissident Congress MLAs. Altogether, the Congress has 107 MLAs in the 200-member assembly and the BJP 72.Commenting on the governor’s approval to the assembly session, Congress leader Mahesh Joshi said: “We will run the House successfully. The decision taken in House will bring more relief to the people of the state.”Earlier on Wednesday, Mishra returned the government’s third proposal, saying the Cabinet refused to state the reason why it wanted a session at short notice. He asked the Gehlot Cabinet to resubmit its proposal, giving a reason for calling a session at short notice.As the impasse over calling a session deepened, chief minister Ashok Gehlot held a 15-minute meeting with Mishra at the Raj Bhawan. “The love letter has already come. Now, I am only going to have tea with him,” Gehlot told party workers at the state Congress office before heading for the Raj Bhawan. Hours later, the state Cabinet met to redraft the proposal, setting the new date.Although the Congress has said it wants to prove its majority in the House, it has not mentioned this in its proposal. The governor previously referred to the Covid-19 pandemic and asked the government to make it clear why it wanted the session summoned at short notice under such circumstances.The Congress has alleged that Mishra is acting “under pressure” from the BJP government at the Centre.BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said on Tuesday the post of the governor was constitutional and his party did not interfere in the work of the constitutional bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/guv-okays-cm-proposal-for-house-session-from-aug-14/story-fiMT7zLp0pm0XrEh1BbhnN.html
30-07-2020||India||US, Australia see key role for India in Indo-Pacific security||New Delhi India will have a key role in defence cooperation and post-Covid-19 recovery efforts in the Indo-Pacific by the US and Australia, which plan to strengthen partnerships in the region to ensure it remains secure, inclusive and rules-based.The matter figured in a meeting between US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and defence secretary Mark Esper and their Australian counterparts Marise Payne and Linda Reynolds in Washington on Tuesday, with a joint statement issued by the two sides making several references to India’s role in the Indo-Pacific.The US and Australia also expressed serious concerns about China’s “recent coercive and destabilising actions across the Indo-Pacific”, and the two countries said the Covid-19 pandemic has “created incentives for some actors to pursue strategic gains in ways that undermine the rules-based international order and regional stability”. The development comes at a time when India is set to include Australia in the Malabar naval exercise that it conducts with the US and Japan, and against the backdrop of the months-old border stand-off with China.The US-Australia joint statement said the Indo-Pacific remains the focus of their alliance and that two countries are “working side-by-side, including with Asean, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Five Eyes partners, to strengthen our networked structure of alliances and partnerships to maintain a region that is secure, prosperous, inclusive, and rules-based”.On the issue of regional coordination, the two countries said they are committed to “trilateral dialogues with Japan and Quad consultations with Japan and India”, and were looking forward to further ministerial meetings of these forums. The Quadrilateral security dialogue or Quad, which includes India, Australia, Japan and the US, was upgraded to the ministerial level last September. China has often expressed its opposition to the group, though India has said it is not aimed at any country.The US and Australia also referred to bilateral defence cooperation such as the joint naval activity by their warships in the South China Sea, and said they are committed to “pursue increased and regularised maritime cooperation in the region, as well as the Indian Ocean, bilaterally and in concert with other likeminded and regional partners”. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, described India as the “most natural partner” for security-related initiatives by the US and Australia both in the Indian Ocean and the wider Indo-Pacific region. “Though China is its biggest trade partner, Australia has growing concerns about what it perceives as China’s interference in domestic politics and issues such as cyber security. Australia also has concerns about China’s growing influence in the South Pacific, which it sees as its strategic backyard and which has been the focus of attention from Prime Minister Scott Morrison,” he said. “These concerns and similar worries for the US are areas of convergence with India. Australia certainly feels that if the Quad can get its act together, the four countries can counter the rising Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific,” Patil added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-australia-see-key-role-for-india-in-indo-pacific-security/story-bUl4VrSA50Iq2l0Ig99FbI.html
30-07-2020||India||78% Covid-19 patients develop heart condition, study finds||It is not just the lungs that get severely affected in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients but also the heart, according to a new study that found that as many of 78% of Covid-19 patients monitored developing a heart condition, independent of pre-existing conditions. To be sure, the study was based on a small sample and needs further (and more extensive) research and validation, but it adds to the number of body organs affected by the virus. The study also found that 60% of those infected with Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, had an ongoing myocardial inflammation (swelling of heart muscles); it has been published in the journal ‘JAMA Cardiology’ on Monday.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe study, Outcomes of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patients Recently Recovered From Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), looked at the cardiovascular effects in patients who suffered from Covid-19.Data from about 100 recovered patients from the University Hospital, Frankfurt’s Covid-19 registry between April and June 2020 was analysed for the study.“…cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed cardiac involvement in 78 patients (78%) and ongoing myocardial inflammation in 60 patients (60%), which was independent of preexisting conditions, severity and overall course of the acute illness, and the time from the original diagnosis,” the study added. .The researchers emphasise upon the need for studying in detail long-term cardiovascular consequences of Covid-19.Experts in India have also been asking for examination of clinical data to know the long-term health impact among Covid-19 patients post recovery as there have been observations made by clinicians on recently recovered patients experiencing long-term effects.“It is a huge percentage, and looks like induced by virus or its after-effects such as inflammation. There is a need for large studies to reach a conclusion but that would require funding and access to data,” says Dr Giridhara Babu, head, Life Course epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health, Public Health Foundation of India.Clinicians here have observed that Covid-19 leads to other long-term health complications involving kidneys, liver, even eyes in patients after discharge from hospital.The joint monitoring group under the Union health ministry’s technical wing- Directorate General of Health Services, is independently reviewing clinical data available so far to draft guidelines for managing post-recovery health complications.“Our experts are working on putting a document together to guide people on what kind of long-term care would be required,” said Rajesh Bhushan, officer on special duty, health ministry. The group is chaired by Dr Rajiv Garg, director general health services, along with specialist doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, and representatives of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and World Health Organisation (WHO) office in India .The data is being collected from several hospitals across the country that are treating Covid-19 patients. The hospitals include three from Delhi: The central government-run Safdarjung Hospital, Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, and Lady Hardinge Hospital. Apart from these, clinical data is also being sought from six other All India Institute of Medical Sciences that treat Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/78-covid-patients-develop-heart-condition-study-finds/story-rwHw5I1ayqQwG8V4FyO3wM.html

As of Wednesday night, 1,019,297 people out of the total 1,582,730 infected (64.4%) across India had recovered from the disease while 33,236 had died. There are 528,459 active cases (33.4% of total cases) in the country as of Wednesday.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe gap between recovered patients and the number of active cases has been a key statistic that offers hope in the country’s long-drawn battle against Sars-Cov-2. This gap, however, wasn’t always there. On May 28, the number of active cases in the country outnumbered the recovered patients by at least 23,000. However, the recoveries closed this gap by June 13, and as of Wednesday, there are 490,838 more patients who have recovered than those who are infected.The journey to a million recoveries took 150 days since March 2, but each quarter of that million has come at a faster pace. While the first 250,000 recoveries came in 114 days, the next quarter of a million recoveries took only 17 days. India crossed 750,000 recoveries 11 days later on July 12, while the latest quarter million recoveries have taken just eight days.Also read: Six months after first coronavirus case, India enters Unlock 3 mode.

30-07-2020||India||Time to heal Kashmir’s wound, look to future within India: Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Wednesday granted conditional bail to Jammu & Kashmir High Court Bar Association president Mian Abdul Qayoom, 73, saying the region has gone through troubled times and it was time for healing the wounds of Kashmiris and to look forward to a future within India. It said Qayoom’s release on bail on Thursday on the condition that he will not travel to Jammu & Kashmir till August 7 and refrain from making any public statements will enable him to celebrate Eid on Saturday.A justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul-led three-judge bench, which hoped the government will make efforts to restore normalcy in Kashmir, ordered Qayoom’s release after the Centre agreed to it taking into account his age and deteriorating health. “Kashmir has been a troubled area. Nature has been very kind to the place. It is the human race that has been unkind. It is time for all wounds to be healed and look to the future within the domain of our country,” the bench said.Qayoom was among hundreds of people, including three former chief ministers, detained in August last year as part of measures to prevent protests against the Centre’s move to divest Jammu & Kashmir of its special status. A communications blackout and a lockdown were imposed and most of the restrictions have since been eased even as the mobile internet remains restricted. Two former chief ministers Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah were released in March while Mehbooba Mufti remains under detention.The court said it is sure Qayoom will also adopt a more constructive approach to the future and the government will consider how to bring complete normalcy at the earliest.Senior counsel Dushyant Dave, who appeared for Qayoom, on Monday asked the top court and the government to show leniency considering his client’s advanced age and troubled health and release him immediately.The Centre then informed the court that Qayoom’s detention will expire on August 7 and he will not be detained further.During the hearing of the case on Wednesday, the judges and the lawyers involved in the matter also spoke about the situation in Kashmir including its tourism potential. “I must say that Kashmir is much more beautiful than Switzerland. Switzerland is pedicured and manicured, Kashmir is natural,” Dushyant Dave said.“I completely agree,” said solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for Jammu & Kashmir. “There is huge potential for tourism in this country which is untapped,” added justice Kaul.Qayoom, who has been lodged in Delhi’s Tihar prison since January, was detained under the Public Safety Act that allows detention without trial for up to two years. He was earlier imprisoned in Agra.The Jammu & Kashmir high court in May rejected Qayoom’s plea against his detention, citing his ideology which the government termed “separatist”. It said the ideology was like a live volcano and remained unaffected by the passage of time.Qayoom submitted his detention was based on four First Information Reports registered against him between 2008 and 2010 and were, therefore, stale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/time-to-heal-kashmir-s-wound-look-to-future-within-india-sc/story-1VKcVNJoG6hC6aqdR3wtfJ.html

Another TMC member skipped a key meeting of a separate panel last week even as many Opposition members wanted her to attend it.TMC’s Rajya Sabha floor leader, Derek O’Brien, said they were not attending the meetings as it is an issue of principle. “When they can hold several other meetings online, why cannot they hold House panel meetings digitally too?” he asked.“Many meetings are not having quorum, yet the authorities are not allowing online meetings in this pandemic. Why is the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] afraid of allowing Opposition to scrutinise bills and issues...?”Several Opposition leaders have been asking Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla to allow online meetings of parliamentary panels. But House officials maintain such meetings were not immediately possible online as they involve a change of rules and secrecy issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-leaders-absent-after-plea-for-online-meetings-ignored/story-nk01VJQGOb1eXDAfTOD4fO.html

30-07-2020||India||Unlock 3: Yoga centres, gyms to reopen, no night curfew||The Centre on Wednesday issued guidelines for the third phase of lifting curbs imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), announcing that gyms and yoga centres can reopen from August 5, while also removing a night curfew that restricted movement of people outside containment zones. The Union home ministry issued the plan, “Unlock 3”, prepared after receiving feedback from states and in consultation held with central ministries and departments, to open up more activities outside containment zones, an official statement said.The new guidelines, which will come into effect from August 1, said that a strict lockdown will continue in containment zones – areas that report clusters of the disease – till August 31 and asked authorities to maintain strict perimeter control in such zones. The latest guidelines said that schools, colleges, theatres, swimming pools, metro rail, cinema halls and bars will continue to remain closed. Social, political, religious, sports and entertainment functions and other large congregations will also not be allowed.“Dates for opening of these will be decided separately, based on the assessment of the situation,” the home ministry said.Also read | Six months after first coronavirus case, India enters Unlock 3 mode. Explained in 10 pointsThe decision to keep schools, colleges and coaching institutions closed till August 31 was taken after consultations with states and Union Territories, the statement said. The guidelines added that online/distance learning shall continue to be permitted and shall be encouraged. Independence Day functions will be allowed in all states, districts and municipalities with social distancing norms and health care protocols such as wearing of masks. Separate detailed guidelines were issued regarding this on July 21, stating that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will unfurl the Indian flag at the Red Fort and deliver the annual speech.The fresh guidelines said that international flights, which are currently permitted under the Vande Bharat mission, will further open up in a calibrated manner at a later stage.The phased reopening of activities – termed as “Unlock” – has already led to the resumption of several commercial activities, including restricted domestic aviation and train operations apart from restaurants, hotels, saloons and malls in the past two months. However, the government has been wary of other activities that are likely to result in mass gatherings, including Metro rail operations, entertainment parks and cinema halls.After 68 days under a lockdown to halt the spread of Covid-19, the country began opening up widely in May, but with significant restrictions. On Wednesday, India reported 52, 406 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the tally of infections to 1,582,730. There have been 34, 974deaths from the infectious disease so far.The latest guidelines said that states could decide on further restricting activities outside containment zones. “States and UTs, based on their assessment of the situation, may prohibit certain activities outside the Containment zones, or impose such restrictions as deemed necessary. However, there shall be no restriction on inter-State and intra-State movement of persons and goods. No separate permission/ approval/ e-permit will be required for such movements,” the guidelines said.Like the previous guidelines for Unlock 1 and Unlock 2, the latest guidelines also advised those vulnerable (persons above 65 years of age, persons with co-morbidities, pregnant women, and children below the age of 10 years) to stay at home, except for meeting essential requirements and for health care purposes.The guidelines also said that the use of the Aarogya Setu mobile app should be encouraged. According to a senior official who spoke on condition of anonymity, Niti Aayog’s Dr VK Paul, who plays an important part in shaping the Centre’s Covid-19 strategy, and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) were separately consulted on what areas or activities were to be opened. “Both of them were very clear that Metro, schools and other places of mass gatherings can’t be opened at this crucial hour,” said the official involved in planning the guidelines. The Union health ministry’s officials were skeptical about allowing activities with big crowds. According to another official, reopening of cinema halls was actively considered but it was struck down as the government maintained that a maximum 25% of the capacity can be filled up in a theatre — an offer that looked commercially unviable for many cinema hall owners.During the interactions between state officials and the Cabinet secretary, many states opposed opening schools at this juncture. The school education department, which spoke to parents’ bodies, reverted to the home ministry that many parents want schools to open only after a Covid-19 vaccine is out in the market.The opening of gyms, according to the two officials, saw long discussions, as health ministry officials considered them places that will have a lot of aerosol due to intense physical activities. While the Centre finally allowed gyms to reopen from August 5, the health ministry will come up with stringent social distancing norms and hygiene rules, the officials added.

Barauni is the ancestral town of fighter pilot Wing Commander Abhishek Tripathi who was among the air crew flying the French fighter jets to India. The crew was headed by Group Captain Harkirat Singh, a decorated fighter pilot and commanding officer of the No. 17 Squadron.Also Read: Moments after Rafale fighter jets land, Rajnath Singh’s veiled warning to ChinaCelebrations at Wing Commander Abhishek’s village began soon after the pictures of the air crew entering Indian airspace went viral. “Wing commander Abhishek was among the few chosen ones, who were assigned the task to fly the Rafale to India. Indeed it’s a matter of pride and a moment to celebrate for our district. We are proud of him,” said Anurag Tripathi, Abhishek’s cousin who distributed sweets. “Abhishek was born and brought up in Jaipur but was always in touch with his friends and relatives at his ancestral town. We always used to catch up at the family functions and get-togethers. It is no less than a Diwali for us,” he said.

30-07-2020||Editorials||Unlock 3.0 rules get the right mix | HT Editorial||On government has announced guidelines for Unlock 3.0 for August, the third phase in reopening the country after the 68-day lockdown through March to June. The guidelines permit the opening up of yoga institutions and gymnasiums, and remove the somewhat arbitrary night-time curfew currently in place. But it, sensibly so, continues a set of restrictions. Schools, colleges, cinema theatres, swimming pools will remain closed; social, cultural, religious events continue to be prohibited; metro travel hasn’t been resumed; and international flights will remain limited.While lockdowns have to be used to improve health infrastructure, they cannot serve as a solution for the pandemic. Stretched beyond a point, it has real costs, especially for the poor. Economic activity has to resume, and the government has opened up the country to a large degree. But activities which expose children to closed spaces (as they would in school classrooms), or which expose individuals for non-essential activities (such as going to watch a movie), or which carry great risks because social distancing is difficult to implement (such as travelling in a metro) are best avoided. The central guidelines must serve as the template for states, which have shown an increasing tendency of imposing lockdowns for a limited duration — which has little benefit in tackling the pandemic and high costs in terms of economic loss.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/unlock-3-0-rules-get-the-right-mix/story-Uw46lNwOfJldBOZWvrigCO.html
30-07-2020||Editorials||On education, a positive blueprint||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday passed the new National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which aims at making the education system holistic, flexible, multidisciplinary, and aligned to the needs of the 21st century and the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. The policy is ambitious and forward-looking. In school education, which has seen high enrolment but low learning levels, the policy has some first-rate aims to change the existing scenario — ensuring universal access to school education from pre-school to secondary; focusing on early childhood care, education, foundational literacy and numeracy; reintegrating dropouts; restructuring curriculum and pedagogy; reforming assessments and exams; and investing in teacher training and broad-basing their appraisal. Most crucially, NEP, once and for all, buries the strident Hindi versus English language debate; instead, it emphasises on making mother tongue, local language or the regional language the medium of instruction at least till Grade 5, which is considered the best medium of teaching. There is some ambiguity, which prompted concerns whether this would be at the cost of English language education, but the government has clarified that this is not mandatory. There is also an emphasis on vocational training, but to make it effective, there has to be close coordination between the education and skills ministry.In the higher education segment, NEP aims to improve the Gross Enrolment Ratio from 26.3% (2018) to 50% by 2035; break disciplinary barriers; establish academic credit bank, and allow Indian institutions to build campuses abroad and pave the way for foreign universities to come to India. While these are noble goals, increasing GER drastically — almost adding the same number of seats that India has had in the last 70 years in the next 15 years — may lead to a focus on quantity rather than quality. The new policy also talks about creating several regulatory bodies. This is a sound idea; but to make these institutions successful, it is imperative that they are built better, and staffed with people who have the vision to implement the policy mandate.While NEP aims to increase public investment in education from the current 4.3% to 6% of GDP, there is no time-frame given. The need to enhance funding was first recognised decades ago. Only increasing the investment, however, will not be a panacea; to improve the quality of education, there has to be realistic budgeting, flexibility in the tweaking of priorities when required; strong leadership; and a singular focus on outcomes. Many experts feel that while NEP talks of social inequalities at length, its political and economic goals are diffused. It is now important for the government to get state governments on board, and allow a full-fledged discussion in Parliament on the policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/on-education-a-positive-blueprint/story-G9Co2IK2AbxgSVrNEUyxIN.html
30-07-2020||Editorials||Focus on Bangladesh||The India-Bangladesh relationship, over the past decade, has been the brightest spot in Indian foreign policy. After a tense 1990s and 2000s, when power alternated between the moderate Awami League, led by Sheikh Hasina, and the extremist Bangladesh Nationalist Party, led by Begun Khaleda Zia, and a short period of indirect army rule, the Awami League returned to power in 2009. Sheikh Hasina, the daughter of Bangladesh’s iconic freedom fighter and first president, Mujibur Rahman, was clear that having good relations with India, externally, was essential for Bangladesh’s progress and cracking down on Islamists, internally, was essential for maintaining democracy and peace. This translated into unprecedented security cooperation between the two countries, when Dhaka cracked down on militants and terrorists who used Bangladesh as a base to conduct activities in India, particularly the Northeast. Delhi consistently backed Ms Hasina in her domestic political battles. This often meant arguing against the international community, particularly the United States and European Union, which was worried about the growing democratic deficit in Bangladesh. Delhi and Dhaka also signed a landmark boundary deal, resolving a four-decade-old problem. But it was not all smooth. India was unable to deliver on a Teesta water-sharing seal, which undermined Ms Hasina’s political standing. But in recent years, two other significant developments have taken place. The Indian political discourse over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act-National Register of Citizens appeared, on the Dhaka street, as targeted towards Bangladesh. Dhaka scaled down diplomatic engagement substantially and made it clear that it did not approve of being at the receiving end of hostile political rhetoric, even if it was for domestic political purposes. The second has been the enhanced Chinese influence, engagement and investment in Bangladesh — on the lines of what Beijing is doing elsewhere in the region. This has encouraged a section of the Bangladeshi opinion-making elite, and political elite, to see China as a counter-weight to Indian influence. In this backdrop, there have been reports that Ms Hasina refused to see the Indian ambassador in Dhaka for months, despite requests. Irrespective of the accuracy of the reports — there is a view that the meeting could not be held due to the pandemic — it is clear that the relationship needs work. India must not let its domestic political discourse affect its most important relationship in its eastern neighbourhood; it must reach out to Ms Hasina and provide her with deliverables, which can enhance the domestic political space for her to pursue closer ties with India; it must deploy its soft power and attempt an image-correction. Bangladesh has been a steadfast ally. Don’t let it slip.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/focus-on-bangladesh/story-Zpzsxmjwj7K4MIkozaDRXI.html
