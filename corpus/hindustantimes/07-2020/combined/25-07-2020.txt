The complainants Suken Rathod, 34; Bharat Mehta, 41; and Nilesh Shobhavat, 48, all jewellers from Zaveri Bazaar, had stated in their complaints that the accused first gained their trust by doing clean business since 2016 and after October 2019 started defaulting on payment. Copies of their complaints are with HT.“The accused bought gold ornaments from the complainants and shut all branches and didn’t pay them back, cheating them of ₹3.34 crore, ₹2.65 crore and ₹98.97 lakh, respectively. On Thursday, three fresh FIRs were lodged based on their complaints and the accused have been booked for cheating and criminal breach of trust,” said an officer from LT Marg police station.The complainant jewellers had in November 2019 sent their men to the Goodwin Jewellers shops and found that the owner had escaped after cheating thousands of its customer-cum-investors.The two accused promotors were arrested by Thane Police’s economic offences wing (EOW) after they had surrendered at a court in Thane in December 2019.According to Thane police, the accused brothers had been hiding in Kerala after they shut down 12 branches of Goodwin Jewellers across Mumbai, Pune and Kerala on October 22 without intimating customers and investors.Aside from buying and selling jewellery, Goodwin Jewellers had introduced saving schemes that offered interest rates between 14% and 18%. Several cases of cheating and fraud have been registered against the accused and the losses are estimated to be worth ₹25 crore.Thane police seized accused’s properties, bank accounts and vehicles during the investigation, which forced the duo to surrender. The two brothers were charged under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors Act. Both are presently in the judicial custody.Store managers and accountants are among the other accused named in the EOW cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/3-more-cases-against-owners-of-goodwin-jewellers/story-PHNGUK1nFw4ilV352hXFkM.html
25-07-2020||Mumbai||Possession without OC: Action ordered against 45 homebuyers||The Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRera) recently called for prosecution of 45 homebuyers for taking possession of their apartments without the premises possessing an occupation certificate (OC). Apart from the buyers, MahaRera also asked the municipal commissioner concerned for similar action against the project promoters for handing over possession, which it said was an offence.“The Maharashtra Municipal Corporations Act prohibits the occupation of the building without occupancy or completion certificate and it is an offence,” said MahaRera member BD Kapadnis in his order. The order referred to the case filed by builders Niranjan Dashpute and Dattatray Dashpute against the landowner, the Saste brothers, accusing them of causing obstruction in completing their project — Nivrutti Heights — in Pimpri-Chinchwad. Both parties had entered into a development agreement on July 9, 2012, where the project was to be completed within 36 months. However, disputes arose, which forced the Dashputes to approach MahaRera.The Dashputes contended that they were unable to procure the OC for their building since the Saste brothers — Rajkumar, Sanjay and Vijay — were causing obstruction and thus not allowing them to complete the project and install a fire-safety system in the premises.The Saste brothers defended themselves, saying that the builders used substandard construction material and the 45 families staying in the building were not provided amenities promised to them.Kapadnis, in his ruling, directed the Saste brothers not to create obstacles and allow the builders to complete the project. However, he came down heavily on both parties as well as the occupants over the issue of people staying in the building without an OC. He directed the MahaRera secretary to bring to the notice of the Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal commissioner to take legal action against the builder, landowners and also the occupants. “Section 3 (2) (i) of Maharashtra Ownership of Flats Act, 1963, prohibits a builder from inducting any person without completion certificate into the flats and also prohibits the buyer from entering into possession of such flat without Occupancy Certificate or the Completion Certificate,” said Kapadnis.Earlier, he said, “I have been told that 45 families have already moved into this building, which is not yet completely constructed and which is not safe to live in the absence of a fire-safety system. The respondent [Saste brothers] cannot be allowed to put the lives of others in danger for their own sake or benefit,”Currently, there are three lakh buildings in Maharashtra, of which 15,000 in Mumbai still don’t have an OC. The reason: The builders violated rules or did not construct a mandatory compound wall or defaulted in payments. The builders deserted the projects leaving the residents high and dry. The result was BMC allowed them to stay on humanitarian grounds, but they are charged double the amount for water bills. Various efforts by the government to regularise them through amnesty schemes failed as the penalty was too high and not affordable for flat owners.According to Ramesh Prabhu, chairman, Maharashtra Societies Welfare Association (MSWA,) it was an excellent decision, which would dissuade both builders and buyers from moving into flats without an OC. “As MahaRera is now monitoring the possession date, buyers need not worry as it is binding on the builders to give possession with OC to buyers before the deadline,” said Prabhu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/possession-without-oc-action-ordered-against-45-homebuyers/story-1XrCXnl7CwZR40fQVWNeWI.html

25-07-2020||Mumbai||Pawar defends CM, says asked him to monitor from one place||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday defended chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray for not touring other areas of the state during the Covid-19 crisis. Pawar said they all had urged the CM to oversee and monitor functioning of his team from a place as the head of the government. He also praised Thackeray saying that the latter is working day and night against Covid-19 outbreak.Pawar, along with state health minister Rajesh Tope, has started visiting cities and districts and reviewing preparations of local authorities. On Saturday, he was in Aurangabad city where he took a stock of the situation and launched ‘Mission Zero—Aurangabad’ campaign that aims to bring the fatality rate in the city to zero. Aurangabad guardian minister and industries minister Subhash Desai was also present during the event.Maharashtra has the highest number of Covid-19 cases and deaths across the country with a surge in new Covid-19 cases in several cities and districts, taking daily case count of the state to almost 10,000. The NCP supremo said sitting at a place is not in his nature and that it is his duty to reach out to the people in the time of the crisis as many districts have supported him in the past. “It is in my nature to keep visiting people. Also, many districts such as Aurangabad, Beed etc. have helped me in the past and it is my duty to reach out to all those in the time of crisis. Today, I’m here only with that feeling and there is no other reason behind it,” he said.“Being a captain, we all had urged the chief minister to be at a place and oversee and monitor the functioning of his team and take decisions accordingly, which he is doing at present. After going back to Mumbai, I will meet and explain the situation to him. The guardian minister (Subhash Desai) will also be meeting him for the same and I’m sure he will take necessary decisions immediately. Crises of this nature are fought this way,” Pawar said.“CM is working day and night focussing to control the Covid-19 pandemic. He has been taking reviews from officials and people concerned, twice a day — morning and evening. But there was also a view that some people should go on field and took stock of the situation, thus we are here to attend a meeting called by the guardian minister,” the veteran leader added.The 79-year-old leader was in Nashik on Friday and in Solapur district on Monday where he reviewed the measures taken to control the situation.The opposition has criticised that the chief minister for not touring other parts of the state to review the situation while the ruling Shiv Sena claimed Thackeray has been taking virtual review. Taking a dig at the CM, state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil on Saturday told a Marathi news channel, “Even a school student can say that our Uddhavji is not going anywhere.” Recently, the state government has barred state officials from attending meetings called by Opposition leaders including non-governmental members, MPs and legislators. An order to this effect was issued on July 21.The decision came after the leader of Opposition in the legislative Assembly Devendra Fadnavis was touring a few districts to review the Covid-19 situation. Leader of Opposition in the legislative council Pravin Darekar, too, has visited various Covid care centres and hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pawar-defends-cm-says-asked-him-to-monitor-from-one-place/story-9UEy5PpOjCSrKV398zugYI.html
25-07-2020||Mumbai||State crosses 200,000 Covid recoveries; tally is 366,368||Maharashtra clocked over 9,000 Covid-19 cases for the fourth consecutive day with 9,251 new infections on Saturday pushing the tally to 366,368, but the state also crossed a positive mark of 2 lakh recoveries. So far, 207,194 patients have recovered from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) across the state, making the recovery rate 56.55%, while the number of active cases touched 145,481. Maharashtra also recorded 257 new fatalities, which took the toll to 13,389.Mumbai, meanwhile, on Saturday crossed a grim mark of 6,000 fatalities after recording 52 deaths, which took the toll to 6,036. Mumbai recorded 1,080 new cases, taking the financial capital’s tally to 108,060. The city has 22,854 active cases. Maharashtra recorded 191,907 Covid-19 cases in July and is expected to amass 2 lakh cases this month within a day or two, looking at the trend of daily new cases. The state had recorded 107,106 cases in June alone.Although the daily caseload is on the upward trend, state health minister Rajesh Tope said that they were not worried about the rising numbers as nearly 97% of the patients recover. He said that their focus is reducing the case fatality rate (CFR) of the state. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday directed officials to work at bringing the CFR down to zero. The CFR of the state stood at 3.65%.“The positives in the current scenario are that over 2 lakh people have recovered so far. Yes, cases are going up in some districts. At some places, the curve is flattening, [the situation in] Mumbai is stabilising. Dharavi and Malegaon are reporting zero cases almost. Now, the situation in every district is improving. The [daily] figures can go up, but we are focused on keeping the CFR in check. For the treatment, we have increased the availability of beds, we have also sought the help of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) to provide doctors,” Tope said.The minister said that he spoke to the heads of three pharmaceutical companies — Hetero, Cipla, and Mylan — that manufacture anti-viral drugs remdesivir and tocilizumab, on providing adequate quantities of them to the state government. “We have floated tenders worth Rs20.57 crore for remdesivir and tocilizumab. District collectors have been provided the funds for it. The collectors must place orders as per their requirements and the heads of these companies have assured me that it will be supplied in three to five days,” Tope told reporters in Aurangabad.Thackeray, meanwhile, said that the administration should remain alert in this fight against the rising spread of Covid-19 in parts of the state. Thackeray, on Saturday, inaugurated two Covid care facilities in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), where the cases have been increasing over the past month now. With lockdown imposed in most of the municipal corporation areas within the MMR, the situation is now gradually coming under control, state health department officials said.In the last eight days, MMR, excluding Mumbai, has been recording an average of 2,458 cases daily. Between July 18 and July 25, MMR has added 19,666 cases, stretching the health infrastructure in the region. The total number of active cases in the MMR now stands at 46,554.With the cases continue to rise in the MMR, Thackeray said that “carelessness and laxity” will not work. He said that only erecting big centres and facilities will not work, but the focus should be on providing better health facilities, medical services, adequate supply of oxygen cylinders is also a must.Thackeray was speaking to officials, while inaugurating a testing laboratory in Kalyan and a dedicated Covid Care Centre in Dombivli. The CCC in Dombivli has a capacity of 400 beds, including 300 oxygenated beds and 20 ICU beds. The lab, set up on a PPP basis in Kalyan, has a capacity to conduct 3,000 tests a day. Earlier, Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) would send swab samples to a laboratory in Mumbai or Thane and the test results would come after two-three days. Now, officials expect reports within 12 hours of testing. Kalyan-Dombvli, the twin cities, have reported a chunk of the cases within MMR and has surpassed Thane city to become the most affected city in MMR, after Mumbai. With 451 new cases on Saturday, Kalyan-Dombivli touched 20,700 cases.“Till an effective medicine comes, we have to remain more alert. We cannot afford to be careless or lax. Check the line of treatment going on [at your location] with the [Covid] Task Force. Defeating the coronavirus is a challenge for us all, but we can do it collectively,” he said.Pune contributed the most number of cases recorded by a city or a district with 1,913 new cases, pushing the tally to 49,370. It also recorded 45 new fatalities, which took its toll to 1,248. Pimpri-Chinchwad, another hotspot in the Pune district, recorded 866 new cases. The satellite city of Pune now has 16,122 total cases.Aurangabad city recorded 238 new cases, which took the tally to 8631. Tope who took a review of the measures in the city said that the situation in Aurangabad city was under control. “The doubling rate, which is an important parameter, is now 26 days. It has come down from 14 days last month. Aurangabad has so far tested 1 lakh samples, which is a crucial step for early detection,” he told reporters in Aurangabad.The health minister added that the state government had amended the rules for recruitment to fill 17,000 vacant posts in the health department. “These posts will be now filled on merit. The recruitment rules have been amended; now there is no need for an interview etc; the chief minister has signed the proposal. The applications have come in the mega recruitment drive. We will fill the posts on merit in the next few days,” Tope said. The state government is going to purchase 500 ambulances, he added.The minister appealed to people that asymptomatic Covid-19 patients should not occupy beds in the hospitals. He added that asymptomatic patients who get admitted to hospitals will not be covered under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana, the state’s medical insurance scheme. He also reiterated that auditors have been appointed to verify the bills at private hospitals and therefore, there will not be any complaints about overcharging.Maharashtra has tested 1,836,920 samples so far and has an overall positivity rate of 19.94%. Currently, 8,94,509 people are in home quarantine and 44,603 people are in institutional quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-crosses-200-000-covid-recoveries-tally-is-366-368/story-riFf5JpZU6ydT6oK85SyGN.html
25-07-2020||City||KDMC files plaints against 40 for flouting quarantine||Over the past two days, the Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) has charged 40 people with non-cognisable (NC) offence for violating quarantine. No first information reports (FIRs) have been filed and no arrests have been made in these cases. KDMC epidemic officer Dr Pratibha Panpatil, said, “We get complaints from housing societies that Covid-positive patients continue to step out. These are mostly asymptomatic patients who have been told to isolate at home. Also, if we feel any person is staying in a small space or is prone to spread it to others, we recommend institutional quarantine. Often, they do not comply. In such cases, we have now enrolled the help of the police and filed written complaints against 40 people, including those who did not comply with institutional or home quarantine.” Deputy commissioner of police, Kalyan zone, Vivek Pansare, said, “We have not registered FIR in any such complaints. However, when the civic body requests, we provide our forces to assist them to reach a hospital or quarantine facility.” Citizens allege KDMC has been inconsistent in its handling of Covid cases. “There have been instances where instead of just taking the patient to hospital, the civic body has taken neighbours as well, along with the patient’s family to the quarantine centre. Also, there are instances where families have returned from the hospital, yet the officials have arrived to seal the building,” said Rajat Rajan, social worker, Dombivli. Sanjeev Auti, secretary of Sunshine Court apartments in Kalyan, said, “We have faced instances where the positive patient is asymptomatic yet the civic body asks them to be quarantined at the quarantine centre. These patients and their families request to be allowed to stay at home in isolation, as asymptomatic patients are allowed to isolate at home. However, the officers insist it is protocol.” Auti also alleged the civic body has not sealed some buildings despite residents testing positive for Covid-19. KDMC commissioner Vijay Suryavanshi said there is an established protocol for the civic body. “We ensure 15 high-risk contacts and five low-risk contacts are traced for every positive patient. They are advised strict quarantine,” he said, adding that civic officers are “keeping a strict vigil” on all those who test positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kdmc-files-plaints-against-40-for-flouting-quarantine/story-zdDgUkyucOuuwY65QHQExJ.html
25-07-2020||Chandigarh||After staff dissent, PGIMER puts new quarantine rules on hold||The Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) authorities here have put the new quarantine rules on hold after objection from the health staff on Covid-19 duty.The institute had earlier decided that the health personnel working in PGIMER’s high-risk Covid-19 treatment zones will be allowed to go home after duty instead of the mandatory seven-day quarantine at specially allotted accommodation.To this, some employees and nurses had argued that quarantine at home was not feasible for those who were sharing their rented houses with other people. The nurses association had even shot off a letter to the PGIMER administration in this regard.However, the administration had maintained that the decision was taken after consultations with other institutes following similar rules.PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said he had directed that a meeting of officials and representatives from the nurses’ union be held to reach a consensus in the matter.“For now, the decision on new quarantine rules have been put on hold and previous arrangement will continue,” said Dr Ram.Earlier, only seven days of Covid-19 duty was allowed following which one-week quarantine was mandatory in a private accommodation.However, under the new rules, the staff would work for 10 days followed by five days off, which would be deducted from their monthly quota of nine offs. After 15 days (including workdays and five-day leave), the nurses would be posted in non-covid areas for a period of 15 days, including four days of leave.All in all, they would be working for 21 days with nine days off, similar to their previous working schedule.The doctors will be given just two days of leave after one-week Covid-19 duty, which means they have to report back to work on the 10th day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/after-staff-dissent-pgimer-puts-new-quarantine-rules-on-hold/story-NbH2fkBOhuyS4tF2C9sIcM.html

25-07-2020||City||Panchkula records first Covid fatality, Mohali surpasses Chandigarh death toll||With the death of a 75-year-old woman from Shahpur, Panchkula district reported its first fatality related to Covid-19 on Saturday. Meanwhile, a 65-year-old man from Kharar succumbed to the disease at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), becoming Mohali district’s fourteenth Covid fatality. The district has now surpassed Chandigarh’s death toll, which stands at 13. The two deaths were reported on the day Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula recorded 29, 28 and 23 fresh cases respectively, in yet another big single day-spike of 80 cases in the tricity. Those tested positive include two doctors of the PGIMER.The elderly Panchkula woman, who died on Saturday, was on medication for tuberculosis and was admitted to the local civil hospital three days ago with Covid-like symptoms.“Her lungs were damaged, suffering from pneumonia and breathlessness. After three days of treatment at the civil hospital, she was shifted to a private hospital by her family, where she died in the evening,” stated a release. The district had reported a Covid death on July 2 as well, though 20 days later the administration claimed the patient’s death audit report termed it a non-Covid fatality. Among the 23 fresh cases in the district, a PGIMER doctor staying in Panchkula and a security guard posted at the MRI and CT scan centre of the civil hospital in Sector 6 have tested positive. The other patients include three senior citizens. The cases are spread across Sectors 8, 10, 12, 21 and 25 in the city besides Surajpur, Rai Purani, Nanakpur, Kalka and Pinjore. With this, the total number of cases in Panchkula district has climbed to 413, with 232 still active.

After an infection surfaced at Elante Mall, its management said in a release: “A third-party employee manning a kiosk at Elante Mall tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday. He last visited the mall on July 19, when his Aarogya Setu app was checked and his body temperature was normal.We have asked all the staff manning the kiosk to be self-quarantined immediately and get themselves tested at the hospital.

25-07-2020||Mumbai||15 years after 2005 deluge, city’s condition still same: Activists||Fifteen years since unprecedented rainfall led to the floods of July 26, 2005 that claimed 1,094 lives, major recommendations made in 2006 by a fact-finding committee have still not been met, alleged environmentalists. While admitting more work needed to be done, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said 80% of all recommendations pertaining specifically to Mithi river under the storm water drains (SWD) department have been met. On Saturday, in a letter to chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray, city environmentalists said previous governments had not taken the recommendations of the Chitale committee seriously. The letter highlights 10 major recommendations that have not been acted upon, including separation of sewage from storm water; conservation of natural ecosystems including mangrove and wetland protection; reckless dumping of construction debris; integrating urban planning with extreme weather events; developing climate resilient infrastructure, banning development on river flood plains, creeks, conserving holding ponds; and increasing urban green zones. The letter has been signed by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) NatConnect Foundation, Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan, Paramparik Machhimar Bachao Kruti Samiti, and RiverMarch. “By highlighting the gaps in the Chitale Committee report, we have called for a comprehensive environment and urban development policy for Mumbai metropolitan region with a special focus on conserving natural ecosystems and developing a comprehensive rainwater harvesting plan,” said BN Kumar, director, NatConnect Foundation. Additional municipal commissioner P Velarasu said, “Perennially flood prone areas are being tackled keeping extreme events in focus. Extra capacity margins have been decided for future projects so that we are able to handle a once in a 10-15 year weather event. This is being looked at by the SWD department as of now. It needs to be percolated into other departments also.” Between July 26-27, 2005, Mumbai recorded 944.2 mm rainfall in 24 hours. Coming under strong criticism of flood-protection promises, the state had set up a fact-finding committee headed by Madhav Chitale to examine causes of the extreme weather event and suggest solutions. The then CM Sushil Kumar Shinde had said it was a “once-in-a-100-year” event and that no city could cope with this amount of rainfall. “Owing to climate change, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are increasing. At a parallel level, faulty and inaccurate execution of existing recommendations are worsening the situation,” said environmentalist Debi Goenka. “We are fairly in a better shape today,” said Velarasu adding, “From developing flood warning system, widening retention walls, nullahs, improving sewage network under the Brihanmumbai Storm Water Disposal System (Brimstowad) project, and encroachment removal, are some of the major efforts done for Mithi. The same is being replicated for three other rivers. We need to make progress regarding widening and improving culverts below railway lines and crossings as immediate measures.” Godfrey Pimenta, trustee of Watchdog Foundation, said, “Even after spending Rs 2,000 crore over 15 years, BMC has completed only 70% of the Brimstowad project till 2020. Paving of creek channels has altered the city’s hydrology. Contour mapping (topography) has not been done for decades.” A Supreme Court-appointed committee in 2018 had highlighted that with large-scale urbanisation as well as encroachments and development in the Mithi river basin, a future flood similar to the deluge of July 2005 was inevitable. “Major suggestions of the Chitale committee were never implemented,” the committee had concluded. Stalin D, director of the non-governmental organisation Vanashakti, alleged that the city continues to sees flooding, even if the rainfall isn’t extreme. “Mumbai will witness floods even if it rains over 250 mm in 24 hours,” he said. However, Velarasu said flood-prone areas are being tracked by the SWD department on an evolving basis. “Apart from 35-40 locations, the situation is much better. We have planned for 50-60 mm per hour but intense rain spells witnessed even this year were bound to lead to temporary waterlogging. Planning for extreme events every year has very high expenditure. Ultimately we have to see financial optimisation also,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/15-years-after-2005-deluge-city-s-condition-still-same-activists/story-DnrJGbn63kFrBe7h6ci47K.html
25-07-2020||City||Bail granted does not come to an end due to delay in surety: HC||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court has held that bail granted to a person does not come to an end on account of delay in submitting surety. The high court bench of justice Anil Kshetarpal reversed an order passed by a Mohali court, observing that in such circumstances, mere delay in furnishing personal bail bonds/surety cannot go against the petitioner and the order granting bail under Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 does not cease to exist or comes to an end or stand eclipsed. Section 167 of the Code lays down the procedure for bail on the non-completion of probe. The order came on the plea of one Surinderpal Singh, being probed by Punjab vigilance bureau in different graft cases in three FIRs, all registered in 2017. He secured bail in one FIR, but remained in custody due to two FIRs pending against him. When he secured bail in those two FIRs as well, his surety bonds were not accepted by the court in first FIR on account of delay, earlier this year. The person who had stood had surety in 2017 had withdrawn, but court did not accept fresh surety from him. In the high court, he had contended that the court below erred in refusing to accept fresh surety as the bail granted to the petitioner has never been cancelled. The court found that the bail once granted, may be cancelled, but there is no time limit prescribed for furnishing of bail/surety. The petitioner did “avail of” his right of bail and was granted. Thus, he would be deemed to have been released from custody, the court said, further, observing that the view of the trial court is against the mandate of proviso to Section 167(2) of the Code as expounded by the Supreme Court in various judgments. The court also rapped the trial court, observing that the court below did take note of an apex court judgment cited by the petitioner in his favour. But, instead, refused to follow the same by observing that “these judgments are not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case”. “A judgment passed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court is binding on all courts in the country under Article 141 of the Constitution. No doubt, the ratio decidendi (the rationale for the decision) laid down in a judgment is binding and not obiter dicta ( remarks made by judges that do not affect the outcome of the case). However, before distinguishing judgment, the court is required to analyse that what is the ratio laid down in the judgment and thereafter, proceed to explain the same,” the bench said adding that the manner in which the trial court has ignored the judgment of the apex court is not ‘appreciable’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bail-granted-does-not-come-to-an-end-due-to-delay-in-surety-hc/story-PRTsul9S2Cbm34Cr1KA54K.html
25-07-2020||Mumbai||US visa announcement: Anxiety, uncertainty grip students enrolled for online-only classes||It’s like the worst has happened, says Aanchal G, who enrolled in a Masters programme at the University of Pennsylvania; got a scholarship that covered her tuition; celebrated her imminent departure, and now finds that she may have to stay home.On Friday, the Trump administration announced that foreign students with online-only classes will not be eligible to enter the country. Aanchal’s institute has gone completely online amid the Covid-19 pandemic.When the US government announced, on July 6, that students with entirely-online courses could not stay in the country, that had caused her first wave of panic. When that order was rolled back, Aanchal began to breathe again. “Now, I am totally disappointed,” she says.It’s been heartbreak all around in the student community, for those headed to the US. While this decision too may be amended or reversed, it stands for now, adding a layer of anxiety and uncertainty in an already unprecedented time.Following Friday’s announcement, some Mumbai students said they are considering deferring study; others are opting to go through with it because of loans already taken and / or grants received.Aanchal plans to stay the course. “Maybe things will change, or I will get to meet everyone there once the Fall semester ends,” she says.A lose-lose situationFor those enrolling in colleges with a hybrid module that allows students to choose an on-campus or online experience, students from India will be forced to choose the former just to get their visas — even if it means exposing themselves to the virus in the country with the world’s highest number of cases.“I gave up a job with such a good profile to pursue this course. I can’t afford to skip a year,” says Shruti Babbar, 23, enrolled in a Masters course in science project management and business analytics at Northeastern University, Boston. “Plus, I’ve taken an education loan.”Shruti’s father Arun, a real-estate and travel agent, says he wanted to plan everything perfectly for his only child. “When the pandemic complicated everything, that was the first time my wife and I got upset. But we didn’t let on. We put on bright smiles. As things fell into place, we booked flight tickets and made a deposit on accommodation in Boston for Shruti. The tickets have already been cancelled twice. Only part of the accommodation charges will be refunded.”Kimberly Wright Dixit, founder of study-abroad consultancy The Red Pen, says the drawbacks for architecture, engineering and medical students are most significant. Aseem Visal, 28, would agree. He was scheduled to do a Masters in materials science and engineering at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He has deferred his programme. “It just isn’t practical to try and do it online from here,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/us-visa-announcement-anxiety-uncertainty-grip-students-enrolled-for-online-only-classes/story-rNM1YmAszMRzZUFfd7XxoI.html

He assured residents that now, no hospital will be able to hide information regarding the actual status of vacant beds. He said the direct access of this portal is with deputy commissioner, commissioner of police and ADC (development), besides being shared with private hospitals as well. The industrialists assured the deputy commissioner that they will always support the district administration in the fight against Covid-19. They said the MSME sector of Ludhiana has already donated more than Rs 1.5 crore to the district administration to help in the battle against Covid-19.The deputy commissioner urged industrialists to ensure that wearing of masks is made mandatory for labourers and should be part of their uniform. He also urged them to repeatedly sensitise the labour regarding safety precautions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-dc-asks-industrialists-for-assistance-in-handling-covid-pandemic/story-DTw1tm5DE4Nj2PhJuPfNBN.html
25-07-2020||Chandigarh||Graft-tainted woman cop surrenders in Chandigarh court||Finally, after being on the run for 25 days, suspended Chandigarh Police inspector Jaswinder Kaur, who is an accused in a ₹5 lakh graft case, surrendered before court on Saturday and was handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for four-day custodial interrogation. With this development, Jaswinder has become the first woman personnel of Chandigarh Police arrested by the CBI for graft. “In order to unearth the larger conspiracy entered into between accused Jaswinder Kaur, Bhagwan Singh (conduit) and other accused, her police remand is required,” said Sushil Kumar Garg, special judge, CBI court, Chandigarh.Earlier, pressing for her remand, CBI public prosecutor KP Singh said: “Subsequent conduct of Jaswinder is highly deplorable and against the spirit of the rule of law as she is a member of police force to the rank of inspector.” Meanwhile, court allowed the application moved by her defence counsel Terminder Singh to meet her daily during her remand. Jaswinder had raised apprehension that CBI officials may “misbehave” with her. Court allowed one of her counsels to meet her daily for an hour from 5pm to 6pm as her family members did not want to meet her in custody. The court also ordered that her Covid-19 test be conducted.SHE HAS A LOT TO ANSWERJaswinder Kaur, who was then the station house officer in Manimajra, was booked by the CBI on May 30 following the arrest of conduit Bhagwan Singh. The CBI had on July 29 arrested Bhagwan while accepting ₹1 lakh as illegal gratification, allegedly on Jaswinder’s behalf from complainant Gurdeep Singh, a resident of Manimajra. Jaswinder was accused of demanding ₹5 lakh bribe from Gurdeep in lieu of not registering a cheating case against him. Jaswinder is also accused of making fake daily diary register (DDR) entry, and thus creating false evidence, to show she had joined investigations following the CBI raids on July 29. Jaswinder had been maintaining that the money recovered by the CBI was part of a “compromise” reached between Gurdeep and one Randhir Singh on June 21. Randhir had accused Gurdeep of fraud, alleging that he had taken ₹28 lakh from him in lieu of getting his wife recruited as an excise and taxation officer. Jaswinder maintained that as part of the compromise, Gurdeep was to refund ₹30 lakh to Randhir. The document was signed by Gurdeep, Randhir, and Bhagwan besides one Narpinder Singh, following which a DDR entry was also made about the compromise, she claimed. However, CBI investigations have pointed out that on Jaswinder’s instructions, Gurdeep’s signatures were taken on a blank paper. It was later that “samjhauta/compromise” was written on it and the paper was signed by Randhir and others. The investigating officials have already recorded the relevant statement of constable Sarabjeet Singh, who is posted at the Manimajra police station. Now, Jaswinder will be confronted with the police station’s CCTV footage of June 21 that corroborates Sarabjeet’s statement, said an official. HIGH DRAMA IN COURTAs Jaswinder Kaur walked into court to surrender, a section of lawyers raised objection. The lawyers said in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic when not even mushis and lawyers’ clerks are allowed entry into the premises, then how come Jaswinder managed to enter without permission. Meanwhile, claiming innocence, Jaswinder Kaur said: “I have been implicated falsely at behest of a lobby, as I am from backward caste. Despite being an inspector, I am facing atrocities.” THE CASE SO FARJune 26: In a handwritten complaint, Manimajra resident Gurdeep Singh accuses SHO Jaswinder Kaur of demanding bribe on June 10, in lieu of not registering a cheating case against him. He claims he already paid ₹2 lakh to conduit Bhagwan Singh on June 19 June 29: CBI raids Manimajra police station and Jaswinder’s house, after arresting Bhagwan with ₹1 lakh of the bribe money June 30: Jaswinder booked for seeking ₹5 lakh bribe and suspended, after which she keeps evading arrestJuly 10: CBI special court denies Jaswinder’s anticipatory bail plea July 21: Punjab and Haryana high court also dismisses her anticipatory bail application July 25: Jaswinder surrenders before court and sent to four-day remand||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/graft-tainted-woman-cop-surrenders-in-chandigarh-court/story-HUtkeJEPcXHI4MexiiK3FP.html

The members also raised slogans against the MP and asked him to get the fee waived off amid the Covid-19 pandemic.During the protest, the members also stated that during elections, Bittu hold rallies in various areas of Ludhiana to woo voters, and after becoming MP, he is not bothered to help residents. Arvind Walia, district president of Shiv Sena, said, “Parents are in financial crisis due to the lockdown and many have lost their jobs due to which they are unable to pay school fee. The state government should take a decision and ask school authorities to waive off admission fee.”“Several private schools have struck students’ names off the roles as they were not able to pay the tuition fee and other charges. Many schools are not allowing students to attend online classes.

25-07-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Shopkeepers a harried lot as Shahpur road declared micro- containment zone ahead of Raksha Bandhan||At a time when the market is witnessing a slowdown amid surging Covid-19 cases, Shahpur road being declared a micro containment zone on Friday has added to woes of shopkeepers as their establishments have been shut down ahead of Raksha Bandhan.Councillor Rakesh Prashar, a resident of Shahpur road, tested positive for Covid-19 on July 16, following which eight of his relatives also tested positive. The administration and health department then declared the area a micro-containment zone citing rising number of cases.Shop owners rued that every shopkeeper in the market had stocked rakhis and gift items worth around Rs 1 lakh. Shahpur road is one of the main markets of the old city areas with a large number of shops dealing in rakhis and gift items. One of the shopkeepers, Paramjeet Singh, said, “The shopkeepers are in trouble as we were already facing losses due to low footfall in the market. The administration should allow shopkeepers to open up at least the day before Raksha Bandhan (August 2). After the lockdown, we were thinking that business would slowly come back on track during raksha bandhan, but the announcement has dashed our hopes.””The shopkeepers of Shahpur road are contemplating installation of temporary vends at Field Ganj to sell off the Rakhis. The situation has worsened due to internal tussle between shopkeepers. The health department had earlier declared a small portion of the road a micro- containment zone. But, shopkeepers in that area raised objections on other shops being allowed to open. So, the department declared the entire area a micro-containment zone,” another shop owner said.Ludhiana civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said,”It is a collective decision taken by the district administration, police and health department. These steps are required to control the spread of the disease. Shopkeepers should cooperate with the department as it is for their own benefit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-shopkeepers-a-harried-lot-as-shahpur-road-declared-micro-containment-zone-ahead-of-raksha-bandhan/story-jDUN25awvotxlf60oS7IiP.html
25-07-2020||City||Delhi riots cases: One gets bail, two released; relief denied to another||New Delhi: A Delhi court has granted bail to an accused in a case related to February’s communal riots in north-east Delhi. The same court denied release to another accused in a separate riots case which took place in Bhajanpura. In a third case, the court allowed the release of two persons — Furqan and Irshad — who were arrested for damaging the Rajdhani school during the riots, after the city police informed court that nothing adverse was found against them in the investigation. All three cases were decided on Friday(July 24). Police had filed a cancellation report, specifying that accused persons did not cause any damage to Rajdhani School and they may be discharged. It had said that there is no material on record to connect the accused persons with the crime. Chief metropolitan magistrate Purshottam Pathak granted bail to Mukesh Rai while stating that police had not recovered anything from him and the chargesheet has already been filed. The judge said that the accused has been in jail since the last three months and no purpose would be served by keeping Rai in judicial custody further. Police had said that Rai was a part of an unlawful assembly and was involved in rioting, vandalisation, chanting of slogans against the other community, looting of shops and arson of public as well as private properties during the riots in February. Rai’s counsel had said that he was being falsely implicated and no recovery has been made from him. The judge while granting bail, noted that Rai was arrested on the basis of the disclosure statement of another accused and nothing has been recovered from him. In a separate case, judge Pathak denied bail to Neeraj alias Kashi while noting that he was a part of an unlawful assembly and had further involved in rioting and burning of shops. The court also said that the accused was a “habitual offender”. The judge said that the investigating officer had filed the records of previous criminal antecendents and has also been identified by a Delhi police head constable for being present on the spot at the time of the incident of rioting. Neeraj, through his cousnel, had contended that he is the sole bread earner of his family and his wife being seven-month pregnant, he should be granted bail. He said that the charge sheet in the present case has already been filed and hence he should be released on bail. However, the police had contended that he had actively participated in the riots and ransacked houses and shops. Communal riots had broken out in the city on February 23, claiming 53 lives and leaving several injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-riots-cases-one-gets-bail-two-released-relief-denied-to-another/story-LX2m4qiZ6E2MURgC5zB3yK.html
25-07-2020||City||New consumer law to protect online customers||New Delhi: It’s been a long wait , but finally, the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 has replaced the 1986 law and it’s certainly a cause for celebration. The new law retains all the components of the landmark 1986 law that gave Indian consumers, their six basic rights and a consumer justice system. However, it further expands the scope of the consumer courts to deal with complaints pertaining to e-commerce, direct selling entities and unfair contracts. It also provides for product liability action against manufacturers, sellers and service providers for any defects or deficiencies or even failure to provide adequate warning about the use of the product or service. The new law is in tune with the modern day concepts of consumer protection, the new market dynamics and the rapid advances in digital technology that has so transformed our world. In fact the comprehensive E-commerce Rules notified under the new law to protect consumers from unfair trade practices in the digital world, encompasses all models of e-commerce and all kinds of unfair trade practices.But what makes this law so different and comprehensive is the fact that under the new law , the government takes full responsibility for the protection, promotion and enforcement of consumer rights, through the creation of the regulatory body- the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA). Even though the 1986 law encapsulated the rights of consumers, it failed to provide a regulator to enforce all the rights, particularly the right to be protected from unsafe goods and services and unfair trade practices, believing that the consumer court or the adjudicatory body, would somehow play the role of the regulator too. This was a major lacuna in the law.This has finally changed. The CCPA has the power to investigate into unsafe goods, order their recall and direct refund of the cost of such goods to the consumers; it can put stop to all unfair trade practices, including unfair terms in consumer contracts and false and misleading advertisements. It can also hold celebrity endorsers liable for false and misleading promotions. It can also take to task, those selling and manufacturing adulterated and spurious goods. And the punishment prescribed under the law for some of these offences is stringent. However, it may take some time for the Authority to become fully functional.But the consumer courts have already moved over to the new law. While the old cases will continue to be adjudicated under the old law, the new ones will have to be filed under the CP Act of 2019, which means that consumers have to keep in mind the changed pecuniary jurisdiction of these Commissions. The consumer court at the district level or the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, has the jurisdiction to entertain complaints up to the value of Rs 1 crore. Those above Rs 1 crore and upto Rs 10 crore will be handled by the State Commission and complaints above Rs 10 crore will go the National CommissionHowever, the biggest advantage to the consumer under the new law is that (a) you can file the complaint online, sitting in the comfort of your home and b) the choice of the court no more depends on where the opposite party resides or has an office. You can choose a consumer court close to your home or place of work. However, there is no substantial change in the procedure before these courts –so the lawyers will be there and so also the adjournments, unless the government finds ways and means of strictly enforcing the 90-day limit for completing the adjudication, as prescribed under the old and now the new law. However, if you do not want a long fight, you can opt for mediation for quick settlement of your dispute. Thus while the 1986 law laid the foundation for consumer protection in the country, the 2019 Act builds on it, brick by brick. On its strict enforcement rests consumer empowerment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-consumer-law-to-protect-online-customers/story-zN1PBoZ9p3hHlmnCmMMxNK.html

The suspect was arrested soon after the incident, the police said. According to the police, the incident took place around 4.30pm in Dasna when Mohammad Inam and his mother, Raheesa, who used single name, were working in fields near their house and an altercation started between them. Dasna comes under the jurisdiction of Masuri police station. “There had been frequent altercations between the two. During initial questioning, the suspect has told us that he was habitual of drinking and also wanted to get married. But his mother objected to his habit and there were differences between the two on the issue. When the altercation broke out between the two on Saturday evening, the suspect landed several blows to his mother’s head with a spade and she collapsed on the spot,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural). “In the meantime, suspect’s elder brother arrived and called locals for help and they also called up the police. The suspect had also tried to throw his injured mother into a nearby drain, but soon people arrived and nabbed him. The police later arrested him,” Jadaun added. Police officials said that on the basis of complaint given by the family, an FIR under Section 302 (murder) of Indian penal Code was lodged against the suspect at Masuri police station. The spade, which was used in the crime, was also recovered, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/22-year-old-man-kills-mother-after-altercation-arrested/story-b9liCiHxz985sLNqmvDMpM.html
25-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Health dept to widen net, trace more contacts of positive patients||The health department will widen the scope of contact tracing of Covid-19 positive patients in order to identify suspected cases. The officials said at present, they have an average of about 4.5 contacts per patient and will scale this up further. Health officials said they have received directions from the state government to increase the contact up to six or eight per Covid-19 patient. The district, till July 24, has a total of 4,441 Covid-19 cases and about 94% of the contact data of these patients has been uploaded to the state portal. “We have received directions from the state government to trace at least 8 to 10 primary and secondary contacts of each Covid-19 patient. This will help us as more people will be tested subsequently. At present, our contact tracing is averaging 4.5 contacts per positive patient. So, we will now scale this up,” Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad, said. “Since rapid antigen kits are now available, contact tracing will be followed up by early testing. Increasing the contact tracing will finally help us to know how many more people are prone to the infection. More contact tracing and testing will help prevent the spread of Covid-19,” he said. The contact tracing of a patient is taken up to ascertain the number of people (s)he had come in contact with about four or five days before (s)he tested positive for Covid-19. Such contacts are then told to remain in home quarantine and those showing symptoms of Covid-19 are also tested and sent to appropriate Covid facilities (if tested positive) for further treatment. In Ghaziabad, contact tracing of Covid-19 patients is done with the help of six teams who speak to each patient over phone. The teams are stationed at a dedicated control room at the district headquarters. Another three-member team, comprising a police personnel and health workers, also visits the patient’s house for the purpose. According to the statistics available with the health department, the district currently has about 3,200 patients with up to five contacts, 815 patients having six to eight contacts, 232 patients with 11 to 20 contacts and about 30 patients having more than 20 contacts. “We have been able to upload about 94% of our manual contact tracing data on to the state portal. The rest will be updated within a day or two,” Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, Ghaziabad, said. According to the uploaded data, the age group of 41-60 years has the highest number of contacts at 8,824. The age group of 0-20 years has 2,236 contacts while the age group of over 60 years has 1,964 contacts. “The age group of 41-60 years has the highest number of contacts as this group is the most mobile -- they go to office daily and visit markets for household goods and chores. Senior citizens, for more obvious reasons, prefer to stay indoors and have the least number of contacts,” Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association, Ghaziabad, said. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-health-dept-to-widen-net-trace-more-contacts-of-positive-patients/story-XrrbHcTd4bOf7A37iRwElK.html

Kejriwal said the Delhi government would do whatever it can to support the education of Kumar’s children. He died at Dwarka’s Venkateshwar Hospital on July 13, at the age of 48.Kumar contacted the disease in the course of his duty, while providing food to people during the lockdown.“Arun Kumar ji did an excellent job during the whole Corona lockdown period. He worked in almost all the departments, whether in hospitals, distributing food, or anything else. Our civil defence volunteers have worked hard day and night. Arun ji was one such volunteer who, in the course of his duty, contacted corona and unfortunately lost his life because of it. The people of Delhi salute the martyrdom and sacrifice of Arun Kumar ji,” Kejriwal told reporters after meeting with Kumar’s family in Uttam Nagar.Kejriwal met Kumar’s father, wife, and children. “His daughter is in class 12 and his son is in class 9.

25-07-2020||City||UP government reduces area of containment zones by more than half||The Uttar Pradesh government has redefined the area of containment zones by reducing the limits of such zones by more than half. The move will help a number of households and localities get away from the containment exercise in the coming days, officials said. As per the Friday order issued by RK Tiwari, UP chief secretary, areas within the 100 metre radius of a category-1 containment zone (one Covid-19 case) in city areas will be sealed now as compared to areas within a 250-meter radius. The boundary of category-2 containment zones (with multiple cases) have also been redefined and the earlier 500 metre range has been reduced to 200 metres. However, the limits of the buffer area for category-2 zones, which would stretch to 250 metres earlier, have not been redefined and the respective district officials can take a call on it based on their assessment, the order said. “In case of a single case in city areas, the category-1 containment zone will be within a 100 metre range or an entire mohalla, or whichever is less. In case of a cluster where more than one cases emerge, the category-2 containment zone will be up to a 200-metre range and the buffer area will be defined on local assessment,” the directions issued by the chief secretary said. The order would be applicable to new containment zones. “ We will comply with the new directions regarding the containment zones. We have strengthened the containment exercises and are ensuring that sealing and de-sealing as part of the exercise is done in a timely manner,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.In containment zones, movement of residents is restricted, and the local administration implements strict perimeter control, besides taking up extensive sanitisation drives and door-to-door surveys to detect suspected Covid-19 cases. Officials in Ghaziabad said that with the limits of the containment zones reduced, the number of households to be contained in the coming days will be reduced by half. “With the revised guidelines, now about only 50% of households that could be put under a containment zone earlier will be put off bounds now,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.According to a list issued by the district administration on July 19, the district has 162 category-1 zones and 168 category-2 zones. “As per our estimates, there are about 200,989 houses with a population of about 78,1344 people which are under containment zones in Ghaziabad right now,” the CMO said.The neighbouring Gautam Budh Nagar district has 320 category-1 zones and 41 category-2 zones ( as on July 24).Residents in Ghaziabad have welcomed the state government’s new order. “The government has done the right thing. Large area under sealing created fear among residents and also hampered their movement. It also brought resentment against the Covid-19 patients. The reduction in the sealed area limits will also reduce fear among people and will not hamper their daily lives,” said Colonel (retired) TP Tyagi, president of flat owners’ federation.There is no revision in directions issued for high-rises. “The previous guidelines for sealing of floor in high-rises with Covid-19 cases will continue as it is,” the CMO said. Earlier on June 14, the UP government had issued revised guidelines according to which high-rise buildings/towers will be sealed only for 14 days as against 21 days earlier. The directions were issued after residents had approached the officials about the inconvenience they faced. In last week of June, the state officials had also directed the district officials for sealing the floor in a high-rises in case a someone on the floor tested positive for the infection. Prior to this, the entire tower was sealed. “ I have also directed officials to ensure that the list of the containment zones gets timely updated so that people do not face issues,” the DM said. “We are also taking up strict containment exercise in 21 different areas which have 10 or more cases,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-government-reduces-area-of-containment-zones-by-more-than-half/story-ZwypO0KFIKiOOwuNy952fP.html
25-07-2020||City||State’s first plasma bank inaugurated at Noida||Noida: Uttar Pradesh on Saturday got its first plasma bank at the Rotary Noida Blood Bank in Sector 31 for treatment of Covid-19 patients in the city.The plasma bank that has a storage capacity of 10,000 units of 200 ml each also received its first three units of plasma donated by the Rotary club members who had successfully recovered from Covid-19 and qualified to donate the convalescent plasma.“The bank will be a part of Rotary Noida Blood Bank. We will now start reaching out to the recovered patients and will motivate them to donate the plasma. The contacts of such patients will be procured from the different hospitals of Noida. Once we have a proper stock of convalescent plasma, this bank will cater to demands of the city and neighbouring areas. In Gautam Budh Nagar, four private and two government hospitals have the infrastructure to treat Covid-19 patients through plasma therapy,” said Trilok Sharma, founder trustee, Rotary Noida Blood Bank.The bank was inaugurated by UP’s minister of state (health) Atul Garg, along with GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY. Other senior officials were also present on the occasion. One of the most affected districts of the state, GB Nagar had 897 active Covid-19 cases as of Saturday, while 3,700 had been discharged post-treatment and 40 patients succumbed to the infection. Appreciating the initiative, officials said that experts from government hospitals or institutes with good experience of plasma therapy will also be sent to extend their expertise and supervise the new plasma bank.“It is the first dedicated bank in the entire state. The plasma therapy is already going on at GIMS Greater Noida and Child PGI. At GIMS, doctors have done many procedures successfully, but it doesn’t have a plasma bank. We will also be sending GIMS officials to supervise the plasma bank and extend their expertise,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, GB Nagar.Suhas further said that this is the first plasma bank in a non-Covid hospital, where a person can walk in with a proper prescription by a Covid-19 hospital and acquire plasma for treatment of their family members. Authorities at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), which has already performed 78 plasma therapies, said that they are self-reliant.“We are already maintaining our own stockpile of convalescent plasma and also helping other hospitals in Noida, Faridabad and Gurugram, among others. We are self-dependent and don’t think would require help from a plasma bank or any external source to obtain convalescent plasma,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, director, GIMS.Plasma is a major component of a person’s blood, making up almost 55% of it. In convalescent plasma therapy, antibody-rich plasma from recovered patients is injected into recovering individuals to help them stave off infection. Although promising, the effectiveness of the treatment is still in the experimental stage and is allowed to be administered only in severely ill patients.Notably, the plasma therapy has been previously used during the Sars and Mers outbreaks (which were also caused by viruses in the same family as the Sars-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/state-s-first-plasma-bank-inaugurated-at-noida/story-Peu7mtFRTB4tRs1A3uoksO.html
25-07-2020||City||Sisodia reviews online classes, seek suggestions for improvement||New Delhi: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday visited two government schools and interacted with teachers and parents to review the “semi-online” teaching-learning model initiated by the government. On July 2, the government had asked its teachers to focus on student-teacher interaction while carrying out learning activities during Covid-19 pandemic. The education department had also issued a series of instructions for teachers and principals asking them to stay connected to students through WhatsApp. Children up to classes 10 are given worksheets every week through WhatsApp. Those children who do not have smartphones at home can ask their parents to collect printout of the weekly worksheets from their respective schools. Class 12 students are attending live online classes conducted by teachers in 12 subjects. On Saturday, Sisodia interacted with teachers and parents and sought suggestions to improve online education at two government schools in Prashant Vihar and Pitampura. “The whole world is in crisis. But our students are facing the biggest crisis. We cannot sit and wait for everything to settle on its own. We had to find some measures to keep the learning process going and we found it,” Sisodia said. While interacting with parents, Sisodia said that parent-teacher meetings too should be organized at regular intervals using online method. “This is the first time in the country that online education has been done in government schools at such a scale,” Sisodia said. He also congratulated parents for supporting their children’s education by turning their homes into schools. “Soon there will be a vaccine to cure Corona, but there is no vaccine for the loss of education. Therefore, we have to reduce our other expenses so that we continue with our children’s education. If there is a loss in education, it will not only be the loss of that child or family, but it will be a loss for the entire country,” Sisodia said. The education minister said that teachers were trying to provide education through social media platforms like Facebook to engage students in educational content instead of other things. “We did not think that we too would provide education through social media. But today, under compulsion, we launched this experiment which has reduced the educational loss significantly,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sisodia-reviews-online-classes-seek-suggestions-for-improvement/story-RYFM9BXp8u0DfC9AtWmD0O.html
25-07-2020||City||Noida cops accused of harassing Delhi Police head constable||Two police personnel from the Dankaur station have been accused of harassing and manhandling a Delhi Police head constable.The Noida police has denied the allegations.The complainant, Firoz Ahmed, a resident of Ghaziabad, said the incident took place around midnight on July 23 when he was on his way home from Jewar.“I had two goats with me for Bakrid and I was going home via the Eastern Peripheral Expressway. All of a sudden, a grey Maruti Brezza intercepted my vehicle and I was asked to stop. Two people in police uniform, a sub-inspector and a constable, got out and started checking my vehicle. They asked me about the animals and I explained that it was for Eid and that I was taking them to Muradnagar,” said Ahmed in his complaint to the Noida commissioner of police.He said that the Noida personnel became agitated and started abusing him. “They said I was in the illegal animal smuggling business. I told them that I was a head constable with the Delhi Police. I started to show them my identity card but they took my wallet from me and punched me. When I objected, they started manhandling me. I then called my brother, who is a lawyer. I have the necessary recording in my phone to prove the assault and harassment,” the complainant said.Ahmed said the personnel told him that they were from Kasna police station and took his wallet containing his police ID, other documents, ATM cards, and ₹15,000 cash with them and asked him to collect it from the police station. “My brother and I went to Kasna police station and we found out that the personnel in question were not attached to that station and the incident with me had taken place under the jurisdiction of Dankaur police station. But we were not provided any help by that station personnel either,” Ahmed said.He filed a complaint with the Noida police commissioner on Friday. However, police have denied the allegations.“He was stopped during routine checking and was found not wearing a seat belt, for which he was fined. During a probe by the inspector, there was an argument and but there was no manhandling,” additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 3, Vishal Pandey said.He said they are yet to verify Ahmed’s claim that he was from the Delhi Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-cops-accused-of-harassing-delhi-police-head-constable/story-noTi4nYOe6fsrMA761q0gM.html
25-07-2020||Delhi||CRPF sub-inspector shoots dead senior before killing self at MHA office||A sub-inspector of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) allegedly shot dead his senior on Friday night, before turning the gun on himself at an office of the ministry of home affairs (MHA) in Lodhi Estate. Police said the two men, who belonged to CRPF’s 122 Battalion and were posted at the bungalow, had an argument after which the sub-inspector used his AK-47 rifle to shoot the inspector dead and then kill himself. Preliminary investigation has revealed that the two shared the same office room inside the bungalow. Police said the incident took place around 10pm. Other staffers heard a gunshot and rushed to the room, to find the inspector shot in the head.“Witnesses said the inspector was having his dinner when he was shot. Less than a minute later, another gunshot was heard, this time from the guard room near the main entrance to the premises. The staffers rushed there to find the sub-inspector lying dead with a gunshot wound to his head. The matter was immediately reported to senior CRPF officers,” said a senior police officer, who wished not to be named.Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal said the AK-47 rifle used in the shooting was issued to the sub-inspector.“Preliminary probe suggests that two bullets were fired from that rifle. The SI and the inspector shared the same room and were involved in a fight over something; we are yet to ascertain what. We have registered a case of murder and are probing the matter,” Singhal said.Following the incident, a team of forensic experts visited the spot and lifted evidence for examination. M Dhinakaran, spokesperson, CRPF, said the duo was posted with the 122 Battalion. ”The fratricidal event is an aberration which seems to have been committed on the spur of the moment. An inquiry has been ordered to establish the facts of the matter and will be taken to its logical end,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/crpf-sub-inspector-shoots-dead-senior-before-killing-self-at-mha-office/story-fdSNsKKJOYZzwGamioIakJ.html
25-07-2020||City||Panjab University youth fest cancelled this year amid surging Covid cases||The highly anticipated Panjab University Youth and Heritage festival will not be conducted this year amid surging Covid-19 cases. The four-day event features various cultural and academic competitions which are held in 12 zones of PU, following which winners participate in the inter-zonal youth festival. PU youth welfare director Nirmal Jaura, said, “Due to the rising number of coronavirus cases, it is not possible to organise the youth festival this time. Maintaining social distance is important right now and there is a gathering of more than 3,000 people at the festival.”“I am receiving a lot of calls from teachers, principals and students to know the dates for the festival. I have told them it is not possible to organise the event in colleges this year. If the situation improves in the next few months, we can organise small events with 50 students,” Jaura said.“To keep students engaged during these tough times, we have conducted many online competitions including essay, story writing, debate competitions, poster making, cartooning and solo song and dance,” he added.To conduct the youth festival, a meeting is conducted with college principals in July every year so that dates and host college to hold the event can be selected. Students and teachers also start preparing for competitions and more time was devoted to practice sessions. The teachers who are involved in preparing students for various items for the youth festival stated that it is very disappointing for the talented students that the event will not be organised. Inderjeet Kaur, principal of Ramgarhia Girls College, Miller Ganj, said, “Online competitions conducted by the youth welfare department has been a hit among students and participation in each competition was more than expected. Amid the pandemic, colleges are closed and students are stressed, but online competitions keep them occupied. Usually, by this time of the year, a meeting is held with all principals to decide the venue and dates for the youth festival. But this year, nothing has been discussed regarding the festival, and keeping in mind the situation, I think authorities will continue with online competitions.” COMPETITIONS HELD DURING FESTCompetitions in different categories include group shabad, bhajans, classical music (vocal), classical dance, group dance, debate, hand writing, poem writing, short story writing, essay writing and rangoli .Also, competitions are held in phulkari, bagh, dasuti or cross stitch, knitting, crochet work, pakhi designing, mehndi designing, bhangra, quiz , Gidha, skit, mimicry, miming, poem recitation and one-act play.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panjab-university-youth-fest-cancelled-this-year-amid-surging-covid-cases/story-1yBAhX0YQz7bU31YGRzCjL.html

More will follow, if oil companies and the state government do not listen to us,” said Manjit Singh, general secretary, PPDAP He added that of 3,451 outlets in Punjab, 800 border district outlets were on the verge of closure due to higher VAT rates in the state, which resulted in shift of trade and smuggling. “Due to the lockdown, losses in March, April, May have eaten into our capital. Nearly every dealer is on the verge of bankruptcy,” added Ranjit Singh Gandhi, treasurer, PPDAP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-dealers-call-for-petrol-pump-bandh-on-july-29/story-fvE1hBHK7GxL5dRtENhX9I.html
25-07-2020||Gurugram||Teachers work hard to deliver online classes in tough conditions||For the last four months, Manju Bala Bhardwaj, an English teacher at a government school, has been teaching her classes online. From 8 am till 5 pm, Bhardwaj stays glued to her phone as she juggles students’ queries on WhatsApp and calls while giving out notes and assignments. Once she is done with classes for the day, the 44-year-old starts preparing and recording video lessons for the next day. With a black marker in her hands, she stands before a whiteboard and delivers the lesson to an imaginary audience while her son, a college-going student, films her on a mobile phone. “There is hardly any time left after classes to focus on other things. The cycle of planning, preparing, recording, along with daily classes and feedback calls to parents is taxing,” said Bhardwaj. While video lessons are not a compulsion for government schools, Bhardwaj decided to test the waters after reading about private schools that were quick to adopt online lessons in the wake of the nationwide lockdown that was imposed in March to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease. “Many students in government schools like ours are not familiar with spoken English. I felt that recording lessons would help in comprehension,” said Bhardwaj, who had to get her phone repaired after it crashed under the load of the videos within the first week. Over the past few months, Bhardwaj has also learned the tricks of the trade from her sons. “I don’t have a tripod or stand. With their classes too going on, even my sons are not available at all times. I made notes of how to do it myself so that I am prepared for such days. Despite all this, it is still daunting,” she said. Adding to the technological challenges are the online abuses and uncharitable remarks from students and parents, and distractions. Deepika Chauhan, a private school teacher, said, “A greater part of the class goes in asking children to mute or unmute the mic or not use the chatbox. There is a lot of disruption. They keep sending emoticons in the chatbox and texts unrelated to the class. Sometimes when we ask children to shut the mic, some overprotective parents get hurt and write emails complaining about us.” She recalled an instance where a class 4 student used an expletive against a teacher using the chatbox. “The teacher was shell shocked. When she took up the issue with the parents, they were apologetic but insisted that the child’s account had been hacked,” said Chauhan. With many parents refusing or unable to pay fees, salary cuts have demoralised teachers too. “In addition, the school has asked us to report for work if we want to receive full salary,” said Chauhan. Deepali, a music teacher, said that while teachers were putting double the amount of work to make online classes work, parents and school educators felt that these classes “were not good enough”. “I had never imagined that I’d be teaching Indian classical music through a laptop screen,” she said. “Pulling off these classes has been a Herculean task. Schools and parents, however, don’t recognise our effort. We are all exhausted but holding on to our jobs is the priority right now. Moreover, I have also learned many new things courtesy the shift in teaching methods.” School principals said that coronavirus had caused a big change in transmission of lessons and coping with the effects of the shift was hard to digest for all stakeholders, including teachers. Anshu Arora, principal, Amity International School, Sector 43, said that it was important to recognise that teachers belonged to a wide spectrum, and carrying on with the show individually was challenging. “While younger teachers are adept in using the interfaces, not all teachers are familiar with the technology. A lot of hand-holding was needed. Teachers need to be supported by schools,” said Arora. She said the school was providing support by having additional co-teachers in every class. Manoj Kaushik, coordinator, program education technology, SCERT Haryana, said that the department was aware of the technological constraints and had responded. “We brought teachers together on a WhatsApp group and shared explainer videos about basics of recording lectures and delivering live lectures as and when the need arose,” said Kaushik. “Not everything can be taught through training. Sometimes, there are many things that one learns through experiences.”Aditi Misra, principal, Delhi Public School, Sector 45, said that the school had been engaging with the CBSE and NCERT regarding possible ways of addressing the digital divide that government school students and teachers were facing. “Digital divide is worrying and needs to be addressed at some level. We have shared necessary teaching resources with two government schools that we have adopted,” said Misra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/teachers-work-hard-to-deliver-online-classes-in-tough-conditions/story-NOoFDYyy9fk9GPp4LyIk8O.html
25-07-2020||Gurugram||Faridabad: Five foreign nationals among seven arrested for duping people online||The Faridabad police on Saturday arrested seven persons, including five foreign nationals, for allegedly duping people after befriending them on a social networking site. The suspects would befriend people on Facebook and then convince them to transfer money on the pretext of sending them high-value gifts and foreign currency, said the police. The police said they believe that with the arrests they have solved more than 100 such fraud cases. According to the police, they received a complaint from a local resident on July 23 alleging that he has been duped of Rs 35,500. The Faridabad police commissioner, OP Singh, said that since he took charge he has taken up pending cases and have involved the cyber crime cell. “The gang members created fake social media profiles and befriended people by posing as women. They would tell the victims that they were sending a precious gift as a token of friendship or would propose them for marriage and stage drama that they are stuck at airport and make calls posing as customs officers and duped people on pretext of releasing gifts. They used to ask victims to pay custom duty and processing fees,” he said. The suspects were identified as Williams Michael of Liberia, Promise Ebere Okoli, Halimat Mohammed, Okeke Nnabugo and Kenechukwi Okanta, all four from Nigeria. Besides, two persons from Ballabhgarh -- Anurag Singh and Nishant -- were also arrested.All the suspects were arrested from a rented house in Faridabad and were taken on four days’ police remand on Saturday after being produced before the court, said the police. The police said during questioning they revealed that they used to make fake profiles and contact people across the country. Singh said Halimat Mohammed, a woman, posing as a London resident expressed her intention to marry the complainant and cheated him with the help of her aides, who posed as a customs official and a finance manager of Reserve Bank of India (RBI). After an investigation by the cyber cell, the police registered an FIR in the matter on July 23 at Faridabad police station. After chatting online and exchanging phone numbers, the woman suspect told him that she wanted to marry him and they decided to meet in July and sent some gifts through customs. The suspect told him that she was coming to India in July. “In July, he received a call from a man who introduced himself as a customs officer at Mumbai airport. He told the complainant that he was required to pay fees as custom clearance for the woman, following which the victim transferred Rs 35,500 in two transactions to two different bank accounts,” Singh said. After two days, the victim allegedly again received a call from someone posing as an RBI official and asked him to deposit more money. The police said the victim did not buy the story and reported the matter to the police. “Our cyber police team immediately set the numbers on surveillance and their locations were traced following which they were arrested from a house,” said Singh. Hailmat’s passport had expired, the police said, adding that the four others were holding passports of two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/faridabad-five-foreign-nationals-among-seven-arrested-for-duping-people-online/story-bTVAbF81jR8V59ldkevtbL.html

Ravi used to take a painting class, which is when he came in contact with Chautala in 2018.“Ravi initially started helping Chautala to crack deals with inmates who wanted to buy mobile phones and drugs. He became the middleman and started taking orders from inmates and later delivered mobile phones and drugs to them with the consent of Chautala. ,” he said.Another police officer privy to the investigation said that phones were being made available to the inmates for as much as ₹50,000.Harinder Singh, jail superintendent of Bhondsi jail, said they have started conducting regular checks in the barracks, and on Saturday recovered four mobile phones from inmates. “Strict warnings were given to all the officials to ensure no illegal activity inside the premises,” he said.Malik said they have identified the dealers who used to supply the contraband. “We have formed teams and identified their hideouts in Gurugram. We are close to them and would arrest them at the earliest,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/bhondsi-jail-officer-sold-phones-to-inmates-for-50k-finds-probe/story-NOCc8moER5ie4pRkDKpjrL.html
25-07-2020||Gurugram||HSPCB to retest Bandhwari leachate samples after concerns arise over new test results||The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) will conduct a second laboratory test to gauge the “safety” of leachate at the Bandhwari landfill, about 20kms from Gurugram, after several experts and activists found holes in the first test report. Following complaints from city resident Vaishali Rana Chandra, an activist who has been tracking developments at the landfill, the HSPCB on July 13 inspected the landfill and collected three samples from a leachate pond for chemical analysis. The report, which Hindustan Times reviewed, found no presence of heavy metals in the water. It also stated that the samples’ pH levels (that measures acidity) , and biological oxygen demand (measure of oxygen consumed by microorganisms as they decompose organic waste), were within the limits prescribed by the central pollution control board’s solid waste management rules.Dr Rekha Singh, an approved environment expert from the Quality Council of India under the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, said, “The results seem highly unlikely for a leachate sample taken from a landfill. Going by the report, which shows desirable acidity and oxygen demand, the water may even be fit for drinking. This definitely raises some questions as to the integrity of the report, as most samples taken from the field -- even in natural water bodies -- show higher pH levels and presence of contaminants.” In 2015, as part of an independent assessment by local environmentalists, Singh had analysed leachate samples from the landfill. Her report stated that contamination from the leachate has rendered high amounts of fluoride, phenolic compounds, cadmium and mercury in the groundwater.On July 9, HT had reported that residents of Bandhwari and Mangar villages near the landfill had complained of large amounts of leachate run-off after rain over the previous two days. The “leachate problem” at Bandhwari is alleged to have caused severe degradation of the water table in the region and posed a risk to the health of local residents. The issue of landfill run-off in the area has persisted for close to a decade, and routinely worsens during the monsoon, experts and local activists said.Dr Vinod Kumar Mogha, an independent expert with over a decade long experience in material sciences and laboratory testing, said the report does not, as per national accreditation board for testing and calibration laboratories (NABL) guidelines, provide any confirmatory statements about the quality of the water. “Why was the test carried out? What was the HSPCB trying to establish? Any lab test is done with a certain aim, and reports must mandatorily summarise their findings. This report does not explain the import of the test results, as it should have,” he said.Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, HSPCB, said, “We have taken note of the concerns raised. We will carry out another test by taking samples in the presence of locals, and will send them to two or three different labs for analysis before comparing reports. We will take further action based on the results.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hspcb-to-retest-bandhwari-leachate-samples-after-concerns-arise-over-new-test-results/story-ThENYnZK6c5ylcLU1IfTWI.html

Earlier, such webinars have been held for Pathankot and Hoshiarpur districts. A large number of teaching and non-teaching employees of the district shared their grievances directly with the education secretary.“The idea behind the webinars is to ensure positive reciprocation to the hopes and aspirations of the teachers, who have been doing really commendable job in taking online classes, enhancing enrollment, distributing textbooks, mid-day meal, taking bimonthly house examination, as well as performing various duties during the unprecedented pandemic,” said Kumar while directing the DEOs and BPEOs to ensure transparent and hassle-free delivery of the utility services to the teachers.More than 80 grievances were raised by the teaching and non-teaching staff during the webinar. The issues as well as grievances would also be taken up in the meeting of the concerned officials on Monday, said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ensure-hassle-free-delivery-of-utility-services-to-teachers-education-secretary-tells-deos/story-fGYA8EUHfZwEpJzVGfbbFJ.html
25-07-2020||Gurugram||City to have muted Independence Day celebration due to Covid 19||Following instructions from the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) on celebrating Independence Day, Gurugram will see muted celebrations with social distancing norms and honouring those in the front line of the fight against Covid-19. In a detailed advisory issued to all the states and union territories, the MHA had asked all states to use technology in the best possible manner for the celebrations and avoid large gatherings. The Gurugram district administration on Friday said that they will follow the directions, which included fewer guests, social distancing and wearing of masks. Gurugram deputy commissioner Amit Khatri, while addressing a press conference on Friday, said, “We have received directions from the home ministry in this regard and these will be followed strictly. All events will be planned in manner that social distancing norms are observed.”Officials, however, said the Independence Day event would include the ceremonial parade and speech by the chief guest and unfurling of the national flag followed by playing of the national anthem. It would also include presentation of the Guard of honour. But unlike previous years, social and cultural events such as dances by school children and march pasts would be missing, said officials.Elaborating on the details, a district administration spokesperson said that events by school children which were held in large numbers on this day earlier would be avoided this year due to spread of Covid 19. The focus, he said, would be on holding events such as tree plantation, debates at school level on digital platforms, online quiz contests/patriotic essay writing and poetry competitions and other such measures, which can be held practising social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-to-have-muted-independence-day-celebration-due-to-covid-19/story-D5qyrGDmya37t7E1dESQlL.html
25-07-2020||City||Covid crisis: Malls, parks under MCG scanner for safety violations||Gurugram After receiving complaints of coronavirus related safety violations in city malls and parks, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has directed its sanitation and enforcement wing to conduct surprise inspections at such locations.The development comes a week after MCG received a complaint from shopkeepers that the management of a shopping mall in Palam Vihar was not following any safety guidelines. Some residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) have been regularly complaining to the civic body to take action or empower them to do so against residents who are constantly violating safety norms in parks.After a gap of almost three months amid the coronavirus pandemic, malls and parks were allowed to reopen in the city on July 1.“We have initiated full-scale action against any violation in malls and parks. On Friday, for example, nine people at the bio-diversity park were fined for not wearing masks. Teams have been formed for this task. These are locations where people congregate, so any safety violations can lead to the Covid-19 spread,” said Hariom Attri, joint commissioner, MCG.Attri further said that he, along with his team, visited several malls, including one on Saturday, to check for violations.“The footfall in most of malls is virtually non-existent, hence there is little scope to fine people for violations. At some of the malls, we observed that the security guards weren’t wearing the masks properly or did not have the right type of masks. We sensitised them about the issue and gave them proper masks to wear,” said Attri.There are around 45 shopping malls in the city.Aman Bajaj, member of MGF metropolitan mall association, said, “During the first week of reopening, MCG had fined six people, including two shopkeepers, for violations. Since then, all shopkeepers have been strictly adhering to the rules. We believe that stricter enforcement by MCG will help curb safety violations, if any, across all malls in the city.”RWAs said that they have been apprising MCG about residents not wearing masks, especially while walking or jogging in parks, and asked the civic body if they could take action on their end in this regard.“Although there were several instances of violations by residents in parks, without any authorised powers we couldn’t take any action against the violators except sensitizing them about the adverse effects. With MCG taking full-scale action, we are quite assured that it will deter people from stepping out without masks and limit the possible spread of coronavirus,” said Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson, Qutub Enclave RWA.There are 793 parks in the city. MCG maintains 310 parks, while RWAs have the responsibility of overseeing 483 parks.The Haryana government has released a set of standard operating procedure (SOP) for visitors in malls and parks. The guidelines include: visitors and all mall workers need to strictly follow social distancing norms and wear masks at all times; visitors also need to install the Aarogya Setu app; mall authorities will have to ensure that every visitor is scanned for temperature via thermal scanners as well as to ensure that hand sanitizers are placed at all entry points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-crisis-malls-parks-under-mcg-scanner-for-safety-violations/story-VgNQpEM8fPgiLhJqsJnuQK.html
25-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Neuro issues in Covid patients worry doctors||Almost a month ago, a 28-year-old man, a resident of South City 1 was admitted in a multispecialty hospital of the city after he suffered seizures and fell unconscious. Although asymptomatic, he tested positive for Covid-19. “Out of the 200 Covid-19 patients treated so far, over 10 people developed neurological symptoms out of which four did not show the (most common) onset of Covid-19 like symptoms like breathlessness,” said Dr. Praveen Gupta, director, neurology, Fortis Memorial Research Institute (FMRI), Gurugram. “They report of unconsciousness and weakness due to brain inflammation or encephalitis. A couple of them even presented stroke and seizures too.”Despite the cases of neurological symptoms, respiratory distress remains the defining symptoms of Covid-19, along with loss of sense of taste and smell. When the 28-year-old reached the emergency of Fortis in a comatose state, he tested positive for Covid-19 twice. “The patient underwent MRI scan of his brain which came normal. His seizures stopped and after a day he regained consciousness. He was on ventilator for three days,” said Dr Gupta. “The patient developed a fever, had decreased oxygenation levels and a cough which persisted for a week. His sputum had blood.” The patient was treated for his symptoms and discharged after he recovered and his Covid-19 confirmatory test returned negative. A review of over 50 studies published in the journal Annals of Neurology last month revealed that the virus affects almost every level of the nervous system and may lead to strokes, seizures and muscular pains. However, the number of cases in India that presented neurological symptoms first were still far too few.According to Dr. Gupta, the coronavirus can reach the brain through nasal passage and creates neurochemical imbalance. “The virus can bind with receptors in brain and blood vessels, and reach the central nervous system, causing inflammation and neurochemical imbalance, and ultimately leading to seizures,” he said.Doctors explain that one of the pathological explanation for this is the formation of clots in blood vessels. Dr. Yatin Mehta, chairman, critical care, Medanta Hospital, said, “The virus creates clots in different parts of the body, which, when it reaches the brain, can cause strokes and seizures.”Mehta has treated Covid-19 patients who had symptoms like altered consciousness or mild paralysis. “We have seen neurological disorders in nearly 5% of the patients admitted in our hospital. They are mostly elderly and have to be kept on ventilator support. Fatality is also being reported due to stroke,” said Mehta. Dr Gupta said that at least two Covid-19 patients in their hospital died of brain stroke. “There can be post viral immune mediated phenomena like ADEM (Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis – it is a rare inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system,” said Gupta. According to them, loss of taste and smell are initial symptoms.Doctors said that patients with neurological symptoms sometimes recover in 15 days, while it is only rare cases treatment stretches up to a month and even death. Therefore, they suggest being cautious if there are signs of weakness and mild sensations in hands. On June 14, while reviewing the study in the Annals of Neurology, Dr. Rajinder K Dhamija, head of the neurology department at the Lady Hardinge Medical College & Hospital in Delhi, had said, “There is literature to show that Covid-19 is beyond cough and fever. We should proactively probe the history of the patient.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-neuro-issues-in-covid-patients-worry-doctors/story-rRG9asQ6qnMxZkMejFiPOJ.html
25-07-2020||City||Source of infection still a mystery in Ludhiana’s 210 Covid-19 cases||Amid spike in Covid-19 cases, a major threat looms over the district as Ludhiana health department has been unable to trace the source of 210 infections.The total number of cases reported in the district till Friday stands at 2,275 and contact tracing for the remaining patients was still being done. The officials of the health department said that in many cases, the patients do not disclose their contacts citing social stigma among other reasons.On the condition of anonymity, a health official said, “There have been instances where the infected patients do not disclose their travel history. Few political workers have also tested positive for coronavirus who claimed that they might have got infected during public dealing. The department was also not able to trace the source of infection of ACP Anil Kohli, who succumbed to the virus, and whose contacts had also tested positive afterwards.”“We have been spreading awareness among people to disclose necessary information regarding their travel history and contacts, as failing to do so will put lives in danger. However, some patients were adamant in disclosing information citing social stigma and to avoid hospitalisation of their relatives,” said the official.Ludhiana civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said, “Many people are not cooperating with the health department as they are not disclosing their contact history even after testing positive for Covid-19. The teams of the health department are regularly visiting the affected areas especially the micro-containment zones to motivate residents to disclose necessary information to thwart the spread of the virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-health-officials-struggle-to-trace-source-of-infection-in-210-covid-19-patients/story-7sYCKbnZwaGdmI4R8D0gEN.html
25-07-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Our Take: Let’s give a shout out to creative expression||Years ago, an anthropomorphic yellow Volkswagen Beetle named Herbie captured popular imagination in a Walt Disney film, The Love Bug. It drove itself and had a number of adventures, managing at times with a deft turn of a steering wheel, to win automobile races too.Why we are referring to Herbie in this column is because a brightly coloured vehicle has been in the news in the city for the last few weeks. It features, very prominently, art work by a Mexican artist, Senkoe, or so its owner, Chandigarh resident and high court lawyer Ranjit Malhotra, claims.Malhotra bought the Ambassador Grand Harit-C-1800 from a European Union diplomat in Delhi in July last year. However, much to his chagrin, the registering authority in Chandigarh refused to register the vehicle stating that the colour of the original vehicle had been changed from white to multi-colour, in violation of norms.Following this, Malhotra moved the Punjab and Haryana high court, pleading that the reason for buying the vehicle was the artwork by Senkoe.Famed for his freestyle art, Senkoe is much loved by Dilliwallahs for the number of vibrant murals he has created in the Capital during visits to India, especially at Lodhi Colony and Jamia Millia Islamia.On July 15, the high court’s single-judge bench of justice Jaishree Thakur directed UT administration to register the car within two weeks. Now, the UT says allowing registration would lead to a potential law enforcement problem as in common practice a motor vehicle is identified by its registration number and colour by the authorities. The colour takes precedence as it is the most recognisable/distinguishable feature of a vehicle for its prima facie identification by authorities, UT states in its plea. The administration’s argument is that the single-judge bench misinterpreted Section 52 of the Motor Vehicles Act. According to Section 52, no owner of a motor vehicle can alter it beyond the particulars mentioned in the certificate of registration, which are provided by the manufacturer. This seems to be leading to an interesting tug of war between the administrative authorities and a lawyer with an artistic eye. Agreed, a car is recognised by its colour, but if this piece of art is registered, not just traffic authorities, even locals will be more than happy to spot it on the roads. The administration should also doff its hat to creativity, especially in a city like Chandigarh, which has been a drawing board of sorts for Le Corbusier.Art cars are not new and have an enthusiastic fan following, especially in the US, where the likes of artist and film director Andy Warhol, known for his pop art, have designed famous BMW vehicles with art.Rules need to be relaxed in special cases when in a changing world order, with a pandemic spreading gloom and anxiety, people are looking for release – which a piece of art can definitely provide.Let there be a splash of colour on our roads, a play on Corbusier’s legacy, where normalcy is not the norm and art always has a place in the people’s hearts.ART MATTERSWhy shouldn’t cars with artwork be registered? Why should vehicles with artwork not be registered in UT? What else should the administration do to promote art in Chandigarh? Send your responses with a photograph to Chandigarh@hindustantimes by July 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ht-chandigarh-our-take-let-s-give-a-shout-out-to-creative-expression/story-pn6EV65kpGB7unUZOZIK4J.html

Civil Lines SHO Sukhwinder Singh said the matrimonial dispute between the couple had turned into an ugly spat, necessitating their intervention. “A video surfaced on social media platforms, following which we intervened.” A case has been registered under Sections 342 (wrongful confinement), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sad-s-malwa-muslim-wing-chief-booked-for-domestic-violence/story-hmjXRBkrbmiRd2JMzNtLvO.html
25-07-2020||Chandigarh||Even in times of gloom, every cloud has a silver lining||We were at the tenth green playing golf when my partner coughed and the other three in the four ball gave him a look as hostile as the one reserved for a crime convict.The poor man sheepishly remarked, “Sorry guys, I was just clearing my throat.”Such is the transformation in people’s behaviour, thanks to coronavirus.It is indeed heartening to see a steep fall in sneezing, coughing, spitting or cuddling and cooing at public places. Masked people who heretofore would have been viewed with suspicion now invite loving looks.Everyone is making an effort to maintain hygiene, improve immunity, eat healthy and avoid meaningless jaunts. Extravagance at weddings and celebrations is a thing of past. With due concern for dwindling businesses, the realisation that not being ostentatious and focusing on essentials is important will definitely level things out I was commanding my regiment when we got mobilised after a terrorist attack on our Parliament. War with Pakistan seemed imminent. We were equipped with partly indigenously manufactured and assembled Russian made tanks. The originals were a class apart and still form the backbone of our mechanised forces. This indigenous version, however, had major issues. My predecessor handed over a fat bundle of files and three dozen power point presentations to all and sundry during his two years of agonising command. I realised in the first few days that though everyone was seized of the issue, it was a case of misplaced priority mired in red tape. Such was the repetitive content of the presentations that any discussion with the powers that be was considered tedious, in fact irritating. The looming war clouds prompted me to vigorously revive the matter.The feedback I got was that strong wordings and brazen statistics of my war fit machinery had raised hackles at the decision-making level. Someone even remarked, “Why is this commanding officer (CO) belly belching?”With only 31 out 45 tanks fit for action, it seemed as if the matter was only the CO’s headache.My immediate commander called me and expressed concern at my getting down to brass tacks, but said under his breath: “Well done, it’s now or never!”It was on January 14, 2002, a day after General Pervez Musharraf’s address to Pakistan that three truckloads men with a battery of technicians from the tank manufacturing facility reached the forlorn dunes of Longewala near Jaisalmer. Within days the tank fleet of our regiment was a roaring 100%.Our three year old grandson doesn’t fail to surprise us with his innocent wit. His desire to own a puppy wasn’t welcomed enthusiastically by us. “ Grow up a bit, children your age are susceptible to infections from animals at home”.Just the other day, out on a short drive with us, he saw a masked master strolling with his pet and came up with: “Dadu, who spreads infections, the mask-less puppy or his master?”Silvo is the name of his newly acquired beagle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/even-in-times-of-gloom-every-cloud-has-a-silver-lining/story-1hK1iVe8dxwdQhQ7XI3XPO.html

25-07-2020||City||Wildbuzz: In the heart’s crevices bloom wild flowers||Deepak, a highlander of the Banjar valley in Kullu, is the proverbial wild flower in a perfect bed of roses. His email identity goes by the name of ‘DeepakRebel’ while his social media identity is ‘Deepak Atheist’. A rare man from the Himachal hills, he does not believe in God or the numerous Devis and Devtas that undergird the state’s cultural life. Nature is Deepak’s guiding light, his moral compass and the source of his spiritual well being. A pair of Himalayan bulbuls and a lone Laughing thrush would come to his hand in the winter snows to relish dry raisins. Such was the trust, the benign aura of the atheist that lured wary avians to a human hand.Deepak, all of 30 years, has an abiding passion: wild flowers of the lofty Himalayan glades. To know the depth of his love, his recent three-day trek to Jalori pass was revealing. He preserved his smartphone battery for only one use, to photograph flowers. Unlike his three trekking mates, who indulged in numerous selfies and group pictures, Deepak’s phone brimmed with flower photographs.“As we climbed to Jalori pass, which is above 10,000 feet, I was a laggard. My companions raced to the peaks but I would stop at a flower and take pictures. Then, I would shut down the phone to conserve battery life and forbid myself from taking more flower pictures. But as I climbed, another pretty flower would waylay me with her smiles. I would then again switch on my phone and take another picture. It went on and on till my battery charge expired,” Deepak told this writer.Deepak inherits his love for flowers from his father, a PWD employee who managed the resthouse at their native village of Bahu. “My father took great pains to cultivate a variety of flowers in the resthouse garden. In our house also, I have grown many flowers,’’ said Deepak.He shares his passion for Himalayan flowers with an innumerable number of Himalayan travellers and tourists through the ages. Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh’s late father, Maharajah Yadavindra Singh, was devoted to gardening and would travel to the Himalayas every spring to admire alpine blooms. Capt Amarinder is planning a book on his father’s passion for Himalayan flowers illustrated with delicate paintings by the late Rai Bahadur Ganga Singh. To all those like Deepak, Maharajah Yadavindra Singh and travellers of the Himalayas, a pithy verse from an anonymous bard would pay a timeless tribute: “The crevices in my heart, some shallow some deep, Grow wildflowers so beautiful, not weeds, The crevices in my heart are precious orifices to keep!” LIFE IS THE PITSOur diligent gardener of many years, Vinod K Yadav, has been efficient at digging serial compost pits and then filling them up in the backyard of our Sector 19 garden in Chandigarh. Our kitchen wet wastes, garden leftovers/wastes etc go into the pit while household dry wastes are put in the bin and picked up by waste collectors every morning. That simplifies the hard-working waste collector’s task, lends it dignity by obviating the need to physically segregate the wet from dry wastes, and renders the burden of his carriage less weighty.The garden benefits from enriched soils of maturing compost pits. Garden birds and insects have gained enormously as the festering, unclosed compost pits have fostered a magical, mini-ecosystem. The number and variety of insects the pits have spawned has been taken advantage of by insectivorous bird species, snapping lizards and butterflies/moths that feed on rotting fruits.Hovering and buzzing insects attract Black drongos, Tailor birds, Common mynas, Jungle babblers and even a migratory Black redstart. A female redstart in passage from the high Himalayas to further down in the sub-continental plains spent a day perched over the compost pit greedily devouring insects in October 2019. She was back for two days while returning to her breeding grounds up north in April 2020. However, the utmost advantage has been usurped by Tailor birds. A pair had set up a nest last summer in our front garden but the breeding failed. The pair then made another nest close to the pit in the backyard and successfully reared three chicks on a diet rich in insects. This summer, too, I was happy to see the pair rear another two chicks and the babblers a troupe of little ones.The flip side was that feral cats prowling around the garden noticed the abundance of birds in the pit’s vicinity. The cats would lay an ambush in the lemon and ‘motia’ bushes flanking the pit and pounce on unsuspecting birds till the avian community got wiser and set up an alarm system. Rodents, too, sniffed the decomposing foods in the pit and set up base here, drilling a maze of holes in Vinod’s carefully manicured vegetable beds.All told, the pit has been a blessing. The flowering plants dumped into the pit after the season was over just refused to pass gently into the night! A bunch of uprooted and dumped light-pink poppies woke up from the dead and started to bloom out of season at the edge of the pit while another bush of dumped sun flowers took root again on the pit’s other side. Certainly, more smiles than snarls has our pit attracted from all and sundry. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/wildbuzz-in-the-heart-s-crevices-bloom-wild-flowers/story-rUImGjfWz7LGv8z8I3j37K.html

25-07-2020||Chandigarh||Beware of SMS claiming to provide free covid relief package: Cyber Crime Cell||The Punjab Police State Cyber Crime Cell, on Saturday, warned the citizens not to click on any URL in messages being circulated via SMS or WhatsApp with claims of providing free covid relief package of Rs 2,000 from government.An official spokesperson of the Punjab Bureau of Investigation said that these phishing attacks are an attempt by cybercriminals to assume control of people’s devices and access their data and financial information, which could lead to draining of bank account.He said that the message being circulated on social media and via SMS reads: “The Government has finally approved and have started giving out free Rs 2,000 Relief Funds to each citizen. Below is how to claim and get yours credit instantly as I have just did now https://covid19-relieffund.com/. You can only claim and get credited once and it’s also limited so get your now instantly.”“Once anyone opens the page by clicking the URL, it shows a congratulatory message: ‘Get free Rs 7,000 instantly to your bank account. Please complete the survey to avail free lockdown relief funds’,” the spokesperson said.Along with the congratulatory message, there is a question asking if you are a bona fide Indian citizen? The link actually contains a questionnaire asking details such as: “How much can sustain you throughout their login? What will you use free Rs 7000 for?”After that people receive a congratulatory message of getting Rs 7,000 and a link for sharing the message to other groups and contacts.Police have urged people to remain cautious and not to click on any suspicious URL links on social media or SMS. “If anyone comes across such messages do not forward it to others and delete it immediately. Clicking on such links poses high risks as it can be a malware which could redirect you to fraudulent sites and may lead to financial losses,” police cautioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/beware-of-sms-claiming-to-provide-free-covid-relief-package-cyber-crime-cell/story-tguMmpST5bit9ua7Y4i36J.html

25-07-2020||Delhi||Tihar inmates with yoga knowledge train others inside barracks||With yoga trainers from outside the Tihar unable to visit the prison due to the coronavirus pandemic and inmate instructors either out on bail or parole, authorities have turned to prisoners aware of the exercise regime to train others within the barracks.Tihar, which has over 16,000 inmates across its various jails, had started Project Sanjeevan in association with Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga (MDNIY) in January 2019 to train inmates.“With the help of MDNIY, two sessions of yoga training were conducted last year. The first was from March-June when around 1,000 inmates were trained, including 46 who were trained as trainers.“The second batch was started from September 2019 to January 2020 when another 1,000 inmates were trained, including 31 as trainers,” a senior prison official said.The classes were conducted from Monday to Friday every week and around 15 trainers in both the programmes used to come from MDNIY for the yoga sessions.“Due to the ongoing situation, we could not start the programme this year. Once the situation gets normal, we will start it once again. This time, we would like to increase the numbers also,” said Director General (Prisons) Sandeep Goel.Since outsiders are not allowed and the 77 inmates, who were trained as trainers, have been released on bail or parole, the inmates who know yoga are teaching others inside the barracks, he said.This is not so structured but the jail authorities are trying to keep them in practice which would help them in the regular sessions whenever they are started, the DG said.“It is our endeavour to provide some skill to the inmates so that they can start a new life after being released. We do not want any inmate to come back again after they are released.“Yoga helps in mental and physical health. It can be used as a skill and those who get the certificate can opt it as a career and work as yoga teachers and make a living,” Goel said.Till July 23, 59 inmates tested positive for the novel coronavirus out of which 51 recovered, two died and one released and is currently home quarantined. There are five active cases. On the other hand, 120 prison staff members have been tested positive, out of which 91 recovered, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/tihar-inmates-with-yoga-knowledge-train-others-inside-barracks/story-jsmaO4twsC1UH5vXy2XTSO.html

Not even a single rakhi card has been sold and due to the pandemic as residents are preferring to buy them online,” he said.The market is so depressed that retailers expect the prices to dip further in the run up to the festival.Kundan rakhis catch the eye of residentsKundan and sacred thread rakhis are selling like hot cakes in the city. Many customers are also preferring to buy local rakhis than made in China.Cartoon rakhis such as Doraemon, Spiderman, Mickey Mouse, Chota Bheem are also in demand.Akhil Joshi, a retailer from Jawahar Nagar, said, “Earlier we used to sell more than 100 rakhis on a daily basis but this year, very few customers are visiting my shop. I have set up a stall outside the shop so that social distancing can be maintained but since morning only three customers have come in and purchased rakhis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ahead-of-raksha-bandhan-ludhiana-markets-witness-low-footfall/story-9DpdOnOZO8aCuPS5W6gTjL.html
25-07-2020||City||Tricity buzz: HT Chandigarh reporters’ tracker on all those making, or faking, news||On wrong foot, ex-mayor makes cop join Teej celebrationsInspector Paramjeet Kaur was out ensuring social distancing norms the other day when she learnt about Teej celebrations at Ram Darbar. To enforce social distancing norms, the station house officer (SHO) at Sector 31 reached the spot to find former mayor Kamlesh along with five women at the “symbolic celebration”. Kamlesh promptly convinced the inspector to not only join in but also take a few swings, terming Teej to be an auspicious festival for women. Rain eludes tricity despite Met forecast The meteorological department forecast heavy rain last week but all Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali got was drizzle. While other cities in Punjab and Haryana were caught in the downpour, residents of the tricity could be seen carrying their umbrellas along and looking longingly at the sky. Will it rain relief from the humidity this week? We hope so. Caught without a mask? Pay the price at any cost If you don’t have Rs 500 in your pocket and are caught without a mask in public in Mohali, be prepared to beg, borrow or steal but pay the penalty you must. Defaulters learnt this the hard way as the police and district administration held a drive to penalise people without a mask at the Baba Banda Singh Bahadur Inter State Bus Terminus (ISBT) in Phase 6. Among those caught were two passengers who didn’t have Rs 500 on them. They were made to wait till they arranged the cash and paid up. Covid-19 puts brakes on political activity The Chandigarh unit of the BJP is prolific in issuing press notes. Even during the three months of the Covid-19 lockdown, press notes and pictures of BJP leaders distributing food, sanitisers and masks among people were a daily occurrence. After restrictions were relaxed, press conferences became the norm. Not to be left behind, the Congress too issued multiple press notes daily. But last week, both parties went largely quiet, limiting themselves to a few announcements on WhatsApp. “With rising Covid-19 cases, political parties have finally learned to scale down public dealings. The BJP has even shut down Kamalam, its headquarters in Sector 33, Chandigarh,” a party insider said. Parida’s tweet ruffles feathers at PGIDoctors at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, were quick to object to UT adviser Manoj Parida’s call on Twitter the other day to NGOs and companies to put up stalls at Sukhna Lake for distributing face masks among walkers. Dr Aman Sharma, a professor of internal medicine, wrote that there’s a need to educate people to wear masks properly than arranging for free provisions. Almost everyone has a mask but few wear it properly. “Need MasKampaign with catchlines like Naak bachain mask lagain”. Taking a swipe, Dr Mahesh Devnani said the obsession with Sukhna is beyond comprehension. What about parks? If walkers at Sukhna are the only concern, then may consider weekend curfew at the lake only instead of the whole city. It’s Covid and not Kovid! Who hasn’t heard of Covid? The word is all over, be it newspapers, the electronic media, social media or hoardings. Yet, there are few who continue to spell it wrongly. In one of the press notes by the Panchkula public relations department recently, Covid-19 was written as Kovid and that too not once but several times. When hot wheels cooled heels After a Lamborghini Huracan worth over Rs 3 crore was impounded by the Chandigarh Traffic Police for speeding, personnel of the Sector 3 police station impounded a Ducati mobike, worth Rs 20 lakh, as the rider rode it without a number plate and helmet.

25-07-2020||Chandigarh||Guest column: Locked down at home, we miss you, My Lord!||Vacations seem to have outlived their contract as all courts remain closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. All proceedings have been moved online just when we were raring to bounce back to the environs of the legal world. Understanding the prudence of staying at home, I am inevitably missing the stimulating atmosphere of the courts, always filled with a battery of lawyers, respondents, petitioners, and above all, My Lord at the helm of affairs. There is a moment of reckoning when the honourable judge arrives and the whole court rises in deep reverence. Everyone bows to the supreme powers that rest in My Lord, for the learned judge works tirelessly to uphold the ideals of the constitution. I remember as a young lawyer I found it unnerving to appear before the bench. My voice would quiver, my hands would sweat, and I would be shaking even when I had argued my point well. But gradually one learns and grows, for that is the power of a well conducted court. Our interaction with the learned judges on the floor of the court is usually very dynamic. They are like our friends, teachers and guides , who at times haul us up, and at others are magnanimous. Profound lessons roll out from the realms of the venerable court, which leave our minds enlightened. The sheer brilliance with which important matters are put before the court, and the learned judge exercising his legal acumen to decipher the truth of the matter, is overwhelming. Often, we have to hold our breath, so that we do not miss a word of the arguments of the illustrious lawyers, who are masters in court craft. When the formal system of justice took shape several centuries ago it was decided that judges be made to wear a special uniform to give visual prominence to their stature. Since then they have worn the flowing black gowns and stiff white linen bands around the winged collar. Had we been in the pre-independence era , their dress code would have also included silk stockings and wigs (called peruke). The wig was frizzed at the top, with tight horizontal curls and a short tail at the back. However the wigs and stockings were dropped after independence. Pakistan continued with the headgear till 1980. Sri Lankan judges still wear a long wig and scarlet cloak for special occasions. Today, as things stand, the wait seems long till we can pay our obeisance at the altar of justice… in person. We have to make do with our tardy internet connections, and argue our cases from the confines of our homes. Our royal gowns and jackets have also been discontinued for some time, keeping in view the spread of the novel coronavirus. We long to go back to the coffee shops , where we had animated discussions on points of law. As we deliver our legal responsibilities through the online portals, we miss the magnificent courtroom and the benign presence of My Lord. alkagaurkashyap@gmail.comThe writer is a Chandigarh-based lawyer||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/guest-column-locked-down-at-home-we-miss-you-my-lord/story-3qgEfwuNoqElk3LrjX17iN.html
25-07-2020||Chandigarh||Guest column: For private universities to survive, mergers could be a good solution||A nation’s commitment to develop human resource for its holistic development is evident from the number of educational institutes it has. Though an impressive number of higher educational institutions have opened in India since independence, quality and appreciable gross enrolment ratio (GER) in higher education is a bridge too far.Even after more than seven decades past independence, none of the Indian universities could find a berth among top hundred institutions of higher education at the global level; the ambitious target of 30% GER in the year 2020 has also not been achieved as yet. At present, there are 935 universities (including 127 deemed to be universities) in the country. An exponential increase in the share of private universities was noted since the year 2008 when there were only 14 private universities. Now the country boasts of 349 private universities. Obviously, private education providers became ambitious to start courses of their choice with flexible admission capacity and rules, by attaining a sort of autonomy by opening new universities. Many such institutes were just elevated from the colleges already established, without adding substantial research component or outreach activities, the parameters which distinguish colleges from the universities. Ironically, failure of the public sector to spare adequate funds to raise the level of academics at universities and colleges led to private enterprises cropping up to complement public educational institutions. At present, the tiny state of Punjab has 16 private universities against 11 public institutes; the first to be established being Lovely Professional University in the year 2006. Since then each coming year added one or more universities to the state’s kitty; a maximum of three in the year 2016. Initially, opening of private universities could have paid dividends in the form of appreciable revenues, but the downtrend in engineering courses and exodus of students for foreign education made it difficult for the institutes to run the show . In the recent past, Punjab has seen a silent exodus of 1.5 lakh students; 1.25 lakh only to Canada. Payment of reasonable salaries and hiring adequate number of competent faculty for effective curricula delivery has become a serious issue. Further, there is no provision of any financial aid from the government to run a private university in India and that explains the primary focus of these universities on enrolling the maximum number of students to fill their coffers. Secondly, the students would prefer an institution which is affiliated to a well recognised public university rather than the yet-to-make-a-mark private university. This is also affecting the admission prospects of the private universities. Surprisingly, there are private universities on record, where at one time the number of admitted students was only in two digits, and then there were others where enrolment could not touch four digits. This is in stark contrast to private universities in developed countries where average enrolment is not less than 20,000 students. Probably, to run a private university in India with a student strength of less than 5,000, has become a herculean task. Unfortunately, a majority of private universities in the country may be hard pressed even to get these numbers. The prevailing coronavirus pandemic has made the situation still more dismal for managers of the private universities already struggling to run their institutions due to declining revenues. The situation is likely to worsen in the post-pandemic period. To disburse salaries to the teachers and the supporting staff has become a huge challenge. There seems to be little likelihood of getting any special financial aid from state or Central government in view of the pandemic. What is the way out then? This is the time for managers or owners of private universities to sit together and ponder over the issue. They need to share, sustain and survive. The idea of merging their universities to bail out of this situation would be worth considering. For instance, in Punjab, and may be in other states of the country, there are several private universities located close to each other. Optimising resources by merging these universities would greatly help to improve the financial status ensuring their sustainability. Judicious utilisation of expertise and infrastructural resources will be an added advantage. It needs to emphasised that to pursue the cause of education what counts is not opening more universities, but strengthening the existing colleges by catering to their needs. The Imperial College of London remained a college for more than a century and most of the times it ranked amongst the ten best educational institutions of the world. Khalsa College Amritsar is running very well with thousands of students on its rolls since more than 125 years During my studentship at DAV College Jalandhar from 1971-1975, the enrolment ranged from 4,000 to 5,000 students and very high standards of education were maintained. Alternatively, majority of private universities that were elevated from colleges can revert to their original stature and renew affiliation to recognised public universities; thus shedding the burden of running a university set up. While this will reduce the financial burden of some institutes, at the same time affiliation to a public university may also brighten the admission prospectus. Further, private education providers may explore some new avenues of need-based professional education such as veterinary science, much needed for diversification in agriculture rather than opting for short lived fancy courses lacking job opportunities. One very successful example of such venture was opening of the first private veterinary college by the management of the Khalsa College Amritsar, which is affiliated to the Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU) Ludhiana and maintaining quality standards at par with the GADVASU monitored by the Veterinary Council of India. The pandemic has put us in a difficult situation and we have to take difficult decisions and subsequent actions for the sacred cause of education.

25-07-2020||City||Sangrur police using app to track cops on night duty on trial basis||Sangrur In a boost to Punjab government’s efforts to enhance use of technology in policing, the Sangrur Police have developed a mobile application (app) to track its policemen on night duty, nakas and patrolling. Developed over a period of eight-nine months in collaboration with a private Information Technology (IT) firm, the app works on the basis of sending an alert to senior officials in case of absenteeism among policemen on these sensitive duties. “The app is on use on a trial basis,” said Sangrur SSP Sandeep Garg, adding that the district police had also developed a range of software to resolve issues that caused daily inconveniences like accessing data of criminals, stock of essentials and pending litigation etc. “The app and the software are the result of at least a 100 meetings and work over nine months. This is way forward for policing, where technology is increasingly adopted,” the SSP added. A source said that using the software, alerts for litigation in high court can be generated ten days before the date. “Over 1,500 cases from Sangrur are pending in Punjab and Haryana HC. The work of preparing replies and compilation of data, which take a lot of time, will be done lot more efficiently with the software. The new software will be installed in all police stations and investigation officers (IOs) will be able to work effectively on court cases,” the SSP added. To reduce expenditure on Mobile CCTV surveillance van, a moveable CCTV set-up has been developed that costs Rs 60,000 instead of a CCTV police van, which costs around Rs 7-8 lakh, the SSP said, adding that corruption could also be checked with the software also generating record of vehicles, their travel history and bills, and many other such items. “The Punjab DGP has checked the functioning of such software and approved its use. Some ideas have been implemented in the state and the rest are under trial,” the SSP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sangrur-police-using-app-to-track-cops-on-night-duty-on-trial-basis/story-l89H5hR3Ts39RYSUyTGisI.html

25-07-2020||Jaipur||Tiger in Kota’s MHTR sanctuary dies after preying on feral cattle||A tiger has died in Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve (MHTR) in Rajasthan’s Kota district because of preying on feral cattle that led to accumulation of fat in its vital organs, which has triggered a fresh move to relocate at least three of the 14 villages located within the reserve on an urgent basis. MT-3, the tiger, had died on Thursday (July 23) in Mashalpura block of MHTR and its autopsy revealed a lump of fat in its heart, lungs and other vital organs. At present, MHTR has three tigers. Anand Mohan, the chief conservator of forests (CCF) Kota, said: “MHTR is a newly developed tiger reserve, where the animal had gone extinct four decades ago. They have been rehabilitated again. Though their prey base number is growing, it’s still short of the desired figure within the 80-square (sq)-kilometre (km) natural habitat for tigers.” Feral cattle are believed to be a problem in all tiger reserves across the country, which are exposed to villages and human habitation. “Similar problem exists in MHTR as well because 14 villages are located within the reserve,” the CCF said. Tigers don’t need to put an extra effort to prey on fat-rich feral cattle, he added. “Ungulates like deer, blue bull or other prey bases of tigers are aware of the prey predator’s hunting tactics in the wild, but the feral cattle are not acquainted with the animal’s hunting technique. They have become tigers’ soft targets, as they are easier to kill, as compared to wild animals,” he said. “Less fat is burnt in a tiger’s body while killing cattle. Consumption of bovine fat also leads to further accumulation of fat in a Big Cat’s body, in turn, affecting its vital organs,” he added. A tiger has to exhibit more endurance in killing wild animals than cattle. Besides, wild animals have less fat in their body. The forest officials are looking at measures to prevent a recurrence of similar mishaps. “Relocation of the villages can minimise the stray cattle problem and also facilitate more grasslands in MHTR that can increase tigers’ prey base,” Mohan said. Though there are 14 villages within MHTR, tigers are found to be moving around in three hamlets that need to be relocated on an urgent basis. The relocation of three villages will also provide an inviolate area, measuring around 300 sq km, within the reserve. The CCF said he would incorporate these facts in his report on MT-3’s death to chief wildlife warden of Rajasthan on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/tiger-in-kota-s-mhtr-sanctuary-dies-after-preying-on-feral-cattle/story-jfnt2H1gQomimdo9Uz9RDN.html

He is a MSc Biochemistry student at KU, who had been come home after the Covid-19 outbreak.“Yes, we have arrested him in a case registered under UAPA in 2018,” said Nigeen station house officer Gowhar Ahmad. He refused to divulge any further details.Sources said that a case under Section 13 of UAPA was registered against Malik at the Nigeen police station in 2018. Section 13 deals with a person who advocates, abets, advises or incites the commission of any unlawful activity.Hazratbal superintendent of police Sudhanshu Verma said that they arrested Malik after collecting evidence in the case. “Without evidence we could not have arrested him. Besides, due to the Covid-19 pandemic it took some time. That is why he has been arrested now,” said Verma.Malik’s family says they suspect the case is related to a protest he held at the university hostel against poor quality of food. “He had protested against the bad quality of hostel food in 2018. He had raised a voice against corruption and that is why things went bad for him,” said Faizan Mushtaq, Malik’s younger brother. He added, “My brother has been at home for the past three months.”Malik’s family members are now travelling to Srinagar to meet him.Kashmir University officials said that the case was not filed by the varsity. “The university has been closed owing to Covid outbreak and no classes are going on. He is our student and has appeared in a recent exam. It is a 2018 case in Nigeen police station. We have not filed any case against him. Issues in hostels are a part of the university life,” said KU registrar Nisar Ahmad Mir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kashmir-university-student-arrested-under-unlawful-activities-act/story-fjTECvqSS1nCkUzCD22zKO.html

25-07-2020||Bangalore||Karnataka waives crematorium fees for Covid-19 victims in Bengaluru||The Karnataka government on Saturday announced waiver of crematorium fees for those who succumb to the Covid-19 infection in Bengaluru and said the city civic body would bear the cost. It said that from now on, families of the Covid deceased need not pay any fees fixed by the city civic body- Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP)- across 12 electric crematoriums in the city. “There were reports in the media about difficulties faced in performing the last rites of those who died due to Covid-19 infections. Aimed at resolving those difficulties, certain decisions have been taken,” revenue minister R Ashoka said. He told reporters here that BBMP had fixed Rs 250 as the cremation fee, Rs 100 for the ash collection pot and Rs 900 for the bier (bamboo stretcher on which the body is carried), all of which have been waived for Covid deaths. “So it will be a waiver of Rs 1,250 per cremation. The BBMP will bear this cost,” he added. Ashoka also announced Rs 500 per body incentive for the personnel who conduct the last rites of Covid victims. “This is in recognition of their services at a time when family members of the deceased are not ready to touch the body and not ready to take the body in some cases,” he said. Noting that the government has identified 23 acres of land at five places around Bengaluru for burial or cremation of Covid victims, Ashoka locals in all these areas are protesting against it. Appealing to the people for cooperation during these difficult times, he said the government’s intention was to ensure respectful burial or cremation for the deceased. “Obstructing it is not right, it is not Indian tradition,” he said.Pointing out that it takes almost a day’s time for a Covid victim’s body to be handed over for burial or cremation, he said “scientifically, according to experts and doctors, the virus will not remain alive for more than three hours. ...Also, bodies are either burnt or buried eight feet below. So there will not be any problem for those living in nearby areas and it will not spread infection. Cooperate with humanity,” he said. “These lands identified are for all religions and communities and once the pandemic subsides, can be used for other deaths as well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-waives-crematorium-fees-for-covid-19-victims-in-bengaluru/story-pqdW2Jndi4e4MhPhuqyhOJ.html

25-07-2020||Lucknow||The win that changed UP’s cricket scene||Uttar Pradesh’s loss to domestic giants Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy semi-final by an innings and 233 runs at the Wankhede Stadium in 1994-95 in less than three days was not unexpected.While it may have been business as usual for most of the players in the Rahul Sapru-led Uttar Pradesh team, a few, including Gyanendra Pandey, were distraught. The young brigade in the side then decided to avenge the humiliation in future.With the passage of time, many people forgot that loss, but not the young Pandey and his pacers Ashish Winston Zaidi and Obaid Kamal who avenged the defeat in style in another semi-final at the same venue four years later. That three-wicket win changed the fortunes of Uttar Pradesh cricket. Perhaps, forever.Zaidi wrecked Mumbai in the first innings, bagging 6/29 in 11.3 overs as UP skittled out the Amol Mazumdar-led side for 94 in just 34.3 overs after the home side chose to exploit the flat pitch on winning the toss. The two other seamers Obaid Kamal and Mohd Saif shared two wickets between them. Five of the Mumbai batsmen couldn’t open their account. Only skipper Mazumdar (31) and Jatin Paranjpe (42) offered some resistance.Even after Mumbai had lost five wickets for 84, things could have been different, if the young Obaid had not uprooted the middle stump of a solid-looking Mazumdar with a direct throw from the mid-off region. In fact, that run-out became the turning point of the first innings.Despite posting a small total, Mumbai looked confident of hitting back. But UP skipper Gyanendra Pandey (64) and ‘Mr Dependable’ Rizwan Shashad (43) defied the strong Mumbai bowling line-up consisting of Paras Mhambrey, Abey Kuruvilla, Nilesh Kulkarni, Sairaj Bahutule and RV Pawar to end Day One at 179/4.By the end of Day Two, Uttar Pradesh sensed something special when Pandey and Shamshad smashed 109 and 64, respectively, to help the side score 293 in 99.4 overs. Pandey was dismissed by Kulkarni, taking a return catch off his own delivery, before Shamshad got out in a similar manner to Pawar. Mhambrey finished with 3/48.Despite conceding a 199-run first innings lead against Uttar Pradesh, the hosts Mumbai didn’t lose heart and went on to score 328, setting a winning target of 130 for the visitors in the fourth innings. Paranjpe (83), Mazumdar (87) and Bahutule (44*) came up with some fine batting performances. For UP, this time it was Obaid who bagged 5/58 in 31 overs. Saif took 3/86, whereas Zaidi and Shamshad took a wicket each.Uttar Pradesh were 2/26 with Jyoti Yadav (5) and Shamshad (4) batting at the end of Day Three in the second innings. Drama unfolded on the fourth day when UP started losing wickets at regular intervals and the scoreboard read 5/71. But it was not Mumbai’s day as Gyanendra Pandey stood like a rock and struck an unbeaten 45 to take his side home in 60.2 overs. Besides Pandey, Shamshad (25) and Jyoti Yadav (22) had major contributions. Nilesh Kulkarni took 4/46 and Pawar bagged 2/48.“The win that day was like a dream come true for all of us. It set the tone for a bright future for Uttar Pradesh cricket,” Pandey recalled. “We wanted to let the world know the strength of UP cricket. I still feel proud that I led the side then,” he said.Pandey said that winning moment against Mumbai was unforgettable as everyone in this side had memories of their humiliation against the same team in 1994-95.“I was so disappointed when we lost by a huge margin in the semi-final (1994-95). A few of us were determined to teach Mumbai a lesson in future. We did exactly that in 1998,” he added.Gyanendra Pandey later played two ODIs for Team India against Pakistan, and helped UP cricket and cricketers see many more great moments as player, coach and also as junior national selector. Obaid Kamal, another hero of the match, still remembers how he ran Mazumdar out in the first innings. “I bluffed the batsman as I fumbled an easy push. Before he could think of getting back, I made a direct hit. It changed our fortunes in the first innings,” said Kamal, who hanged his boots in 2005-06 soon after UP lifted their maiden Ranji Trophy at KD Singh ‘Babu’ Stadium here, beating Bengal on the basis of the first innings lead.Kamal praised Gyanendra for his aggressive leadership and the ability to handle the pressure in a crunch situation. “Credit goes to Pandey for transforming UP cricket. It was after a gap of 18 years that we had made it to the Ranji Trophy final in 1998 and had our first win ever against Mumbai,” he said.“The wicket was dry in the second innings. Even before the start of the day’s proceedings, I had told one of my journalist friends in Mumbai that it was going to be my day today. In fact, I planned each dismissal and moved the ball both ways. Although Shamshad dropped Mazumdar at slip, I made him dance to my tunes for 10-15 deliveries before he offered a straight-forward catch to Shamshad. This time there was no mistake,” said Kamal.Shamshad, who scored 7,000 plus runs in domestic cricket but couldn’t play for Team India, also felt the team’s win in 1998 brought a drastic change in the the perspective of other top cricket playing states about UP.“I still find that the team which played between 1998 and 2006, including cricketers like Mohd Kaif, Suresh Raina, Piyush Chawla, were the best in UP’s history.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/the-win-which-changed-up-s-cricket-scene/story-7r2Dm8fTILDnIdzMlFDR3J.html

25-07-2020||Pune||Civic administration fails to increase health infrastructure in Pune during lockdown||If expanding health infrastructure was one of the aims of the administration during the lockdown, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) along with district authorities failed to utilise the period to achieve its target. An official from the PMC offered the beds related data which suggest the administration was able to increase 159 ICU beds with ventilators, 95 beds without ventilators and 348 beds with oxygen in the city during the 10-day lockdown period. The capacity building was way short than what PMC had aimed – when Shekhar Gaikwad was the civic chief he announced to increase the bed capacity to 70,000 in various educational institutes. Though the beds have increased as per the Pune Divisional Commissioner’s dashboard as of July 24, not a single ICU bed with the ventilator was available for patients in PMC area while only six ICU beds without ventilators are available. The figures suggest although the administration was able to increase the beds slightly during the lockdown, the on-ground situation showed critical patients are not getting beds while running from hospital to hospital. On the instruction of the Pune district guardian minister Ajit Pawar, the Pune district administration had introduced the lockdown for 10 days from July 14 to July 23. As the beds situation became critical, the administration decided to introduce the lockdown and got a breathing period to increase the medical infrastructure. Bharatiya Janata Party’s city unit president Jagdish Mulik issued a press statement and said that city’s health facility is on a ventilator. Mulik said, “The lockdown has completely failed. Despite the lockdown, citizens are not getting beds in hospitals. Not a single ventilator is available in the city. Private hospitals are charging more, patients are not getting beds and ambulances and no one has control over this situation. The state government needs to concentrate on Pune city.” Though the figures available with the PMC shows the administration has been able to increase the beds capacity, it is not helping to sort out the crises as the surge is bigger and every day more than 1,500 Covid-19 positive cases are emerging in the city. The officer on special duty Saurabh Rao said, “The administration definitely tried to improve the beds’ situation in the city. But the surge is big and as compared to the surge we must accept that the infrastructure is lacking. But we would ensure that each patient would get treatment and we’ve given instructions to the private hospitals to not deny any patient. If they do not have a ventilator or ICU bed vacant, they should first admit the new patient and start treatment on the vacant beds. Later, that hospital would search the vacant bed in other hospitals through their network or dashboard and inform the relatives.”Rao said that we are expecting more critical patients at the end of July and therefore the goal is to upgrade the infrastructure to handle the situation.District collector Naval Kishore Ram said, “The private hospitals accepted that they would add more beds in the deluxe and semi-deluxe rooms. It would help to increase more beds in the existing infrastructure.”BOXbed category/ 13 July/ 23 July/ beds increased during lock downWithout Oxygen beds / 11085/11253/168Oxygen beds/1715/2063/348ICU beds/ 350/509/159Ventilators/ 210/305/95||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/civic-administration-fails-to-increase-health-infrastructure-in-pune-during-lockdown/story-H2cnqwB98G2ADRh7JPo4fJ.html

25-07-2020||Pune||Scattered response on first day post lockdown in Pune, PCMC||The Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad cities which unlocked after 10 days of lockdown saw a scattered number of customers in their respective markets on Friday. Clothes shops, mobile accessories, grocery shops reported a scattered presence of customers.The odd even guidelines issued by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) saw a decent response on day one as few areas strictly followed the guidelines while others ignored. The odd even guidelines were strictly followed by Pimpri market, Bhosari, Akurdi, Laxmi road, Tilak road, Bajirao road, Navi peth, Sadashiv peth, Hadapsar, Kothrud, JM road, FC road, Camp, Appa Balwant chowk.Shravan Hardikar, Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner said, “We are evaluating the even/odd guidelines with the consultation of the PMC and District Information office (DIO) and soon a decision will be finalised on the five days a week suggested by traders association and scrapping up even/odd guidelines. At the moment action will be taken against people who do not follow even/odd rules.”According to the even/odd guidelines, the shops on the right side of the road will remain open on even dates while shops on the left side will remain open on odd dates. All businesses will only operate from 9 am to 5pm, and those found violating the guidelines will be shut down. “We completely oppose the odd-even guidelines but today all the traders have followed it as the civic body is following what state government has told them and the rule will remain till July 31 after that there will be new guidelines,” said Mahendra Pitaliya, secretary of federation of traders association of Pune (FTAP). The Pimpri market which faced many problems in the past for not following odd even guidelines followed it strictly on day one. The guidelines were also followed by MG road camp, Laxmi road, Bajirao road and Navipeth markets. Tulshibaug was not entirely operational, and guidelines were not followed. “We will not be repeating our mistakes this time. The odd even guidelines will be followed till the civic body wants. We don’t expect a rush of people in the cloth market as many people have not got their salaries so how will they come for shopping,” said the owner of Waheguru clothes shop in Pimpri. The guidelines were not implemented in Chinchwad, Dange chowk, Baner, Aundh, Balewadi, Tulsibaugh areas. A partial implementation of the guidelines was seen in Aundhgaon, Thergaon, Mahalunge, Hinjewadi, Dhyari, Satara road, Katraj, Ambegaon.“We don’t have any idea about the even/odd guidelines. We have already faced so many losses, we cannot keep our shop closed,” said Raunak Shah of Raunak hardware on Baner road. “We have requested Pune police commissioner and civic body chief, Vikram Kumar to scrap even/odd guidelines and traders will follow five days (10am-8pm) week routine with shops completely shut on the weekends. The authorities are yet to make any decision on the same. Let’s wait for July 31,” added Pitaliya. Most of the shops followed temperature check up at the entrance of the shops and workers were given protective guards for their safety. The traffic movement on roads has increased as civic bodies have allowed 50 per cent staff to go to office. “On most roads, traffic was noticed in morning hours (office hours) but after that it slowed down later in the day,” said Satish Nandurkar, police inspector at MIDC Bhosari. Satara road was also buzzing with vehicles in the morning hours. Ramesh Phadnis, a Thergaon resident said, “The crowd at Dange Chowk was less in comparison to when unlock happened on the previous occasion.

25-07-2020||Pune||Pune shopkeepers defy ‘odd-even’ rule in some parts of city||Despite opposition from traders, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) administration in its order on Thursday decided to retain its ‘even-odd’ formula for commercial shop openings across the city, a move many traders defied on Friday when the 10-day lockdown was lifted.As per the order, on even dates shops on one side of the road will be open while those on the other side while resume business on odd days. However, the Pune Traders Federation has opposed the move and kept shops on both sides of the streets open on the first day on Friday.Several shops in areas like Laxmi road, Kumthekar road, Bajirao road, Satara road, Tilak road and others were seen open. In suburban areas like Aundh, Baner and Bavdhan, along with Hadapsar, many shops were seen open on both sides of the road.“As the lockdown was ending on Thursday, we had already written our demands to PMC commissioner and all other governing bodies. One of our major demands was cancelling the odd-even days’ formula due to which each shop owner is facing huge financial losses,” said Fattechand Ranka, president, Traders Association.“For the last three to four months, shops are closed and according to the formula, one has to keep the shop open only for 15 days in a month. So we demanded to cancel it and still, they continued it. So, we have now left with no option but to oppose the decision and shop owners or traders are ready to face any action but will keep the shops open,” he said.There are more than 30,000 shops across Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad and around 10 lakh people are dependant financially, according to the traders’ body, which claimed that the rule is creating confusion and quarrel between shop owners and business has gone down.“On one hand all other essential shops, vegetable markets, roadside hawkers, private offices are open throughout the month why this injustice is only with the shop owners. The spread of Covid-19 is not because of us, it is due to the failure of the government agencies and they cannot blame us for their failure,” he said.“All the shop owners are taking safety precautions for their staff and customers. Still, the odd-even formula is imposed on us, we are going to take a meeting of all our association members on Monday and further plan of action to oppose this decision will be decided,” he added.Despite shops open on both sides, PMC did not act against any trader.“The odd-even rules for the shop owners are not decided by us, but is the regulation of the Maharashtra government. The order of restarting Pune has come yesterday only and it cannot be changed in one day about the P1 and P2 issue,” said Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar.“We need to wait for the revised regulations issued by the state government in this regard and we will work accordingly,” he said.Ashok Mohtage, a shop owner on Tilak road said, “During the countrywide lockdown, we have already suffered a huge loss in the business and now when we are restarting such rules are imposed on us.”“Keeping shop open half of the month is not profitable for any of us. There are many expenses to shop owners like maintenance of shops, worker salaries, electricity bill and now additionally for the safety precautions to daily sanitise the shop, masks, gloves and sanitisers for workers and customers. So, our expenses have increased and only 15-day business will badly affect us,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-shopkeepers-defy-odd-even-rule-in-some-parts-of-city/story-pFjPQ8JVBrffsu0ZvlvbvJ.html

This is the second tiger to have died in CTR this year. Rahul, who only uses his first name, director, CTR, said that the tiger was spotted by forest officials in the Laldhang beat of Jhirna range. “A five-month-old tiger cub was found dead by forest staff in the Jhirna range. The post-mortem report has revealed it died due to dehydration and hunger. This is the second tiger to have died in CTR this year,” said Rahul. On May 29, a carcass of a 10-year-old tigress was found in CTR’s Jhirna range. The tigress had injury marks on its neck and was likely to have died due to infighting with another tigress or tiger, officials had said. “Patrolling staff of the park spotted the carcass of the tigress in Jhirna range. The tigress had injury marks, which hinted that it likely to have died due to infighting with another tiger or tigress,” Rahul had said. The death of a Big Cat is not an isolated incident in the Kumaon region, as many carcasses have been found in the past two years. In the second week of April, the carcass of a five-year-old male tiger was found in the Ramnagar forest division near CTR. Last December, the carcass of a tigress was found in CTR’s Bijrani zone. Last September, a tigress was killed in CTR’s Dhela zone. Last May, the carcass of a male tiger was found in Corbett’s Bijrani zone. In the same month, the carcass of another tiger was found in the Corbett landscape under a culvert in Ringoda stream. Corbett and its surroundings have one of the highest tiger densities in the world. At present, CTR is estimated to have a tiger population of 260, according to state forest officials.

In Ayodhya, believed to be the birthplace of lord Ram, saints have given a call to locals to mark bhumi pujan by observing Diwali on the same day. As part of celebrations, all temples in Ayodhya will be decorated and lit with earthen diyas in the evening. Special puja will also be performed in all temples in Ayodhya on the bhumi pujan day. For the rest of the state, the VHP has asked people to light earthen diyas at the entrance of their houses on the day PM Modi will lay the foundation stone of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. “Apart from Diwali celebrations in Ayodhya, in all prominent temples across the state, the VHP will ensure that special puja (aarti) is performed in the evening on August 5 to mark foundation laying ceremony of Ram Mandir,” said Sharad Sharma, regional spokesperson, VHP, who operates from Karsevakpuram, Ayodhya. The VHP celebrates its foundation day on the festive occasion of Rakshabandhan every year, which falls on August 3 this year.To mark its foundation day and bhumi pujan of Ram Mandir, the VHP has planned eight-day celebrations across the state starting from August 9. “In villages across the state small functions will be organised to mark bhumi pujan of Ram Mandir. Special brochures have been prepared for distribution among villagers,” said Sharma.“This carries history of the Ram Mandir agitation and the November 9 (2019) verdict of the Supreme Court in favour of Ram Mandir,” pointed out Sharma.It may be pointed out that the VHP had planned grand celebrations in Ayodhya and rest of the state on the bhumi pujan day.All these activities were planned prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. But after the pandemic, the VHP decided to scale down this plan.Special emphasis will be on villages where the VHP has never organised any activity or where it does not have any local office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/vhp-plans-diwali-like-celebrations-for-mega-ram-temple-event-in-ayodhya/story-rSFzTahR1PaFisMWYzcJ4M.html

The governor is head of the family and we do not want any differences. If our constitutional rights are violated and if that is from the Raj Bhavan, then we can at least say that people will gherao as it will be an insult of public,” Pratap Singh Khachariyawas, the state transport minister, said.“It is our right to call assembly session and we aren’t getting permission for it from the governor. In an autocratic manner under a conspiracy, an elected government is being toppled. The BJP will face angst and protest of the people when they will go to them,” he said while addressing the protest rally in Jaipur. Govind Singh Dotasra, Congress’ state unit president, had on Friday announced that the party’s workers will hold demonstrations at all district headquarters against the conspiracy by the BJP to murder democracy.Dotasra had also directed that the gatherings should not have more than 50 people and that only five of them should go to the collector to submit a memorandum addressed to Governor Kalraj Mishra.The Congress is pushing for an assembly session so Ashok Gehlot can prove his majority, following a revolt by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and 18 other MLAs.The Rajasthan High Court on Friday ordered that status quo should be maintained on the disqualification notices sent out by state assembly Speaker CP Joshi to the rebel MLAs.The BJP said the language used by the Congress leaders against Governor Mishra was unfortunate. Mukesh Pareek, the party’s spokesperson, also said the protests were unjustified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-congress-stages-demonstrations-protest-rallies-against-autocratic-bjp/story-RRJMuBIS9AcgT5HCasITSP.html

25-07-2020||Mumbai||Dharavi takes battle against Covid-19 ahead, comes forward to donate plasma||Mumbai’s Dharavi, Asia’s largest slum, has managed to flatten the curve of the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and will now take the battle against the pandemic further through a plasma donation program.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will launch the plasma donation program on Monday, following the Plasma Daan Sankalp Abhiyan for the primary screening of recovered Covid-19 patients in Dharavi.The program will be launched on the occasion of Uddhav Thackeray’s birthday on Monday.Shiv Sena legislator Rahul Shewale has organised the primary screening camp for the upcoming plasma donation camp at Kamaraj Memorial School in the slum, which was once declared a Covid-19 hotspot.“About 500 Covid-19 recovered patients have shown interest in plasma donation, of which 50 people were primarily screened,” Shewale said.“Earlier, the people of Dharavi won the fight of Covid-19 and now they are gearing up to win the hearts of the people of Maharashtra,” he added.Rajesh Tope, Maharashtra’s health minister, had said that the government is planning to start plasma bank in Dharavi and Malegaon. “We are encouraging people to come forward and donate the plasmas to save the lives of other serious Covid-19 patients,” he had said.Convalescent plasma therapy involves transfusion of specific components from the blood of people recovered from Covid-19—at least 14 days after their complete recovery—into those who have contracted the disease virus or are in the high-risk category. Plasma is the almost-clear liquid left behind after red and white blood cells and platelets are removed from the blood.Dharavi is a densely populated slum area with around 10,00,000 people squeezed in an area spanning 2.5 square kilometres, making it highly vulnerable to spread of contagions such as Covid-19. Active surveillance and containment measures, including intense screening, testing, sanitation and isolation of Covid-19 patients and suspects, has led to the tapering off in the number of new infections in the area. Maintaining social distance is a challenge in Dharavi, with a population density of 2,27,136 per sq km. According to a senior Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) official, at least 80% of its population depends on 450 community toilets and the administration had to sanitise and disinfect these toilets several times a day.The World Health Organization (WHO) had earlier this month praised the efforts taken to contain the coronavirus pandemic in Dharavi, saying that only aggressive action combined with national unity and global solidarity can turn the disaster around.“And some of these examples are Italy, Spain and South Korea, and even in Dharavi - a densely packed area in the megacity of Mumbai - a strong focus on community engagement and the basics of testing, tracing, isolating and treating all those that are sick is key to breaking the chains of transmission and suppressing the virus,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the UN health body chief, had said.The number of coronavirus disease patients in Dharavi rose to 2,519 on Friday with the addition of six cases. It was the third consecutive day that Dharavi registered only single-digit growth, a BMC official said.Five people had tested positive on July 22, while six cases were added on July 23.The official said that Dharavi now has 128 active Covid-19 cases and the number of recovered patients has gone up to 2,142.The civic body has, however, stopped sharing the number of deaths, if any, from the slum.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/from-being-a-covid-19-hotspot-to-driving-plasma-donation-dharavi-sets-an-example/story-PN27fz1Tnp6Y6oDUqrJ3nO.html

25-07-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana private sector job quota: Ball in governor’s court after law secretary, advocate general give divergent opinions||Chandigarh: In view of the divergent opinions of the law secretary and the advocate general, the proposed ordinance that provides for 75% reservation in private sector jobs in Haryana has been sent by the state cabinet to governor Satyadeo Narain Arya for approval. The cabinet’s nod was taken by way of the circulation of the memorandum of the proposed law. The law secretary or legal remembrancer (LR) calls for the assent of the President on the proposed legislation, while the advocate general says the proposed law does not require presidential assent. The proposed law was vetted twice by the law secretary after cabinet deliberations on January 31 and July 6. THREE OPTIONS BEFORE THE GOVERNOR Article 213 of the Constitution empowers the governor to promulgate an ordinance with respect to any matter within the legislative competence of the state legislature, if necessary, after obtaining instructions from the President. The Haryana governor, who has the arduous task of taking a call on the proposed legislation, has primarily three options – to go with the advice of the advocate general and give his assent for promulgation of the ordinance, thus, putting the law into effect; second, to return the proposed law with a message for reconsideration to the cabinet; and third, reserve it for the President’s consideration. The proposed law, if reserved for the consideration of the President, will go through the scrutiny of central ministries before the President takes a call. PRESIDENTIAL ASSENT REQUIRED OR NOT? Officials say the law secretary’s opinion on reserving the proposed law for consideration of the President is primarily based on two counts. “There is a provision in the proposed law that gives it an overriding effect over other laws. Such a broad provision has the potential to be repugnant to an Act of Parliament or an existing law and thereby needs presidential assent. Another provision providing for preference in jobs to local candidates domiciled in Haryana seemingly is also in contravention of Article 14 of the Constitution pertaining to equality before law,: said an official familiar with the developments. Referring to the advice tendered by him, advocate general BR Mahajan, however, said the proposed Haryana law did not violate any central law. “It also does not come in conflict with Article 14 of the Constitution,” Mahajan said. PILOTED BY DUSHYANT, BJP NOT SO KEEN Haryana’s move to introduce reservation for local youngsters in private sector jobs is on the lines of a law enacted by the YS Jaganmohan Reddy government in Andhra Pradesh that has been challenged on the grounds of constitutional validity in the Andhra Pradesh high court. The move is piloted by Dushyant Chautala’s Jannayak Janta Party, the coalition partner of the BJP in Haryana, which had made a poll commitment to provide 75% quota in private sector jobs to local candidates. The proposed law has not found much support from the BJP. In fact, chief minister ML Khattar had once sounded non-committal on the prospect of enacting such a law. The BJP government at the Centre has a different view on the issue. At least two former central ministers answered in the negative to questions in Parliament about the possibility of reservation in appointments in private companies. The proposed ordinance, Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Ordinance, 2020, provides 75% of the new employment to local candidates for jobs having salary of less than ₹50,000 a month in private companies, societies, trusts, limited liability partnership firms, partnership firms in the state. Employers will have the option to recruit local candidates from one district to the extent of only 10%. The proposed law will also contain a bail-out clause for the industry if suitable local candidates are not available for a category of industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-private-sector-job-quota-ball-in-governor-s-court-after-law-secretary-advocate-general-give-divergent-opinions/story-puFJmborEBYFn4nTtkLqlO.html

A reward of Rs 2 lakh has been declared for the STF-Gonda Police team, who successfully conducted the operation,” said Awnish Kumar Awasthi, additional chief secretary (ACS) (home), UP.The child is a grandson of bidi trader, Rajesh Gupta, from Colnelganj in Gonda district, which is located around 90 kilometres east of Lucknow.The kidnappers had demanded a ransom of Rs 4 crore for the release of the child.An STF press release identified the kidnappers as Suraj Pandey and his wife Chhavi, the mastermind, along with Raj Pandey, who is related to the couple, Umesh Yadav and Deepu Kashyap, all residents of Gonda district. Umesh and Deepu have sustained injuries in the encounter between the STF-Gonda Police team and the kidnappers.

The boy obediently followed the man, who forcefully put him in the car, and fled away.A closed-circuit TV (CCTV) footage had captured the kidnapping incident, where a man in a blue shirt and black trousers is seen walking with a boy in a yellow T-shirt. The boy’s family members informed the police after they failed to search him.Later, the boy’s father received a call from a woman, who demanded Rs 4 lakh as ransom in lieu of his release.The boy’s family filed a first information report (FIR) with the police about the abduction following which the rescue operation was launched.

25-07-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Mango man’s bougainvilleas||Despite living without a house in a tough city like Delhi, despite having to brave every day the dangerous times of the coronavirus pandemic, fruit seller Arman makes sure to have beauty in his life.In the form of pink bougainvillaeas.This morning, bunches of the papery scentless flowers are artfully decked up on the mangoes piled up on his cart, here in central Delhi’s Sadar Bazaar.“The decoration was my own idea,” says Arman, flashing a disarming smile that makes him so endearing that one would immediately want to shake his hands (but for coronavirus). Arman is as stylish as his cart—a white scarf, the gamchha, is flung about his tight-fitting shirt. His hair falls over his forehead, making a prominent curl on one side. His moustache is impeccably trimmed. “I shave daily,” he says.In his early 20s, Arman has been a Delhiwalla for a decade. His family, comprising his mother and siblings, live in the village in Bahraich, UP. He sleeps on the patri, pavement, in the company of other hawkers like him—they all are from the same district.It is the monsoon season and one never knows when it might start to rain at night, while asleep, so Arman recently bought a new tirpal, waterproof canvass sheet, for ₹2,000 from Sadar Bazaar. “I put it up at night upon my stretch of the pavement... sometimes the rainwater wets the gadda (mattress)... but that doesn’t disturb my geheri neend (deep sleep).”Arman returns to his pavement only by 10pm. He has a quick dinner in a dhaba nearby, after which he goes to sleep. His night is not very long, to say the least. A mere couple of hours. At midnight he wakes up and boards an auto for Azadpur wholesale vegetable market to get a fresh stock of fruits for the next day’s sales. Last night he got langra mangoes from Benares. He returned to the patri by 4am, cleaned his cart, arranged it with mangoes and was ready to start the day.That’s his daily routine.This morning, after having a breakfast of kebab and parathas, he pulled his cart by a bougainvillea shrub, plucked off a few flowers and arranged them daintily upon the green mangoes. “A beautiful sight makes one feel good,“ he explains.Now Arman holds a few tufts of these bougainvillaeas in his hands, and shyly starts to talk of his girlfriend who lives near Gonda town. “We have known each other for five years... our villages are about an hour away from each other.” The couple chat daily on phone but Arman can’t predict with any confidence the future of their relationship.“It’s not that I use only the bougainvillaeas for my cart,” he points out later. “it could be anything... yesterday I used leaves of Ashoka and Paakad (trees).... day before I had used roses.”At some point later in the day, Arman will inevitably feel sleepy. “Because I rest so little at night.” And so, when there’s not much crowd and no hope of customers, usually in the late afternoon, he will simply park his cart by a pavement, plop his head among the unsold mangoes, and close his eyes for a while—he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mango-man-s-bougainvilleas/story-tgkXmtourdwwCI48PsFo2J.html

25-07-2020||City||Two Navi Mumbai residents lose money in internet frauds||A fraudster duped a 35-year-old Seawoods resident of Rs1.55 lakh after he gained access to her phone on the pretext of updating her father’s KYC details. In another case, a 70-year-old man lost ₹66,000 in a phishing scam when he tried to donate money to a church trust.In the first case, the complainant from Seawoods, Bhagyashree Deshpande, received a call on Thursday afternoon from a man who identified himself as Rahul Agarwal. The fraudster claimed that he was calling from the headquarters of a payment gateway to inform that her father’s KYC details have expired.Deshpande followed the fraudster’s instructions to renew the KYC process. The accused then guided her to download a remote control and support application and asked her to pay Re1 as a token amount for the process. When the transfer was successful, the accused spent Rs49,990 using her father’s credit card to make an online purchase.When Deshpande brought the transaction to the caller’s attention, he said the money will be refunded and asked her to scan a QR code which he had sent. On doing so, she again lost the same amount.“Realising that the caller was a fraudster, Deshpande rushed to the police station but by then, the accused had spent Rs55,000 more in two different transactions. A cheating case has been registered based on her complain,” said an officer from NRI police station.In the second incident, another resident, VV Verghese, was trying to donate Rs5,500 to St Mary’s Church trust in Dadar using a popular payment gateway but the payment failed.On Thursday afternoon, he looked for the payment gateway’s helpline number online and called on it, not knowing that the number was fake. The fraudster posed as an executive of the payment gateway and gave Verghese another number and asked him to transfer Rs4,999 on it.“On doing so, the complainant received a message stating that the transaction had failed. The ‘executive’ then asked the senior citizen to try transferring Rs5,000 to the number but the transaction failed to get through again. The executive made the complainant repeat the process several times,” the officer said.The caller then asked Verghese to check his account balance. It was then that the senior citizen had realised that he had lost Rs65,997. When he tried calling on the number, it was switched off. He then filed a complaint with the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-navi-mumbai-residents-lose-money-in-internet-frauds/story-fjHEvcQ5vLovP4Na0gy5kJ.html

The accused have been identified as Paresh Modawala and Shahrukh Niyaz Ahmed.According to the police, the 32-year-old businessman, Zuber Abdulhasib Ahmed, in his complaint said that the accused sent a promotional message on his mobile number in last year in September which stated that the duo can offer him VIP phone numbers.“The complainant showed interest to get 9191919191 and 7777777777 as his mobile numbers and contacted on the mobile number mentioned in the promotional message.

25-07-2020||City||Animal slaughter not allowed in private premises: Bombay HC||In light of an existing order, which restricts slaughtering goats in private premises, the Bombay high court (HC) has directed the civic corporation to ensure that slaughtering takes place only at the certified slaughterhouse in the city at Deonar. The directions were prompted after a petition was filed, stating that owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, shops should be restrained from slaughtering goats in their premises, as it led to overcrowding of buyers and thus defeats the purpose of lockdown and social distancing. It also poses a health threat to the people living in the vicinity of the shop, as disposal of waste is not as per norms, the public interest litigation (PIL) stated.A division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Riyaz Chagla was hearing a petition of Santacruz (East) resident Rajeshkumar Kanojia. The bench was informed by advocate Vivek Shukla that his client resided in a Kalina building, which housed a mutton shop on the ground floor. Shukla submitted that the shop owner not only kept livestock, but also undertook slaughtering of goats in the shop premise. This, Shukla submitted, posed a dual threat in the form of overcrowding of the shop, which resulted in violation of social distancing norms. Shukla added that the livestock roamed freely in the building premise and the disposal of waste after the slaughtering was also not done properly. He submitted that even though his client had complained to the local municipal authorities on numerous occasions, no action had been taken and hence he had no option but to approach the court. Shukla said that such a practice was prevalent in many shops across the city, though there was an order of a previous bench restricting slaughtering of animals outside of the certified abattoir in the city which is at Deonar. Thus, orders should be passed to curb such activities outside the Deonar slaughterhouse, argued Shukla.While defending his action, the butcher running the mutton shop in the petitioner’s building claimed that he had a license to operate the shop from the civic body.Responding to the petition, the civic body, through advocate Oorja Dhond, submitted that it had not given any licence to the shop owner to slaughter or store any livestock in the premises. Dhond submitted that the butcher was only issued a license to sell the meat, sourced from the Deonar abattoir, and hence could not use it as a permission to slaughter at his shop.After hearing the submissions, the bench directed the butcher to refrain from slaughtering any animal in the building premises or any other place apart from the Deonar abattoir and disposed the petition. The order gains prominence ahead of Bakri Eid, on August 1, during which members of the Muslim community offer sacrifices by slaughtering goats and sheep.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/animal-slaughter-not-allowed-in-private-premises-bombay-hc/story-T3OFLxCMAndBEeivihxYKJ.html
25-07-2020||Mumbai||43,000 litres of smuggled diesel worth ₹35 lakh seized from Mumbai, 3 held||City crime branch officers on Thursday arrested three members of a gang, after 43,104 litres of smuggled diesel worth ₹35 lakh was found from a tugboat at Mazgaon. The officers suspect that the accused may have smuggled the diesel from other foreign commercial vessels in the sea. The accused were produced in a local court on Friday and remanded in police custody up to July 27.On July 18, assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze, in-charge of the crime intelligence unit (CIU), received intelligence on the movement of some members of a diesel smuggling racket. Acting on the intelligence, Vaze’s team visited a jetty at Bhaucha Dhakka (Ferry Wharf) in Mazgaon.They found a boat, Barsaatu, at the spot. According to the police, the boat is owned by Hind Offshore Private Limited, which has an office at Ballard Estate. Barsaatu has been sailing at Ferry Wharf since May 29, and there were nine crew members on board.On examining the tugboat in the presence of the panchas (witnesses) the police found the allegedly smuggled diesel. When crime branch officers asked the boat’s chief engineer Debashish Vishwas, 48, and sailing master Ismail Mujawar, 59, about the ferrying diesel in such large quantity, they could neither produce any documents, nor were able to provide satisfactory answers on it. The officers then asked the duo to produce the relevant documents by July 21 but they failed to do so.A preliminary probe revealed that the boat was not used for any operations by the company from the past three years.“Investigators suspects that using the boat, the accused either stole diesel or illegally procured it from other foreign vessels in the sea to sell it in the black market,” said a crime branch officer.After the probe, the police arrested the boat’s superintendent Rajesh Kute, Vishwas and Mujawar under the relevant sections of the Essential Commodities Act and the Indian Penal Code.The police are looking to question the directors of the company.Ravi Hirani, the accused’s counsel, said, “My clients have purchased the seized diesel legally and have documents to prove the purchase. The diesel has not been stolen. Had that been the case, then why is there not a single complaint against my clients till date. This is a totally false case against my clients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/43-000-litres-of-smuggled-diesel-worth-35-lakh-seized-from-mumbai-3-held/story-x32h4TRynhjDKvTUgS53HN.html

25-07-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC says restriction on aged artists at movie, TV sets is ‘discriminatory’||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday observed that the state’s prohibition on the cast and crew members above 65 years of age from attending studios or outdoor shootings amid the Covid-19 pandemic appears to be a case of discrimination.The bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Riyaz Chagla questioned why only aged film and television artists were prevented from stepping out for work, even as shop keepers who are above 65 years of age are allowed to sit at their shops throughout the day.The court was hearing the government’s response on a petition filed by 70-year-old actor Pramod Pandey, who claimed that though he is physically fit, the state’s rule deprived him of the only source of livelihood.Government lawyer Purnima Kantharia pointed out that restriction was based on the number of orders issued by the central and the state governments from time to time. She added that aged persons have been instructed right from the beginning to not step out, except for essential supplies.Kantharia also pointed out that no individual, other than those engaged in essential services, are allowed to travel on trains or by air. She also said that private offices are also allowed to function only with 10℅ staff.After hearing the state’s response, the court appointed senior advocate Sharan Jagtiani as amicus curiae (friend of the court) to assist HC in arriving at a proper decision on the petition. The final hearing is scheduled for July 29.In the meanwhile, the court directed the government to file an affidavit by Saturday, setting out the basis for imposing the restriction, and to clarify if any data, statistics or report was taken into consideration before issuing such a restriction.On Tuesday, Pandey, who has been earning his livelihood by performing small roles in films and television serials from the past 40 years, challenged a clause in the guidelines issued by the state on May 30, on the shooting of film and television serials. Pandey had also claimed that perusal of the available data makes it clear that a majority of the Covid-19 patients are below the age of 65. He added that the state’s decision has grave hardship and prejudice will be caused to him, if he was prevented from participating in the shootings, as he will not be able to survive with dignity and self-respect.Based on his petition, the court had then asked the government how physically fit senior citizens were expected to live a dignified life if they were not allowed to go out and earn a livelihood. The court also asked the government to explain where else was such a similar restriction on the movement of aged people imposed by the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-says-restriction-on-aged-artists-at-movie-tv-sets-is-discriminatory/story-DyZOWimSDjPEhHJR9AQSqJ.html

On Thursday, the weather bureau downgraded its warning, predicting only light to moderate showers from Friday to Monday. No alert was issued for Mumbai, Thane and Palghar for Sunday.“A possibility of enhancement of rain activity is expected over the west coast, including Mumbai, for the weekend, following the development of a weather system off north Kerala and Karnataka coasts. This is enhancing the offshore trough and intensifying lower level westerly to southwesterly winds allowing increased moisture incursions along the coast,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, India Meteorological Department (IMD).On Friday, between 8.30am and 5.30pm, the suburbs recorded 10.3mm rain, while south Mumbai recorded 23.8mm rain.

25-07-2020||Mumbai||University of Mumbai to give ₹56 lakh aid to 15 colleges hit by Cyclone Nisarga||Almost two months after Cyclone Nisarga hit parts of Maharashtra, the University of Mumbai (MU) has decided to extend a helping hand to 15 of its affiliated colleges in Raigad and Ratnagiri districts which have sustained damages owing to the calamity. MU on Friday passed a resolution to aid the colleges during the management council meeting.“Based on a visit to the said colleges by the Konkan divisional joint director along with programme officers, a special committee has estimated a financial loss of ₹56 lakh to the 15 colleges in Ratnagiri and Raigad districts,” said a statement released by the university. The circular further said that the amount will be disbursed from the varsity’s disaster management fund and the affected colleges will use the money to purchase administrative and educational essentials, electrical materials and other items lost during the cyclone.Some of these institutes include Loknete Gopinathji Munde Arts Commerce and Science College at Mandangad, Ratnagiri; Tikambhai Metha College and MPS College of Arts and Science at Mangaon, Raigad; NK Varadkar Arts and RV Belose Commerce College at Dapoli, Ratnagiri and Gokhale Education Institute of Arts, Commerce and Science at Shrivardhan, Raigad.MU has clarified that the colleges will not get the collective amount, but they will be given money as per the expenses they incur. “The varsity will reimburse the amount once the said colleges submit the bills of the expenses they incurred to repair damages caused by the cyclone,” said Ravindra Kulkarni, pro vice-chancellor, MU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/university-of-mumbai-to-give-56-lakh-aid-to-15-colleges-hit-by-cyclone-nisarga/story-jiNwwZFfsCjJmkUZV25GSN.html
25-07-2020||Chandigarh||Social distancing norms flouted at MD/MS offline counselling at PGIMER||Social distancing norms went for a toss during the third round of counselling of MD/MS (doctor of medicine/masters of science) courses at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research on Friday.Around 300 candidates were to attend the first offline counselling session for 40 vacant seats. A candidate from Gurugram said they had submitted several representations with the institute for conducting online counselling, but the management had paid no heed to their demand.“It was surprising that the institute of such stature could not mobilise enough resources for maintaining social distancing. No one was asking the candidates and their accompaniments to maintain distance. Strict measures should have been in place,” Dr Rachit Singhania, an aspirant attending the counselling said, who also tweeted a photo of the jam-packed counselling hall.Registrar Manoj Kumar had ordered that “the personal appearance of the applicant (counselling) was mandatory. Candidates coming from states other than Chandigarh should either return within 72 hours to avoid 14-day quarantine or should come prepared to join the course (if allotted a seat) and stay on in Chandigarh. The candidates appearing for counselling should wear face masks and maintain social distancing. The candidates are advised not to accompany more than one person in the counselling hall to maintain social distancing.” Institute’s spokesperson, professor Ashok Kumar, said: “All arrangements for offline counselling were in place. The names of the candidates were announced by the officials from a stage in a staggered manner to avoid crowding. Candidates were repeatedly requested to maintain distance. Moreover, the venue, Bhargava Auditorium, is the biggest auditorium in Chandigarh. Surprisingly, the parents were more interested in sitting with their wards. The onus to follow the norms also lies on the candidates and their families.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/social-distancing-norms-flouted-at-md-ms-offline-counselling-at-pgimer/story-l7r5mCXFpACCFG5033qYrJ.html

25-07-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government plans to acquire 87 hectares around Lonar lake||The Maharashtra forest department has submitted a proposal to the district collector of Buldhana to acquire land admeasuring 87 hectares (ha) around the Lonar Crater Lake in Buldhana to ensure its protection. This area forms an ejecta blanket around the 77.69-ha lake, which is a meteorite-impact crater that occurred almost 50,000 years ago and is a rare cosmic phenomenon. The ejecta blanket is the material debris surrounding it. The proposal was submitted last week to the district collector’s office based on the submissions of a December 2019 technical committee, appointed by the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) in October 2019. The report had directed that the ejecta blanket be protected to ensure conservation and prevent further degradation of the site. Though HC had banned any construction within 500 metres (m) around the crater rim in 2015, peripheral areas include government offices, schools, and a section of Lonar town. Nearly 20% of the ejecta blanket comprises settlements while the remaining 80% is free human disturbances, the report stated. According to the latest proposal, nine plots of private land spread across 86.94 ha will be acquired from farmers. “Bringing it under the state’s jurisdiction will allow enhanced and safe scientific research, and nullify any threats to the blanket,” said Manoj Khairnar, deputy conservator of forest, Akola. Located 500 km from Mumbai and over 90 km from Buldhana city, the oval shaped Lonar Lake is a part of the 365.25-ha Lonar Wildlife Sanctuary. The crater rim crest has a continuous ejecta blanket extending across an average of 1,410 metres. Currently, only 1.22 hectare area is protected as part of the sanctuary through fencing (see images). “An additional 1,750 m of the blanket is yet to be fenced at a cost of Rs. 30 lakh. Funds are awaited under the regional tourism development plan for various departments,” said Khairnar. The technical committee, comprising geologists from the Central University of Karnataka and an independent geologist from Navi Mumbai, had carried out field visits in September and November last year. “Conservation and promotion of Lonar should be done as a hub of international scientific research and promotion of educational activities. Thus, maintenance should be handed over to the forest department,” the report read. Meanwhile, one of the HC petitioners suggested the area will be better protected if made part of the sanctuary. “Recurring development pressures persist for decades. The Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, had first suggested the protection of the black diamond in 2006. However, 15 years later, nothing has happened. Real-estate development concerns combined with profitable intent of private farmers who acquired land at low rates several decades ago but now intend on selling them, five times higher will make acquiring this unprotected crater debris a difficult process,” said Sudhakar Bugdane, petitioner and member of a 2002 committee to conserve the crater site. Further highlighting the threat to the ejecta blanket, the HC in an order delivered on July 22 directed state agencies to develop detailed project reports for the Lonar-Manth bypass road and the Lonar-Kinhi-Saraswati road to ensure the eco-sensitive area around Lonar Wildlife Sanctuary, including parts of the black diamond, are not affected. Suman Chandra, district collector and magistrate, Buldhana, could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts. NATURAL FACTORS LED TO CHANGE IN LONAR LAKE COLOUR, NOT POLLUTION: BOMBAY HC The Nagpur bench of HC on Wednesday took cognisance of reports submitted by research bodies such as the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, Agharkar Research Institute, Pune, and the Geological Survey of India regarding the change in the colour of the water in Lonar Lake, which turned pink in June. “The conclusions and findings of these reports are almost similar. The common conclusion is that change of colour of the water of the lake has occurred on account of natural reasons and the factors responsible for the same are dunaliella algae and halobacteria (salt-loving bacteria). These organisms, as per reports, release a substance called carotenoid under stress conditions. This substance is pink in colour, which turns the water pink. They also indicate that pollution was not the cause for this phenomenon,” said HC in its order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-plans-to-acquire-87-hectares-around-lonar-lake/story-ZZhXqFb0Hq1rLep7pjmHcI.html
25-07-2020||City||Deceased Mohali petrol pump owner had been fighting disparity in fuel rates||The 76-year-old Mohali-based petrol pump owner, who died by suicide on July 22, had also written a letter to the Punjab governor in September 2019, seeking permission to end his life. He had cited huge losses to Mohali filling stations due to the substantial difference in fuel rates in Chandigarh as the reason.In his letter, Chawla, who owned two petrol pumps in Mohali and Fatehgarh Sahib, had stated that due to non-revision of VAT by Chandigarh administration, he was robbed of 80% business, as his pumps were situated quite close to Chandigarh.Ashwinder Singh Mongia, president, Mohali District Petroleum Dealers Association, said the deceased suffered huge losses due to VAT rates. He had been fighting for uniformity of fuel rates, but finally gave up. “Dealers in Punjab, whose pumps are located on the Chandigarh border, are the worst affected. When they can bring parity in liquor prices why not in fuel rates?” Mongia questioned.ALSO READ: Suicide note names at least 13, FIR against six NUB OF THE MATTERAccording to petrol pump dealers in Mohali and Panchkula, over the past three years, the Chandigarh administration dropped VAT rates twice in October 2017 and October 2018, resulting in a “total shift” of trade to Chandigarh (see box for VAT).The dealers are also resentful about Chandigarh petrol pumps putting up boards advertising cheaper rates in Chandigarh against those in Mohali and Panchkula.A comparison of sales figures of fuel stations in the tricity over the past three years, exhibits a sharp slide in sales at Mohali and Panchkula. Mohali’s sales dropped by 42% as of June this year. In the corresponding period, Chandigarh doubled its diesel sales, while Panchkula’s sales have dipped by 40%.UT adviser Manoj Parida said, “We understand the concerns of petrol pump owners in Mohali. But instead of asking us to increase VAT, they should ask the Punjab and Haryana governments to slash the rates. We follow central government’s instructions for consumers’ benefit. Besides, we recently increased VAT to 22.45%.”ALSO READ: Family demands all accused be brought to task||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/deceased-mohali-petrol-pump-owner-had-been-fighting-disparity-in-fuel-rates/story-XVF1iNMbP85xtVxJuLu4LP.html

25-07-2020||City||Suicide note by Mohali petrol pump owner names at least 13, FIR against six||The nine-page suicide note written by a Mohali-based petrol pump owner, who died by suicide on Wednesday night, mentions at least 13 names, including officials of Chandigarh administration, a petroleum corporation, Punjab Police and a close family member, but the FIR has been registered against only six. Police say they may add more names as investigation progresses.The 76-year-old deceased, a resident of Sector 69, Mohali, owned two petrol pumps – one in Phase 7, Mohali, and another in Patrasi, Fatehgarh Sahib. “I hereby confirm and declare truth that I have committed suicide due to harassment by officials of an oil corporation,” he wrote in the suicide note, while naming six officials.Alleging that officials of the UT administration, an oil firm and Punjab Police forced him to sell a property, he wrote: “By way of cheating and conspiracy, they snatched my property in the name of my wife (name concealed) at Daun on Chandigarh-Kharar road with the help of Punjab Police and an official of the oil firm.”He also wrote about complaining to senior officials of the company, but no action was taken.Mentioning how he was incurring monthly loss of Rs 80 lakh due to difference in VAT rates between neighbouring states, he wrote: “I had gone bankrupt due to lowering of VAT rates of petrol and diesel at Chandigarh by UT administration at the behest of (one private business dealer) and other dealers at Sector 49 and 52 by bribing Chandigarh (officers).”ALSO READ: Deceased had been fighting disparity in fuel ratesHe laid the blame of “compelling circumstances” on officials of the oil company and others (names withheld) for being “the root cause of looting my right to earn my bread.”The deceased also wrote that he had signed an agreement to purchase a house in Sector 9 with a woman, who cheated him as she was not legally allowed to sell the house in 2005-06. He said one of close family members had also “joined hands with UT police”.The note further read that he was a simple businessman who could not fight corrupt officials of the oil company and UT administration, a private dealer, the woman with whom he finalised the properly deal and her son-in-law, with an appeal to lodge FIR against all culprits.After finding this note on Thursday night, UT Police have booked the six officials of an oil firm under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) of the Indian Penal Code on the complaint of the deceased’s 47-year-old son, who lives in Sector 15, Chandigarh.“In his suicide note, he specifically named six people, while mentioning a series of events and names of several others.

25-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s PGIMER to begin antibody testing||The Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) has received kits for conducting antibody testing of recovered patients to diagnose the presence of antibodies in their plasma for potential donation.Professor Ratti Ram Sharma, head of the transfusion medicine department, said that the tests will be required for sorting out eligible donors. “Evidence so far suggests that the antibodies disappear quickly in asymptomatic cases. The only difference now will be that the antibody test will give us confidence about their presence in the recovered patients.”“This kind of testing will not be used for detection of infection,” he added.As per the advisory of the Indian Council of Medical Research, the UT administration is using only the RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) method of Covid testing.PLASMA CENTRE OPENED IN PANCHKULAAssembly speaker Gian Chand Gupta on Friday inaugurated Haryana’s fifth plasma centre here in Panchkula.The opening of the centre officially heralds the beginning of plasma donation in the district. What’s more, a shopkeeper of Rajiv Colony voluntarily donated plasma on the first day.Gupta said that the number of Covid infected patients had increased in the district in the last few days. “Till now the treatment was done with oxygen and steroid systems, but these are not effective in the treatment of severely-ill patients. Plasma therapy is needed,” he said.According to Dr Saroj Aggarwal, a consultant at civil hospital, an antibody called Copla remains in the body even after a person has been cured, which can then be used for another patient even after 28 days. Plasma will be kept at the centre at a temperature of minus 40 degrees. The sample can be used for one year.An official statement mentioned that this treatment will be given free in government hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-pgimer-to-begin-antibody-testing/story-NHBGgvWliMpS63ZaHo0QlJ.html
25-07-2020||Chandigarh||Panel rejects Chandigarh MP Kirron Kher’s proposal to build nursing homes on residential plots||A panel of the UT administrator’s advisory council on Friday rejected the proposal by Chandigarh MP Kirron Kher for allowing conversion of residential plots into sites for nursing homes.In a meeting of the standing committee on urban infrastructure and planning in the city held through video-conferencing on Friday, members deliberated on the issue and rejected the proposal. “These are purely commercial activities and offer expensive healthcare facilities. Members were of the opinion that these create lots of inconvenience to the residents like traffic congestion and parking problems,” said Davinder Singh Babla, Congress councillor and committee member.The committee was directed to consider the proposal after Kher had asked the administration to allow the same. Advocating more private health facilities in city’s residential areas, Kher had written, “If new private nursing homes are allowed in residential areas across Chandigarh as prevalent in neighbouring states, it will certainly decrease burden on government hospitals; rather people will get better health facilities at their doorstep. This will generate more employment opportunities for medical and paramedical staff too.”Since 2005, the administration hasn’t allowed construction of new nursing homes in residential areas.The panel suggested that like other commercial establishments, sites for the nursing homes could be allotted in commercial areas. “Industrial areas can be used for building new nursing homes. Many industrial plots are lying unused and may be utilised by allowing health care facilities like nursing homes to come up here. Members suggested that the administration should permit the same,” said a committee member requesting anonymity.The committee members also suggested that better health facilities at affordable rates could be provided by augmenting the infrastructure and facilities in the city’s dispensaries. “We already have adequate infrastructure in sectors that should be strengthened and improved upon,” the member said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panel-rejects-chandigarh-mp-kirron-kher-s-proposal-to-build-nursing-homes-on-residential-plots/story-Bd5RX124ii5Sn15VjYTrxI.html
25-07-2020||Chandigarh||Smart classrooms in Chandigarh’s govt schools to be social distancing compliant||In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the smart classrooms being developed by the Chandigarh Smart City Ltd (CSCL) in government schools will adhere to the social distancing norms.There is proposal to set up 90 smart classrooms in four government schools of the city. A primary school in Sector 22, three senior secondary schools in sectors 35 and 43 will be equipped with interactive boards, projectors, smart lighting, fire alarms, etc., and seating in consonance with the social distancing norms.Confirming the development, CSCL chief general manager NP Sharma said, “Following social distancing norms in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic has become a priority. After detailed deliberations, it was decided to make changes in the seating plan. Now, there will be individual benches for every student instead of two students sharing a bench.” The classroom strength will remain the same, he said.The changed plan will add to the cost of the project. Originally, the project was to cost around Rs 5 crore. “The new furniture requirements will add around Rs 1.5 crore to the project cost,” said Sharma.The CSCL is revising the modalities of the tender it floated for the project.The successful bidder will have to set up the smart classrooms, provide the furniture, in addition to supply, installation, testing, commissioning, operation and maintenance for 5 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/smart-classrooms-in-govt-schools-to-be-social-distancing-compliant/story-pQL2winLjFEONWcVhjcvaN.html
25-07-2020||Chandigarh||Faulty tracks put brakes on rising popularity of cycling in Chandigarh||At a time when Chandigarh administration is making ambitious plans to promote cycling, badly designed cycling tracks have put the brakes on the rising popularity of cycling in the city.The city has more than 190 km of cycle tracks, and an additional 20 km are in the works. The administration, through Chandigarh Smart City Ltd, is also preparing to roll out a public bicycle sharing system by December this year. At the same time, due to the restrictions imposed in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak, an increasing number of residents are opting for cycling to maintain fitness.But, for regular users of cycle tracks, like Shilpa Das, it is not a smooth ride and sometimes even dangerous to cycle on these tracks. Das, an architect, pointing out basic flaws in design at several junctions and locations, said, “Riding along the tracks, the movement is constrained because their width is not constant. There are awkward and abrupt cuts and joints on the track, and no proper turn angles are provided. There are no kerbs provided at edges to give strength and visual symmetry.”Track surfaces have also been damaged, say cyclists. “There are up to ten places where the cycle tracks have broken areas because sloping hasn’t been done right and water collects, creating potholes. At other places, obstacles like trees or electric pole break cyclists’ movement. Sometimes, these tracks go too close to peoples’ house walls,” said RK Garg, a city-based social activist and cycling enthusiast.MISSING AMENITIESApart from the damaged, badly laid out tracks, additional infrastructure is also missing. “Benches for resting, water points, repair kiosk, street lighting, signage and parking facilities should also be provided, which are missing now,” said Das.In some locations, the UT is yet to complete the cycle tracks. “In areas like Dhanas, Malloya, Sector 25, and other such areas, where large number of people use cycles as a necessity and not recreation, there are no cycle tracks. Even though the administration has approved it, the engineering department is yet to construct these,” said Akhil Bansal, a resident of Dhanas.REPAIRS BEING DONE, MORE AMENITIES COMINGStating that 80% of the repair work has already been completed, Mukesh Anand, UT chief engineer, said, “After conducting a survey of the tracks, we undertook repair work. It is a continuous and recurring work. We have also undertaken tree pruning, repaired leakages, and recarpeted broken tracks. Some of the repairs like on a stretch near Rose garden will be initiated soon.”On the complaints of lack of proper right of way and continuity of movement, Anand, said, “We want to save trees, and so at some places width is less, and tracks meander.”Anand assures that amenities like cycle stands and water points are also being planned, “We will create cycle stands in more areas as we have done near lake,” he said.“In areas like Dhanas, we are in the process of constructing tracks. At some places, we will have new tracks, and in other locations we will have to curve out on the road,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/faulty-tracks-put-brakes-on-rising-popularity-of-cycling-in-chandigarh/story-TUX2jzmPD4AIdIc0UnpBiM.html
25-07-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM rejects Suresh Kumar’s resignation, asks him to resume work||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday turned down the resignation of his chief principal secretary Suresh Kumar, asking him to return to work.The CM’s decision was conveyed to Kumar by chief secretary Vini Mahajan. The chief secretary wrote to Kumar, informing him that the resignation has not been accepted by the chief minister and he is requested to continue as such, according to sources. The chief secretary’s letter was in response to Kumar’s resignation and letter relinquishing charge on July 15.He will meet the chief minister on Monday and is likely to get back to work thereafter, they said. Mahajan declined to speak on the matter. The chief principal secretary, who has been upset over the government not defending his appointment strongly in a high court case, stopped attending to official work last week. He was neither attending any official meetings nor accepting files. On Monday, he even relieved his personal staff and sent back his official vehicles. Though there was speculation after he met with the chief minister on Wednesday that he would return to work, Kumar appeared to dig his heels in on the court case challenging his appointment as the chief minister’s topmost aide.Kumar has been sore with the advocate general’s office for quite some time for not “defending” the appointment order strongly and not pushing the case for an early decision. He has made no secret of his unhappiness over the Damocles’ sword hanging over his head for the past 40 months due to the court case even though similar post-retirement appointments have been made in Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and several states across the country.Kumar, who has tendered his resignation from the post thrice earlier over this issue, left his charge this time as no one from the state’s legal team was present in the high court for the case when it was listed for hearing on July 15. As per the protocol put in place by the high court in the view of the Covid-19 outbreak, an application is to be filed by either of the parties if an urgent hearing is required in pending cases. No application was moved by the state’s legal team or the petitioner for urgent hearing, and the case was not taken up. It is now listed for September 14.When contacted, AG Atul Nanda refused to comment. However, sources in the AG’s office said there was no delay on their part. They said most of the adjournments in the matter have been taken by Ramandeep Singh, and not the state of Punjab), or taken up by arguments by the original petitioner on May 16, November 13, (2018) and February 13 (2019). The case was adjourned by the high court for the paucity of time on July 11, October 16 (2018), January 10, and May 23 (2019).Sources said the only times when the state was required to seek an adjournment was on March 26, 2019, for filing of a reply to an application and then on April 17, 2018, and May 23, 2019, for non-availability of senior advocate P Chidambaram. “During the last effective hearing, the matter was adjourned to February 21, 2020, which was later declared as a public holiday by the high court on account of Mahashivratri and hence had to be adjourned when the matter got auto listed on February 24”. The state went into lockdown thereafter, the high court was closed and only fresh urgent cases filed were being heard by the high court through video-conferencing.A retired 1983-batch IAS officer, Kumar was handpicked by Amarinder for the coveted assignment in March 2017. His induction was challenged on August 4, 2017, in Punjab and Haryana high court, and a single-judge bench, in its order on January 17, 2018, quashed the appointment. The state government filed a Letter Patents Appeal (LPA) and the single-bench’s order was stayed by a division bench on February 14, 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-cm-rejects-suresh-kumar-s-resignation-asks-him-to-resume-work/story-zPmjB9hDYkpZTw2ihTRP1K.html

25-07-2020||City||UP may have to tweak timeline for trillion dollar economy||The Uttar Pradesh government may have to tweak a bit the timeline set to achieve the objective of making the state a trillion dollar economy in five years.A delay is expected in the selection of the consultant to work out a roadmap to take the state’s GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) to the one trillion dollar level by 2025. Such a delay may occur following the Uttar Pradesh government’s decision to amend the request for proposal (RFP) and timelines to accommodate suggestions made at an online pre-bid meeting held on June 29.A 41-page comprehensive request for proposal (RFP), along with an approved timeline, was provided online as the state government invited e-bids ‘for selection of consultant to provide services to boost up the size of GSDP of Uttar Pradesh to one trillion dollars in five years (2020-2025)’.“An important amendment is expected in RFP following suggestions received at the online pre-bid meeting held on June 29, 2020. An amended RFP with new timeline will soon be uploaded on the website of the planning department and the e-tender portal after seeking permission from competent levels,” said Ankit Kumar Agarwal, special secretary, planning department, in a notice dated July 15.Although a definite date for commencement of work by the consultant was not quoted in the present RFP, the timelines given therein mentioned July 27, 2020 for presentation and evaluation of the technical bids. “We are not sure about the revised timeline for completing the bidding process. A meeting of the high powered committee chaired by the chief secretary has considered the amendments on July 3, 2020 and the revised RFP will be sent to the state cabinet’s approval soon,” said a senior officer on condition of anonymity.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has time and again said the state government will be working hard to achieve the objective of taking the state’s GSDP to one trillion level in five years. Will the process of amendment to RFP have an impact on the timeline? “There has been no deviation and no change has been made in the timeline for achieving the objective of making the state a trillion dollar economy in five years,” said KB Raju, advisor, finance, to the chief minister.A GSDP of Rs 15.80 lakh crore (US $ 230 billion) has been quoted for 2018-2019 in RFP floated online with economy witnessing 7% growth over the previous year. With the state government’s tax revenue coming down considerably in the fight against the Covid-19 , the state’s growth rate is likely to be adversely affected and such a situation will throw more challenges to policy makers. “It’s good that the state government has taken the initiative of working out a roadmap for making the state a trillion dollar economy. Since the timeline for RFP is being revised, the state government will have to redouble its efforts to meet the objective of a trillion dollar economy. The current year is already a difficult one in view of Covid-19 pandemic and this will add to state government’s challenges,” said Yashvir Tyagi, professor (retired) of economics, Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-may-have-to-tweak-timeline-for-trillion-dollar-economy/story-hnA2ZmkSZ4HAZr2yBBIMvL.html
25-07-2020||Mumbai||Students allege error in admission process at TISS||Prospective students of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai, have alleged discrepancies in the marking scheme of the admission process. The students have also written to the institute administration pointing out the errors.The candidates have alleged that their final marks were not adherent to the weightage allotted to their TISS National Entrance Test (NET) and personal interview scores. The institute allots 60% weightage to TISSNET and 40% to a personal interview. “The scores appear skewed in favour of those who appeared for the interview online,” a candidate said on conditions of anonymity. Moreover, candidates pointed out that the marks obtained by candidates who appeared for in-person interviews in March were lower than those obtained by candidates who appeared for online interviews.While a few candidates had completed their online interview in March, ahead of the lockdown, the institute switched to the online mode of interviews in June to complete the admission process. Progressive Students Forum (PSF), a student organisation at TISS, has written to the institute on behalf of the candidates and demanded transparency in the admission process. One of the issues raised by PSF is that some candidates from the general category have been allotted seats in the OBC (NC) category.The group has asked for clarification on the discrepancies from the administration. “The institute should make the complete data of candidates public, which should include data points like the total number of people who have applied, the number of people who have appeared for the admission process and the mode (online /offline PI), their original score, weighted score and the category under which they have been offered admission,” said the letter by PSF.The institute administration admitted that it has received representations from students regarding suspected errors in the calculation of the final score. In a clarification issued to students on its website, the administration said there was an error in the marks of candidates who attended offline interviews. This was, however, restricted to the MA in applied psychology (with specialisation in clinical and counselling practice) programme offered by the School of Human Ecology.A senior official said that the administration is rectifying the error and the final marks will be revised for such candidates. The institute said it had verified the entire marking scheme and software for all other courses and did not find any error.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/students-allege-error-in-admission-process-at-tiss/story-N0TXsfGmphhT9ymonjOXtK.html
25-07-2020||Mumbai||Sharad Pawar begins tour of Maharashtra districts||As the number of Covid-19 cases continues to rise in Maharashtra, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar has started to visit the cities and districts to take stock of the situation. Pawar, while visiting Nashik on Friday, said that they were of the view that some people should start field visits and submit their observations to chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray to help him make policy decisions. He, however, clarified that the CM too was keen on visiting districts and will take a call on it soon. “Some of us were of the view that some people should go in the field and submit observations to the chief minister to help him make policy decisions, that is why we are here,” Pawar told reporters after attending the review meeting, along with health minister Rajesh Tope.Pawar further said that the situation of the pandemic in the financial capital is under control. “The chief minister is keen on visiting districts and will take the decision on it soon,” he said.The 79-year old veteran leader will be visiting Aurangabad on Saturday to review the Covid-situation.Though CM Uddhav Thackeray is yet to start the tour to review the Covid-19 situation in the state, he has been taking virtual review meetings regularly. According to officials from the chief minister office (CMO), Thackeray is likely to start visiting regional headquarters from next week. However, the schedule is yet to be finalised.Pawar while praising Thackeray said, “CM has put in a lot of hard work and worked day and night in the last few months. His hard work in Mumbai is showing results.”On Tuesday, the state government barred the state officials from attending meetings called by the Opposition leaders including non-governmental members, members of parliament (MP) and members of legislative Assembly (MLC). The decision comes after the leader of Opposition in the legislative Assembly Devendra Fadnavis toured the state to review the Covid-19 situation. Leader of Opposition in the legislative council Pravin Darekar too visited various Covid care centres and hospitals.NCP leaders said that the tour was first started by the NCP chief as he was first one to tour Raigad and Ratnagiri districts after Cyclone Nisarga. Before that, he visited field hospitals at Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) and NSCI, Worli in Mumbai, developed by the state.“We have not barred the officials from attending the meetings. The decision was taken by the erstwhile BJP government headed by Devendra Fadnavis on March 11, 2016. Our government has decided to continue their decision,” said an NCP functionary on conditions of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sharad-pawar-begins-tour-of-maharashtra-districts/story-jhaIB8dBBgbectbVVi4bJK.html
25-07-2020||Mumbai||Ensure proper disposal of Covid-19 biomedical waste: HC directs MPCB||RThe Bombay high court (HC) on Friday directed the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to ensure that Covid-19 biomedical waste is properly disposed of by scrupulously complying with the provisions of the Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016.The bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Madhav Jamdar also directed MPCB to take prompt action against the civic authority concerned, if it finds any violation of the waste disposal rules.The directives were issued in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Dombivli resident Kishor Sohoni regarding the appropriate disposal of biomedical waste. Sohoni alleged that though prevailing rules mandate scientific disposal of biomedical waste, the waste generated at Covid-19 treatment centres at Kalyan was being dumped at Adharwadi dumping ground by garbage collectors.Sohoni’s PIL, filed through advocate Sadhana Kumar, stated that such dumping of contaminated waste is dangerous, considering the spread and intensity of the Covid-19 infection.“During the pandemic, direct disposal of biomedical waste from Covid hospitals is a serious threat to human life, and should be stopped immediately,” stated the PIL. “Rigorous monitoring is required to ensure such waste does not end up infecting others, including garbage collectors,” it added. MPCB, however, maintained that no Covid-19 biomedical waste was found at Adharwadi dumping ground when officers of the board and Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) jointly inspected the site.In its affidavit, MPCB stated that the civic body had set up a dedicated site for disposal of biomedical waste at Umbarde, where the contaminated waste generated at Covid-19 treatment centres was disposed scientifically.Thirty common facilities have been set up for treatment and scientific disposal of Covid-19 biomedical waste generated across Maharashtra. The waste is being collected by common treatment facility operators for scientific disposal at the dedicated sites, the affidavit added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ensure-proper-disposal-of-covid-19-biomedical-waste-hc-directs-mpcb/story-9uGI0buIIv4gI8tKJ2X9zI.html
25-07-2020||Mumbai||No-go for Mumbai local trains yet; new rules for taxis, autos soon||Four months after the lockdown was imposed in the city to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, public transport is unlikely to resume on a full scale any time soon. Local train services, which are otherwise used by around 80 lakh passengers daily, continue to remain suspended for commuters, except those working in essential services. Experts have suggested that the Railways should not resume local train services for the general public until September. Since June 15, Western Railway (WR) and Central Railway (CR) have been operating nearly 700 services for essential service providers. Within the city, Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) resumed partial operation of its bus services since June 1. It has started operating 3,200 buses daily, with only 30 passengers allowed per bus. Black and yellow taxis and autorickshaws in the city are operating with only two passengers per vehicle and can carry only people working in essential services and in cases of emergency. Emergency travel has only been allowed by mobile application-based cabs. The state government has formed a transport task force to suggest a plan to resume regular services of taxis and autorickshaws in the city. According to a member of the task force, they have already submitted their suggestions to the state government. “An announcement by the state government regarding the operation of taxis and autorickshaws will be made soon. Suggestions have been submitted.” said the task force member. Rail commuters will have to wait longer to use local trains though. “There have been no discussions on the starting of local train services for the public in the city. The cases are decreasing in the city, but the situation in other regions outside Mumbai should also stabilise before resuming train services.” said a senior CR official. Railway and transport experts have suggested that the Railways not resume local train services until September. Experts have also suggested that air-conditioned (AC) local trains should not be operated till the Covid threat is under control.“Fresh air circulation on a non-AC train is much higher and decreases the chances of the virus spreading. Maintaining social distance inside local train compartments will not be possible, so the railways should focus on temperature screenings and mandate masks inside the compartments. Train services should not resume until September,” said Subodh Jain, former railway board member and ex-general manager of Central Railway.Transport experts have also suggested that the Railways could explore the option of allowing one person per week inside the compartments. “Railways can explore the option of allowing railway pass-holders to travel only once a week. This way, people can complete their chores. There should also be services provided between Borivli and Virar,” said transport expert AV Shenoy. Meanwhile, CR and WR are undertaking various measures to maintain social distancing and safety on suburban and outstation train stations. It is now mandatory for essential service employees to produce QR-based e-passes to travel by local trains. Outstation train passengers will also have to undergo thermal screenings.CR has developed a mobile application under corporate social responsibility (CSR) for outstation train passengers, through which tickets can be checked. The railway also plans to introduce flap gates at which the QR codes on passengers’ tickets will be scanned, before allowing them to enter the station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-go-for-mumbai-local-trains-yet-new-rules-for-taxis-autos-soon/story-jbH2SFE0xtCs6OPzIz4BxI.html

Jain has filed a complaint with the police after the said audio clip was found doing rounds on social media platforms, following which Navghar police in Bhayander (East) registered a first information report (FIR).In the fake clip, the imposter, mimicking Jain’s voice, alleges of corrupt deals by the state government in the name of combatting Covid-19.

25-07-2020||Mumbai||Don’t target beggars when civil society members do not follow lockdown too: HC to petitioner||The Bombay high court (HC) questioned a petitioner as to why he was targeting children begging on the streets during Covid-19 while people from civil society do not follow lockdown and safety norms as well. The court has also directed the state to file a reply in compliance with a 2019 order on the action being taken with regards to rescuing and rehabilitating minor children and women who are found begging on the streets.In view of thousands of minors found begging on the streets soon after lockdown norms were relaxed, the petitioner had sought an urgent hearing of a petition filed last year seeking relief for children and women indulging in begging activities. On Friday, a division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Madhav Jamdar, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Pune resident Dhyaneshwar Darwatkar through advocate Shekhar Jagtap in 2019, was informed that the PIL was based on the outcome of a 2016 survey on beggars in Pune city. The survey conducted by NGO Rainbow India Foundation had revealed that there were more than 10,000 children involved in begging in Pune city, of whom 83% belonged to families that live on streets, 15% were street-working children, while 3% lived alone on the streets.Pointing to the urgency for hearing the PIL, Jagtap submitted that since lockdown was relaxed begging activities had commenced, putting the lives of children involved in begging as well as that of the general public at risk in view of Covid-19 situation. While seeking urgent relief for children and women involved in begging, Jagtap submitted that these children and women are ‘live bombs’ and hence directions should be issued to the authorities to rescue and rehabilitate them in homes as per the provisions of Maharashtra Prevention of Begging Act, 1960 and other policies related to rights of children begging on streets.Jagtap also sought directions against police officers who allowed such activities and submitted that the state had failed to comply with orders passed in previous hearings.After hearing the submission the bench questioned, “Why blame only the beggars? Even other members of civil society do not follow social distancing and other norms.” The court added that the police could not be expected to curb begging while they were involved in containing the spread of the virus; hence the petitioner should be ‘sensitive’ while making their arguments. “The entire nation is facing difficult times and it is not right for the petitioner to target beggars only,” said the bench.The court then observed that as the state government had not filed a response to the plea since last year, it was granting a last opportunity to the state and other authorities to file replies in affidavit by August 7, and a rejoinder by the petitioner thereafter. The court posted the matter for further hearing on August 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/don-t-target-beggars-when-civil-society-members-do-not-follow-lockdown-too-hc-to-petitioner/story-VylsS6Rgh8d6kMl4se8mmJ.html

At the time of going to press, the Thane police were in the process of filing an FIR against 12 unidentified men.Gokhale had sought HC direction to restrain the bhoomipujan during a pandemic, on the grounds that it was in violation of the protocol prescribed by the Centre. The court, however, dismissed his petition on Friday. Gokhale’s tweets on BJP leader Devang Dave have led to a demand by the Congress for a probe by the chief election commissioner.According to Gokhale, on Friday evening, 10-12 people gathered near his building, shouted slogans and used abusive language against his family. Gokhale tweeted about the alleged harassment and claimed the group also threatened his mother. The Thane rural police provided protection to Gokhale.Meanwhile, Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh announced a probe into the incident. “@SaketGokhale We are taking very serious cognisance of this and have immediately ordered an enquiry into this issue. We will immediately provide you protection. Thane police have been instructed accordingly. #ZeroToleranceForHooliganism,” he tweeted.Sanjay Hajare, senior inspector, Kashimira police station, said, “There was no one when we reached the building. We checked the videos and took statements of the activist and are now filing a case. We are yet to identify them. We don’t have any confirmation if they belong to the RSS. We are also checking the CCTV footage to get more details of their vehicles.” He said the men would be booked for disobedience of lockdown, unlawful assembly, provocation, criminal intimidation.Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said, “This is how BJP uses its organisations and workers to suppress freedom of expression.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rss-men-shouted-slogans-outside-my-house-alleges-rti-activist/story-rPTq1e5WUxGw2Ei3Vt49mL.html

Teltumbde said he is likely to challenge the extension given to NIA, and he should be released on bail.The special court rejected his plea, observing that the court is not expected to see ifs and buts. The court held that as on today, the agency has time, so the plea is not maintainable.Teltumbde, an engineer and Indian Institute of Management (IIM) graduate who used to teach at the Indian Institute of Technology (Kharagpur) and at the Goa Institute of Management, was arrested after the Supreme Court refused to grant him protection.

25-07-2020||Mumbai||Congress wants CEC probe into BJP leader’s role in polls work||Alleging that the chief electoral officer (CEO) of Maharashtra appointed a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) office-bearer to handle its Facebook page and social media campaigns during the Assembly polls in Maharashtra late last year, the state unit of the Congress has written to the chief election commissioner (CEC), demanding a probe. An official from CEO’s office said the agency was empanelled by the Directorate General of Information and Public Relations (DGIPR). CEO Baldev Singh, issued a clarification, stating: “It is misleading and incorrect to say that the office of CEO has issued any advertisement through any agency on political considerations. As per the standard practice, electoral awareness campaigns are launched through DGIPR. They, in turn, follow a laid down procedure for selecting an appropriate agency for public awareness and not by the CEO office.”Former chief minister and senior Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan alleged in a press conference on Friday that the CEO’s office, which acts on behalf of the Election Commission of India, had appointed Signpost India, which has links with Devang Dave, national coordinator of information technology and social media of the BJP’s youth wing to run its voter awareness campaign on social media. “As per Article 324 of the Constitution, the Election Commission has the power to direct, schedule and control the election and it is duty-bound to conduct the polls in a free and fair manner. The appointment of a BJP office-bearer clearly indicates the CEO office failed in its duty. I have requested the chief election commissioner of India to conduct an inquiry into it,” Chavan said.RTI activist Saket Gokhale on Thursday put out a series of tweets alleging the appointment by the CEO ahead of the Maharashtra Assembly polls. Responding to them, ECI spokesperson Sheyphali Sharan tweeted, “Regarding tweet of Mr Gokhale@SaketGokhale, commission has sought a detailed factual report in this matter from CEO Maharashtra with respect to alleged locale of the incident immediately (sic).” The CEO, Maharashtra’s statement further said: “As far as the specific imputation made in the tweet of Saket Gokhale, an interim reply based on the facts has been sent to the ECI. Meanwhile, some other representations on the matter have been received from some public representatives, which are also being addressed and a detailed response in this regard shall be sent to the commission soon.”Dave, in a text message, said, “The work assigned by the Election Commission to Signpost was after following due process and there was no illegality involved. Can a political activist not work for an honest living? Am I not allowed professional engagements just because I support an ideology? The reputation of people levelling allegations is known to all. These are the people who were against the CAA, and are opposing Ram Mandir.”Chavan said the information related to voters and their demographic details available with the election body is sensitive and can’t be assessed by an outsider. “The confidentiality may have been compromised owing to Dave’s appointment. It needs to be checked if the party benefited out of this link,” he said.Chavan also alleged that Dave’s Facebook profile stated he was a member of the Information Technology board of the state government, even though no such board was constituted officially. “The state government should also probe which board Dave is referring to,” Chavan said.In his letter to CEC, Chavan has raised questions over the process followed while selecting the company and if a background check was done before its appointment. He has also questioned if there was any direct or indirect political pressure on the CEO, Maharashtra to appoint the agency. “Even if he was appointed by DGIPR, it was the duty of the CEO’s office to cross-check the background,” said Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant. BJP’s state vice-president Madhav Bhandari said, “The appointment of the agency led by Dave was not done just because he is a BJP office-bearer. It was done after he complied with all the criteria. Being a political leader or worker does not stop anybody from bagging a government contract if he/she is competent enough for it. Whether to pick the agency from the ones empanelled by DGIPR was the decision to be taken by the CEO office and they will clarify on it. Chavan, as a leader in opposition, should have taken objection at the time of the appointment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/congress-wants-cec-probe-into-bjp-leader-s-role-in-polls-work/story-jFybXh2HptYLauWZQGhL0N.html
25-07-2020||Mumbai||Bring fatalities to zero, CM instructs task force of doctors||Ahead of the government’s plan to roll out more relaxations from the first week of August, chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray has directed the task forces of doctors from various districts to work towards bringing the case fatality rate to zero and ensure better management of patients. The CM spoke with the teams of doctors during a video conference on Friday to brainstorm for better patient management.The task forces from across the state have been directed to follow the example of Mumbai, which has managed to contain the virus and reduce the death rate. After the successful intervention of the 11-member state task force of doctors in Mumbai, the government had appointed such forces in all the other districts. Many districts in the state are witnessing a spike in Covid-19 cases, with poor doubling rate, and high fatality rate. “The fatality rate is more than 3% in the state, and it should be gradually brought down to zero. The coordination between the task forces will be help bring uniformity in the line of treatment, leading to a drop in the fatalities,” said Thackeray. A state government official who was present at the meeting said that the CM also discussed the role of the state-level task force in the clinical management of patients in Mumbai and other cities in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. “Most of the interventions, including anti-viral drugs, were introduced on the suggestions by the doctors in the force,” said the official. The CM also expressed concern for the rising number of cases in rural areas of Maharashtra. “The new trend of the spread in rural parts of the state is a cause for worry as the health infrastructure in these areas is comparatively weak. The guidance of these task force doctors, who are globally renowned names in their respective fields, to the district-level doctors is expected to play an important role,” said the official.Since the state government is planning to roll out more relaxations from August 1, the authorities are expected to be extra cautious. “There will be a spike in cases after the relaxations, but it should not turn into a ‘second wave’ as was witnessed in some other countries. The district-level augmentation of health infrastructure and focused efforts by the administration are more important in this backdrop,” the official added. Thackeray directed the teams of doctors to follow the guidelines for use of antiviral drugs like remdesivir and favipiravir.“The district-level doctors were guided about the utility of the antiviral drugs and management of the oxygen beds, which play a crucial role in saving lives. The dialogue between the state task force members and their counterparts in the districts will help in building confidence among them,” said Dr TP Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research, Mumbai. Dr Sanjay Oak, who leads the state-level task force said that the doctors should avoid unnecessary use of antiviral drugs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bring-fatalities-to-zero-cm-instructs-task-force-of-doctors/story-nhz95IAaOuuJgGMQoM1tvI.html
25-07-2020||Mumbai||‘Direct state, prison authorities to give updates on Rao’s health||The family of veteran Telugu poet P Varavara Rao, 81, who is an accused in the Elgar Parishad case, has approached the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), seeking updates on his health.Rao has tested positive for Covid-19 and is suffering from several other ailments. He was moved from state-run GT Hospital to Nanavati Hospital, following an NHRC order, on Sunday morning.In a letter written on Friday, his wife, P Hemalatha, and daughters, P Sahaja, P Anala, P Pavana, have asked NHRC to intervene and direct the state government and prison authorities to give periodic updates on Rao’s health and share details of the treatment given to him. The family has sought updates every six hours and appointment of a contact person, who they can get in touch with for information related to Rao’s health and treatment. “We are denied information on his condition or treatment at Nanavati Hospital. From the time he was shifted out of Taloja jail to St George’s Hospital to Nanavati Hospital, the only official information provided to the family was that he had tested positive for Covid-19,” the letter states. “The family was not informed, by either hospital or prison authorities, about a head injury discovered on him upon arrival at Nanavati Hospital.”The family has referred to the order passed by NHRC on July 13, directing the prison authorities to provide all necessary medical care and assistance to Rao with intimation to his family members. “It is the family’s right to get routine updates about the medical status of a patient, any treatment that he is undergoing and the risks involved regarding the same. Keeping us in the dark about Rao’s medical status is a flagrant violation of the NHRC directive,” the family alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/direct-state-prison-authorities-to-give-updates-on-rao-s-health/story-d6ruMNss5c4baFFJLhf7fN.html
25-07-2020||Mumbai||BMC widening scope of tracing to shopkeepers, vegetable vendors||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) began its aggressive Covid-19 testing using rapid antigen kits across the city from Friday, testing frontline workers on priority and widening its scope of tracing to shopkeepers and vegetable vendors in high-risk and containment zones. Senior civic officials said the idea was to find positive cases within a short span and quarantine them.The civic body has started to test frontline workers from various health centres, including major and suburban hospitals, dispensaries, health volunteers, health workers working for prevention of other diseases, sanitation workers working under solid waste management department and sanitation workers working in slums.Vishwas Shankarwar, deputy municipal commissioner of zone 7 (Dahisar, Borivli and Kandivli), said, “We are screening and testing all frontline workers from the zone. We are also testing shopkeepers using rapid antigen kits, as they may have come in contact with those testing positive from high-risk or containment areas. Overall, the plan is to conduct 250 tests using rapid antigen kits.”Rapid antigen kits deliver test results within 15-20 minutes, but are less sensitive compared to RT-PCR tests. According to ICMR guidelines, every positive report from testing will be treated as ‘true positive’, while negative samples will have to be compulsorily re-tested by RT-PCR process.BMC had procured one lakh kits in the first week of July from a South Korean firm, which was the only company approved by ICMR. On July 2, BMC had announced that it will start rapid antigen tests in five wards with most Covid-19 cases then – R-North (Dahisar), R-Central (Borivli West), R-South (Kandivli), P-North (Malad) and P-South (Goregaon). However, the plan has now been extended to all 24 administrative wards in the city, and the officials have been asked to identify areas for the tests. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), said, “We are getting positive cases within a short span, so the testing is successful. For symptomatic people who test negative in antigen testing, second analysis is done using RT-PCR so that false negatives are covered. We will surely continue antigen testing process and will procure more kits, if needed.”Till Thursday afternoon, 9,371 people from eight wards, private hospitals and three civic-run hospitals were tested using the antigen kits. Of them, 1,214 tested positive, giving the city a positivity rate of 13%. Meanwhile, on Friday, Mumbai reported 1,057 Covid-19 cases, followed by 54 deaths. The total number of infected cases in Mumbai has reached 106,980 and the toll is 5,984, according to the state health department data. As per BMC’s data, of the 54 deaths, six deaths were of patients below 40 years, 39 of patients above 60 years, and nine between 40 and 60 years. The data further states that 1,157 patients were discharged on Friday. A total of 78,259 patients have been discharged so far. The number of active patients is 22,443. The recovery rate is 73%. Further, the number of Covid tests done till Friday is 4.62 lakh. Meanwhile, Dharavi reported six new cases on Saturday, taking the total to 2,519. Of the total, 2,141 patients have recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-widening-scope-of-tracing-to-shopkeepers-vegetable-vendors/story-3XFlFAyaNvAZ22ZZ3bgKPI.html
25-07-2020||Chandigarh||Fruit growers in Valley fear Covid-19 could play spoilsport||With the first batch of apples ready to arrive in the markets, fruit growers in the Kashmir valley fear Covid-19 could play spoilsport for the industry.Next month, different varieties of Pears, which are considered high value fruit and have a less shelf life, will be ready for harvest. The growers claim that Cherry which is considered the season’s first crop did not fetch money as the dealers who used to make bulk purchases for canning purposes did not turn up in the local mandies.Last year, due to the abrogation of Article 370 followed by strict curfew, fruit growers had suffered huge losses. This time, growers and commission agents are a worried lot due to the restrictions in wake of Covid-19 even though horticulture activities are exempted from the lockdown.President of Fruit Growers Association Parimpora, Bashir Ahmad Bhat, said at present 10 to 20 trucks of early fruit varieties like Bulgarian arrive in the markets, which are consumed locally and only a dozen trucks are dispatched outside the mandies everyday. “From August last year, the growers have suffered huge losses—first due to curfew after abrogation of Article 370 and then the lockdown imposed in wake of Covid-19,” he said.Bhat said even growers who had kept the apples in cold storage with a hope that the markets will fetch them a good price, could hardly make any profits. “This year’s Cherry and Plum crop also did not fetch good prices,” he added.Another grower, Irshad Ahmad, who owns a shop in the fruit mandi at Sopore said they are still hopeful that the markets will get stabilised. “Last year was full of miseries, though we hope things will get better. The mandi is open but the hectic business will pick up only next month onwards,” he said.Ahmad said, “The commission agents from outside who used to make bulk purchases will prefer to stay away from the mandi due to Covid-19. Last year was not good for us and this year too if growers suffer losses, then they won’t be able to repay bank loans.”Adil Malik, a fruit grower from Rafiabad, said fruit is the backbone of Jammu and Kashmir’s economy but growers are a dejected lot. “Last year, it was the economic loss and this year it is this deadly disease and shortage of labour among other things which are worrying factors. As a grower, we have already spent money on pesticides and upkeep of the orchards. We don’t know how it will be in the markets,” he said, adding that the government should come to the rescue of the growers and announce some supportive prices. Around 2.5 million people are directly or indirectly associated with the fruit trade in Kashmir, which fetches around Rs 10,000 crore. The Sopore mandi alone deals with more than 2.5 crore fruit boxes and is considered India’s second largest fruit mandi.Sopore fruit mandi manager said the mandi opens in the morning for a few hours and gets closed due to fresh lockdown restrictions. “The fruit in bulk will start arriving next month and it is then that we will be in a position to say something.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fruit-growers-in-valley-fear-covid-19-could-play-spoilsport/story-Ly5DeFyqMT5JVxIrngSmcO.html
25-07-2020||Mumbai||Maha Covid toll crosses 13,000; tally now 357,117||Covid-19 deaths in Maharashtra breached the 13,000 mark with the addition of 278 fatalities on Friday, taking the toll to 13,132. The rise in deaths is becoming a cause for concern for Maharashtra, which leads the country in Covid-19 casualties, too, along with infections. As many as 5,126 deaths have been reported this month, as against 5,638 in June, 2,286 in May, 449 in April and 10 in March, when the first case was reported. It comes to 213 deaths a day on an average. Friday was the 18th day the state reported over 200 deaths.The state’s case count reached 357,117 after 9,615 infections were recorded on Friday. This has pushed the tally of active cases to 143,714, according to the state health department. Friday was the fourth day the state recorded over 9,000 cases.Meanwhile, Mumbai has maintained stability in the number of fresh cases and deaths with 1,057 and 54 respectively. Its case count stood at 106,989 with 22,443 active infections, while its toll rose to 5,984. While Mumbai saw the most Covid-19 deaths in the city on Friday, Pune city followed at 49, Pimpri-Chinchwad 17, Mira-Bhayander 16 and Kalyan-Dombivli 13. The state’s case fatality rate (CFR) was recorded at 3.68%, a drop from 4.72% on June 24. It continued to be second-highest in the country after Gujarat where the CFR was 4.29% with 2,252 deaths (52,477 cases) till Thursday.Dr Om Shrivastava, infectious diseases specialist and member of the 11-member task force appointed by the state government for clinically ill patients, pointed out two reasons behind the deaths — one was delayed treatment and second, some areas may not be fully prepared to fight the pandemic. “Patients having symptoms found to have delayed the treatment, which results in complications, is the first reason behind Covid casualties. We also have to admit that there may be some centres that are not entirely equipped to understand the urgency of the disease,” Dr Shrivastava said.He, however, stressed that the number of deaths was still among the lowest in the world if compared to the total number of cases. This may be because of immune system, previous vaccination or some other reason that needed to be looked in to. He also said that the Dharavi model of Mumbai needed to be replicated in other parts of the state to contain the spread as well as reduce deaths. Dharavi, once declared as one of the hotspots, is now getting fewer patients and is considered as one of the success stories from the state.Dr Lancelot Pinto, Mumbai-based pulmonologist and epidemiologist, also found delayed diagnosis and ultimately delayed treatment as one of factors contributing to the death rate. “In Mumbai, we have experienced general practitioners have been preferring CT scan tests (of chest) instead of swab test for Covid-19 as the first medical test. After this, they start their treatment and in many cases patient’s condition deteriorates in the second week or so due to low oxygen level. At that time, they cannot be admitted immediately to a Covid hospital because they have not done Covid test,” he said.This may be because patients don’t want to get quarantined and want the doctor to treat them accordingly, he said. Another reason, he believed, is the high number of cardiovascular diseases in younger population. “In a paper published in the Journal of Global Health Science (JGHS) sometime back, it was observed that a significant proportion of people in the age group of 50-60 died in India due to Covid-19 as opposed to the rest of the world where it is beyond 60 years,” Dr Pinto said.To reduce the large number of Covid deaths, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray recently directed the formation of a task-force for clinically ill patients in each and every district of the state. The first such task-force was constituted in Mumbai in April. On Friday, Thackeray chaired a meeting with members of the task-force from all districts and directed them to work in tandem so that the number of casualties can be brought to zero. He said there has to be proper coordination among members of the task-forces and they should also be taking guidance from the Mumbai-based task force as and when required.On Thursday, the state government decided to take up an awareness program about the precautions to be taken by people to remain safe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-covid-toll-crosses-13-000-tally-now-357-117/story-HwVROR0P8hEwH78ENFvbKK.html
25-07-2020||Mumbai||40 cases in 10 days: BMC seals Tardeo housing complex||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Friday sealed Navjivan Society, a residential complex of 17 buildings in Tardeo after 40 Covid-19 positive cases were detected there in the last 10 days. Since April, a total of 55 cases were recorded in the society. The civic body said it has sealed the complex and quarantined the residents of all 730 flats for the next 10 days. According to BMC officials, initially, 15 positive cases were reported at the housing complex since April – mostly of individuals involved in essential services. However, in the last 10 days, 40 additional cases were reported, following which the buildings were sealed.“Cases were being reported from Navjivan Society daily for the past 10 days, and in the last two days alone, we recorded around 10 cases. At present, there are 40 active cases in the society, and this is alarming. Hence, we decided to seal the entire complex of 17 buildings. We are also setting up a camp in the complex to detect more cases,” said Prashant Gaikwad, assistant commissioner of BMC’s D ward, under which Tardeo falls.“There are commercial establishments too that are part of the complex, but their entry and exit are separate. They will be allowed to function normally, but residents will not be allowed to enter or exit the society. However, those involved in essential services can go out. We want to break the chain and bring the situation under control,” Gaikwad added.BMC has started sealing entire buildings instead of just the floor on which a Covid case is detected. This is being done to curb the spread of infection in high-rises. On July 24, HT had reported that BMC was deciding the implement the same rule for housing societies in Dahisar, Borivli, Kandivli, and Malad. In D ward, which covers Tardeo, Malabar Hill, and Grant Road, around 297 residential societies have been sealed. Across the city, 13,203 buildings have been released so far and 6,037 are still sealed.Tardeo corporator Rajendra Narvankar suggested that residents of Navjivan Society are not maintaining social distance. “The residents have complained against the sealing of the building, citing a loss of livelihood, but this is for their own safety. I have asked BMC to check the travel history of the residents, to ascertain the chain of infection. A few residents had gone to their hometowns during the lockdown, and are now returning. We suspect they are spreading the virus among other residents. Also, 40 cases have been reported in the last 10 days, which means the residents are in close physical contact. They need to maintain social distance,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/40-cases-in-10-days-bmc-seals-tardeo-housing-complex/story-xEyFfN6Mj2YI4upGz5hD4L.html

25-07-2020||Mumbai||Four get life term for killing two brothers in 2012||The sessions court on Friday sentenced four men to life imprisonment for killing two siblings at Sakinaka in 2012. The accused entered the house of the deceased and killed them in front of their family for approaching police against them. The court on Friday convicted Rakesh and Sunil Sharma, Abhilash and Brijesh Rai for murder of Avinash Singh and his brother Ashish. The court, however, acquitted Sunita Sharma, Sunil’s wife and sister of Abhilash and Brijesh, who was booked for instigating the four men. According to the prosecution, the incident took place on May 29, 2012, when the Singh family —which included Avinash and Ashish, their parents, their sister — was watching television in their house. The accused barged into their house and assaulted the brothers and their father Jitendra Pratap with sharp weapon. Ashish died on the spot. When Avinash tried to escape, the group chased him outside and killed him too. It was alleged that a few days before the attack, the families had a minor scuffle wherein Sharmas had allegedly assaulted one of the members of Singh family for parking an autorickshaw at their place. Singh family had filed a complaint with the police against Sharma, following which both Rakesh and Sunil were arrested. However, after they were released on bail on May 29, they planned to take revenge and attacked Singh family. The prosecution also alleged that Sunita instigated the brothers against Singh family. However, she was acquitted for want of evidence. The defence denied the prosecution case and claimed that the accused are falsely implicated by the Singh family. Public prosecutor Ashwini Raykar examined around 27 witnesses against the accused to prove the case and argued that one of Singh’s neighbours saw the accused chasing Avinash and assaulting him. The neighbour deposed before the court and identified the accused. The court considered the evidence presented by the prosecution and convicted the four men.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/four-get-life-term-for-killing-two-brothers-in-2012/story-nd6YB5bLqQgtkM0oaFxHwM.html
25-07-2020||City||Woman held for illegal sale of remdesivir, tocilizumab||In the second case of illegal sale of remdesivir and tocilizumab injection in Thane commissionerate, a 50-year-old woman from Ulhasnagar was arrested on Thursday night. The woman was caught selling tocilizumab injection, used for Covid-19 treatment, for ₹60,000 by a team of Ulhasnagar Central police station and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has been booked for cheating under section 420 of the Indian Penal Code.According to police, the arrested accused, Neeta Panjwani, is a housewife and resident of Ulhasnagar. FDA officials received a tip-off and set up a trap. The police sent a dummy customer who struck a deal for tocilizumab injection and nabbed her when she came to deliver it. An FDA official said, “The printed price for the injection was ₹40,545 but the accused was selling it for ₹60,000. She doesn’t have any doctor’s prescription or medical bill. She has not yet revealed how she got it. We are on the lookout for other accused who sold the injection to this woman. We are yet to reach to main dealer. The accused has also sold remdesivir to some people before this.”Earlier this week, Thane anti-extortion cell arrested five accused from Naupada, Thane for illegally selling the drugs for ₹25,000 to ₹50,000.FDA joint commissioner Sunil Bhardwaj said they are carrying out further investigation in both the Thane and Ulhasnagar cases. He said, “We are urging people to not fall for these black marketers. We are requesting everyone to reach to us on 1800222365 to complain if anyone asks for extra money for these injections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/woman-held-for-illegal-sale-of-remdesivir-tocilizumab/story-TNd5mU36RKQqtlt6POc8PO.html
25-07-2020||Mumbai||With rise in demand, state FDA to buy remdesivir from Gujarat firm||The Covid-19 outbreak has led to a sharp rise in the demand for remdesivir and tocilizumab — two drugs that have become essential for the treatment of serious cases of the infection. To meet the demand, Maharashtra’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plans to buy remdesivir from a Gujarat-based company. With the state registering more than 7,000 new cases of Covid-19 daily, there’s been growing demand for remdesivir and tocilizumab, which have been effective in many serious cases of the infection. However, this has also led to a shortage of these drugs in the market as well as overcharging by some retailers. FDA has asked citizens to file complaints about overcharging on its helpline 1800222365. State FDA minister Rajendra Shingne said the government plans to publish the price and availability of the drugs online for transparency. “We have held meetings with manufacturers. We are also in talks with a Gujarat-based company to supply remdesivir to the state. The production will increase soon,” he said. While there are no official figures, it is estimated that more than 40,000 Covid-19 patients in Maharashtra require the two drugs for treatment. Many have complained of shortage and overcharging.For example, on July 23, acting on a tip from a patient, FDA along with Ulhasnagar police’s crime branch caught Neeta Panjwani for selling tocilizumab for ₹60,000 while the maximum retail price (MRP) was ₹40,545. The joint raid was carried out by drug inspector Nishiganda Pashte, Nitin Aher and Sandeep Narawane from the Thane branch of FDA. “The woman was selling the drugs at a higher price without the required prescription. Thus, an FIR [first information report] has been filed against her under the Drugs and Cosmetic Acts, 1940 and Essential Commodities Act, at Ulhasnagar police station,” said Sunil Bhardwaj, vigilance commissioner, FDA. So far, 15 people have been arrested in four separate operations for illegally selling drugs used to treat Covid-19. Remdesivir, an antiviral drug manufactured by Cipla and Hetero Healthcare, is used for the treatment of Ebola and costs ₹5,000 per vial. Tocilizumab is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and is imported by the Indian arm of the multinational pharmaceutical Roche, and marketed by Mumbai-based Cipla. While there are numerous informal reports of shortage and overcharging, few formal complaints have been lodged, which may be due to lack of awareness. “We have launched the toll-free helpline number — 1800222365 — for people to file complaints if they are charged over the MRP. I request people to come forward and file complaints with us. Their anonymity will be maintained,” said AB Unhale, commissioner, FDA, Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/with-rise-in-demand-state-fda-to-buy-remdesivir-from-gujarat-firm/story-bzYInYY1WaxFptsQzQysrO.html
25-07-2020||Delhi||AAP, BJP spar on health workers’ pay||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations on Friday targeted each other over the payment of salaries to health workers and doctors, funds to the civic bodies and the waterlogging problem .Addressing a press meet, senior AAP leaders on Friday said they would start a protest if the corporations did not clear the salaries of doctors in hospitals under their jurisdiction in three days.“It is unfortunate that in Delhi, the capital of India, the medical staff in two hospitals under the BJP-ruled MCD have not received salaries since March. We all talk about respecting doctors, we salute them, and the central government showered flowers from fighter jets to show respect to our Covid warriors. But the BJP cannot pay their salaries,” said AAP’s national spokesperson and Rajendra Nagar MLA Raghav Chadha.Kalkaji MLA Atishi said, “The AAP govt has already disbursed the required amount to the MCDs but due to BJP’s corruption, the doctors are not getting the salaries...When the audit of North MCD was done, financial irregularities of more than three thousand crores were found. In the South MCD also, financial irregularities of more than Rs 1,250 crore were found.”Chadha said, “The BJP has no right to disrespect the health workers and Covid warriors of Delhi…if they do not pay the salaries of the doctors, then AAP will take to the streets for the rights of the health workers.”In response, the Delhi unit of the BJP said, “People of Delhi very well understand that the municipal corporations are passing through extreme financial crunch for almost the last decade and the crisis has worsened ever since the AAP government came to power in Delhi. Before making allegations against MCDs, Raghav Chadha should ask CM Arvind Kejriwal why his government is giving grants as per the third Delhi Finance Commission’s recommendations at a time when they ought to have got payments as per fifth DFC report.”In another press meet, the mayors on Friday alleged the Delhi government departments were to be blamed for the waterlogging crisis. They demanded that funds for this quarter, which has been due to the three civic bodies, be released at the earliest.North mayor Jai Prakash, South mayor Anamika Mithilesh and East mayor Nirmal Jain said funds “due” to the MCDs must be released so that they can pay their staff. The south mayor said they are exploring all possible revenue generation sources . East mayor Jain said, “We had met the team of finance minister Satyendra Jain. The file for disbursement of funds has not moved from his table. Of around Rs 1,600 crore funds due under the planned head as well as BTA (basic tax assignment), only Rs 91 crore has been released so far.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pay-salaries-to-doctors-or-we-will-hit-the-streets-aap-to-mcds/story-LNtWTbMB3fmUrQ4cJsuRzK.html
25-07-2020||Real||Govt looks to ease property registries, to launch portal for officials, applicants||The Delhi government has approved plans to set up a new integrated web portal that will help in properties registrations by acting as a common database and search engine for related documents, which can be accessed not only by officials of the city government but other agencies, a senior government official said on Friday.The move gains significance in light the Centre’s initiative launched last year that allows for 4.5 million residents of 1,700-odd illegal colonies in Delhi to apply for ownership of their properties. The process requires availing a conveyance deed, provided by the Delhi Development Authority, chaired by the Lieutenant Governor, and completion of registry — entrusted under the state government.“The task involves multiple agencies and requires both applicants and officers to dig into numerous documents. They often have to approach different offices under the revenue department, land development department, civic bodies, urban development and departments under the DDA. Often, officials under the various departments end up wasting time looking for documents that some other department may already have in its records. The cumbersome process will be simplified by the integrated web portal,” said a senior official in the Delhi government’s urban development department, which opened tenders for the project last week.The project will bring under one platform all documents related to change of ownership, chain of ownership, loan taken using it as a mortgage, arrear of dues of property tax, water tax, status of litigation in courts among others, as per the tender document, which HT has seen.A senior official in the government’s revenue district said a similar project was initiated in 2012, but was limited in its scope and access, and later affected by technical glitches. A section of the proposed portal will also be accessible to applicants, where they will have options to view and download land records, including certified digitally signed maps in possession of land record agencies of Delhi, and all other property related historical and current information required for registration of property.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-looks-to-ease-property-registries-to-launch-portal-for-officials-applicants/story-JqC3GjaX3cMCwag3i9K3oJ.html
25-07-2020||Delhi||Sisodia asks Centre to review transfer of education director||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, Friday wrote to Union home minister Amit Shah, requesting him to reconsider the transfer of incumbent director of education in Delhi and to allow him to continue, at least till the end of the current academic session.Sisodia’s letter comes a day after the Union home ministry transferred 11 officials, including education director Binay Bhushan, on administrative grounds. He has been transferred to the Andaman Islands. In his letter, Sisodia said the sudden removal of the education director would affect the efforts of his government in supporting the education of children amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Highlighting the 98% pass results of Delhi government schools in the Class 12 exams this year, Sisodia said, “This is probably the first time that state government schools have seen such spectacular results. Soon after the results came out last week, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and I were working with a team of officers and academicians to formulate a strategy so that in the years to come, not a single child in a government school remains uneducated.”Seeking the reason behind Bhushan’s transfer Sisodia said, “It has been only a year since Bhushan took over the as education director. Why did you feel a hurry to remove him from this post and send him out of Delhi? Were you not happy that government schools in Delhi yielded good results? Did you not feel that officials and their teams who have made this possible should be commended and have their work put forth in front of the entire country as a model so that government schools all over the country can get back their lost dignity?”A query sent to the Union ministry of home affairs remained unanswered. The education minister requested the Union home minister to reconsider his decision and allow Bhushan to continue as Delhi education director at least till the end of the ongoing academic session -- March 2021. “Chief minister Kejriwal believes that without education, we cannot make our nation strong and developed...Do you not think that with such a chief minister, you should discuss the road map for improving the education system of the entire country, rather than sending Delhi’s director of education out of Delhi without consulting him?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sisodia-writes-to-shah-urges-him-to-reconsider-transfer-of-delhi-education-director/story-jb4nvUJZwSA6pqzhQ8kBTN.html

Officials from the Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport said the 400 attendees were sent to Indonesia, Malaysia and to some European countries in around 10 flights. Between February and March, at least 2,000 Tablighi Jamaat members from different countries had attended a gathering at the markaz in Nizamuddin.According to an official from the airport, who wished not to be named, the process of sending Tabhligi Jamaat members back started on July 17. “The first flight of deportees departed Delhi on July 17. As and when the courts keep releasing them through plea bargaining, and when the police return their passports, they will be sent back to their countries,” the official said.The official said these Tabhligi Jamaat members have been blacklisted and they will not be allowed to enter India in future.Ashima Mandla, legal counsel for the Tabhligi Jamaat foreign nationals, said the procedure for their deportation has posed unforeseen hurdles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/400-tablighi-jamaat-members-deported-to-home-countries-over-the-past-one-week/story-Pz5HToXh5vqrEPazRGsRhJ.html
25-07-2020||Delhi||Minor raped in care centre recovers from Covid-19; security stepped up||A 14-year-old Covid-positive girl who was allegedly raped at the 10,000-bed Covid Care Centre in south Delhi’s Chhatarpur by a 19-year-old patient housed at the facility has recovered from the disease, police said on Friday. “The survivor’s Covid test results returned negative on Thursday evening,” said a police investigator who did not want to be identified.Two suspects, who were arrested and are in judicial custody, are at a government hospital for treatment. The second man is the suspect’s friend who filmed the crime on his mobile phone. Both are Covid-postive.“Though they have no symptoms now, their test results are yet to arrive. When they recover, we will approach court to seek their custody for interrogation,” the officer said, adding the suspects are being guarded by personnel of Delhi Police’s Third Battalion, which mans prisoners outside jail premises. The suspect was admitted at facility around the same time the girl was brought -- about a week before the alleged crime happened on the night of July 15.The girl and the 19-year-old had got acquainted with each other during their stay at the centre, police said. He allegedly called her near the washroom on the pretext of speaking to her and allegedly committed the crime, police had said on Thursday. His 20-year-old friend allegedly stood guard and recorded the crime on his mobile phone. During a brief interrogation, the suspect “admitted” to raping the girl child, the investigator cited above said. The suspects were sent to judicial custody and since they were infected, the police did not get a chance to interrogate them any further. “We seized the mobile phone of the other suspect and sent it to a forensic laboratory for recovery of the alleged video as we suspect he deleted it when the crime was revealed,” the investigator said.Commenting on the crime, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said, “It is an unfortunate incident. A police case has been registered and the matter is being investigated. The culprit should receive strictest punishment.” The survivor’s statement was recorded in the physical presence of a magistrate on Friday. “Since she was infected with coronavirus all this while, we didn’t have a chance to record her statement in court. On Friday, her mother was with her while she recorded her statement, which was consistent with her earlier allegation,” the officer said.After legal requirements, she was sent home with her mother who works as a domestic help. The child is yet to be counselled by NGOs, a mandatory requirement to help survivors heal with mental trauma. “Now that she has recovered, we have requested a counsellor to help her,” the officer said. The survivor reported the crime on July 16 morning to an attendant of the care centre. Of the 10,200 beds at the facility -- billed as the largest Covid care centre in India -- only about 250 are currently occupied. Since it is a huge facility with a negligible occupancy, large spaces are unmanned. The Indo-Tibetan Border Police, which is overseeing security as well as treatment of patients there, had initially planned to deploy 1,000 of its personnel for security purposes. But with very few patients at the centre, only about 100 of them are working in shifts in the security department. The ITBP said they have stepped up security and are investigating if there were any lapses on the part of its personnel||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/minor-raped-in-care-centre-recovers-from-covid-19-security-stepped-up/story-HXlbJXG2CpV0797gnxtpxJ.html
25-07-2020||Delhi||August 15 approaching, traders say tricolour sales lower than never before||Abdul Gaffar Ansari’s family has been making national flags since 1954. Every year, the orders – which came from as far as Assam, Orissa, and Bihar-- peaked two months before Independence Day, and he ramped up production, making about 5,000 cotton flags every day. But this year has been unlike any other.It is only three weeks to go for Independence Day, and he is making only 200 flags as most of his customers are not turning up. “Normally we would make about 300,000 national flags for Independence Day, but I am afraid we may not make 20,000 this year. I have not seen an Independence Day like this before,” says Ansari, 70, who runs Bharat Handloom Cloth House in Sadar Bazar, one of the oldest manufacturers of flags in Delhi. Ansari is not the only one. With schools, colleges closed, and most government and private organisations deciding to keep their Independence Day celebrations low-key, the demand for the national flag, manufacturers and traders say, have dropped. “Seventy-five per cent of my orders for the national flag came from schools, colleges and other educational institutes, and this year, there are hardly any orders from them. Business is down by 90%. We have a few orders from government offices,” says Anil Gupta, a major manufacturer and trader of flags in Sadar Bazar in Delhi, which is a major flag manufacturing hub, attracting traders from all over the country. “Last year we made 2,500,000 paper flags for schools, this year we have made only 400,000. Looks like even that is going to be unsold,” says Gupta.Mohammed Chaman, who runs Aaroma Enterprises, has a similar story. Apart from flags of different sizes, the shelves in his shop are stacked with tricolour-themed merchandise: badges, scarves, caps, T-shirts. “Our sales on August 15 were always four times more than that on Republic Day. But this time, we hope we will be able to clear our Independence Day stock on Republic Day, which will be a first for us,” says Chaman.Among the best-selling flags for Independence Day celebrations, the traders say, were small paper flags ( 4x6 and 6x 9 inches), mostly supplied to schools, and medium-size cloth flags (3x5ft). “Small paper flags cost just 25 paise and the bigger ones (40-60 ft) cost about Rs 15,000 a piece wholesale. Big flags were mostly bought by corporates in Gurugram, who celebrated Independence Day in their campuses. This year they have not come. We expected a dip in demand, but never thought it could get so bad,” says Hardik Arora of Muskan Enterprises, a wholesale dealer of flags for the past 22 years in Sadar Bazar.“The demand has only been rising since citizens were allowed to hoist the national flag over their homes in 2002. Such has been the demand that two months before Independence Day, about 150 temporary shops selling the tricolour came up in Sadar Bazar. Now there are hardly 25,” he says.Most big manufacturers outsource manufacturing to contractors in east Delhi areas such as Shiv Vihar, Nand Nagri, Sonia Vihar, Seelampur, where flag-making is a cottage industry, providing seasonal employment to about 40,000, especially women.“Work would start in May and a woman with a single sewing machine at home would earn about Rs 500 day, making about Rs 45,000 during the season. This year I have no work to offer them,” says Tohid Ali, a contract manufacturer of flags for over two decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/august-15-approaching-traders-say-tricolour-sales-lower-than-never-before/story-tWRGrIj3oEaHgDRwzS7E9H.html

25-07-2020||Chandigarh||Readers’ take: Online classes to stay, but careful monitoring can prevent stress, eye strain||Avoid giving out homework, build skillsWith reduction in syllabus, the initiative of reducing screen time now rests with schools. The following measures can be adopted to make online teaching fruitful, while also cutting short screen time for the young :1. Avoid giving out homework2. Finish all teaching and written work for the day in the online class3. Base your projects on reading stories, newspapers and books to wean children away from the screen. This is a good time to develop their interest in reading and cultivating skills / hobbies. That will also keep them mentally healthy4. Let one period in a week be based on speaking skills so that it can be used as assessment5. Fix hours for students to call you for any queries etc, so that use of mobile screen is reduced6. Take regular feedback from parents to check the impact of online teaching on their children. Make corrections/ adjustments accordingly.Madhu RD Singh, AmbalaEncourage project based learningTo begin with parents need to be proactive and should spend quality time with their childrenEducation is priority therefore it is not possible to avoid screen time, but time spent on video games and social networking sites should be restricted Children should be made to understand the consequences of spending excessive time onlinePhysical activities should be encouragedAs far as blended learning is concerned, project based learning should be encouraged.Complex topics can be handled in the physical classroom,while easier topics should be made available online.Blended learning methodology can be called hybrid learning and is just the right approach not just during the pandemic but otherwise too as it will save time,petroleum and our environment .The need of the hour is adopt best practices for a better world.Arti MalhotraExcess of everything is bad There is no denying the fact that exposure to the digital world has broadened the horizons of young children. Now information on any subject under the sun is just a few clicks away. Overindulgence, however, is injurious to a person’s wellbeing. Let us not get carried away by today’s needs and demands for a smartphone or laptop for “online coaching” during the Covid-19 pandemic. We must resist this promotion of electronic devices to get youngsters addicted. There is no substitute for classroom coaching to cover the prescribed syllabus, which includes laboratory work too.Subhash LuthraKeep an eye on time children spend onlineChildren’s screen time has to be monitored. Many of them have a habit of playing games on their mobiles or laptops, because of which they have been prescribed spectacles. Parents should ensure that apart from online education, the youngsters minimise use of electronic devices. Many schools, in order to perform better than competitors, might not adhere to the time limit of three hours for online classes. Parents should ensure that schools stick to the rules.Apart from limiting screen time, using anti-glare spectacles too will help prevent eye strain in children. Priyam Aggarwal, ChandigarhChildren need to lead a ‘balanced’ lifeThe onus is on parents to ensure that a balance is maintained in their children’s life when it comes to digital devices. These should only be used for essential activities such as online classes after which the child should be encouraged to try looking beyond the digital world. Active parental involvement in the child’s life is also necessary if the youngster is to live a balanced life. Gone are the days when absentee and disjointed parenthood worked. Other checks could include imposing a strict time limit on use of digital devices, restricting certain online content and creating an open environment for discussion. The abrupt digital change in education due to Covid-19 should not be the way forward. The main component of India’s education policy should be one of blended education, which combines traditional classroom learning with online methods. The Union government’s recently launched Operation Digital Board to integrate digitalisation and technology with classroom education can be successful if it begins with the training and upskilling of all education stakeholders, ie teachers, students, parents, schools and universities. Other steps include creating digital infrastructure in schools and utilising the expertise of India’s education start-ups through public-private partnership model. The digital divide also needs to be bridged by providing cheap digital devices and connectivity across the nation. Parag PuriGuidance must from parents, teachersIt is true that every coin has two sides. Digital devices have their merits and demerits. Children can gather a lot of information through the devices, which also make their lives easy. However, often youngsters download obscene material, or spend excessive hours chatting with friends or playing video games, which can affect their health and mental equilibrium. This is when parents and teachers can step in with the right guidance on studying online and making the best use of time offline. As of now, long breaks should be announced for primary classes and senior students should be divided into three groups in each class and allowed to attend schools two days a week while following social distancing and other safety norms. Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, MohaliParents root cause of tech addictionThe modern day child has to live with technology so parents have to accept this reality. Parents are the root cause of this tech addiction, allowing the child to make excessive use of the internet, and buying him or her expensive smartphones and computers. It has a lot to do with their social status, something that they like to boast about at social gatherings. Then it becomes a vicious circle as the child grows up to be someone who is constantly searching for expensive things to flaunt. Then there’s the problem of all schools going hi-tech, with e-books, net learning and online homework submission. This leads to stress and psychological problems as parents want them to top the class but cannot provide them the requisite support as they might be working and unable to give the child the time he or she requires. The solution is to ensure that the child is involved in extra-curricular activities, goes to the library, movies or is involved in creative activities such as clay modelling, collecting stamps or playing chess and board and outdoor games. Spending quality time with parents will make them well rounded individuals instead of netizens.Rajiv Boolchand Jain, ZirakpurOrganise creative activitiesIt is imperative is to keep children busy with exciting activities which parents should participate in. Plans should be made together. Organise a quiz at home, with participants the quiz masters by turn. Simple questions on tourist attractions in Chandigarh, historical landmarks in Delhi, spelling and pronunciation contests will allow children to do some creative thinking. Enjoy the fun together.Usha Verma, Chandigarh Keep students engagedThe Central Board of Secondary Education needs to focus on practical learning and communication skills instead of theoretical learning. Audio lectures should be delivered online, often including moral lessons and interesting life experiences. Student engagement with group discussions, debates and, declamations should be encouraged. This way teachers can judge their grasping power and hone their communication skills. Tips on physical exercise and eye care routines should be given too.Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliLectures via audio lessonsI believe in the present scenario we have no option. Our children need to be in academic mode via e-learning. But more screen time is leading to health problems, eye strain and mental stress. I believe by converting at least 25% of syllabi in audio lectures we can reduce screen time for children without worrying about them not completing their syllabus. IMS Sandhu, Batala Make online education affordable and safeThe human resource development ministry has done well to recommend a cap on duration of online classes and teachers’ engagement with online activities.Luxuries of yore are becoming necessities today.Analytical thinking will be remain the most in-demand skill in the years to come for which being connected to the digital world is essential. We need not be allergic to this technological marvel but focus on the shift to research and development to minimise its ill effects on health.Government schools need to remodel and reimagine teaching and learning by introducing suitable home and institutional methods.Poverty and gender must not take a toll on brilliant potential of students in free India.It’s time to make online education affordable and safe. Lalit Bharadwaj, PanchkulaOnly children can change their habitsBlended education can work wonderfully if online classroom timings are limited. Apart from that, no one can limit children’s exposure to smartphones except for children themselves. They need to understand that this quarantine period is for their development and not for using mobile phones. Parents need their children during this time and we youngsters should try and spend as much time with them as possible and focus on doing what is good for everyone and ourselves. For instance, I like writing, dancing and acting so instead of spending time with electronic devices I should spend time in polishing my skills. No time should be wasted and people should utilise the break to do things they have always wanted to.Ishita NaraSurfing net a waste of timeDoubtlessly, unnecessary chatting on the phone and surfing the net can be a waste of time and very unproductive for students.Therefore, parents should keep a vigilant eye on their children to ensure they make the best of these times and do not misuse their gadgets. Presumably, things will change for the better when things normalise and schools reopen.Surinder Paul Wadhwa, MohaliEnsure children get a breakTo minimise exposure to digital devices, parents being nearest to their children can periodically ensure that during the long periods they study online, the youngsters take short breaks to rest. Schools and parents must ensure that the students are monitored closely through apps that can track what they are surfing.Manjeet Singh Ishar, MohaliMore focus on audio based lessonsUsing reading mode and auto brightness features can lessen the impact of the harmful effects of staring at a screen. Schools should endorse and vouch for audio based lectures along with references to study material students have access to. Audio discussions should be held regularly and tests and assessments done in the same way as well. Parents can take charge and spend time managing teaching hours for their kids.

25-07-2020||World||Singaporean in US pleads guilty to acting as Chinese intelligence agent||A Singaporean man who set up a fake consulting site to solicit information from US government and military workers has pleaded guilty to acting as an illegal agent of Chinese intelligence, the Justice Department said on Friday.Sentencing for Jun Wei Yeo, also known as Dickson Yeo, will be in October, according to the department. The United States is cracking down on Chinese spying, with the FBI having interviewed dozens of visa holders about their possible ties to Chinese intelligence.On Friday a Chinese researcher who took refuge in the San Francisco consulate was expected to appear in court on allegations she lied about her Chinese military service, while the US counterintelligence agency chief warned China and other nations could interfere with November elections.China’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singaporean-in-us-pleads-guilty-to-acting-as-chinese-intelligence-agent/story-tEDZ3IjQldDYIMYYWdyl6L.html
25-07-2020||World||China slams ‘forced entry’ of US federal agents into its Houston consulate||US-China diplomatic tensions continued to simmer on Saturday as Beijing slammed the “forced entry” to its Houston consulate by U.S. personnel hours earlier and vowed to respond “as necessary.”Federal agents and local law enforcement authorities broke into the consulate building late Friday, according to the Houston Chronicle and CNN, after issuing an order on July 21 that it must close within 72 hours.The newspaper reported that among the personnel on site were some wearing shirts carrying the words “U.S. Department of State.” Agents tried three different entrances at the compound before prying open a back door, the Chronicle reported.Beijing said that U.S. had broken diplomatic conventions by entering “China’s national property.”“According to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the Sino-U.S. Consular Treaty, the United States must not infringe on the premises of the Chinese Consulate in Houston in any way,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said in an a Q&A posted on the ministry’s website late on Saturday.Beijing has already expressed “firm opposition” to the move and will respond as “proper and necessary,” Wang said.On Friday, China ordered the U.S. to close its consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu, retaliating for the Trump administration’s decision to shutter the Chinese mission in Houston.The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Friday that the consulate’s closure was a “legitimate and necessary response to the unjustified act by the U.S.”The widely anticipated retaliation came hours ahead of the U.S.’s deadline for Chinese diplomats to vacate the Houston facility, which the State Department said had served as a hub for spying and influence operations.Beijing’s decision will not only oust American diplomats from the capital of Sichuan province -- a region with a population rivaling Germany -- it will close a key listening post for developments in neighboring Tibet. The move will probably have a bigger impact than shutting the U.S. consulate in Wuhan, but less than closing U.S. missions in the key financial centers of Hong Kong or Shanghai.Wang,the foreign ministry spokesman, told a regular news briefing in Beijing that some consulate staff had “engaged in activities inconsistent with their capacity, interfered in China’s internal affairs and harmed China’s national security interests.” By Friday afternoon, dozens of police, plainclothes officers and People’s Liberation Army personnel were seen patrolling the street outside the building, searching phones and ordering people to delete photos.While police ordered most reporters and pedestrians to leave the area, China’s state broadcaster began live-streaming footage of the consulate’s entrance.U.S. stocks have been hit by the tensions, and spot gold topped $1,900 an ounce for the first time since 2011. China’s CSI 300 Index slumped 4.4% at the close on Friday, while the ChiNext Index dropped 6.1%, the most since Feb. 3.“It’s not possible to carry out an entirely equivalent action, but choosing Chengdu shows China wants to reduce the harm made to bilateral relations,” said Wang Yiwei, a former Chinese diplomat and director of China’s Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University in Beijing. “The operations out of Chengdu are not the most high profile of the U.S. mission in China, compared to say Shanghai.”In another potential sign of a deescalation, U.S. officials said a Chinese researcher wanted by law enforcement who had taken refuge in China’s San Francisco consulate was now in custody. The researcher, Juan Tang, is expected to have a court appearance on Friday, official said on a briefing call for reporters.Yet the Chengdu and Houston consulate closures illustrate the alarming degree to which relations between the world’s two largest economies have worsened in recent years, as China assumes a more assertive posture on the world stage and the U.S. seeks to check its rise. President Donald Trump and his aides have stepped up attacks on China ahead of the U.S. election in November, accusing Beijing of spying, cybertheft and causing the coronavirus pandemic.In a speech Thursday at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo accused President Xi Jinping and the Chinese leadership of attempting to “tyrannize inside and outside China forever” in pursuit of global hegemony. “Securing our freedoms from the Chinese Communist Party is the mission of our time,” Pompeo said.In the first U.S. reaction to the Chengdu decision, a spokesman for the National Security Council said the closure of the Houston consulate was justified after years of espionage activity.“For years, the CCP has undertaken a whole-of-society effort to steal American technology and intellectual property for commercial gain, and many of these activities are directed from PRC diplomatic facilities,” NSC spokesman John Ullyot said in a statement Friday. “Our action to direct the closure of PRC Consulate General in Houston was taken to protect American intellectual property and Americans’ private information.”A commentary published by China’s official Xinhua News Agency moments after the Chengdu announcement said the Chengdu closure was “aimed at a few extremist forces in the U.S. government, not the American people.” “The U.S. has stirred up trouble in bilateral relations to the point of hysteria,” the commentary said.In a sign things could deteriorate further, Wang, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, answered a question on Thursday about the future of the U.S.-China trade deal by saying the American side should think “carefully” about where the relationship was heading. Trump also said that his “phase one” deal meant “much less” to him in the wake of the pandemic.The Chengdu mission, which opened in 1985, covers Chongqing, Guizhou, Yunnan, as well as Sichuan. The consulate has also served as a key U.S. perch to follow events in Tibet, where Communist Party efforts to suppress dissent have long been a focus of tensions between China and the West.In 2012, former Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun sought refuge in the Chengdu consulate with evidence linking the family of his then boss, former Chongqing party secretary Bo Xilai, to the death of a British businessman. The episode exposed a scandal that would see Bo ousted and his wife convicted of murder, leading Xi to launch a nationwide anti-corruption campaign.“They wanted to make it hurt a little bit more so they picked Chengdu,” said James Green, a former State Department official who is now a senior adviser for geopolitical consulting firm McLarty Associates. “What the Chinese care about more -- and what we care about more -- is what we do out of Chengdu, which is follow Tibet. And shutting that down kind of cuts our link to Tibet, which is a political blow to us.”Global Times Editor-in-Chief Hu Xijin, who had earlier reported the timing of the decision on his Twitter feed, said U.S. diplomats were given the same 72-hour notice as their Chinese counterparts in Houston, meaning they must leave by Monday morning. The Wall Street Journal separately reported, citing unidentified people briefed on the matter, that China had given the affected diplomats 30 days to leave the country.Wang Wenbin repeatedly sidestepped questions about when the diplomats would have to leave, saying only “we always talk about reciprocity in diplomacy.”“The current situation in China-U.S. relations is not what China desires to see, and the U.S. is responsible for all this,” the Foreign Ministry said earlier Friday. “We once again urge the U.S. to immediately retract its wrong decision and create necessary conditions for bringing the bilateral relationship back on track.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-slams-forced-entry-of-us-federal-agents-into-its-houston-consulate/story-5w8UHowIJDiJd77EhiGdhK.html
25-07-2020||World||Record number of new Covid-19 cases as public loses faith in govts||The world has set a new record for the highest daily increase in coronavirus infections, as a survey released Saturday showed governments are fast losing support for their handling of the pandemic.There were more than 280,000 new cases recorded globally on both Thursday and Friday, the highest daily rises since the virus emerged in China late last year.Friday’s tally of 282,042 was marginally down on Thursday’s single-day record 284,661, according to an AFP count based on official sources, but still marks an alarming uptick in the spread of the virus.Nearly a third of the world’s 15.8 million infections have been registered since July 1, while the total death toll nears 640,000. The World Health Organization said that more than a million cases had been recorded in each of the last five weeks, “with over 280,000 being reported on July 24 alone”. “While no country is unaffected, this rise is driven by high transmission in large and populous countries in the Americas and South Asia,” it said in a statement on Saturday.It added that Brazil and India had recently reported their highest daily increases, while the figures remained worryingly high in the United States and South Africa.The US, still the hardest-hit nation, on Friday reported its second straight day of more than 70,000 new cases and over 1,000 deaths as the virus takes hold in the south and west.- Bolsonaro tests negative - Governments worldwide have struggled to contain the virus despite long and economically-crippling lockdowns imposed on millions of people, and a new survey showed that faith in authorities is dwindling in six rich nations.Populations in France, Germany, Britain, Japan, Sweden and the US widely believed death and infection figures to be higher than recorded, according to the study, which polled 1,000 people in each nation.“In most countries this month, support for national governments is falling,” the report by the Kekst CNC communications consulting group said.One world leader widely criticised over his handling of the pandemic is Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who was diagnosed with coronavirus on July 7.Bolsonaro, who has downplayed what he calls “a little flu”, announced on Saturday that he had finally tested negative.Despite his diagnosis, Bolsonaro has appeared to continue flouting virus precautions, being spotted riding his motorcycle and chatting maskless with presidential palace groundskeepers on Thursday.Brazil’s biggest city Sao Paulo on Saturday said it was indefinitely postponing its 2021 carnival, while Rio de Janeiro was considering a similar move.New outbreaks continue to wreak havoc elsewhere around the world, with fresh clusters emerging across Asia.South Korea on Saturday reported its highest infections figure in nearly four months, and in Vietnam the first locally-transmitted case in nearly 100 days was detected.Authorities in China said they would introduce a new wave of measures and testing in the port city of Dalian, home to about six million people, after fresh infections were detected there.That did not prevent the Chinese Super League kicking off behind closed doors on Saturday with the players of Guangzhou Evergrande and Shanghai Shenhua holding a minute’s silence for the victims of the pandemic.- ‘The world is infested’ -Europe remains the hardest-hit continent, accounting for a fifth of the world’s case count.Belgium said Saturday it could further tighten its restrictions following the death of a three-year-old girl, the country’s youngest victim of the virus.There have been recent outbreaks in the Spanish regions of Aragon and Catalonia where officials have reintroduced fresh curbs on daily life.However with experts fearing a spike in Covid-19 infections linked to the European summer holiday season, many tourists are reticent to cancel their plans. Fanny Lievens said she and her family had no choice but to continue on their holiday trip to Catalonia from the southern French city of Montpellier.“If we cancelled our holiday, which has been planned since February, we would lose the rental money,” she said.In France, where infections have been rising, Prime Minister Jean Castex said on-the-spot testing would be rolled out for travellers arriving from 16 high-risk nations.Britain meanwhile has made it compulsory to wear a face covering in shopping centres, banks, takeaway outlets, sandwich shops and supermarkets.The virus has overwhelmed health systems and devastated families across Latin America, where nearly 180,000 people have died.“The world is infested,” said Raquel Barrera, a 28-year-old in El Salvador who has lost three brothers and both her parents to the disease in less than two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/record-number-of-new-virus-cases-as-public-loses-faith-in-govts/story-fw39goWdbV3siXGdo5sLbP.html
25-07-2020||World||Businessman’s frozen £190 million UK assets returned to Pakistan||Britain’s crime officials have returned £190 million to Pakistan following an investigation into a Pakistani businessman whose assets in the UK were the subject of freezing orders; millions of pounds more were similarly returned to other countries in 2019-20, officials said.The amounts are the result of investigations into international corruption and bribery. More individuals were charged by the National Crime Agency (NCA)’s international corruption unit than ever before during the year, linked to the laundering of criminal cash into major overseas developments projects.An NCA spokesperson said none of the cases investigated during 2019-20 involved Indian citizens.Its international corruption unit restrained or detained £32 million; £146 million more were been confiscated or forfeited, of which £139 million were returned to developing countries, the NCA said in its annual report.“In December 2019, the NCA agreed a civil settlement of £190 million following a civil investigation into a Pakistani national, whose business is one of largest private sector employers in Pakistan. Most of the frozen funds in this case have now been returned to Pakistan”, it said.The NCA had previously identified the businessman as Malik Riaz Hussain. The settlement was announced after NCA implemented eight account freezing orders in August 2019 linked to nearly £120 million and one in December 2018 linked to the same investigation for £20 million.Account freezing orders and unexplained wealth orders were unveiled by British authorities in 2018 as part of efforts to tackle fraud and organised crime, or assist in the recovery of illegitimate assets. Some non-EU politicians have been subject to such orders.The International Anti-Corruption Coordination Centre (IACCC) based at the NCA supported foreign jurisdictions investigating “grand corruption” during the year. This is defined as abuse of high level power causing serious and widespread harm to society.This year IACCC intelligence supported the arrest of senior corrupt officials, the identification of over £100 million worth of suspicious assets, and the return of stolen money to affected states, the NCA said.NCA director-general Lynne Owens said: “The threat to the UK from serious and organised crime remains chronic and corrosive. Criminals work across international boundaries and are using new technologies to find different ways to identify victims, exploit the vulnerable and hide both their identities and the proceeds of their crime”.“The NCA leads the UK’s fight against these criminals, and in 2019/20 we recorded our biggest ever disruptive impact against them”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/businessman-s-frozen-190-million-uk-assets-returned-to-pakistan/story-VrlgCMCVYx1rulTyCwtWeJ.html
25-07-2020||World||Brazil’s Bolsonaro says new Covid-19 test came back negative||Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said on Saturday that he has tested negative for the novel coronavirus after weeks quarantined in his residence due to an infection.In a photo posted to social media, Bolsonaro appeared with a box of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug he credited for his recovery despite a lack of scientific evidence about its effectiveness. In an accompanying text, he said his RT-PCR test for Sars-Cov 2 was negative.He did not say when he took the test nor did he provide any further details.Bolsonaro reported testing positive three times this month, including an initial diagnosis on July 7 for Covid-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus.Since then he has been in partial isolation at the presidential residence, filling his official agenda with videoconferences. He was spotted outdoors occasionally, including at a rally where he greeted supporters, removing his mask occasionally when at a distance of a few meters.Bolsonaro’s coronavírus infection was one of more than 2.3 million cases in Brazil, second only to the United States. The pandemic has killed more than 85,000 people in Brazil.Bolsonaro has played down the risks of the virus he called “a little flu” and defied public health experts and fought against governors and mayors imposing lockdowns to fight the pandemic. The right-wing populist has warned such policies are worse than the virus itself and urged businesses to reopen quickly.Bolsonaro has said he would start traveling around the country after recovering from his illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-s-bolsonaro-says-new-covid-19-test-came-back-negative/story-5Zn0Hyd6FC5vxaysRQaGtI.html
25-07-2020||World||Thousands of stranded Filipinos crammed into baseball stadium amid coronavirus risks||Thousands of Filipinos were crammed into a baseball stadium in Manila on Saturday, breaking social distancing rules despite coronavirus risks, after people wanting to return to their home provinces flooded a government transportation program.Officials had reserved the stadium as a place to test people before transporting them back to their home provinces under a program to help people who had lost their jobs in the capital return to their families elsewhere.Officials had planned for 7,500 people to arrive at the stadium from Friday, but were caught out when another 2,000 people who were not yet scheduled to travel headed there anyway. “Because of the overflowing number of people, we can no longer control (the situation) and the relevance of social distancing had been diminished,” Assistant Secretary Joseph Encabo, who is overseeing the government’s transportation assistance program, told Reuters by phone.Police were deployed to urge social distancing, but people, including the elderly, children and pregnant women, were seen in close contact with each other. Some were not wearing masks.Many of those at the stadium had got stuck in the capital when it imposed one of the strictest and longest lockdowns in mid-March in response to the coronavirus pandemic. That was eased at the start of June, allowing businesses to reopen in a limited capacity, but schools remain shut and mass gatherings are banned. People must wear masks in public and observe one-metre social distancing, while children and the elderly are urged to stay at home.Coronavirus cases have more than quadrupled since restrictions were eased to 78,412, with more than half of those in the capital and surrounding areas.Among those at the stadium was Fred Marick Ukol, 40, who became stuck in Manila after his flight to Australia, where he had found work as a welder, was cancelled.“We don’t have work and now all of our savings have dried up because of the lockdown,” Ukol said, referring to himself and fellow overseas Filipino workers. Encabo said everybody at the stadium would undergo rapid testing for COVID-19 and must be cleared before being allowed to board the buses, sea vessels, and trains the government has prepared.

25-07-2020||World||‘You will destroy vaccines’: Supply chain to save the world is unprepared||The industries that shepherd goods around the world on ships, planes and trucks acknowledge they aren’t ready to handle the epic challenges of shipping an eventual Covid-19 vaccine from drugmakers to billions of people.Already stretched thin by the pandemic, freight companies face problems ranging from shrinking capacity on container ships and cargo aircraft to a lack of visibility on when a vaccine will arrive. Shippers have struggled for years to reduce cumbersome paperwork and upgrade old technology that, unless addressed soon, will slow the relay race to transport fragile vials of medicine in unprecedented quantities.Making a vaccine quickly is hard enough but distributing one worldwide offers a host of other variables, and conflicting forces may work against the effort: The infrastructure powering the global economy is scaling down for a protracted downturn just as pharmaceutical companies need to scale up for the biggest and most consequential product launch in modern history.“We’re not prepared,” Neel Jones Shah, global head of air carrier relationships at San Francisco-based freight forwarder Flexport, said during a webinar this week with other logistics executives.“Let’s all be honest here, vaccine supply chains are exponentially more complex than PPE supply chain,” he said, referring to personal protective equipment like surgical masks and gloves. “You can’t ruin PPE by leaving it on the tarmac for a couple of days. You will destroy vaccines.”8,000 Cargo PlanesJulian Sutch, head of Emirates SkyCargo’s pharmaceutical division, estimated recently that a single Boeing Co. 777 freighter can carry 1 million individual doses of a vaccine. That means airlifting double-dose regimens to protect half the world’s population would require the space in about 8,000 cargo planes.It’s doable, but not without a coordinated global strategy. For now, what’s helping to free up air freight capacity is retrofitting idled passenger planes so they can carry products ranging from medical gear to mangoes. Emirates is using 70 passenger 777s to move cargo, according to Sutch.Another capacity issue involves refrigeration. Health officials have said a vaccine that eventually comes to market will likely need to be maintained at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (35.6 to 46.4 degrees Fahrenheit) throughout the shipping process. Some newer technologies could require more advanced freezers that can keep them at a frigid minus 80 degrees Celsius. Any deviation can ruin the shots.Among the big questions involving fairness and accessibility: Exactly how will medicine requiring such delicate and expensive transportation reach remote, impoverished areas where drones are now used to distribute pharmaceuticals?Such details aren’t sorted out yet and shippers are aware of the need to get organized. But they’re waiting on signals from the drugmakers.Shah said Flexport is in early discussions with a number of pharmaceutical companies involved in vaccine manufacturing that are still unsure about what they’re going to need. “To a T, they’re all extremely nervous about being able to bring these to market as quickly as people might expect,” he said.There are more than 160 coronavirus vaccines in development, according to the World Health Organization, though only 25 are currently in human studies. The candidates furthest along are now launching late-stage trials, and have ambitions of securing an emergency use authorization from regulators before year end. That could allow for a limited availability of shots for health-care workers and other vulnerable groups.Targeting 2021Ultimately, countries will need far broader access to Covid-19 shots to halt the virus that has devastated economies and so far taken more than 633,000 lives globally. But by all accounts that’s not likely to occur until well into 2021 at the earliest.In the meantime, manufacturing deals are being clinched, and facilities are getting retrofitted to produce the still-experimental shots at the risk they fail in the clinic. Though the science underscoring the inoculations is still unproven, and mass production remains a daunting task, top pharmaceutical executives speculate that distribution will pose the greatest challenge of all.“Often people are talking about the scientific conundrum of coming forward with a vaccine that works. In some ways, maybe even a harder problem is what you just put your finger on, which is distribution,” Merck & Co. Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Frazier said in an interview on Leadership Live With David Rubenstein on Bloomberg Television. “None of us are safe until all of us are safe, so it’s got to be given broadly to humanity. We need a vaccine that we can make and distribute around the world.”Throughout nearly six months of the crisis, the closing and reopening of economies has thrown out of sync the usual seasonal flow of goods from China and other large manufacturing hubs, rendering forecasts useless for shipping plans. Making the future even harder to predict is the wide time range health experts are discussing for the arrival of an antidote to the coronavirus.Airport Readiness“I don’t think we’re ready because I don’t think we know what to expect,” said Emir Pineda, manager of aviation trade and logistics at Miami International Airport, which is among a limited number of airports around the world with carriers certified to handle pharmaceuticals. “If all of a sudden 20 to 30 charter flights land at Miami International Airport full of pharmaceuticals for distribution throughout the Americas, we’re going to have a challenge.”Another complicating factor could be the behavior of some protectionist governments intent on hobbling international cooperation by exerting sovereignty over supply chains.That attitude was on display this week at a hearing in Washington before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, where some lawmakers grilled executives of AstraZeneca Plc, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc. about whether their vaccines would be made in the U.S., and what countries they would acquire materials from.“Systemic health threats are the least promising subjects for global cooperation,” said Simon Evenett, a professor at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland who tracks trade barriers.If private industry doesn’t rise to the delivery task, one option is outright government intervention. In the U.S., for instance, the Pentagon can call on commercial airlines contracted as part of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, a program established in 1951 after the Berlin airlift that can be invoked in peacetime for national security reasons.Amid the political noise is the steady hum of economies trying to recover, and the busy time of year for companies to stock up ahead of the end-of-year holidays typically is in August and September. Vaccine distribution aside, already elevated shipping prices may stay that way and remain more volatile than ever given the capacity shortages and the demand uncertainty.“We are going to see spikes driven by commercial freight” over the next several months, said Michael Steen, executive vice president and chief commercial officer at the Purchase, New York-based shipping company Atlas Air Worldwide. “The typical calendar peak will be strong -- that’s what we’re expecting.”The branded and generic drug industry has already stomached the high cost of transportation as the pandemic has thrown the airline industry into chaos. Even at the outset of February, industry trade groups and nonprofits struggled to help drug companies navigate the dearth of commercial and cargo flights.“This is an issue of demand where the pricing is four, five, ten times of what they normally would be,” said Anne McDonald Pritchett, the senior vice president of policy and research for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, during a virtual meeting meeting on supply-chain hurdles in June.Companies are getting creative, with some going through Canada and using trucks to haul products into the U.S. Others have chartered private planes to deliver finished therapeutics into the country. Those quick-fix, costly solutions aren’t likely to work when combined with the complex transport requirements of a coronavirus vaccine.Hence the urgent need for a game plan.“We’re not planning proactively for accommodating that vaccine distribution going forward because the various parties here are not connecting,” Steen said Thursday during the industry webinar, hosted by STAT Media Group, a trade industry publisher in Mumbai. “Shippers and manufacturers are not connecting.”The good news, he said, is that drug manufacturers, companies along the distribution chain and governments still have time to understand how to “take this very scarce capacity and support the distribution of those vaccines in order to stimulate the economies and most importantly make people healthy again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/you-will-destroy-vaccines-supply-chain-to-save-the-world-is-unprepared/story-D0WKzH5hrQuaVWHhHDTqlI.html
25-07-2020||World||Prince Harry, Meghan distance from new book on royal rift||Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, on Saturday distanced themselves from a new unofficial biography, which claims to expose details behind the rift that saw the couple step back from Britain’s royal frontline earlier this year.‘Finding Freedom’, which is being serialised in ‘The Times’ this weekend, has claimed that Harry and Meghan were barely speaking to Harry’s elder brother, Prince William, and his wife Kate Middleton by March. It also claims friends of the Sussexes, who are now based in California, referred to some Buckingham Palace officials as “vipers”.“The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were not interviewed and did not contribute to ‘Finding Freedom’,” a spokesperson for Harry and Meghan said.“This book is based on the authors’ own experiences as members of the royal press corps and their own independent reporting,” the spokesperson said.The book’s authors, Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, write about a culture of increasing tension between the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and other members of the royal family in the lead up to the royal split which became official from April 1.They say the Sussexes felt their complaints were not taken seriously and believed other royal households were leaking stories about them to the press.“There were just a handful of people working at the palace they could trust,” the authors write. “A friend of the couple’s referred to the old guard as ‘the vipers’. Meanwhile, a frustrated palace staffer described the Sussexes’ team as ‘the squeaky third wheel’ of the palace.” In extracts from the book published in the newspaper, the authors claim Prince William was hurt by internal royal family affairs being made public.“As Meghan tearfully told a friend in March: ‘I gave up my entire life for this family. I was willing to do whatever it takes. But here we are. It’s very sad’,” the book notes.The biography, which is formally released on August 11, is expected to portray Harry and Meghan as pioneering forces with the ability to modernise the monarchy, thwarted by “grey suits” at the palace who they feel failed to support them as well as a hostile tabloid press.It will cover actress Meghan Markle’s arrival as Prince Harry’s girlfriend a few years ago and dramatic events ever since, leading up to their decision to forge a new life in the US with their son Archie this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-harry-meghan-distance-from-new-book-on-royal-rift/story-VNEn6MyUuZOckQbnkk05yI.html
25-07-2020||World||Study reveals Covid-19 can infect ears||While Covid-19 continues to wreak havoc across the globe, a recent study suggests that the virus can infect the ear as well. The study, which was published in the scientific journal JAMA, was based on the autopsy carried out on three patients who died from Covid-19. The findings revealed the virus’ presence inside the middle ear and in the mastoid area of the head. The mastoid is a hollow bone behind the ear.The research was carried out with the team removing the mastoids from the deceased patients’ bodies and taking specimens from their middle ears. Mastoid specimens from two patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.“Two of the 3 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus in the mastoid or middle ear, with viral isolation from 2 of 6 mastoids and 3 of 6 middle ears. Results for case 1 were positive for the right middle ear only. Case 2 had negative results for all samples,” the study stated. Also read: Nearly 49,000 fresh Covid-19 take India’s tally to over 13.36 lakh“This study confirms the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the middle ear and mastoid, with significant implications for otolaryngology procedures,” it added. The team calls for taking proper precautions to stop the spread of infection in patients visiting hospitals or during surgical procedures. “Droplet precautions (including eye protection and proper N95 level mask) are warranted for outpatient procedures involving the middle ear due to proximity to these potentially infectious spaces. Given the high asymptomatic rate of Covid-19 cases, caution is warranted for all elective ear surgery, and negative status by testing is indicated,” the study stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-reveals-covid-19-can-infect-ears/story-lCbx8IrdZnbyfi6t8la2wI.html

Rana, 59, a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, was re-arrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. He is a declared fugitive in India. US District Court Judge in Los Angeles Jacqueline Chooljian, in her 24-page order dated July 21, denied bail to Rana arguing that he is a flight risk. Describing Rana as a flight risk, the US government opposed his release on bail, arguing that if he were to flee to Canada, he may escape the possibility of a death sentence in India. “Given the stakes, an allowance of bail in any amount would not guarantee Rana’s presence in court. Granting bail would invite the possibility of embarrassing the United States in the conduct of its foreign affairs, straining its relationship with India,” Assistant US Attorney John J Lulejian had told the court. On the other hand, Rana’s attorney told the court that the 26/11 accused is not a flight risk and has proposed a USD 1.5 million bond for his release. Rana, in his defence, has argued that the US’ decision not to extradite his co-conspirator, Headley, to India is inconsistent and bars his extradition. While Rana “has presented a robust bail package and proffered conditions which significantly mitigate the risk of flight, the court cannot find that he has negated the risk of flight and accordingly grants the Detention Request (of the government) on that basis,” Judge Chooljian said. For someone facing conspiracy to murder and murder charges in India, the incentive to flee to avoid extradition is strong, the court said. Pakistan-born Rana completed Army Medical College there, and served in the Pakistani Army as a doctor for more than a decade, but eventually deserted. He is currently a Canadian citizen, but was a resident of Chicago where he had a business. According to the court papers, he has also resided in and travelled to Canada, Pakistan, Germany and England and speaks seven languages. If he flees to Canada, he could effectively avoid exposure to the death penalty as such country’s extradition treaty with India contains a provision which allows extradition to be refused if the offence for which extradition is requested is punishable by death in India and is not punishable by death in Canada unless India gives assurances that a death penalty would not be executed, federal prosecutors had said. “There is no question in the court’s mind that given” Rana’s significant foreign ties, particularly to Canada, and the potential death penalty awaiting him in India if he is extradited on and convicted of the most serious pending charges, he is a flight risk, the court said. According to the court papers, Rana had tested positive for Covid-19 at Terminal Island in Los Angeles on April 28, 2020, but was asymptomatic and has since recovered. He tested negative in the last three tests on June 13, June 15 and June 25. According to the federal prosecutors, between 2006 and November 2008, Rana conspired with Headley, also known as “Daood Gilani”, and others in Pakistan to assist Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Harakat ul-Jihad-e-Islami, both US-designated terrorist organisations, to plan and carry out the Mumbai terrorist attacks. Pakistani-American LeT terrorist Headley was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. He was made an approver in the case, and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack. India seeks his arrest on a number of offences, including the conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit forgery for the purpose of cheating, and murder under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He is sought for his role in 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. The 2008 Mumbai attack was one of India’s most horrific terrorist attacks in which 166 people were killed and over 300 injured as 10 heavily-armed terrorists from Pakistan created mayhem. Pakistani national Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the lone terrorist captured alive, was hanged to death on November 21, 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-26-11-accused-tahawwur-rana-being-sought-by-india/story-jQytpovCzAY4VksaTefRLP.html
25-07-2020||World||Hurricane Hanna expected to hit southern Texas coast||Tropical Storm Hanna is expected to hit the southern Texas coast as a hurricane on Saturday afternoon or early evening, forecasters said, all while another tropical storm approached the Caribbean.Hanna was centered about 140 miles (225 kilometers) east-southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas, the US National Hurricane Center said early Saturday. The storm had maximum sustained winds around 65 mph (100 kph) and was moving west at 8 mph (13 kph).A hurricane warning is in effect for Port Mansfield to Mesquite Bay, a span that includes Corpus Christi. A tropical storm warning is in effect from Barra el Mezquital, Mexico, to Port Mansfield, Texas, and from Mesquite Bay to High Island, Texas.A storm surge warning is in effect for Baffin Bay to Sargent. Storm surge up to 5 feet (1.5 meters) was forecast for that area. People were advised to protect life and property from high water.Forecasters said Hanna could bring 5 to 10 inches (13 to 25 centimeters) of rain through Sunday night — with isolated totals of 15 inches (38 centimeters) — in addition to coastal swells that could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.Hanna broke the record as the earliest eighth Atlantic named storm, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. The previous record was Harvey on Aug. 3, 2005, Klotzbach tweeted.Tropical Storm Gonzalo was also the earliest Atlantic named storm for its place in the alphabet. The previous record was held by Tropical Storm Gert, which formed on July 24, 2005. So far this year, Cristobal, Danielle, Edouard and Fay also set records for being the earliest named Atlantic storm for their alphabetic order.Gonzalo was moving west at 17 mph (30 kph) while its maximum sustained winds held at 40 mph (65 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center’s update early Saturday. It was centered about 240 miles (390 kilometers) east of Trinidad.Officials said that those in the Windward Islands should monitor the storm as it is expected to approach the islands Saturday afternoon or evening. The storm is expected to weaken as it moves into the Caribbean Sea.A tropical storm warning has been issued for St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Tobago and Grenada and its dependencies.

It said the imported cases included 36 South Korean workers who returned from Iraq and 32 crew members of a Russia-flagged cargo ship docked in the southern port of Busan.South Korean officials consider imported cases as less threatening than local transmissions as they mandate tests and enforce two-week quarantines on all overseas arrivals.Kwon Jun-wook, director of South Korea’s National Institute of Health, said during a briefing Friday afternoon that the newly reported cases the next morning would likely exceed 100 for the first time since April 1 and urged the public not to be overly alarmed by it.He said 89 of the 293 South Korean workers who arrived home Friday aboard two military planes from Iraq were exhibiting symptoms.South Korea has been dealing with a virus resurgence since easing social distancing guidelines in mid-April. Health authorities over the past week have found new clusters tied to churches, welfare centers, office buildings and a front-line army unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-records-113-new-covid-19-cases-most-from-overseas/story-J3qGmkaLPu9ku1g7WzYdaJ.html

The Governor General is the equivalent of India’s President and is considered the British Queen’s representative in Canada.According to a report from the outlet CBC News, anonymous sources accused Payette of verbally harassing and abusing staff, leading to the departure of some among those allegedly attacked.The country’s Cabinet Secretariat, the Privy Council Office has now launched a formal inquiry into these charges.CBC quoted PCO spokesperson Stéphane Shank as saying, “Harassment has no place in any professional workplace. It is a public service priority to advance efforts to more effectively prevent and resolve issues of harassment.”Also read: Canada to not recognise results of Punjab 2020 Referendum organised by SFJPayette, a former astronaut selected for the post by the Government of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in 2017, said in a tweet that she took “workplace harassment issues very seriously.” She added that she was committed to “ensuring that every employee” who worked at Rideau Hall, the official residence of the Governor General, “enjoys a secure and healthy work environment at all times and under all circumstances.” She also said she “requested the conduct of an independent review.”As this probe was announced, Trudeau and his finance minister Bill Morneau continue to face calls for their resignation from Opposition parties even as both are being investigated by the country’s Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner and Parliamentary panels over a nearly billion-dollar contract given to a charitable organisation despite their families having ties to it.The contract to the WE Charity was later cancelled following an uproar as it emerged that Trudeau’s wife, mother and brother were paid for appearances by it or allied outfits that came under the same parent umbrella. Meanwhile, Morneau’s daughter worked for the organisation and he and his family enjoyed a complimentary vacation costing over CA $41000 at the organisation’s expense. Morneau apologised for the lapse this week while appearing before the House of Commons Finance Committee and said he had repaid the charity that amount, though that was done just earlier the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-leadership-in-turmoil-governor-general-faces-official-probe-on-harassment/story-LONGu5maryQ2IahpaMgSeM.html
25-07-2020||World||Trump administration denies entry to foreign students enrolled for online-only classes||Newly-enrolled international students, many of them from India, would not be allowed to enter the United States (US) if their courses were to be taught online in the upcoming fall semester, the US agency that runs the student and exchange visitors visa programme said on Friday.The fall semester starts in September.“Non-immigrant students in new or initial status after March 9 will not be able to enter the US to enroll in a US school as a non-immigrant student for the fall term to pursue a full course of study that is 100% online,” said the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) in a statement.It directed authorised universities to not issue Form 1-20s to newly-enrolled students if their classes were to be online only. These documents are required by international students to apply for student visa.March 9, the cut-off date, is when ICE issued guidelines allowing non-immigrant foreign students to continue to stay in the country and pursue their classes online, wholly, as required by the universities, making an exception in view of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) from a rule under which foreigners are not issued student visas for online-only classes.The number of foreign students impacted by this order could not be immediately ascertained.There were nearly 270,000 new foreign students enrolled in graduate, under-graduate and non-degree courses for the academic session starting 2019 fall, according to Open Doors, a standard resource on international students.India is the second-largest source of foreign students in the US, with around 200,000, of an estimated 1 million in all.This new order came just days after the Donald Trump administration rescinded a controversial order that would have led to the deportation of non-immigrant international students if their courses were being held fully online in the fall semester, a preventative measure adopted by many institutions as they reopen after a prolonged Covid-19-enforced break.To stay in the US, these foreign students would have had to ensure a majority of their courses were conducted in-person and if that was not offered by their institution, transfer to one that did.The universities are being extra vigilant, as the US is reporting a second surge in Covid-19 cases and fatalities.Harvard University, for instance, has declared its fall classes will be all online. It is not even allowing all its students to return to their on-campus accommodations.Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) had challenged that earlier order in a lawsuit that was eventually joined by over 200 universities.Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator, and former presidential candidate, had weighed in with a stinging denunciation. It is “dangerous & xenophobic”, she had written in a tweet and had gone on to compare the order to the travel ban the president had ordered targeting people from certain countries, called the “Muslim travel ban”.The Trump administration told a Boston court at the first oral arguments in the case it was rescinding the order.But the administration is not done with foreign students evidently. It is understood to be considering suspending OPT (Optional Practical Training), a temporary post-graduation work authorisation foreign students use as a stepping stone to H-1B visa, and, eventually, Green Cards and citizenship.And now this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-denies-entry-to-foreign-students-enrolled-for-online-only-classes-in-us/story-pvkxmAX8a5eveh4UEgZJGI.html
25-07-2020||World||US eases export rules on drone sales to allies||The US on Friday relaxed norms to allow American defence companies to sell more drones to allies by changing the decades-old Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), an agreement involving 35 countries to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons.The White House said in a statement that while the 1987 missile control pact is critical in slowing proliferation and promoting peace and security, it is in dire need of modernisation as it applies to unmanned aerial systems (UAS).“This action, which is consistent with the MTCR guidelines will increase the US’s national security by improving capabilities of its partners and increase economic security by opening the expanding drones market to the US industry,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement.McEnany said the MTCR standards are more than three decades old in a sector which has rapidly evolving technology and these outdated standards give an unfair advantage to countries outside MTCR and hurt the United States industry.They also hinder the deterrence capability abroad by handicapping the US’ partners and allies with subpar technology, she said. More than two years of discussion with MTCR partners were unable to produce consensus on this overdue reform, she added.“Therefore, the President has decided to invoke our national discretion to treat a carefully selected subset of MTCR Category I UAS, which cannot travel faster than 800 kilometers per hour, as Category II,” McEnany said.“As such, the United States has determined that it will overcome the MTCR’s strong presumption of denial for this UAS subset,” she added.McEnany said the action, which is consistent with MTCR guidelines and the objectives of the UAS export policy of April 2018, will increase the US’ national security by improving the capabilities of its partners and increase the country’s economic security by opening the expanding UAS market to United States industry.“It also sets a strong example for other MTCR partners to adopt the same standard,” she added.Clarke Cooper, the assistant secretary of state for political military affairs, said the policy change modernises the US’ approach to implementing MTCR commitments and makes it more reflective of the technological realities.“It helps our allies, it helps our partners — it helps them all meet their urgent national security and commercial requirements, and it also advances the US’ national security and economic interests,” Cooper said during a conference call.Cooper, however, said higher-speed systems such as cruise missiles, hypersonic aerial vehicles, and advanced unmanned combat aerial vehicles are not affected by this revision.The United States remains a committed member of the MTCR and holds it as an important non-proliferation tool to curb the spread of high-end missile technologies to countries such as North Korea and Iran.He said preventing the use and spread of the weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery remains a Trump administration priority.As of now only the United Kingdom, France and Australia are allowed to buy larger, armed drones from US manufacturers.Senator Jim Risch, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said for too long, the restraint of the international community with regard to exports of large unmanned aircraft has created an opportunity for the Chinese military to advance its defence technology and industrial base, and build new defence relationships around the world, including with traditional US partners.“I commend the administration for its robust, years-long diplomatic effort to modernise the MTCR to account for China’s actions. It has become clear, however, that one MTCR member state will inevitably block any consensus within the regime on necessary changes. Therefore, the United States has no choice but to make the policy changes that the administration has outlined today,” he said.However, Senator Bob Menendez, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the Trump administration has once again weakened international export controls by this action.“It is important to appreciate that the Missile Technology Control Regime originally adopted stringent controls on exports of advanced drones at the urging of the United States. To disregard this policy now is likely to undermine the credibility and influence of the MTCR generally, which also coordinates international controls on the sale and spread of dangerous ballistic missiles and technology around the world,” he said.Congressman Eliot Engel, the chairperson of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Trump is unilaterally abrogating a long-standing arms control agreement because it is inconvenient for his ‘anything goes’ policy to sell dangerous weapons seemingly anywhere to anyone.“In this case, it is the MTCR, set up by President Reagan, to restrict exports of unmanned aerial vehicles that can carry nuclear weapons. Trump wants to be free to sell UAVs that can carry heavy warheads, bombs, and other explosive devices more than 300 km,” Engel said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-eases-export-rules-on-drone-sales-to-allies/story-9gAbARY5ComkLcyH8O5ulM.html
25-07-2020||World||No Covid-19 bill yet: White House, GOP at odds over jobless aid||Negotiations over a new Covid-19 rescue bill were in flux Friday after the White House floated cutting an unemployment benefits boost to as little as $100 and President Donald Trump turned to a new priority, adding money to build a new FBI headquarters.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sent senators home, promising a Republican proposal would be ready on Monday. Outraged Democrats warned that time was being wasted on GOP infighting as the virus worsens, jobless aid expires and the death toll rises.“We call upon Leader McConnell to get serious,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer in a statement.During a head-spinning week of start-and-stop efforts, McConnell abruptly halted the rollout of the Republicans’ $1 trillion plan, which was supposed to provide a counter-offer to the Democrats’ $3 trillion bill in an opening bid for negotiations. Trump was forced to abandon his push for a payroll tax break, which his party opposed, and the White House turned to new priorities.As Republicans struggled, the nation’s infections topped 4 million, deaths rose by several thousand, to nearly 145,000, and the $600 unemployment benefit boost for millions of out-of-work Americans was on track to expire.As McConnell shut down the Senate, he promised to return with “a strong, targeted piece of legislation aimed directly at the challenges we face right now.”The GOP leader, who is up for reelection in November alongside Trump, dashed home to Kentucky for an event with the nation’s drug czar, Jim Carroll, in a part of Appalachia confronting opioid addiction and skyrocketing overdose deaths.As for the Covid-19 crisis, McConnell said in Ashland, Kentucky, “This has been one heck of a challenge for everybody in the country. Hopefully we can come together behind some package we can agree on in the next few weeks.”Click here for full Covid-19 coverageOne sticking point for Republicans trying to resolve their differences with the White House is how to cut the $600 weekly jobless benefit boost that is expiring.Republicans largely believe the add-on, which had been approved in an earlier aid bill, is too much and becoming a disincentive for returning to work. In some situations, the boost gives the unemployed more money than if they were working. Under McConnell’s plan, senators proposed cutting it to $200 and then transitioning over the next few months to a new system more closely linked to a state’s own payment levels.An administration official granted anonymity to discuss the private talks said the White House viewed the Senate GOP’s proposal as too “cumbersome” and the $200 boost as too high.A number of different solutions were being discussed, the official said Thursday, including dropping the add-on to $100.Democrats warned time was running out. The benefit officially expires July 31, but due to the way states process unemployment payments, the cutoff is effectively Saturday.Rep. Richie Neal, D-N.J., chairman of the House Ways & Means Committee, said the nation is on “the eve of an economic catastrophe.”The US registered its 18th straight week of new jobless claims topping 1 million, with an unemployment rate at 11 percent, higher than during last decade’s Great Recession. A new AP-NORC poll said half of Americans laid off now believe their jobs will not return.“People need the sustenance of day-to-day life,” Neal said at the Capitol. He said the extra aid not only helps cash-strapped families, but is key to fueling the economy as Americans go without paychecks. “The recovery is going to be slow,” he said.The unemployment debate is only one of many issues dividing Republicans as they enter negotiations with Democrats over how best to respond to the prolonged coronavirus crisis and devastating economic fallout.McConnell’s emerging CARES Act II, named after the earlier effort, was expected to include a fresh round of direct $1,200 cash payments to many Americans, a repeat of the money sent in spring, along with $105 billion to help reopen schools, $25 billion for virus testing and McConnell’s top priority of a liability shield to protect businesses, hospitals and others against Covid-19 lawsuits.Trump was pushing the payroll tax cut, but Senate Republicans didn’t want to include it because they say it does little to help out-of-work Americans. It would also pull revenue away from the tax that funds Social Security and Medicare.The president relented, but the White House also inserted new priorities — rethinking the jobless benefit and Trump’s preference for a new building to replace the FBI’s aging J. Edgar Hoover Building in downtown Washington, across the street from the Trump hotel.“This is disarray,” Pelosi said Friday at the Capitol.Next steps are uncertain after days of closed-door GOP negotiations at the Capitol with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and others.“We had expected to be working throughout this weekend,” the Democratic leaders said.“It is simply unacceptable that Republicans have had this entire time to reach consensus among themselves and continue to flail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-covid-19-bill-yet-white-house-gop-at-odds-over-jobless-aid/story-HNEVDWaGrkt91GEfZmAvRP.html
25-07-2020||World||No Covid-19 herd immunity yet, says WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan||The WHO’s chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan on Friday said “herd immunity” -- which is when enough people become resistant to a disease to stop its spread -- is still a long way ahead for Covid-19 since 50 to 60 per cent of the population will need to be immune to the novel coronavirus to protect the uninfected. In a social media live event organised by the World Health Organisation from Geneva, the scientist said that more waves of the infection would be required to get to a stage of natural immunity.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage Therefore, she warned, that at least for the next year or so, the world needs to be “geared up” to do everything possible to keep the novel coronavirus at bay while scientists work on vaccines. Meanwhile, therapeutics will help keep death rates low and allow people to get on with their lives. “For this concept of herd immunity, you need 50 to 60 per cent of the population to have this immunity to be actually able to break those chains of transmission,” explained Swaminathan. “That’s much easier to do with a vaccine; we can achieve it faster and without people getting sick and dying. So, it is much better to do it that way, to achieve herd immunity through natural infection. We would have several waves [of infection] and unfortunately also the mortality that we see,” she said. She added: “Over a period of time, people will start developing natural immunity. We know now from the studies that have been done in many of the affected countries that usually between 5 to 10 per cent of the population has developed antibodies. In some places it’s been higher than that, up to 20 per cent. “As there are waves of this infection going through countries, people are going to develop antibodies and those people will be hopefully immune for some time and so they will also act as barriers and brakes to the spread of this infection,” said Swaminathan, a paediatrician from India and a globally-recognised researcher on tuberculosis and HIV.The scientist, who was addressing a range of questions on coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics, said that for the foreseeable future, it is important to be focussed on doing the “right thing” such as public health measures that are known to work while the world waits for a vaccine. “Even if the clinical trials are successful and we have a couple of vaccines by the end of this year, we still need the hundreds of billions of doses, which will take time,” she said. Elaborating on vaccine development, the chief scientist said there are over 200 candidates in some stage of development as she highlighted the extraordinary speed at which the science has been moving around the understanding of the novel coronavirus. “Vaccine development is normally quite a lengthy and laborious process… the more candidates we have, the more opportunities we have for success,” she said. “Most people who recover from Covid-19 develop neutralising antibodies, which means a vaccine has a good chance of offering protective immunity,” she said. Asked about the fearful prospect of never getting a vaccine for Covid-19, Dr Swaminathan admitted that “we have to entertain the possibility that we may have to learn to live with this virus”. “Right now it seems frightening; what will we do if we don’t have a vaccine? But it is a possibility, there is no 100 per cent guarantee that we will have one. Let’s hope we do. But we know, now, what are the measures that we can take to minimise the spread of this infection, such as maintaining distance, hand washing, respiratory hygiene and wearing of masks,” she said. According to Johns Hopkins University, the Covid-19 pandemic has so far infected more than 15.5 million people and killed over 6.3 lakh across the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-covid-19-herd-immunity-yet-says-who-chief-scientist-soumya-swaminathan/story-ho7p9cZpArmLMIDbpNolvO.html
25-07-2020||World||Chilean suspect jailed in French murder case of Japanese||A Chilean man was order jailed in eastern France on Friday while he is investigated in the disappearance nearly four years ago of his ex-girlfriend, a Japanese student, in a case of suspected murder spanning continents but in which the body has not been found.Nicolas Zepeda, 29, extradited from Chile earlier in the day, was ordered detained by a judge in Besancon after hours of deliberation.The prosecutor in Besancon, where the missing Narumi Kurosaki had been studying, said the extradition of the suspect by Chile was a “new start” for the investigation even though Zepeda refused to answer questions of the investigating judge.“He simply declared that he is innocent” and expressed hope the real killer would be found, prosecutor Etienne Manteau told reporters.Being placed under investigation is a step short of formally being charged, under French legal procedure. Formal charges would come if the investigating judge concludes there is sufficient evidence to put the suspect on trial.Manteau predicted a trial could be held next year.It was a “major advance ... but it’s not over,” he said of the extradition. He himself had traveled to Chile as part of the murder probe.The regional press, which has followed the investigation, has described a love affair that allegedly went awry. Zepeda reportedly had met Kurosaki in Japan then traveled to France to see her after she ended the relationship.With Zepeda in custody, investigators must now plumb the personality of the suspect and “understand who Nicolas Zepeda really is,” the prosecutor said.Kurosaki disappeared in the early hours of Dec. 5, 2016, from her residence at the Besancon university campus. Zepeda had already returned to Chile before her disappearance was investigated.Despite long searches in the region’s thick forests and elsewhere, investigators failed to find her body, but police believe he killed her.During court proceedings in Chile, Zepeda acknowledged that he had visited Kurosaki at her apartment on the night she disappeared, even though their romantic relationship had ended. He said they had consensual sex.“We’re obviously interested in everything that might be proposed by the defense,” the prosecutor said.Until his extradition, Zepeda had been under house arrest at his mother’s apartment in the resort of Viña del Mar, 120 kilometers (75 miles) northwest of Santiago.Zepeda was turned over to French officials and put on a Paris-bound flight with police escort. From Charles de Gaulle airport, he was transferred Friday by car to Besancon, in the foothills of the Alps. His extradition was approved by Chile’s Supreme Court in May, but was delayed because of the coronavirus crisis and the cancellation of many international flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chilean-suspect-jailed-in-french-murder-case-of-japanese/story-hSakEevTdMLef9QdXE9KIJ.html

The announcement primarily affects new students hoping to enroll at universities that will provide classes entirely online as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.International students who are already in the US or are returning from abroad and already have visas will still be allowed to take classes entirely online, according to the update, even if they begin instruction in-person but their schools move online in the face of a worsening outbreak.The policy strikes a blow to colleges a week after hundreds united to repel a Trump administration policy that threatened to deport thousands of foreign students. That rule sought to bar all international students in the US from taking classes entirely online this fall, even if their universities were forced to switch to fully online instruction amid an outbreak.The new order was released Friday as a clarification to earlier guidance from March 9 that suspended existing limits around online education for international students. The March guidance was meant to provide flexibility as schools across the nation closed campuses amid the pandemic, but universities said it was unclear whether it extended to new students.In its memo, ICE clarified that the flexibility applies only to students “who were actively enrolled at a US school on March 9.” Officials at some schools — including Harvard University and the University of Southern California, which are offering classes online this fall — had feared as much and already told first-year students they could not come from abroad,.The American Council on Education, a group of university presidents, said it was disappointed by the guidance. “We have been fearing this and preparing for this. We’re still disappointed,” said ​Brad Farnsworth, vice president of the group.Harvard officials said they’re asking Congress to extend the March guidance to new students but don’t anticipate any changes by the fall term. New students can take classes online from abroad or defer their enrollment, the school said.In a message to students Tuesday, Harvard’s undergraduate dean, Rakesh Khurana, said the school “abhors” any policy that forces officials to choose between “our community’s health and the education of our international students.”The rule threatening to deport thousands of foreign students if they took all their classes online was widely seen as part of Trump’s recent campaign to pressure the nation’s schools and colleges to reopen this fall.Immigration officials rescinded the policy July 14 after it was challenged by eight federal lawsuits from states and universities. More than 200 schools had signed briefs supporting a suit brought by Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.The policy was issued as a growing number of colleges make the decision to hold classes entirely or primary online this fall. As virus cases continue to rise, schools including the University of California, Berkeley, and Rutgers University have announced the move this week.Several education groups issued letters this week urging ICE to allow all international students, including new ones, to enter the country even if their schools were operating entirely online. They said many colleges had already prepared housing for international students, even at universities offering online instruction only.The Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, a coalition of college leaders, said it was disappointed by ICE’s decision on new students. It places undue pressure on schools to offer at least some in-person instruction, the group said.But other elements of the guidance took a step in the right direction, the group said, including the clarification that students can remain in the US even if their schools switch to fully online instruction during the semester.Colleges across the US are already expecting sharp drops in the number of students coming from abroad amid the pandemic and a slowdown in visa processing. It’s likely to deliver a financial hit to colleges that rely on revenue from international students, who typically pay higher tuition rates.The nation attracted roughly 1.1 million international students in the 2018-19 school year. The American Council on Education estimates about 250,000 international students will enroll at US universities this fall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-foreign-students-can-t-enter-us-if-courses-online-us/story-vkFZazTZMdhRQ7vJSHcccO.html

At that point, federal agents checked the locked doors of the consulate and a locksmith was seen working to crack the lock on one door.Meanwhile, a small group of protesters gathered across the street and played a recording criticizing the Chinese government.It was unclear at the scene if the consulate had been cleared of consular staff. A Houston Police Department spokesman referred all questions to the FBI and State Department, which did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.The US alleged that the consulate was a nest of Chinese spies who tried to steal data from facilities in Texas, including the Texas A&M medical system and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.China called the allegations “malicious slander” and responded by ordering the U.S. to close its consulate in the western Chinese city of Chengdu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-consulate-in-houston-cleared-out-ahead-of-eviction/story-7ttwf09TNrQE7SeaCv26uJ.html
25-07-2020||World||Facebook, Twitter remove accounts of Bolsonaro supporters following court order||Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc took down the accounts of several high-profile supporters of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro following a Supreme Court order, a move that underlines the tricky territory the social media titans are navigating in some of the world’s largest jurisdictions.Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered the removal of 16 Twitter accounts and 12 Facebook accounts on Friday, a decision tied to an ongoing probe into the alleged dissemination of disinformation by supporters of the right-wing Bolsonaro.Among the purposes of the “fake news” investigation, as it is known in Brazil, is to discover if misinformation and threats against Supreme Court officials are being funded illicitly.Among the owners of the suspended accounts is Roberto Jefferson, a former congressman and president of the conservative PTB party, as well as businessmen Luciano Hang, Edgar Corona and Oscar Fakhoury, and activist Sara Giromini, widely known as Sarah Winter.Moraes had ordered the accounts blocked in a separate ruling in May, though the accounts were not removed at the time.Friday’s order, Moraes said, was meant to stop the accounts from “being used as a means of committing possible criminal conduct.”Facebook said in a statement that it “respects the judiciary and complies with valid legal orders.” Twitter in a statement said, “Twitter acted strictly to comply with a legal order related to a Supreme Court investigation.”The blocked Twitter accounts themselves, on the pages where their accounts would be, said Friday evening they were suspended “in response to a legal order.”The reaction among Brazil’s conservatives was swift.The PTB party said in a statement that it was surprised by “yet another arbitrary measure” ordered by Moraes, which “impedes the exercise (of Jefferson’s) right to liberty of expression and opinion on social media.”Winter, the activist, said she would complain to “international human rights organizations about the serious offense against free speech.”While Bolsonaro did not immediately address the removal of the accounts, he has previously spoken against the inquiry, calling it a grave threat to free speech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-twitter-remove-accounts-of-bolsonaro-supporters-following-court-order/story-jOH6SukVL7v0NrgYKvzZzI.html
25-07-2020||World||US records over 1,000 coronavirus deaths for fourth straight day||The United States recorded more than 1,000 deaths from Covid-19 for the fourth day in a row on Friday, according to a Reuters tally, as the Trump administration stressed the need for children to go back into the classroom despite fears about safety.Early June was the last time the United States recorded over 1,000 deaths a day for four days in a row, resulting from fallout from infections in April. In the most recent outbreak, cases began rising in early June and deaths increased about six weeks later.So far in July, 19 US states have broken one-day records for increases in Covid-19 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. Texas lost a record 206 lives on Wednesday, Florida had a record increase of 173 deaths on Thursday and California’s record was 159 on Wednesday.US deaths rose by at least 1,019 to a total of 145,352 on Friday compared with a rise of 1,140 on Thursday, 1,135 on Wednesday and 1,141 on Tuesday. Total cases across the United States rose by at least 68,800 on Friday to over 4 million total.Even though deaths are rising in the United States for a second week in a row, they remain well below levels seen in April, when 2,000 people a day on average died from the virus. The outbreak in March and April ravaged many nursing homes while infections this summer have been in younger, healthier individuals. Hospitals have also found better treatments, such as putting patients on their bellies and using the antiviral drug Remdesivir.Among the 20 countries with the largest outbreaks, the United States ranks seventh highest globally for deaths per capita, according to a Reuters analysis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-records-over-1-000-coronavirus-deaths-for-fourth-straight-day/story-5vEzmeko14vErSDHu5fFhJ.html

Trump, in an interview with Barstool Sports, said it’s not like the old days when people wrote a letter and let it sit for a day before sending it, giving them time to reconsider. “But we don’t do that with Twitter, right?” Trump said. “We put it out instantaneously, we feel great, and then you start getting phone calls, ‘Did you really say this?’” Trump said that more often than not, “it’s the retweets that get you in trouble.” He added, “You see something that looks good and you don’t investigate.” Among other things, Trump has been criticized in recent months for retweeting posts with “white power” and anti-Semitic messages as well one that included a “FireFauci” hashtag, referring to Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-had-regrets-about-his-tweets-too-often/story-jPYud8kBMrUPaTUiOJq1DI.html
25-07-2020||World||UK PM Johnson admits govt didn’t understand Covid-19 in first weeks, months||After over 45,600 deaths and nearly 3 lakh cases in the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday night admitted that the government did not understand the coronavirus in the first few weeks and months, adding things could have been done differently.The UK has registered the worst death toll in Europe and one of the highest in the world, with questions swirling over the Johnson government’s handling of the situation: from initial ideas about ‘herd immunity’, a late lockdown (on March 23) and a track-and-trace system.Johnson, who recovered after being severely infected by the virus, told the BBC in an interview to mark the first anniversary of his entering Downing Street that “we didn’t understand (the virus) in the way that we would have liked in the first few weeks and months”.He said there were “very open questions” about whether the lockdown had started too late, adding that there were lessons to be learned and that ministers could have done some things “differently”. He has promised an independent inquiry into the handling of the pandemic.According to him, “the single thing that we didn’t see at the beginning” was the extent to which coronavirus could be transmitted asymptomatically between people. But he said this is not the time for the independent inquiry to take place.He said: “Maybe there were things we could have done differently, as I’ve said, and of course there will be time to understand what exactly we could have done, or done differently. But what I think the public wants us to do now is to focus on getting the preparations ready for what, as I say, could be a resurgence of the virus this winter.”The number of deaths and cases have come down in recent weeks, prompting the government to ease lockdown and reopen large sectors of the economy, besides picking up 80 per cent of the salary bill of private sector employees and paying similar grants to the self-employed. Labour has accused the Johnson government of ‘mishandling’ the crisis. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “Boris Johnson has finally admitted the government has mishandled its response to the coronavirus. It was too slow to acknowledge the threat of the virus, too slow to enter lockdown and too slow to take this crisis seriously.”On the death toll, which the Office for National Statistics has put at over 50,000, Johnson said in the interview: “We mourn every one of the of those who lost their lives and our thoughts are very much with their with their families. And I take full responsibility for everything that government did.”Johnson, who took over after Theresa May resigned and won the Conservative leadership contest last July, later won a comfortable majority in the December election on the back of the slogan of ‘Get Brexit done’. He admitted that the outbreak of coronavirus had caused ‘many difficulties’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pm-boris-admits-uk-did-not-understand-it-in-first-weeks-months/story-l6Z0p2R9idlcfePimlh9cI.html
25-07-2020||World||Mike Pompeo sets agenda for a new Cold War with China. Russia will be key||On the day his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was goading the world to rise up against the tyranny of Chinese President Xi Jinping, US President Donald Trump dialled his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to discuss the inclusion of Beijing in future talks on strategic arms control, oil security and Iran developments.According to diplomats based in Washington and Moscow, this was President Trump’s fifth call to President Putin in the past two months as Russian Federation is the key to holding a rampaging China accountable in the long term interests of global peace.While the US President understands the importance of Russia in handling Beijing, he faces stiff resistance from the cold warriors and anti-Trump activists in Washington who still see Moscow, not China as the enemy number 1. President Trump’s conversation on Iran was to dissuade President Putin from supporting Tehran who wants to join hands with China for a long term anti-US alliance.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, on his part, virtually upended the 1970s Nixon-Kissinger doctrine of engaging China in the belief that Beijing rulers would assimilate in the global comity of nations. The Nixon-Kissinger engagement of China was at the cost of US relations with India as Washington held New Delhi responsible for the division of Pakistan in 1971 and moved the USS carrier Enterprise in opposition to the move.By saying that his past army record during the Cold War taught him that Communists always lie, Secretary Pompeo made it clear that the new mantra with Beijing was “distrust and verify,” refitting President Ronald Regan’s ‘trust but verify’ slogan vis-a-vis Soviet Union through the 1980s to present day China.Also Watch | ‘Closing more Chinese consulates in US always possible’: Donald Trump General Secretary Xi Jinping is not destined to tyrannize inside and outside of China forever, unless we allow it….maybe it is time for a new grouping of like minded nations, a new alliance of democracies,” Pompeo said.While it is early days for Pompeo’s statement to be translated on ground, it is quite evident that China will do everything to ensure that President Trump does not return to power in November. His Secretary of State did sound like US diplomat George F Kennan, who sent an 8,000-word telegram to the US State Department in February 1946 - the now-famous ‘long telegram’ - where he articulated the US philosophy of “containment” to deal with the Soviet Union.Pompeo said he wasn’t advocating containment because the challenge facing the US and the world from China was much more complex. “The USSR was closed off from the free world. Communist China is already within our borders,” he said.Identifying China as a clear and present danger, Mike Pompeo turned President Nixon’s statement that “ world cannot be safe until China changes” on its head, saying that the world must change the Chinese Communist Party or China will change us as it is happening in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang.Following up on US National Security Advisor Richard O’ Brien, FBI Director Chris Wray and Attorney General William Barr’s caustic remarks on China, Secretary Pompeo has set the agenda for the dawn of a new Cold War. The last one ended with the disintegration of the erstwhile Soviet Union in 1991. Only this time the enemy is China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-sets-agenda-for-a-new-cold-war-with-china-russia-will-be-key/story-pqOH74cFjqfZFzYashstJJ.html

A statement sent to the Hindustan Times made this position explicit for the first time.Responding to queries from Hindustan Times about Canadian Government’s stand on the referendum scheduled for November this year, aimed at carving out a separate state of Punjab from India, a spokesperson of the country’s Foreign Ministry, stated in an email response: “Canada respects the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of India, and the Government of Canada will not recognize the referendum.”The spokesperson also said that the bilateral relationship between Canada and India “is a priority for the Government of Canada.”Indian officials did not want to comment on this development on record, though one described it as “significant” that this was put in writing and a change from the earlier stance that the referendum was protected by freedom of speech and expression rights in Canada. An official also pointed out that a recent message in this respect from Ottawa, stating its opposition to the referendum, was also communicated to New Delhi, via the High Commission in Canada.India’s High Commissioner in Ottawa Ajay Bisaria also refused to address this particular matter, but said, “We continue to engage closely with Canadian partners, including security agencies on a range of bilateral security issues. Canada has been requested to check anti-India activities and to proscribe individuals and entities declared illegal in India.”Following the return of Justin Trudeau as Prime Minister in October, New Delhi made it clear in official interactions that the issue of support for Khalistan in Canada had hindered relations between the two nations and expected more from the Canadian side. India, an official said, has noticed a perceptible difference in the attitude with which Canada has approached this contentious matter in recent months, a development described as “positive”.Coordination between security and intelligence agencies has also improved, with a delegation of the Royal Canadian Mounter Police (RCMP) holding discussions with counterparts in the National Investigative Agency (NIA) late last year. “There is active diplomacy and conversations going on,” an official said.In January this year, SFJ had written to Trudeau seeking his support for the non-binding referendum. The separatist organization plans to hold it in November, with in-person voting at various venues across the world including the Canadian cities of Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, Calgary and Edmonton.Reacting to the statement, SFJ’s legal advisor Gurpatwant Pannun said they were “not seeking recognition” of the right to freedom of expression from the Trudeau Government since it was guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom. He went on to say that such “political statements hold no water.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-to-not-recognize-results-of-punjab-2020-referendum-organized-by-sfj/story-H7Ur7veEX9Nn2VBf8BJLYJ.html

Congress legislators backing Gehlot staged a five-hour sit-in on Friday asking Mishra to call a special assembly session for a floor test. They accused Mishra of acting under pressure and ignoring their demand as Gehlot expressed confidence of winning the trust vote amid his power tussle with his former deputy Sachin Pilot. Poonia said Gehlot’s threat that the state’s people will picket the governor’s house if Mishra did not convene the session threatens peace. “The CM [chief minister] and his government are guilty of pushing the state’s peace and calm into anarchy,” said Poonia. “There were scenes of anarchy on the streets in the state today and the CM, who is also the home minister of the state, is morally responsible for this.” He added demonstrations were held at district headquarters on the call of the ruling party in clear violation of Covid-19 guidelines. “The fact that district administrations remained mute spectators to these violations shows the state government’s apathy towards Covid-19.” The delegation gave a memorandum to Mishra saying Gehlot’s statement about picketing was a criminal act under the Indian Penal Code. “The CM came to the Raj Bhavan with his MLAs, who shouted slogans; this led to anarchy. The pressure on the Governor to get a decision in their favour is a derogatory attempt to threaten Constitutional institutions. They also violated Covid-19 advisory on social distancing,” the memorandum said. Ruling Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma linked the meeting to the BJP’s conspiracy to topple the government. “They are trying to delay the session and it is their tactic to topple the government in which they are not being successful. The meeting also proves that we have the majority.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-team-meets-guv-over-cong-s-anarchy/story-pSn3VL10OsZ9rsPRjYs2EO.html

The death toll due to the coronavirus disease outbreak in Uttar Pradesh has mounted to 1,387, while the state’s caseload has reached 63,742. The state on Saturday reported 39 more deaths due to Covid-19 and 2,971 fresh cases, the highest single-day spike in the state. As of July 23, 17.05 lakh samples were tested in the state. At over 20.42 crores, Uttar Pradesh remains the most populous state in India but also the state which is not testing enough people, as the statistics show. “The (spot) review should be held at a health centre or a medical college,” he said, adding that the doctors should take rounds in hospitals and medical colleges.The officials should also focus on the number of beds in Level-1, L-2 and L-3 Covid hospitals, availability of oxygen in L-1 hospitals, oxygen and ventilators in L-2 hospitals and specialist doctors for co-morbidity patients in L-3 hospitals. They should also keep track of the home quarantine and paid isolation facilities, he said. The chief minister has asked the officials to send a proposal to the Centre to buy advance life support ambulances.In the meeting, the Adityanath also asked the chief secretary and additional chief secretary of health for a spot review of health services in Kanpur Nagar and Jhansi divisions on Saturday and in Prayagraj and Mirzapur divisions on Sunday. A report of the review meetings should be made available to him, the chief minister said, adding an action plan based on points given for the review meetings should be prepared. The divisional commissioners should implement the action plan. The nodal officers should camp in the districts allotted to them for five days to effectively implement the arrangements there, the chief minister said to the officials.Calling for effective cleanliness and sanitisation during the weekend special campaign, he said the urban development, rural development and panchayati raj departments should intensify the drive.Sanitisation, spraying of anti-larva chemicals and fogging should be done both in rural and urban areas, he said, adding that water-logging should be removed.The campaign to check spread of Covid-19 and other contagious diseases should be conducted with team spirit, he said.Work should be allocated separately for chief medical officers and deputy chief medical officers and monitored on a day- to-day basis, the chief minister said.“Patients should not be kept in holding areas and their medical treatment should start immediately,” he added.Of the 39 new deaths, five each were reported in Kanpur and Varanasi, followed by four in Gorakhpur, two each in Prayagraj, Bareilly, Firozabad and Sultanpur.One death each was reported from Lucknow, Jhansi, Moradabad, Bulandshahr, Hapur, Sambhal, Hardoi, Sant Kabir Nagar, Rampur, Etawah, Kannauj, Mau, Pilibhit, Rae Bareli, Bhadohi, Bahraich and Balrampur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-yogi-adityanath-wants-a-lakh-covid-tests-daily-in-uttar-pradesh-by-monday/story-Jb465o0hVA6M3nd967VsNO.html
25-07-2020||India||India okays $400 mn currency swap for Sri Lanka||New Delhi India on Saturday announced it had finalised a $400-million currency swap facility for Sri Lanka under the Saarc framework, and people familiar with the development said Colombo’s request for a bilateral swap facility for $1.1 billion is being considered.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) signed documents for giving effect to the currency swap facility for the Central Bank of Sri Lanka on Friday. The arrangement will remain available till November 2022, and the Indian mission in Colombo informed senior officials of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka about the decision. This currency swap was extended by India following a request from the Sri Lankan side for the facility under the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) Currency Swap Framework in order to cope with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.During a phone conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on May 23, Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had asked the Indian government to provide a special swap facility of $1.1 billion “to top up the $400 million under the Saarc facility”.One of the people cited above said on condition of anonymity: “While the agreement for the currency swap under the Saarc framework has been concluded, the bilateral swap request for $1.1 billion is being considered.” A statement issued by the Sri Lankan president’s office in May had quoted Rajapaksa as saying the special swap of $1.1 billion “would enormously help Sri Lanka in dealing with our foreign exchange issues”. A currency swap facility helps a country obtain foreign currency loans at better interest rates than by borrowing directly from the market, and repayment is done at the exchange rate fixed at the time of borrowing. This eliminates risks due to fluctuations in exchange rates.Sri Lanka has made several requests for assistance from India after the Covid-19 pandemic devastated the country’s tourism industry. The Indian move to aid the island nation comes at a time when New Delhi is shoring up relations with countries in the neighbourhood against the backdrop of the border stand-off with China. On July 14, India’s deputy high commissioner Vinod K Jacob met and discussed the currency swap arrangement with the Governor of Sri Lanka’s Central Bank, WD Lakshman. On July 22, the Indian high commission also facilitated technical discussions on rescheduling of bilateral debt repayment by Sri Lanka.During his visit to India earlier this year, Rajapaksa had sought a moratorium on repayment of loans worth almost $1 billion.“These positive developments illustrate active implementation of the leadership-level commitment to work together for addressing the challenges arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, and further the mutually beneficial India-Sri Lanka partnership, including in the economic domain,” said a statement issued by the Indian high commission in Colombo.The people cited above said the prime minister had already conveyed India’s support to Sri Lanka in dealing with the pandemic and its economic impact.“The request from Sri Lanka came against the backdrop of the country’s economy, like that of many other countries, slowing down. Increasing foreign exchange outflows in Sri Lanka resulted in the dwindling of its dollar reserves and added pressure on the Sri Lankan rupee,” said the person cited above. The currency swap agreement with Sri Lanka reflects India’s commitment to help its “friendly neighbour with its economic revival amid the pandemic”, the person said. Earlier, India had assisted Sri Lanka by sending four consignments of essential medicines and equipment during April-May to fight the pandemic. RBI’s currency swap arrangement for Saarc states has a corpus of $2 billion. This facility became operational in November 2012 to provide funding for short-term foreign exchange liquidity requirements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-okays-400-mn-currency-swap-for-sri-lanka/story-VoXlste2wkloBt17pLqp9I.html

A similar call was issued by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) to saints and seers associated with the front. It said the Bhoomi Poojan day must be celebrated keeping in mind the guidelines issued by administrations and governments to contain the spread of Covid-19 pandemic.“On August 5, Wednesday, 2020, at 10.30 am, all the revered sant-mahatmas, in their respective monasteries, ashrams and all the devotees living in the country and abroad, sitting together in their homes or nearby temples or Ashrams, should worship their respective adored deities, recite kirtans, offer flowers, perform aarti and distribute prasad,” read a statement from the VHP quoted by ANI.Also Read: ‘Auspicious time for Ram Temple ceremony has come after 500 years’: Yogi AdityanathThe VHP hoped that devotees would be able to watch the live telecast of the ceremony in Ayodhya in their respective areas on televisions or on big screens.The parishad also asked the people to decorate houses, neighbourhoods, villages, markets, monasteries, gurudwaras, ashrams, etc and distribute Prasad and also light lamps after sunset instead of visiting Ayodhya on the occasion.UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who reviewed the preparations for the foundation stone laying ceremony in Ayodhya today, too, asked all temples in Ayodhya to carry out special cleaning of their premises and light lamps on August 4 and 5 to celebrate the beginning of the construction of a grand temple of Lord Ram, sources quoted by PTI said.

25-07-2020||India||Meet the corporate professional who found her calling in organic farming||Meenakshi Kishore has bucked the trend and traded her corporate job to try her hand at an organic farm-to-fork model four years ago. Kishore, who holds a Master in Business Administration (MBA) degree from the Symbiosis Institute of Management in Pune, took to organic farming in Agra in 2016 after holding several senior-level corporate positions in multi-national companies (MNCs), private equities (PEs) and venture capitals (VCs). Kishore, who is in her 40s and spent her better part of her formative years in a boarding school, made a conscious choice to give up her cushy corporate job and attractive monthly paycheque for healthy living and a union with Mother Nature. “I was in the quest for inner peace that was missing in the corporate world. I knew my penchant for a slow-paced life and also wanted to do something more meaningful in harmony with nature. Corporate life is an existence that thrives on excesses and it had ceased to have any meaning for me,” she reminisced. Her father Ajay Kishore, who is a partner-in-arms in her daughter’s unusual mid-life journey, is supportive of her entrepreneurial endeavour. “On her return to Agra, she wanted to do something different. Conventional farming was not to her liking. Health and the environment are key thrust areas. She spent the next two years researching, travelling across the country, and training herself under several farmers to learn new principles and best practices of farming. She learned about permaculture and regenerative farming,” said Kishore senior. “Regenerative farming explores the concept of nutrient-dense foods, where essential vitamins and minerals remain intact within the food structure. Nutrient-dense foods can only be grown on well-nourished soil and with the use of bio-insecticides and bio-fertilisers. The variants of food grown are unpolished, handmade, machine-free, or minimally processed, cold-pressed, and hormone-free. Ideally, they should be tree-ripened as well,” she explained. Her labour of love has come to fruition at Advait Living, a 40-acre farmland on the banks of the Yamuna river and on the Mathura-Agra border. The farmland was originally barren, and it took years to become fertile. Initially, the farm was used for traditional cash crops such as wheat and mustard. Now, it is designed as an integrated regenerative and bio-dynamic entity that has found a life of its own and whose popularity is growing, thanks to word-of-mouth publicity. Kishore cited that the farm integrates all beings — from farmers, livestock, birds, insects, plants, and micro-organisms into a single working unit, each interdependent upon another.“The farm has adopted a regenerative approach to build soil health, biodiversity, micro-climates and water management to grow nutrient-dense produce. Cow-based farming is another core pillar of our farming method. The cow manure and urine are used to make bio-fertilisers and soil-boosters that enhance the soil’s nutritional content,” she added. The farm produces oilseeds, wheat, millet, fresh vegetables, and fruits, among other things. It also processes raw produce into ghee, oils, spices, flour, jaggery, etc. “Advait Living also works with small and marginal farmers to provide expert training to convert traditional agricultural practices into regenerative farming and bio-dynamic systems that support the farmer’s access to better revenue, prices, and critical know-how. Farmers are also able to access new markets under the Advait Living brand and through our retail outlet and partner alliances across the country,” she said. “There is a growing awareness and our clientele is increasing with ‘immunity’ being the latest buzz amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. Consumers are coming to us for organic products that are free from adulteration. There is a huge demand for mustard oil and jaggery. Many homemakers are asking for natural products and consumers are selecting foodstuff on the parameters of health,” said Kishore, who is a photography buff and also fond of cooking. Advait Living has been retailing Bilona A2 cow ghee, cold-pressed cooking mediums such as mustard oil, sesame oil, and coconut oil, unpolished dals, whole wheat flour, honey, jaggery and non-genetically modified (GM) rice variants and spices from its outlet at Bagh Farzana in Agra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meet-the-corporate-professional-who-found-her-calling-in-organic-farming/story-1LzXG9CBySvo6AJ5zFWD8K.html

The HC bench, comprising Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice SD Singh, passed the order while taking cognisance of an e-mail sent by Dr Abhishek Atrey, a Delhi- based lawyer. The e-mail was addressed to Chief Justice Mathur and was treated as a petition for a writ in the public interest by the HC bench. The petition cited media reports in connection with the alleged sexual abuse of minor girls in Chitrakoot, and levelled allegations pertaining to the blatant violation of the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986. As per some media reports, minor girls from poor tribal families are forced to work in illegal mines for survival, but the contractors and middlemen don’t pay their wages on time. These girls are allegedly forced to trade off their bodies in a bid to get their meagre wages. The court has directed its registry to send a notice of the petition to the DM, the chairman, the DLSA of Chitrakoot by facsimile within two days and fixed July 28 as the next date of hearing in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/probe-alleged-sexual-exploitation-of-minor-girls-in-chitrakoot-allahabad-high-court/story-HkZyueIuVehTuEFGSHK6fP.html

Days are not far off, when we would be able to give employment to others if things went our way,” said Suraj Kumar, 28, who has about 14 years of experience in manufacturing of paver at a factory near old Rawalpora airport in Srinagar.“Coronavirus has certainly been a factor and an eye-opener for us. The biggest problem lies in the fact that we chose to be defensive and not to risk anything in our lives,” said Maksudan Yadav, a resident of Madhopur-Bairiya village, a worker at the unit.Also Read: Patna tops Bihar’s districts with 316 Covid-19 cases; Bhagalpur, Gaya take tally near 40,000Their employer described them as hard workers. “It’s certainly a loss for us as they had pretty good experiences ranging from two years to 14 years with us. However, our door is always open for them,” said Umar Bashir, who runs JD group of industries in Srinagar.Within one month of working together, as many as 14 workers, 12 of them from Srinagar, have churned out about 75,000 pebbles (12x12 with one inch thickness), besides flower pots (about 60 pieces), cement bench (one piece), bed, tables and chairs.“All the materials needed such as stone dust, pebbles, sand, colour, hardeners and cement are readily available here,” said Om Prakash Yadav.“We used to earn ₹3.5 for each block in Srinagar which had to be shared among ten to twelve workers. However, we managed to save close to ₹1 lakh in seven to eight months of working due to the volume of production,” said Rahul Yadav.Watch:Bihar floods | ‘Over 10 lakh people affected, 1 lakh+ evacuated’: SDMAWhile, they have received orders for paver blocks from the panchayat and block officer, district development commissioner (DDC) also placed an order of 6,000 paver blocks.“The orders from panchayat and block office have been placed. We are helping them to get a loan from the bank,” said Harimohan Kumar, block development officer (BDO), Gaunaha.West Champaran district magistrate (DM) Kundan Kumar said the whole concept is aimed at turning migrant workers into entrepreneurs.“A multi-pronged strategy was adopted ranging from micro-detailing of their skills to backward and forward linkage (raw material procurement and marketing for finished products), to making ‘udyami mitra mandal’ (a group of productive people) during their stay in quarantine itself,” said Kundan Kumar.He added that senior officials have been engaged to help them set up their businesses and to open up new avenues for them as entrepreneurs as beneficiaries of Bihar government’s Nav Parivartan Yojna and bank loan scheme.Meanwhile, a group of 30 entrepreneurs from Noida, Gandhinagar, Ludhiana and other places visited Bettiah recently.The DM says they were apprised about the benefits they would receive from the district administration if they chose to outsource their work and source products from home grown units.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrants-return-from-j-k-become-entrepreneurs-in-bihar/story-ReXVzFK1v1AalPSki0dxxH.html
25-07-2020||India||Rapid surge in Covid-19 cases forcing several states to impose selective lockdown||More high-risk areas were brought under lockdown on Saturday for varying periods, including weekends, by states in a bid to check the rapid rise in Covid-19 cases in India. Over a dozen states have so far opted for such selective lockdown citing the need to revive economic activities and at the same time reduce the risk of spread of infection, though Bihar and Manipur have imposed a state-wide shutdown from July 16 and July 23 respectively. In Madhya Pradesh, where Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan tested positive for coronavirus and was admitted to a hospital, a 10-day lockdown has been imposed in state capital Bhopal after a spike in cases. The state has been observing total shutdown on Sundays. A complete lockdown till Monday morning was imposed in Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu, which too has been enforcing shutdown every Sunday. Tamil Nadu on Saturday breached the grim milestone of two lakh coronavirus cases with the biggest daily spike of 6,988 fresh infections, pushing the tally to 2,06,737, according to state officials. While Uttar Pradesh observed another weekend lockdown, similar curbs were imposed for the second time this month in Uttarakhand’s four districts -- Dehradun, Haridwar, Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar districts -- which have reported 1,348 cases since July 18. All shops were shut and transport suspended in West Bengal as part of the twice-a-week lockdown in the state. Jammu went into a 60-hour lockdown from Friday 6 pm, while a six-day complete lockdown has been imposed across the Kashmir Valley except Bandipora since Thursday. In its most recent update, the union health ministry placed the total number of cases at 13,36,861 and the death toll at 31,358. Nearly 11.4 lakh cases have been reported in June-July alone when lockdown restrictions were eased.  In worst-affected Maharashtra, where over 3.5 lakh cases have been recorded, civic authorities of Nagpur city announced a voluntary ‘janta curfew’ on Saturday and Sunday, when only essential services will remain functional. The step has been taken to bring public awareness about behavioural change towards Covid-19 rules, but if these rules are not followed, then a strict curfew could be imposed in the city, Nagpur municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe warned. Chief Minster Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday said that he was not in favour of complete lifting of the coronavirus-induced curbs in the state only to address the economic concerns. Maharashtra too had imposed strict shutdown for varying periods in areas with high incidence of coronavirus infection including Pune. “I will never say that the lockdown will be lifted completely. But I have started reopening a few things gradually. Once reopened, it shouldn’t be shut again. Hence, I prefer taking steps in phases. You can’t just think about economy or health. There needs to be a balance between the two,” he said in an interview to Shiv Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’. From June onwards, the government had started lifting the restrictions in phase-wise manner under its ‘Mission Begin Again’ initiative. A complete lockdown was imposed in Nagaland capital Kohima till July 31, while it will come into effect in Dimapur from Sunday till August 2. The Meghalaya government too has announced a complete lockdown in Shillong agglomeration from July 26 to July 29.In Chhattisgarh, a seven-day lockdown has been enforced from Wednesday in municipal limits of Raipur and Birgaon, besides 20 other urban bodies. Normal life came to a grinding halt in West Bengal on Saturday as shops were shut and all modes of transport went off the roads as part of the state government’s plan to clamp restrictions two days a week. A similar lockdown will take place next Wednesday. More than 3,800 people were arrested for flouting lockdown guidelines on Thursday when it was first imposed. Flight operations at the Kolkata airport were also suspended during the lockdown. Police patrolled all major traffic intersections in the metropolis to keep a check on people coming out on the streets. Barricades were also put up in various parts of the state to stop people from coming out of their homes, officials said. West Bengal has so far registered 53,973 Covid-19 cases and 1,290 deaths till Friday. Odisha had ordered a complete 14-day lockdown in five districts of Ganjam, Khordha, Cuttack, Jajpur and Rourkela districts from July 17. According to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Saturday morning, Delhi has reported 1,28,389 cases, Karnataka 85,870, Andhra Pradesh 80,858, Uttar Pradesh 60,771, West Bengal 53,973, and Gujarat 53,545 cases.Karnataka has been enforcing a Sunday shutdown this month. A week-long lockdown in Bengaluru had ended on July 22. The number of Covid-19 cases has gone up to 52,466 in Telangana, 34,178 in Rajasthan, 33,926 in Bihar, 29,755 in Haryana, 29,921 in Assam and 26,210 in Madhya Pradesh. Odisha has reported 22,693 infections, Jammu and Kashmir 16,782, Kerala 16,995, and Punjab 12,216. India’s first case of coronavirus was reported on January 30, and on March 25 the country was put under a 21-day complete lockdown, which was then extended periodically.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rapid-surge-in-covid-19-cases-forcing-several-states-to-impose-selective-lockdown/story-jh2SjuXAWraJJrhyV7K07M.html
25-07-2020||India||Coronavirus crisis: The dilemma of Covid-19’s second wave||Shuttering businesses, grounding airlines and ordering people to stay home was hard enough the first time. The thought of having to do it all over again is something world leaders don’t want to even contemplate.From Italy to New Zealand, irrespective of how well the virus was contained, governments acknowledge that fresh waves of the deadly coronavirus are likely and that the policy tools to mitigate the damage are limited. The hope is that localizing quarantines to towns, cities and regions will be enough to snuff out bouts of infections as they come.UK’s Boris Johnson was reluctant to order a lockdown and then ended up in intensive care fighting for his life after contracting Covid-19. Yet he finds the idea of isolating the nation again so off-putting that he compared it to a nuclear deterrent: “I certainly don’t want to use it.” French Prime Minister Jean Castex, was equally blunt: “We won’t survive, economically and socially.”Also read: No Covid-19 herd immunity yet, says WHO chief scientist Soumya SwaminathanAt the other end of the globe, New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern has warned that it just takes one mistake to be exposed to the virus again. But even for her, reverting to a nationwide lockdown would be a “measure of last resort.”It all speaks to the great elephant in the room: while scientists warn it could take years to control a deadly virus that has killed more than 630,000 worldwide, there is no appetite to sustain the hiatus on travel, work and leisure that has upended everyone’s lives in 2020.With the world facing its worst recession since the Great Depression and U.S. President Donald Trump fighting for re-election in November, voters are on edge. Politicians of all stripes are looking for ways to ease the pain—not add to it—as fear morphs into anger and discontent. “Populations can be summoned to heroic acts of collective self-sacrifice for a while, but not forever,” political scientist Francis Fukuyama, author of “The End of History and the Last Man,” wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine. “A lingering epidemic combined with deep job losses, a prolonged recession, and an unprecedented debt burden will inevitably create tensions that turn into a political backlash—but against whom is as yet unclear.”The political calculus is to try it and ride it out. Yet while efforts to get people back to stores, restaurants, bars and hairdressers demonstrate the urgency among governments of reviving economies, they also show the risks.Also read | Covid-19: Finally, some good news from Delhi, writes Karan ThaparEurope’s hardest-hit country, Britain, reopened pubs and is now finding spikes in virus cases. Johnson, who aims to return to “significant normality” by Christmas, on Friday said his government is preparing the health service for a second wave of infections over the winter. Countries around the Mediterranean Sea pray a glimpse of tourism will get them through the summer before the cold snap drives people indoors and ushers a second chapter to the pandemic.Italy was the first Western democracy to quarantine the entire population as it became apparent its death toll was going to overtake that of China, where the virus originated. A person close to Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte described that decision as “shock therapy” that can’t be repeated. The euro’s weakest economy this week became the biggest beneficiary of the European Union’s $860 billion rescue package.Populations have already shown they are restless. Spain had a similar trajectory to Italy and in Madrid the resentment spilled into the streets. In Serbia, a jump in cases prompted President Aleksandar Vucic, just re-elected in a landslide, to try and impose another curfew only for him to reverse course in the face of violent protests.The situation is so desperate in Croatia, which relies on tourism more than any other country in the EU, that it pivoted from lockdown mode to embracing the Swedish model that allows bars and shops to stay open and there is no limit to size of public gatherings.At one point the government considered banning all wedding celebrations after a cluster of cases were traced to one event. All it took was some bad press from prospective brides for the plan to be dropped.Nowhere is the disconnect between the health risk and reticence to lock down more pronounced than in the U.S., the worst-hit nation with more than 140,000 dead and the number of infections soaring in battleground states Trump needs to win. But as far back as May, the president made his priorities clear.“Will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes,” Trump said during a factory visit in Arizona, a crucial swing state, that month. “But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.”The approaches have been so different it’s impossible to predict what governments will do when there is an agonizing trade off between deaths and the economy.In places like Singapore or South Korea, mass testing and heavy fines were the strategies successfully deployed to stop the spread. By contrast, in the U.K., there was until recently no mandatory use of masks to go into a shop. It was left to “basic good manners.”However unpalatable, the need to shut everything down may ultimately be forced upon leaders.In Australia, residents of Melbourne have been ordered to stay home for six weeks and South Africa ordered schools to be shut again. Israel declared victory over the virus only for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to warn another shutdown could be inevitable.New Zealand is unique in having eradicated the virus within its borders. Now it’s on high alert to keep it that way. Ardern, herself up for re-election this year, has deployed the military to enforce a quarantine on anyone entering the country.Back in the U.S., Trump has resurrected his White House briefings on the virus in an attempt to reassure Americans he has the pandemic under control and life is going back to normal. On Thursday, though, he scrapped the highly attended Florida convention for the Republican Party he had been keen to hold for 20,000 ardent supporters.“The country is in very good shape, other than if you look south and west—some problems,” he said. “That will work out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-crisis-the-dilemma-of-covid-19-s-second-wave/story-TM4h0725piK5iw1BJqUHQN.html

The Congress violated the Epidemic Act,” said Surendra Singh Naruka, state BJP legal cell convener. He said that in Jaipur state general secretary of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha Rajesh Gurjar gave the report to Sadar police station.Hundreds of workers of the Congress held demonstrations across Rajasthan on Saturday against what they called the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) “conspiracy to topple” the state government and to press for an assembly session.Congress workers took out a rally in Kota, staged a sit-in protest in Jodhpur and held protest demonstrations across the state. They accused the BJP of working against democratic values by conspiring to topple the Ashok Gehlot-led government.“We have the mandate. The governor is head of the family and we do not want any differences. If our constitutional rights are violated and if that is from the Raj Bhavan, then we can at least say that people will gherao as it will be an insult to the public,” Pratap Singh Khachariyawas, the state transport minister had said earlier in the day.A BJP delegation which met Governor Kalraj Mishra late Saturday afternoon lashed out at chief minister Gehlot for his statement on Friday that people of the state will picket the Raj Bhavan if Governor didn’t convene a session of the Assembly soon.BJP state unit president Satish Poonia who led the 15-member delegation said the CM and his government was guilty of pushing the state’s peace and calm into anarchy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-files-complaint-against-congress-in-rajasthan-says-protest-violated-epidemic-act/story-h8TGwWUlbPUhOQtVitPUXK.html
25-07-2020||India||Indian woman files lawsuit against US Immigration for delay in issuing work permits||An Indian woman has filed a lawsuit against the US Citizenship and Immigration Services for the alleged delay in issuing work permits, accusing the authorities of sitting on a backlog of at least 75,000 unprinted Employment Authorisation Documents. Ranjitha Subramanya, who is on an H-4 dependent visa and her husband Vinod Sinha on H-1B work visa, in a lawsuit filed before a federal court in Ohio said that while her application to extend her H-4 status and Employment Authorisation Document (EAD) was approved on April 7, she did not receive the work authorisation card till date. As a result, she was forced to stop working for her employer after her initial EAD expired on June 7, 2020. “To date, she has not received her EAD and remains unable to work. Worse, her employer has notified her that she will lose her job if she does not provide proof of employment authorisation by August 9, 2020,” said her lawyer Robert H Cohen in the lawsuit.An H-4 visa is a visa issued by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to the immediate family members of the H-1B visa holders. Spouses on an H-4 visa can apply for an EAD. The lawsuit alleges that the USCIS is sitting on a backlog of at least 75,000 unprinted EADs. “By delaying or refusing to provide EADs to plaintiffs and class members, defendants have abused their power in an egregious and outrageous manner, without any reasonable justification in the service of a legitimate governmental objective, and with either an intention to harm plaintiff and class members or deliberate indifference,” the lawsuit said. Early this week, the USCIS said it has “reduced its capacity to print secure documents,” such as work permits and permanent residency cards, after ending its contract with a third-party company that previously printed the cards. Noting that generally, the EAD is produced and sent to the applicant within 48 hours of the approval, the lawsuit said it has been over 105 days since the USCIS approved Ranjitha’s application but did not print and send her the EAD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-woman-files-lawsuit-against-us-immigration-for-delay-in-issuing-work-permits/story-fZtXRhAVMf8mojkgVYQEiN.html

25-07-2020||India||BJP CMs target Rahul over one district, one product scheme||The BJP on Saturday accused Rahul Gandhi of “copying” their idea after the Congress leader tweeted that he had suggested promoting one product from every district.“This is a good idea. I had suggested it some time back. Its implementation will need a complete change of mindset,” Gandhi tweeted, tagging a news item about a survey in BJP-ruled Himachal Pradesh by the industries department to select one product in each district for the centrally-sponsored cluster development programme for micro and small enterprises.But it only drew a sharp riposte from Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani.“Rahul ji, copying Gujarat’s initiatives and selling them as your ideas does not show your smartness. I don’t expect you to know details of anything, but your script-writers should know better! How about a ‘One defeat, One reinvention’ policy for you?” Rupani said while attaching a February 2016 tweet of the then state chief minister Anandiben Patel in which she had mentioned the “one village one product” concept.  Rahul ji,Copying Gujarat’s initiatives and selling them as your ideas does not show your smartness.I don’t expect you to know details of anything, but your script-writers should know better!How about a ‘One defeat, One reinvention’ policy for you? https://t.co/RreTEOK0IK pic.twitter.com/dtTeaTDj7UUttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also targeted Gandhi, without naming him, and said his government had given the mantra of “one district, one product” and has been working to implement it. This scheme is proving very effective in giving employment to people locally during the coronavirus crisis, he said. Will he ever desist from his “childish” behaviour, he added. “His memory is either weak or is like this only. He will remember this if he thinks hard. The BJP in its 2017 manifesto had spoken about promoting local products of every district.

25-07-2020||India||India finalises $400 mn currency swap for Sri Lanka, to consider President Rajapaksa’s request for further aid||India on Saturday announced it had finalised a $400-million currency swap facility for Sri Lanka under the Saarc framework, and people familiar with developments said Colombo’s request for a bilateral swap facility for $1.1 billion is being considered. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) signed documents for giving effect to the currency swap facility for the Central Bank of Sri Lanka on Friday. The arrangement will remain available till November 2022, and the Indian mission in Colombo informed senior officials of the Central Bank Sri Lanka government about the decision. This currency swap was extended by India following a request from the Sri Lankan side for the facility under the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) Currency Swap Framework in order to cope with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. During a phone conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on May 23, Sri Lankan President President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had asked the Indian government to provide a special swap facility of $1.1 billion “to top up the $400 million under the Saarc facility”. One of the people cited above said on condition of anonymity: “While the agreement for the currency swap under the Saarc framework has been concluded, the bilateral swap request for $1.1 billion is being considered.” A statement issued by the Sri Lankan president’s office in May had quoted Rajapaksa as saying the special swap of $1.1 billion “would enormously help Sri Lanka in dealing with our foreign exchange issues”. A currency swap facility helps a country obtain foreign currency loans at better interest rates than by borrowing directly from the market, and repayment is done at the exchange rate fixed at the time of borrowing. This eliminates risks due to fluctuations in exchange rates. Sri Lanka has made several requests for assistance from India after the Covid-19 pandemic devastated the country’s tourism industry. The Indian move to aid the island nation comes at a time when New Delhi is shoring up relations with countries in the neighbourhood against the backdrop of the border standoff with China. On July 14, India’s deputy high commissioner Vinod K Jacob met and discussed the currency swap arrangement with the Governor of Sri Lanka’s Central Bank, WD Lakshman. On July 22, the Indian high commission also facilitated technical discussions on rescheduling of bilateral debt repayment by Sri Lanka. During his visit to India earlier this year, Rajapaksa had sought a moratorium on repayment of loans worth almost $1 billion. “These positive developments illustrate active implementation of the leadership-level commitment to work together for addressing the challenges arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, and further the mutually beneficial India-Sri Lanka partnership, including in the economic domain,” said a statement issued by the Indian high commission in Colombo. The people cited above said the prime minister had already conveyed India’s support to Sri Lanka in dealing with the pandemic and its economic impact. “The request from Sri Lanka came against the backdrop of the country’s economy, like that of many other countries, slowing down. Increasing foreign exchange outflows in Sri Lanka resulted in the dwindling of its dollar reserves and added pressure on the Sri Lankan rupee,” said the person cited above. The currency swap agreement with Sri Lanka reflects India’s commitment to help its “friendly neighbour with its economic revival amid the pandemic”, the person said. Earlier, India had assisted Sri Lanka by sending four consignments of essential medicines and equipment during April-May to fight the pandemic. RBI’s currency swap arrangement for Saarc states has a corpus of $2 billion. This facility became operational in November 2012 to provide funding for short-term foreign exchange liquidity requirements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-finalises-400-mn-currency-swap-for-sri-lanka-to-consider-president-rajapaksa-s-request-for-further-aid/story-PADXBEHmsMsEzKz3AeQNzL.html

But it could not break Sonia Das’s resolve and she rode 1,800 km from Pune via Mumbai on a scooter with her friend Sabia Bano to reach Jamshedpur on Friday evening to see her family from a safe distance before the two women were shifted to a quarantine centre.“I saw my son and other family members standing on the balcony upstairs from the road outside our house in Kadma Bhatiya Basti in Friday evening before being shifted to Telco quarantine centre along with my friend Sabia Bano who accompanied me all the way from Pune on the Scooty. The administration here got my son here and arranged my meeting with him after I tested negative for coronavirus today,” Sonia said here Saturday afternoon.Sabia is a Pune resident.The Jharkhand health department had taken the duo’s samples for Covid-19 tests as Sabia was running fever while Sonia had developed a cough and cold with a minor breathing problem. Deputy superintendent of police Arvind Kumar and Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee (JNAC) special officer Krishna Kumar were present during the meeting. “We have shifted both Sonia and Sabia to 14-day home quarantine as per their wish and SDO has provided dry ration,” the DSP said.Sonia was forced to stay at Sabia’s place in Pune after she had to vacate her paying guest accommodation in Mumbai for failure to pay rent.“I had no money, food, no job and now no room to stay. I had shifted to Sabia’s place in Pune. I tweeted to Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren, called helplines of Maharashtra and Jharkhand governments but none was working. I tweeted to (actor) Sonu Sood Sir too but to no avail. Finally, I decided to return to Jamshedpur on my own and left on the night of July 20,” said Sonia.Sonia’s husband Abhishek Ghosh is a heart patient fitted with implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) machine. “He is not in a position to work anymore and for the past two years, I have been doing jobs in production houses in Mumbai on a freelance basis. I had gone to Mumbai in February for such a job and was supposed to return on March 20 but got stuck there as lockdown came into effect,” said Sonia.Sonia and Sabia stopped at ten petrol pumps and three dhabas on the way as they crossed Covid-19 affected states and cities on the way but faced no safety and security issues during the four days on the highway.“We mostly survived on bada-pav and water. Most people took us for boys as our faces were covered with helmets and we were wearing shirts and pants. At some places people did stare at us but we left those places immediately. On the other hand, some locals also came forward to help us and gave food and water. One such person whom we met at the Maharashtra border kept calling Sabia enquiring about our wellbeing and safety,” recalled Sonia.The unique journey finally came through after Jamshedpur deputy commissioner (DC) Suraj Kumar gave the permission to enter Jamshedpur a few days ago after Abhishek Ghosh’s repeated requests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jobless-homeless-woman-rides-1-800-km-on-scooter-from-pune-to-meet-son-in-jamshedpur/story-NqpZl5DNiVasoMbkNU3p9K.html
25-07-2020||India||To promote Indian vendors, Railways cite need to introduce clause in procurement process||The Indian Railways have pushed for promoting Indian vendors and products under the government’s ‘Make in India’ scheme in the procurement process of the national carrier.The national carrier on Saturday said there is a need to introduce a clause for promoting local content in procurement so that it get more bids from local vendors to give a boost to the government’s mission of Atma Nirbhar Bharat. The Railway ministry says it has sought the support of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade to make suitable policy revisions, if required.In a review meeting held on Saturday for steps to promote ‘Make in India’ products in procurement process, Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal emphasized the need to increase the participation of local vendors in the procurement process.Also read: Railways earned Rs 430 crore from Shramik Special train faresGoyal instructed officers to interact with the industry to ensure increased participation of Indian manufacturing.“While reviewing the steps to promote Make in India products in procurement process, it was emphasized to increase the participation of local vendors in procurement process. It was also decided that the local content clause in the procurement should be such that we may get more bids from local vendors/suppliers. This would also give a boost to mission Atma Nirbhar Bharat. Active support of DPIIT was sought to make suitable policy revisions, if required, to facilitate the efforts of Indian Railways in this direction,” the ministry said in a statement.“It was felt that encouragement needs to be given to such vendors who can supply higher locally manufactured content. It was also suggested to create a FAQ section and a helpline number so that vendors may get clarity on various issues relating to procurement process,” it added.The review meeting was also attended by Minister of State for Railways Suresh Angadi, Railway Board members, CEO, Government e-Marketplace (GeM) and representatives of DPIIT and Ministry of Commerce. Goyal emphasized the need to do procurement of approximately Rs 70,000 crore on the GeM platform to open up the market to the industry even at remote places and specially MSMEs.Also read: Amid Covid-19 pandemic, Indian Railways plans to implement QR code-based contactless ticket-checking system“A need for devising strategies for further increasing the participation of Indian service providers and component manufacturers was felt. Government e-Marketplace (GeM) is a highly innovative idea in public procurement, across the globe,” the ministry said.“Indian Railways, one of the largest procurement agencies of the Government of India, is integrating its procurement systems with GeM to use GeM’s full potential,” it added.The e-marketplace by the Centre is intended to becoming the single point of public procurement portal for all agencies of the government.This also comes days after the finance ministry amended its public finance rule that barred all government agencies to procure goods and services from bordering countries such as China and Pakistan on the ground of national security.The Centre amended the General Financial Rules, 2017, imposing restrictions on public procurement from bidders of countries that share a land border with India, citing grounds of defence and national security.Railways has also scrapped a tender for thermal cameras meant for ‘Covid-19 surveillance’ after Indian firms alleged that the tender specifications favoured a Chinese company.Apex traders’ body Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) earlier this month had also objected to the bid placed by a Chinese joint venture company for a global tender by the railways for manufacturing Vande Bharat trains.This also comes at a time when India and China are involved in a tense border stand-off along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh. A brutal brawl in Galwan Valley on June 15 led to 20 Indian and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers being killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-promote-indian-vendors-railways-cite-need-to-introduce-clause-in-procurement-process/story-PWs4Sc1hzFOeq2zgQKa30L.html

A total of 110,931 patients have been cured, discharged or have migrated.Consistently logging a higher number of recoveries than new cases has meant that the total number of active cases is declining regularly to reach 12,657. Out of these, 7,339 remain under home isolation.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesOn July 20, Delhi’s daily case count dropped under 1000 for the first time since June 1.Earlier today, Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain described the situation as “satisfactory” but added that there is a need to do “preparations”.CM Arvind Kejriwal, too, highlighted that Covid-related parameters have improved in Delhi in the last one month and claimed that the two crore people of the city, his government and the Centre have together attained “victory” in controlling Covid-19 spread but cautioned that the fight was not over yet.He was speaking at the inauguration of a 450-bed Delhi government hospital in Burari.Watch: Delhi: 80% hospital beds unoccupied; CM inaugurates new facility | Covid“The two crore Delhi people, Delhi government and the Centre have together attained victory over corona but it would not be correct to say that the fight is over,” he was quoted as saying by PTI.He also congratulated all the corona warriors with special mention to the health care professionals.“This is a result of the hard work of all the people. I want to congratulate all the doctors, nurses, paramedic staff, officials, and whoever has worked hard to achieve this goal,” Kejriwal was quoted as saying.While the Burari hospital will bring a welcome addition to the total bed capacity in the capital, the current availability of beds is not so bad according to the Saturday health bulletin. The city has currently 12,340 vacant Covid beds as against the total of 15,475. Burari hospital has further added to the capacity.The Delhi government recently gave its nod to make 200 beds operational at the under-construction Ambedkar Nagar Hospital in order to further ramp up the bed strength.Delhi has consistently increased its testing capacity, Covid bed capacity and adopted aggressive surveillance and contact tracing to isolate symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with the aid of increased cooperation between Central, state and municipal authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-promotes-delhi-s-covid-turnaround-story-with-87-29-recovery-rate/story-VeSxuRVz1VMZYcfD08kt6L.html
25-07-2020||India||Why ‘biryani challenge’ features in Kerala CM’s daily Covid briefings||Amid a raging coronavirus pandemic, a ‘biryani challenge’ has taken Kerala by storm. Every evening in Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s press briefing in the state capital, though the opposition dubs it ‘record briefing’ or ‘baddai’ (self-complementary), an often-heard word is ‘biryani challenge’.Towards the end of his daily briefing, the CM reads out contributions to Covid relief fund and here pops up ‘biryani challenge’ prominently. In simple words, an organization or a collective of youngsters collect money by conducting a biryani mela and contribute the same to the CM’s fund.It is a different story though that yummy biryani has topped the order list of an online food delivery platform (Swiggy) in the country knocking down the favorite masala dosa during the lockdown.The CM’s office said at least Rs 25 lakh came to the fund through ‘biriyani challenge’ in the last two months. “Youngsters really deserve a salute for this. We must appreciate their dedication and humane activities during trying times,” said the Chief Minister lauding the youngsters for their work.Now let us ask some youngsters how this challenge works? “Since it is for a noble cause, it sells like hot buns. Some buy it and distribute to others. At times, some contribute provisions and meat for this free,” said T Sooraj, a worker of a left youth movement who conducted four challenges and contributed Rs 2 lakh to the relief fund.“Usually a chicken biryani costs between Rs 100-150. Once you make it in bulk the actual cost will be below Rs 50.Since it is voluntary work, no wage is involved at any stage. So at least 80 percent of the sale proceeds go to the fund,” another volunteer said.In some areas, there is a healthy competition among left youth outfits to bring in maximum proceeds. Before the challenge, they collect orders so nothing goes to waste. Since lockdown is in force, biryani reaches the doorsteps and no delivery charge is deducted.In Malabar (north Kerala), left youth outfits popularised beef biryani making use of inclement weather. Right-wing groups like Seva Bharati and upper caste outfits resorted to curd rice and traditional sadya (feast) to check this. “You can’t have politics everywhere,” said P Suresh, a Seva Bharati leader from Kannur.Politics apart, some smart ones put a prefix ‘Thalassery’ before biryani for a quick movement. A coastal town in Kannur district sells Thalassery dum biryani - a mix of Persian, Arabian and Indian cuisine - sought after in south India for its flavour and minimum oil use.A battle for ‘original biryani’ stamp surfaced again after a restaurant in Pune put up a board in July first week saying that all “biryani other than Hyderabadi is pulao,” making many people angry. Earlier also biryani tiffs were there. The most popular one was after Telangana minister K T Rama Rao’s tweet in February: “Best biryani in the world belongs to Hyderabad. Rest are only poor imitations,” he tweeted.Niti Ayog CEO Amitab Kant, who started his long innings from Thalassery as its sub collector, and veteran journalist Vir Sanghvi batted well for Thalassery biryani then.Tiffs apart, the challenge is getting stronger in Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-biryani-challenge-features-in-kerala-cm-s-daily-covid-briefings/story-vQNmgbcQ8NQlQtylZ0yZ0H.html

Joshi told news channels that the army would continue all efforts to restore status quo ante, referring to the situation as it existed in early April, along the LAC. India and China have lately failed to make a breakthrough in reducing border tensions despite intense negotiations at the military and diplomatic levels, and the disengagement process at some friction points has virtually stopped. Also read: The Galwan Valley face-off explained through 17 news reportsJoshi’s comments came a day after the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on India-China border affairs reviewed the situation in the border areas and the disengagement process in the western sector of the LAC. At the meeting, the two sides agreed that another meeting of corps commanders “may be held soon so as to work out further steps to ensure expeditiously complete disengagement and de-escalation” along the LAC, the ministry of external affairs said in a statement on Friday. Another meeting of the corps commanders is expected to be held next week but no dates have been finalised yet. Joshi said disengagement was initiated after four rounds of talks between senior Indian and Chinese military commanders, and it was being verified on the ground to “ensure its veracity and correctness.” He said de-escalation of the border conflict would begin after achieving complete disengagement.

While noting that the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is working on a complete IT solution including a mobile application for seamless implementation of the scheme, Prime Minister said that the scheme design should incentive the use of end-to-end digital transactions by the street vendors.“This should cover the entire gamut of their business - from procurement of raw material to the collection of sale proceeds. Appropriate incentives and training should be conducted for this purpose. Use of digital payments would also help build a credit profile for the street vendor helping them in future financial needs,” he said.The Prime Minister stressed that the scheme should not be just seen from the perspective for extending loans to street vendors.Stating that the scheme can be seen as a part of an outreach to the street vendors for their holistic development and economic upliftment, he said: “One step in this direction would be by capturing their entire socio-economic details to facilitate necessary policy interventions. Such data could also be used by different Ministries of Government of India to benefit them under various schemes for which they are eligible, on priority.”These include housing under PMAY-U, cooking gas under Ujjawala, electricity under Saubhagya, health under Ayushman Bharat, skilling under DAY-NULM, Bank account under Jan Dhan, among various other schemes.The Centre has launched PM SVANidhi Scheme to facilitate collateral-free working capital loan up to Rs 10,000 of one-year tenure, to approximately, 50 lakh street vendors, to resume their businesses. Incentives in the form of interest subsidy (at 7 per cent per annum) and cashback (up to Rs 1,200 per annum) are being provided to promote good repayment behaviour and digital transactions respectively. The interest subsidy effectively works out to 30 per cent of the entire interest burden for a loan of Rs 10,000 at 24 per cent annual interest.Therefore, in effect the vendor does not pay any interest, rather gets a subsidy on the loan amount if he repays in time and uses digital transactions for all receipts and payments. The scheme entails enhanced next tranche of loan on early or timely repayment. Loan processing has begun since July 2 this year through an IT platform “PM SVANidhi” with Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), which is the implementing agency for the scheme administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-reviews-implementation-of-pm-svanidhi-scheme-2-6-lakh-applications-received/story-Dy1OHSoQMtgBKzdZcqKbGN.html

Malik (26), a resident of south Kashmir’s Shopian district, was summoned to Nigeen police station in Srinagar near KU on Friday and was arrested a day later. Malik is a post-graduate degree in biochemistry at KU, but was at home for over three months because of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak in the Kashmir Valley. “Malik has been arrested in a 2018 case under the UAPA,” said Gowhar Ahmad, station house officer (SHO), Nigeen police station. He was booked under Section 13 (a person who advocates, abets, advises or incites the commission of, any unlawful activity) of the UAPA, 1967. Sudhanshu Verma, superintendent of police (SP), Hazratbal, said Malik was arrested after collecting evidence in the case against him. “We wouldn’t have arrested him without any evidence. It took a while because of the prevailing pandemic,” SP Verma said. Malik’s family members said that they suspected the case was related to a protest he had held in a hostel of KU against the poor quality of food. They are travelling to Srinagar to meet him. “He was at home for the past three months and was called by SHO Nigeen to reach the police station, where he was arrested. He had protested in2018 against the bad quality of food served at the KU hostel,” said Faizan Mushtaq, younger brother of Malik. “He had raised his voice against corruption in the varsity and that is why he has been arrested,” he added. KU officials said that the case was not filed by the varsity authorities. “The university has been closed owing to the Covid-19 outbreak and all classes have been suspended. He is a student at the university and appeared for an examination recently. It is a 2018 case lodged at Nigeen police station. We have not filed any case against him. Hostel issues are always confined to the university,” said Nisar Ahmad Mir, registrar, KU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmir-university-student-arrested-under-uapa/story-zhg5VD7kllNbaZglT25OCM.html

It also reported four casualties taking the death toll to 60.The state capital Thiruvananthapuram remained worst-affected with 240 new cases and many areas of the city remained under triple lockdown. With 1,103 new cases total went up to 18,098. Out of this, 9,420 are active cases and recovered 8613. Now at least 80 per cent of the new cases are locally-transmitted, a worrying point for the state which has been effectively controlling the spread of the virus so far. In north Kerala’s Kasaragod, a newly-married couple were tested positive. And at least 40 guests who attended their wedding ceremony were also tested positive. The district collector has asked police to book all of them under relevant sections of the disaster management act. “It is sad such slips are happening despite high vigil. The state is going through a difficult situation and it is no time to lower our guard,” said Shailaja. The state has 481 hot spots now.Despite steep rise in cases the state had on Friday decided not to enforce complete lockdown in view of difficulties being faced by common man. The Confederation of Indian Industry Kerala chapter has also warned the government that such drastic actions would inflict a severe jolt on the economy which is already limping.A flare up in transmission can result in high casualty among the elderly and infirm in care homes. A care home in Ernakulam was converted as covid hospital after many inmates were tested positive. The government has also barred entry for others in care homes. The state has got a large population of elderly people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-reports-1-103-covid-19-cases-highest-since-coronavirus-outbreak/story-NntUYxbYffKsuaN3WiRXBJ.html
25-07-2020||India||Karnataka BJP plans slew of events from July 27 to celebrate one year in office||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday said that it would mark the first anniversary of being in office in the current term by outlining the achievements of the BS Yediyurappa-led government in Karnataka starting 27 July, through a series of events.After the May 2018 assembly elections in which BJP emerged as the single largest party but short of a majority, the Congress and JD(S) had come together to form a coalition government after Yediyurappa unable to prove his numbers had to resign within three days of being sworn in. However, the coalition government led by HD Kumaraswamy collapsed after 14 months in power when 17 Congress and JD(S) MLAs resigned and eventually crossed over to BJP.Yediyurappa was sworn in on July 26. So, as a part of its first anniversary celebrations, the party is planning a host of events. Deputy CM Ashwath Narayan said that on July 27 a booklet containing all the achievements of the government would be released. From July 28 till the end of the monsoon season across all 58,000 booths in the state the party plans to plant more than one crore saplings.From July 29 to 31, the BJP is planning a house-to-house outreach of 50 lakh households to inform them about the achievements of the government. On August 1, it intends to hold a virtual rally to be addressed by CM Yediyurappa and state unit party chief Nalin Kumar Kateel which BJP says will be attended virtually by one crore people.On Saturday, speaking to the media at the state BJP headquarters ‘Jagannath Bhavan’ Deputy CM Ashwath Narayan claimed that when it came to power the state was suffering from drought and in a short while large parts of the state were inundated with floods. “Later we had to face bypolls and now the Covid-19 situation which we are tackling under the guidance and leadership of PM Modi,” he addedAshwath Narayan said in spite of the challenges the state government ensured Rs 6,000 crore relief for the flood-affected, two lakh families were given Rs 10,000 each, Rs 911 crores was released for the repair of 1.25 lakh homes, Rs 1,185 crores was released for the farmers whose crops were destroyed.Political analyst Manjunath said that while the BJP government which earlier faced a precarious situation is stable with a simple majority it faces several challenges including having to come to terms with a post-Yediyurappa leadership situation in the state, continued dissidence among loyalists who feel that only defectors have been rewarded and the poor financial position of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-bjp-plans-slew-of-events-from-july-27-to-celebrate-one-year-in-office/story-TyFyUWqS0orx2y5euGlsYM.html

His antigen test showed positive for Covid-19. Behera, 55, who was posted at the Bhanjanagar court had returned home four days ago because he was not feeling well.However, after his death, his family members did not come near the body fearing infection.

We never compromise with the dignity of Covid warriors,” said the SP.In Odisha, all policemen are considered Covid warriors. There was no explanation why the body was not shifted to the mortuary.After the incident, special relief commissioner PK Jena issued a circular detailing the procedure and precautions to be taken at different levels for management of dead body of the suspect or confirmed cases of Covid-l9. “The body is to be placed in a leak-proof plastic bag, exterior of the body bag decontaminated with 1% hypochlorite, wrapped with a mortuary sheet or the sheet provided by the family members and handed over to the relative of the deceased for cremation/burial.

25-07-2020||India||BJP delegation meets Rajasthan Governor, seeks action against Cong’s ‘anarchy’||A delegation of the opposition BJP which met Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra late Saturday afternoon lashed out at chief minister Ashok Gehlot for his statement on Friday that people of the state will picket the Raj Bhavan if Governor didn’t convene a session of the Assembly soon.BJP state unit president Satish Poonia who led the 15-member delegation to the Raj Bhawan said, “The CM and his government is guilty of pushing the state’s peace and calm into anarchy. There were scenes of anarchy on the streets in the state today and the CM, who is also the home minister of the state, is morally responsible for this.”“Demonstrations were held at district headquarters on the call of the ruling party in clear violation of Covid-19 guidelines by the Disaster Management Authority. The fact that district administrations remained mute spectators to these violations shows the state government’s apathy towards the coronavirus pandemic,” Poonia said.The delegation submitted a memorandum to the Governor in which they pointed out that CM’s statement on Friday -- about threatening to picket the Raj Bhavan -- was a criminal act under section 124 of the IPC. “The CM came to the Raj Bhavan with his MLAs, who shouted slogans which led to anarchy. The pressure on the Governor to get a decision in their favour is a derogatory attempt to threaten Constitutional institutions. They also violated Covid-19 advisory on social distancing,” the BJP said in the memorandum.The delegation demanded action and legal protection from the Governor, the Constitutional head of the state, at a time when the common people of the state were suspicious of the government.Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria, deputy leader of Opposition Rajendra Rathore and Jaipur Rural MP Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore were part of the delegation.“What Congress government did at the Governor’s House was a low-point in Rajasthan politics. There is no governance. Those in power are lodged at a five-star hotel since weeks. People are suffering due to various issues,” ANI quoted Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore as saying.Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma maintained that the BJP was trying to delay the assembly session. “The meeting of the BJP delegation with the governor reflects that the BJP was conspiring with some MLAs to topple the government. They are trying to delay the session and it is their tactics to topple the government in which they have not been successful. The meeting also proves that we have a majority.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-delegation-meets-rajasthan-governor-seeks-action-against-cong-s-anarchy/story-HleuCfdgs5gQfPLlFYd9vO.html

25-07-2020||India||Gehlot has new proposal for convening Rajasthan assembly, will be sent to governor||The Rajasthan government has come up with a fresh proposal to convene a session of the state assembly in four to five days’ time, following objections raised by governor Kalraj Mishra over its convening at a short notice among others, said people familiar with the development.The decision was taken in the state cabinet meet chaired by chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday evening. The people quoted above said the meeting, lasting for about 15-20 minutes, decided that the government should make a fresh submission to the governor for convening a session of the state assembly. It is not clear if the chief minister will himself meet Mishra with the request. Gehlot was earlier supposed to meet him at 4pm this afternoon, however, the meeting didn’t take place.The need for the fresh proposal with new dates as options was felt after the governor’s house raised several questions over the original proposal submitted by the government to hold the session starting Monday. The governor said the note containing the request neither explained the urgency, nor mention the agenda for the session. He added that it didn’t even indicate if the state cabinet had approved it. Mishra alleged the ‘haste’ shown by the government along with its intent to face a floor test was irrational since no one has demanded a show of strength on the floor of the house. He had argued that a 21-day advance notice was needed for calling a new session of the assembly and the Raj Bhawan needed time to consult legal experts over the proposal.Also Read: Supreme Court to hear Rajasthan Assembly Speaker’s appeal against HC order at 11am on MondayGehlot had yesterday alleged that the governor was under pressure from “higher ups” and demanded that he acted as per his constitutional obligation without succumbing to the alleged pressure.Noted senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who is appearing in the Rajasthan High Court for Congress rebels headed by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, told HT that the governor’s office was a constitutional post and therefore Kalraj Mishra may be entitled to advise Gehlot to put off the session for the next two weeks citing the Covid outbreak.Former union law minister and senior Congress leader Ashwani Kumar is, however, of the view that Kalraj Mishra cannot refuse to convene the assembly session sought by the chief minister since the governor’s office is bound to the advice of the council of ministers.Earlier today, Gehlot told the MLAs at the Congress legislature party (CLP) meeting at the Fairmont hotel that the Congress party will not let BJP succeed in their “conspiracy”, people familiar with the proceedings of the meeting said.He added that he was willing to go to the President’s house if needed and even stage a dharna outside the Prime Minister’s house if required.Gehlot and his supporting MLAs had laid siege to the governor’s house yesterday for around 5 hours and shouted slogans demanding convening of the assembly session.Meanwhile, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) delegation led by Rajasthan BJP President Satish Poonia and leader of opposition Gulab Chandra Kataria met governor Kalraj Mishra at Raj Bhawan in the evening on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gehlot-has-new-proposal-for-convening-rajasthan-assembly-will-be-sent-to-governor/story-5OL8ptZhb3TnE7DomlqLtJ.html
25-07-2020||India||Party drugs worth Rs 2.5 crore seized in Kolkata, two drug peddlers held||Kolkata Police have seized a large consignment of Yaba tablets – a party drug - worth around Rs 2.5 crore in the international grey market. A preliminary investigation revealed that the consignment was to be smuggled out to Bangladesh. Two people have been arrested in this connection, police said. Smuggling of Yaba tablets has shot up since 2019 across the porous Indo-Bangladesh border in south Bengal, after the Border Security Force (BSF) cracked down on cattle smuggling. Acting on a tip-off, officers of the city police’s Special Task Force (STF) conducted a raid and arrested two Murshidabad-based drug peddlers from Garden Reach in the western parts of Kolkata. Murshidabad district is located along the international border in south Bengal. “Around 50,000 tablets were seized from the peddlers. Further investigation is going on,” said a senior officer. Earlier in February, two drug dealers from Manipur were arrested by the STF from south Kolkata with Yaba tablets worth Rs 2.3 crore in the black market. The consignment was seized from a car. A mixture of methamphetamine and caffeine and sold as red or pink pills, Yaba originated in Myanmar and entered the Bangladesh black market in early 2000 and gained instant popularity due to the paucity of such stimulants locally. The fact that it was cheap also helped. Till June this year, despite the lockdown, BSF personnel of south Bengal frontier have seized around 28,690 such tablets. In 2019, between January and June the BSF seized around 29,180 tablets. In 2018, no such consignments were sized till June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/party-drugs-worth-rs-2-5-crore-seized-in-kolkata-two-drug-peddlers-held/story-FbHniDQRvs6kTKfjLDAr5M.html
25-07-2020||India||Rajasthan political drama is back in the Supreme Court, hearing on Monday||Three judges of the Supreme Court will hear Rajasthan speaker CP Joshi’s appeal against the high court order staying the disqualification proceedings against 19 Congress lawmakers led by Sachin Pilot at 11 am on Monday, according to the top court’s case list released on Saturday evening.The legal battle is a crucial sideshow in the continuing political battle between Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot who has rebelled against him. Pilot and 18 lawmakers from his camp are challenging notices issued to them by speaker CP Joshi on complaints from the Congress that wants the 19 MLAs disqualified from the assembly under the anti-defection law for their rebellion. Pilot had moved the high court against the notice, which stayed the speaker’s proceedings.The hearing on Monday is speaker CP Joshi’s second attempt to get the high court’s stay order cancelled.The Speaker had moved the top court complaining that the state court had no jurisdiction to ask him to defer the disqualification proceedings. In his petition, Joshi called the court order “illegal, perverse, and in derogation of the powers of the Speaker.In its 1992 judgment in the Kihoto Hollohan case, the top court had held that judicial review should not cover any stage prior to the making of a decision by the speaker/chairman. No interference would be permissible at an interlocutory stage of the proceedings, the court had said. In the present case, the top court is proposing to re-examine this legal principle.The top court had this week refused to accept CP Joshi’s initial request to cancel the high court’s stay order, pointing that the two high court judges had already reserved their order to be pronounced on Friday. “As the high court has already heard the matter after prolonged arguments and reserved the order, we are not staying the passing of the order [by the high court]. However, whatever order is passed shall be ultimately subject to the outcome of this petition,” a three-judge Supreme Court bench led by justice Arun Mishra had said.The high court, however, didn’t deliver its ruling on the case. On Friday, it formally admitted Sachin Pilot’s petition against the disqualification notices, accepting the request to make the central government a party in the case and identified the legal points that it will take up during the hearings.As the Congress sees it, the high court’s Friday’s ruling implied that the two high court judges may not rule on Pilot’s application in a hurry.The Speaker has argued that it is the apex court’s duty to ensure that all constitutional authorities act within the “Lakshman rekha” drawn for each one of them.During the hearing this week, the top court said the larger question here is whether a legislator’s voice can be shut down with the threat of disqualification. Can expressing dissent invite disqualification under anti-defection proceedings, the court observed.“Can a person elected by people not express his dissent? Voice of dissent cannot be suppressed. In a democracy, can somebody be shut down like this?” the court asked. Sachin Pilot, too, has moved a caveat in the Supreme Court to ensure that no orders are passed on Joshi’s petition without hearing him and his supporting MLAs. A caveat is a notice seeking that certain actions may not be taken without informing the person who gave the notice.The disqualification notices were issued on the request of Rajasthan chief whip who said that the dissident MLAs did not attend the party’s CLP meetings. Pilot and other dissidents, meanwhile, argued that a whip cannot be issued when the assembly is not in session. Also, the disqualification notices were a violation of the freedom of speech right, they argued. Already, the Gehlot government is struggling to get governor Kalraj Mishra to convene the assembly so that he can prove his majority in the assembly. But the governor is reluctant, wondering why Gehlot was in such a hurry to face the trust vote when no one was asking him to.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-speaker-s-appeal-against-rajasthan-high-court-order-on-monday/story-ZLgQTSsopxlzxgaXq2rB6I.html
25-07-2020||India||Kashmir’s saffron gets GI tag||Kashmir Valley’s Saffron has got the much-awaited geographical indication (GI) certification from the central government in a fillip to the homegrown spice, which is likely to fetch higher prices in the international markets. Jammu & Kashmir’s Lieutenant Governor (L-G) GC Murmu expressed happiness at the Centre’s decision and said that this is the first major step to put Kashmir Saffron on the world map, thanks to the GI tag. The recognition would help Kashmir Saffron to acquire more prominence in the export market and would help the farmers get the best remunerative price, L-G Murmu said. The L-G complimented Altaf Aijaz Andrabi, director of agriculture, J&K, for his relentless pursuit for the GI tag for the homegrown Kashmiri spice. He said the restoration of Kashmir’s saffron’s pristine glory has been a top priority for both the union territory (UT) administration and the Central government. The inauguration of the state-of-the-art Spice Park at Pampore in south Kashmir in August under the National Saffron Mission (NSM) would prove to be a game-changer for the saffron industry, he added. Navin K. Choudhary, principal secretary, agriculture production department, J&K, said that GI certification establishes specific geographical origin and certifies certain unique qualities of the product. GI certification enables those who have the right to use the sign in order to prevent a third party from using the sign. The GI certification would also stop the prevalent adulteration of Kashmir Saffron and the authenticated spice would fetch a much better price, he added. Kashmir Saffron is the only one spice in the world grown at an altitude of 1,600 metres, making it a one-of-a-kind variant that is known for its unique characteristics such as natural deep-red colour, aroma, bitter flavor, etc. Choudhary said the sprinkler irrigation system is being installed in saffron fields as per L-G’s instructions. The installation to likely to be completed in the next two months, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmir-s-saffron-gets-gi-tag/story-N7VfEu6mG5vlti0lHr6MpN.html
25-07-2020||India||‘You be the judge’: Chidambaram digs out SC ruling after Rajasthan court order||Congress leader P Chidmabaram, in a Twitter post on Saturday, spotlighted an old Supreme Court ruling, which he says is in “simple English”, to explain that courts cannot judicially review disqualification proceedings under the Tenth Schedule (anti-defection law) of the Constitution until the Speaker makes a final decision on the merits of the case.On Friday, the Sachin Pilot camp got a partial relief when the Rajasthan high court ordered maintenance of the status quo on the disqualification notices issued by Speaker CP Joshi to the group. Earlier, the court had also asked the Speaker to defer the decision in the matter till July 24. Meanwhile, refusing the Speakers’ plea, the Supreme Court allowed the state high court to rule on the validity of the anti-defection notices. But the decision in the state high court will be subject to the final decision in the top court as it involves the larger question whether a legislator’s voice can be shut down. The Congress leader said the common man, “mystified” by the orders of the high court, can take recourse to this passage by the top court in the Kihoto Hollohan case in 1992. “In 1992, the SC ruled: “Having regard to the constitutional scheme in the Tenth Schedule, judicial review should not cover any stage prior to the making of a decision by the Speakers/Chairmen; and no quia timet actions are permissible.“Those words are simple and clear enough. That statement of the law by 5 judges was binding on all courts, HC or SC. Now, dear average citizen, you be the judge,” said Chidambaram in a Twitter post.Sachin Pilot, who was sacked as Rajasthan deputy CM and also as the pradesh unit chief last week, and his 18 MLAs were served the notices after the Congress requested the Speaker, citing the MLAs’ absence from successive Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meetings defying a party whip and also and hatching a conspiracy to bring down the state government.The rebel leader has maintained that he is not joining the BJP. The Pilot camp has argued that mere disagreement with the CM’s working style cannot be construed to be defection. Issuing such a notice is also a violation of their freedom of speech right. Also, that the whip applies when the House is in session and not outside, the MLAs argued.The Speaker, on his part, contended that a writ petition in the matter is premature as a decision is yet to be taken on disqualifying MLAs. Additionally, what conduct invites disqualification under the Tenth Schedule is the sole preserve of the Speaker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/you-be-the-judge-chidambaram-digs-out-sc-ruling-after-rajasthan-court-order/story-51ViuuzjK0X4OwLYohFQwN.html

25-07-2020||India||Hit by cash crunch, Odisha defers cash assistance to farmers to next year||Facing a huge revenue shortage, the Odisha government announced Saturday that it has decided to defer the payment of Rs 402 crore cash assistance to at least 16 lakh families till the next financial year under the Kalia Yojana, its flagship scheme for small, medium and landless farmers.The state agriculture department had earmarked Rs 2,234 crore in 2020-21 for the beneficiaries of Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation (KALIA) scheme, in which a farmer gets Rs 10,000 per year for two crops (Kharif and Rabi). The state scheme proved to be a catalyst in the assembly polls as it helped Naveen Patnaik become chief minister for a fifth consecutive time by curbing anti-incumbency sentiments in the countryside.But with the Covid-19 pandemic taking a huge toll on the state’s economy with its revenue earning down by 23 per cent in the first quarter of the current financial year in comparison to the corresponding period of last year, the agriculture department has now decided to defer the payment of Rs 402 crore to 16.09 lakh landless agriculture households to the next financial year.To lessen the financial burden, the state government in December last year had already merged the scheme with the PM Kisan scheme in which the state and centre shared the Rs 10,000 assistance in 2:3 ratio.Now to reduce the outgo in Kalia scheme, the department has asked 50,000 farmers who had received cash assistance under the scheme to return the money. Principal secretary in the Agriculture and Farmers Empowerment department, Saurabh Garg said 50,000 people were found ineligible. “We have sent request letters to the ineligible beneficiaries like farmers with large land holdings, income tax payees and government employees. They have been given a bank account number in which they have to deposit the money,” he said.The refund adds up to over Rs 10 crore. The Odisha unit of the BJP has condemned the government decision of deferring the cash assistance as well as asking the farmers to refund the Kalia money. BJP Krushak Morcha State president Pradip Purohit said at a time when the farmers are facing an uncertain future due to Covid-19 pandemic, the deferment of the cash assistance would stress them further. “The farmers would be forced to take extreme steps if the government does not come to their aid. The Centre is already sharing a major part of the expenditure. The state government should not fail the farmers at this time,” Purohit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hit-by-cash-crunch-odisha-defers-cash-assistance-to-farmers-to-next-year/story-pgB1WlmCskfuGz6O3tAo3K.html

Ashok Gehlot asks||Rajasthan ‘s embattled chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday took another swipe at Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat asking why the Centre hasn’t taken any action even after his name has cropped up in a ponzi scam.On Thursday, a Jaipur court had ordered the Special Operations Group (SOG) of the Rajasthan Police to probe the alleged role of Shekhawat, his wife, and three others, in the Rs 884 crore Sanjivani Credit Cooperative Society fraud case.Earlier, the Gehlot government and the Congress had accused Shekhawat of being involved in horse-trading and have alleged that his voice can be heard in audio tapes of purported phone conversations detailing a plot to topple the Rajasthan government.“First his name appeared in the tapes and now even in this case, Gajendra Singh ji’s name is increasingly appearing, so why has the government not taken any action and dismissed him, this is a matter of concern,” Gehlot tweeted Saturday as he tagged a newspaper report on the scam that also named Shekhawat.The court order came on a petition of two residents of Barmer, who, along with some 50,000 other people, invested in the scheme that offered interest between 10% and 12%. Ladu Singh, one of the petitioners claimed to have invested Rs 54 lakh and Guman Singh, the second petitioner said he invested Rs 14 lakh with Sanjivani Cooperative Society. They alleged that they got no return for their investments, and the money trail led to companies linked with Shekhawat and his wife.Shekhawat has denied the charge of being involved in horse trading and said he is ready for a probe. The Union minister had denied any role in the state’s political crisis, and said that none of the voices in the tapes are his.Gehlot had also named him in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about an alleged attempt by the BJP to bring down the Rajasthan government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-hasn-t-centre-dismissed-gajendra-singh-shekhawat-ashok-gehlot-asks/story-hgfdZe5cAuvi06uok1xuDM.html

The Union government issued a certificate of GI registration for the saffron grown in the Kashmir Valley, an official spokesperson said. Soon after taking over as lieutenant governor, Girish Chander Murmu took a personal interest in ensuring that Kashmir saffron gets GI certification, he said. Pampore, the hub of saffron in Kashmir, is expected to have a bumper crop of the spice this season due to initiatives taken by the National Mission on Saffron (NMS). Under the NMS, a project of Rs 411 crore was approved by the Union government under which an area of 3,715 hectare for saffron was proposed to be rejuvenated. “The GI certification will stop the prevalent adulteration of Kashmir saffron, thereby, authenticated saffron will fetch much better prices,” an official said. He said that Kashmir saffron is the only one in the world grown at an altitude of 1600 metres which differentiates it from other varieties due to its unique characteristics like longer and thicker stigma, natural deep-red colour, high aroma, bitter flavor and chemical-free processing. The official said that an area of 2,500 hectares has been rejuvenated so far and a bumper production is expected during the current season. Expressing happiness over the development, the Jammu and Kashmir LG said that this is the first major step to put saffron produced in the Kashmir Valley on the world map. With the GI tag, Kashmir saffron will acquire more prominence in export market and will help farmers get the best price for it, he said. Murmu said that with the completion and inauguration of the State of Art Spice Park next month, these measures will prove to be a game changer for Kashmir saffron. Navin K Choudhary, Principal Secretary to Government, Agricultural Production Department said GI certification establishes specific geographical origin and certifies certain unique qualities of the product. He said that on the directions of the LG, sprinkler irrigation systems are being installed on a war footing in saffron fields and are likely to be completed in the next two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-historic-first-kashmir-saffron-gets-gi-certification/story-xhVq8sB8BnCkXHX5Vm7JzN.html

The present goverment is doing well in pandemic. The CM is managing things well and he is busy in the coordination all the time.” When asked about the package announced by the Centre to bring the economy back on track, Pawar said, “The benefits of the package were not yet seen.” “But the state government is trying hard to bring back the economy on track,” he said.Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the rate of infection in Aurangabad district has come down to 10 per cent as compared to 26 earlier.The collector has been authorised to commission staff for Covid-19 management, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pawar-defends-thackeray-says-covid-19-situation-different-from-killari-quake/story-jKdSGT330y94Au5j6vSDZJ.html

If required will go to the Rashtrapati Bhavan and even stage dharna, if necessary, outside the PM house,” a senior leader quoted CM Gehlot saying so at the Congress legislature party meeting held this afternoon.The announcement came shortly before the CM is expected to meet governor Kalraj Mishra to present a fresh request to convene an assembly session.Yesterday, Gehlot and his legislators staged a sit-in on the lawns of the Raj Bhawan, demanding that the governor give the approval for convening a session of the state assembly. Gehlot has accused the governor of stalling a decision on summoning House session, saying there was “some pressure from the top”. The CM, who wants a session on Monday, said he wants to prove his majority.In unusual scenes, “Inquilab zindabad, Ashok Gehlot zindabad” slogans were raised by the MLAs, who were sitting on the lawns, in support of the CM.The dharna ended after some five hours. A list of MLAs was submitted to the governor with a plea that a session be convened for the floor test to take place.In partial relief to the Sachin Pilot camp, the Rajasthan high court ordered maintenance of status quo in the disqualification notices issued by speaker CP joshi to the group of rebel MLAs. Post this development, the CM escalated his demand for an assembly session to prove his majority in the hope to end the political uncertainty that has state in its grip for two weeks now. At an earlier CLP meeting, the CM exhorted the legislators to stand firm like a rock as the entire nation was watching them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-go-to-rashtrapati-bhavan-even-stage-dharna-outside-pm-house-gehlot/story-FlOujwXe71bK53rcpJcCMO.html

The state has targeted to increase the milch cow population by 1.56 lakhs through sex-sorted semen straws in the three financial years, ending at 2022-23. The state government data showed that Tripura produced 1,74,260 metric tonnes (MT) of milk in the 2017-18 financial year, followed by 1,83,515 MT and 1,97,270 MT in 2018-19 and 2019-20, respectively. The state has an annual average requirement of 2,34,350 MT of milk, and the current production is less than the demand. “We have decided to adopt a three-year plan to introduce sex-sorted artificial insemination during the mating season of milch cows. This decision has been taken to increase milk production in our state. We are aiming to increase the milch cow population in our state by 90% under the Mukhyamantri Unnato Godhan Yojana,” said Ratan Lal Nath, state law minister. The 13.10-crore scheme’s expenses will be borne the Central and the state government in a 90:10 ratio. Tripura is aiming to increase the milch cow population by 78,000, 46,800, and 31,200 in the next three financial years. Haryana, Maharashtra, Odisha, and Kerala have also adopted sex-sorted artificial insemination of livestock to boost their milk yields.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-hike-milk-yield-tripura-to-adopt-sex-sorted-artificial-insemination-of-cattle/story-tNWfsaQb0C9kpH2f8Efc7M.html

Experts are now of the opinion that people getting cured of coronavirus are visiting a doctor’s clinic with other symptoms after beating Covid-19. Besides the lungs, the virus is known to have impacted the brain, kidneys and other major organs such as the heart in some Covid-19 patients. While some patients were reported to have suffered from mild fever weeks after recovering from Covid-19, others suffered from diarrhoea, S Chatterjee, a Mumbai-based health expert told a news agency as reported by HT’s Hindi language publication Live Hindustan. Also read: India tests 4.2 L samples for Covid-19 in 24 hrs, testing capacity at all-time highThere were some others who showed signs of inflammation in the heart tissue while others showed issues of blood pressure associated with body posture. Chatterjee said that many cured patients are now showing signs of lung fibrosis. He had seen 25 such patients whose oxygen levels in the lungs started to decrease. Health experts are trying to study the various impact that Covid-19 can have the human body. In a recent study published in the medical journal JAMA, experts found the virus inside the ear of deceased Covid-19 patients. On conducting the autopsy on the deceased Covid-19 patients, the virus was found inside the middle ear and in the mastoid area of the head. The mastoid is a hollow bone behind the ear.“Two of the 3 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus in the mastoid or middle ear, with viral isolation from 2 of 6 mastoids and 3 of 6 middle ears. Results for case 1 were positive for the right middle ear only. Case 2 had negative results for all samples,” the study stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-patients-may-report-heart-lung-probems-after-recovery-expert/story-JYJlh5JnpAX1jBqxpbvomO.html

25-07-2020||India||Uniform country-wide peak in Covid-19 cases will not happen: Expert||There cannot be a uniform peak in Covid-19 cases in a large country like India and each state has its own trajectory based on when people there were exposed to the infection, a public health expert said. The peak could be witnessed in states like Delhi by this month end or early August while it may be around September in others such as Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Karnataka, Director of the Indian Institute of Public Health (IIPH) here Prof. G V S Murthy said. IIPH was set up under the aegis of the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI). In states such as Jharkhand it may take longer time as the spread has started only after the return of the migrant labourers, he said. “So, each state has its own trajectory based on when people were exposed to the infection in that particular state.There is not going to be a uniform peak for the country. There is going to be a number of peaks in the country,” he told PTI. For example, Bihar seemed to be reporting a large number of cases suddenly after all those who migrated to other cities, specifically Mumbai and Delhi, started returning. It takes about 10-14 days for a Covid-19 person to infect others in their families and then the next wave of cases will happen, Murthy, who established and headed the first Community Ophthalmology Department in the public sector in the country at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences till 2010,said. Governments need to continue with measures to deal with the virus and the community also should strictly adhere to preventive guidelines such as washing hands and maintaining physical distancing, he said and stressed on taking intense steps in densely populated areas. States like Jharkhand (present total cases 7,564), Chattisgarh (6,819) and parts in eastern Uttar Pradesh too had reported much lower cases earlier but the spread would start occurring as the migrants have returned now to their homes. “There, the peak will take much longer. It would be somewhere towards the end of September or October that those states which had low reporting earlier, will have a peak,” he said. But, states like Haryana, Telangana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu should be able to achieve the maximum number of cases by mid September, he said. All these states which were reporting very high numbers now, should not be getting the same numbers beyond mid- September. Some states should achieve the peak by mid-August also.For example, Delhi seems to be on a path where, by the end of this month or early August, it can be said that the peak has been crossed, he said. The same could be the case with Rajasthan and Punjab, and other states, including Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh may reach the peak in September, he said. The peak should occur in Tamil Nadu by the middle or the third week of August, said Murthy, who had worked at the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Childhood Blindness programme. He said the governments need to continue with measures to deal with the virus as the health system would be overwhelmed if there was a sudden rise in cases and if the states are unprepared. Such a scenario had been seen in Mumbai and others, the expert, who was a UNAIDS Consultant with the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), added. “Kerala, you have seen now. They thought they had seen the end of Covid. Suddenly, in the last over 10 days, Kerala has had a much larger number of cases than before,” he said. Complete monitoring was required in densely populated areas and intense steps should be taken when there is a sudden spike in cases. The three Ts Test, Track and Treatment were important to reduce the infections and slipping into serious complications, he noted. The community should follow precautions, including wearing a mask, hand-washing and maintaining physical distance,the health expert said. If somebody has any doubt of infection, they should immediately seek medical attention. Gatherings should be avoided. “As a community, we cannot put the entire onus on the government. As a community, it is our responsibility (to take the precautions),” he added. At the government level, Murthy suggested arranging mobile labs to collect samples (to avoid overcrowding) in a city like Hyderabad rather than people coming to certain locations to give samples. The community health centres can be strengthened with a few beds having oxygen supply facilities dedicated to Covid care to treat needy patients. Those having severe breathlessness should be transferred to bigger tertiary hospitals, he said, adding that the focus should be on saving lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uniform-country-wide-peak-in-covid-19-cases-will-not-happen-expert/story-91yZuc5gytscdccRtzzJjP.html

In a letter to the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, the Congress general secretary said that the battle against the pandemic cannot be fought by just “managing publicity and news”. Noting that 2,500 cases of coronavirus were reported in UP on Friday, she said almost all the metros were flooded with Covid-19 cases, but now even the villages were not far behind in the spread. “Quarantine centres in UP are in a pathetic state. In some places, the situation is so bad, that people are fearing mismanagement more than the coronavirus. Because of such a scenario, they are not stepping out of their homes for getting tested,” Priyanka Gandhi said. “This is a great failure of the government,” she asserted. The state government by believing in the “no test = no coronavirus” mantra has adopted a low testing policy, she alleged. “There is an explosive rise in Covid-19 cases. Till testing will not be increased in a transparent manner, the fight against the pandemic will be incomplete and the situation can become more frightening,” she said. “The prime minister is a Member of Parliament from Varanasi, the defence minister from Lucknow, many other Union ministers are from UP. Why can’t temporary hospitals be opened in Varanasi, Lucknow, Agra etc.” Priyanka Gandhi asked. Tightening its grip over Uttar Pradesh, Covid-19 claimed a record 50 lives in the state on Friday as the deadly virus infected 2,667 people more in the largest single-day spike till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/managing-publicity-and-news-priyanka-slams-up-govt-over-covid-19-handling-in-letter-to-cm/story-1XxNlyCo99vJsS7XZJD9hN.html

Subsequently, both the Congress and the JDS had protested against what they said was an appeal on the basis of caste and community saying it was violative of the Election Commission’s Model Code of Conduct. They had also lodged cases in this regard.Gokak has a large presence of Veerashaiva-Lingayat community.

25-07-2020||India||Monsoon in north-central India can drop significantly: US agency||Rainfall in north-central India can drop significantly this year because of the projected reduction in monsoon low-pressure system, according to a study of an American scientific agency. The study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), released on Friday, projected a significant decrease in Monsoon Low-Pressure System (MLPS) occurrence over the south Asian monsoon region, attributed mainly to a reduction in low-level relative vorticity over the core genesis region. Notably, MLPSs are the primary rain-producing synoptic-scale systems over the Indian subcontinent, and are estimated to be responsible for more than half of the annual precipitation in agrarian north and central India. Changes in the characteristics of MLPSs, whether natural or forced, have far-reaching socio-economic impacts, the NOAA said. Despite increases in the total precipitation across much of the monsoon region, the model simulates little change or even slight decreases in precipitation over the core MLPS genesis region. “Assuming a fixed radius of influence, the projected reduction in monsoon low-pressure systems would significantly lower the associated precipitation over north-central India,” it said. Generally poor representation of MLPSs in global climate model simulations erodes the confidence in future projections. To date, only a few studies have investigated the potential changes in south Asian MLPSs, without conclusive findings, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-in-north-central-india-can-drop-significantly-us-agency/story-JEMrASKF2Rp99gr0LnzI0L.html

The incident occurred inside a safe house of the Intelligence Bureau (IB) in south Delhi on Friday night. Police said the two men, who were posted at the IB’s safe house and belonged to CRPF’s 122 Battalion, had a tiff over an issue that is yet to be ascertained, after which the S-I used his Avtomat Kalashnikova (AK)-47 rifle to shoot the inspector dead.

It is also said that Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar intervened to convince him to allow opening up of businesses and industry.The CM, in part one of the two-part interview to Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana, said that living with coronavirus is a tightrope walk that requires balancing the economy and health of the public.Also Watch: Mumbai ramps up efforts in plasma therapy for Covid-19 patients “There are several smart people speaking against lockdown… Fine, we will open everything for you but unfortunately if the people die due to this, will you take responsibility? There is no problem in opening up, but will they take the responsibility? I am not using the word ‘lockdown’ now. However, I will not say that I am now lifting the lockdown, but gradually restrictions will be lifted. And my attempt is that once an activity is opened, then it should not have to be shut again.“Just thinking about the economy too will not work. Those who only have a concern about the health situation, however grave it may be, must think a little about the economy as well. Living with coronavirus is a tightrope walk,” Thackeray said.In a wide-ranging interview, published in Saamna on Saturday, Thackeray spoke on a host of topics - covering the first six months of his government, opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis, the measures taken by the state government to tackle Covid-19, among others.On being questioned as to when will vada pav, a popular snack in Maharashtra and Mumbai, be available and when will suburban trains resume for common people, he said: “People may be bored [of the lockdown], but to give them a break from it we cannot lift restrictions. If we hastily unlock, and someone loses their life then what good is a livelihood. What will happen if this virus spreads in a factory? Then we must decide that no matter how many people succumb to this disease, we do not want a lockdown. Are you prepared? I am not. I am not [Donald] Trump, I cannot see my people suffer before my eyes… We will start [suburban] railway and vada pav [stalls on the roads]. Families are taking ill and dying. Who will open the lockdown in that family?”Thackeray, who will soon be 60, also remained measured in his response to the success in containing the spread of Covid-19 in Dharavi, Asia’s largest slum, and also on the dwindling number of Covid-19 cases from Mumbai.“I am not going to speak on it. The danger is still there. If I appreciate the work now, complacency may creep in,” said the CM.The ‘Dharavi model’ was praised by the World Health Organisation (WHO).CM Thackeray also took potshots at former chief minister and leader of opposition in the legislative assembly Devendra Fadnavis, who visited Delhi earlier this week.“He must have gone to see the Covid-19 situation there. But he did not say anything about it. He is going to Delhi because he has given Maharashtra’s fund to Delhi (Centre),” said the CM.Thackeray said that Fadnavis might have “stomach-ache” after an organisation ranked Thackeray as one of the best chief ministers in India.“He could have a stomach ache because without stepping out anywhere one organisation ranked me as [one of the] best chief ministers in the country. This must be a cause of stomach cramps because corona has varied symptoms,” Thackeray said, taking a swipe at Fadnavis.Thackeray dismissed the criticism that he has not gone to Mantralaya as much as he should have. He said that he is using the technology to take stock of the situation in the state. “Mantralaya is shut now. The technology has advanced to such an extent now. If one cannot use technology then it is really unfortunate. I am meeting officials and public representatives. In one go I am covering the entire state and I am taking decisions. When it is important to visit physically, then you do go to that place. With videoconferencing, you can cover the entire state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-if-people-die-cm-uddhav-thackeray-warns-against-lifting-lockdown/story-bzCtbUpQUaF6M084UHd5iN.html

It has been reported that in the past five months, more than 80 lions have died due to various reasons,” said VK Singh, director LBCMS Park. Singh, who suspects canine distemper one of the possible reasons behind the frequent deaths, said they have a reserve of around 150 vials of the CDV vaccine, which they can offer to the Gir park. The Etawah Lion Safari has been populated with lions that were brought from Gir. Singh said the LBCMS Park has over the years gained expertise in administering the CDV vaccine, which is rare and not available anywhere in the country. Samajwadi Party chief and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav’s dream project, the Etawah Lion Safari first saw the usage of CDV vaccine in 2016 after the safari witnessed deaths of five lions between 2014 and 2016 due to canine distemper. “In a probe, it was found that the lions died of canine distemper which, until then, was believed to affect only dogs. Hence, we got the vaccine C-DV Ferret from San Diego zoo in the US and administered it to the lions,” said Singh. The director further said, “This vaccine is rare. We import it from the US. We are the only body in India to have CDV vaccine. Also there is a certain technique through which this vaccine is administered and over the years, we have gained expertise in administering the vaccine. No deaths have been reported at the lion safari since then.” At present the Etawah Lion Safari has 18 Asiatic lions -- 7 were born at the safari itself. Lion safari officials said in 2018 they had assisted them in probing the deaths of a large number of Asiatic lions and had also provided the Gir national park with 200 vials of CDV vaccine. “It was after they (Gir park) approached us that we had sent an expert and 200 vials of vaccine to administer to the lions. Back then, the park witnessed the deathof around 85 lions, of which 59 died of canine distemper virus infection,” Singh said. On Friday Akhilesh Yadav took to Twitter to express concern over the frequent deaths of lions in Gujarat in the past five months.“During our time, the Etawah Lion Safari became virus free. The first Asiatic Lion Breeding and Research facility was set up and it developed the vaccine for canine distemper virus. We have lots of vaccines which we would like to offer to Gir National Park to help save their lions,” he said in his tweet. He also shared a photo of lions with a caption — 85 lions have died in the past five months in Gir forest. Is it because of canine distemper virus? Officials at the Gir national park could not be contacted despite repeated attempts. Being the lone agency to have the canine distemper virus vaccine, Singh said the Lion Safari also sends CDV vaccines to Kolkata, Darjeeling, Chandigarh and Guwahati zoos. In the last financial year, the Etawah Lion Safari has distributed around 1,000 vials of the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/etawah-lion-safari-ready-to-help-gir-national-park-probe-big-cat-mortality/story-zIiHK7yxhOmYnpVs04kgTP.html

The revised proposal will be forwarded to the governor after an approval by the cabinet.The chief minister, who is facing a revolt by his former deputy Sachin Pilot and other Congress MLAs, had chaired a meeting of the cabinet on Friday night to discuss the points raised by the governor on its earlier proposal.The Congress will shortly hold its legislature party meeting to discuss the political situation in Rajasthan. The meeting will take place at the hotel where the MLAs of the Gehlot camp are staying.The Congress government is pushing for the assembly session so that Gehlot can prove his majority on the floor of the House, which came after Rajasthan High Court ordered that status quo should be maintained on the disqualification notices sent out by the assembly speaker to Pilot and 18 other MLAs.Governor Mishra had on Friday asked the Gehlot government why it wanted to call an assembly session to secure a vote of confidence if it already had the majority. He said “no one above constitutional decorum. There should not be any kind of pressure politics”.He also pointed out that neither had any date for convening the session been mentioned in the cabinet note, annexed with the government’s request, nor had the cabinet given its approval to it.He said he will follow constitutional norms to convene a session, denied there was any pressure on him from the BJP, and wondered why Gehlot was in a hurry to prove his majority on the floor of the House when no one had made such a demand.The government has neither given any reason for calling the session on such a short notice nor proposed any agenda for it, said the governor, pointing out that a 21-day notice is mandatory for calling an assembly session.The statement added Mishra had also asked the government “to ensure the independence and freedom of movement of all members of the legislative assembly”.On Friday, the chief minister said that a letter was forwarded to the governor on Thursday night for calling the session, but he had not taken any decision on it.Congress legislators supporting Gehlot had also staged a dramatic five-hour-long demonstration at Raj Bhavan on Friday, demanding that Mishra call a special session of the assembly and allow a floor test.As Gehlot met the governor inside, the MLAs sat on the lawns, shouting slogans and asserting that they will stay put till the governor issues an order for the session.The Congress party has it is confident of winning in the midst of their power tussle with Sachin Pilot and those backing him.Gehlot camp feels that going for an immediate floor test may be the best way to end the political impasse and save the government that has been staring at uncertainty in the wake of a split in its ranks.The chief minister has the support of 101 members, excluding Speaker CP Joshi. Pilot has 18 other Congress MLAs and three Independents in his camp, taking his tally to 22. The BJP and its ally Rashtriya Loktrantrik Party have 75 seats. Bhanwarlal Meghwal, one Congress MLA said to be close to Pilot, is indisposed.The Congress has accused the BJP of instigating the political crisis in Rajasthan and attempting to topple the state government. The BJP has denied the allegation and said the crisis in Rajasthan was triggered by an internal feud in the Congress.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashok-gehlot-calls-another-cabinet-meet-will-discuss-governor-s-reservations-over-rajasthan-assembly-session/story-r93bflfNQzqFzzfQOFsK8L.html

The national carrier spent around Rs 2400 crore in operating Shramik Trains, a senior ministry official said.The national carrier received highest revenue in fares from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu with Rs 102 crore, Rs 85 crore and Rs 34 crore respectively, according to the data reviewed by HT. The fares were supposed to be paid by states, though there have been several reports of local administrations collecting the money from migrant workers.The trains were run starting May 1 to ferry migrant workers stranded in cities, back home to their villages in the hinterland. The national carrier however,spent around Rs 2400 crore in operating Shramik Trains, a senior ministry official said on condition of anonymity, adding that the revenue generated “should be taken as receipt only in lieu of expenses incurred by the Railways in running of Shramik Trains”. The ministry in June said the average cost of fares for migrants aboard Shramik Special trains was Rs 600 and added that it spent around Rs 3400 per person to operate the train. The official cited above said the fares were taken from the states. “It may be noted that railways incurred 85% of the cost of operating Shramik Trains. It was an important operation to rise up for the need of the nation during the lockdown,” a spokesperson for the ministry said.Railways operated 4,496 special trains between May 1 and July 9, ferrying 6.3 million people. The fare structure included regular sleeper class tickets plus superfast charges of Rs 30 and an additional charge of Rs 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-earned-rs-429-90cr-from-shramik-trains/story-Z6S5647BtSrZ7ieHZhlMjJ.html

This papad will be helpful in the fight against Covid-19.”A senior government functionary posting unverified claims on social media evoked a barrage of reactions. “Fight against Covid-19 update: US govt: We are developing a vaccine. UK govt: We are on stage 3 of clinical trials. Indian govt: Ye lo Bhabhiji papad. It will help fight Corona,” said a user on Twitter.Another social media user said, “Why spend millions of dollars on vaccine development when you can sit at home and eat papad to protect yourself from Covid-19. P.S. The joke is on us 1.3 billlion Indians.”Political opponents and rivals of the government too seized the opportunity to take a dig at Meghwal. Lawyer Prashant Bhushan tweeted: “Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal has launched a ‘papad’ brand amid Covid pandemic claiming it contains some ingredients that help develop antibodies against the new coronavirus. Ministers, Ramdev all trying to profit from Covid peddling bogus cures.”The twitter handle of the youth wing of the Congress was also seen hitting out. “Breaking News : CORONA vaccine invented .

25-07-2020||India||Isolated lockdowns not enough: Centre||Two to three-day lockdowns alone are not enough to contain Covid-19, cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba told representatives of nine states at a special review meeting on Friday while cautioning against the delay in procurement of testing kits, officials aware of the matter said. Gauba warned the delay might have “grave consequences” and added some states have demonstrated “the situation can be turned around” while others have “showed how it can deteriorate”, they added.Many states have enforced lockdowns over weekends in select areas to tackle spiralling Covid-19 cases.Chief secretaries of Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, West Bengal and Assam attended the meeting along with senior central government officials. “These nine states are new concern areas for us,” said a union government official. “...several issues of compliance and Covid-19 management have come up in these states.” Gauba usually holds meetings with representatives of all states on Covid-19, but Friday’s was a rare meet with select states.Along with the weekend lockdowns, systematic containment and surveillance would be required, the Centre told the states. It also asked the states to strengthen hospital infrastructure and clinical management.Gauba pointed out delay in decisions has shown grave consequences in some cases and asked the states to ensure advance procurement plans for testing kits and other medical equipment. An official, who attended the meeting, said the rate of testing suddenly dropped in some states and they did not have enough antigen kits.The Centre has emphasised stronger communication between the administration and the public. West Bengal chief secretary Rajeeva Sinha pointed out that his state has multiple issues, including occupancy of Covid-19 beds by non-symptomatic patients. Bihar’s representative said they have not involved private hospitals but it would be done from Monday and sought the Centre’s permission to set up rapid antigen test booths.The states were advised to ramp up testing with special focus on containment zones as sustained and aggressive testing is crucial for early identification of cases, and to prevent the spread of infection.“The rise in test per million has been achieved with a steady rise in the number of labs [1,290], and efforts by the Centre and State/UT [Union Territory] governments to facilitate wide-spread testing through an array of options,” said Union health ministry in a statement.Dr T Jacob John, a former virology department head at Vellore’s Christian College, said he cannot stress enough on how aggressive testing is a must to control the Covid-19 spread. “It is better to overdo it rather than inadequate testing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isolated-lockdowns-not-enough-centre/story-zHo461DmesWeUMuJ8jDicI.html
25-07-2020||India||Human trials for Covid-19 vaccines by Bharat Biotech, Zydus underway in 6 cities||Volunteers across the country are being administered the indigenous vaccine candidates against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) developed by Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL) and Zydus Cadila.Bharat Biotech and Zydus were granted permission for Phase I and II clinical trials of Covaxin and ZyCoV-D respectively and the pharmaceutical companies have said the first doses of their vaccine candidates were administered to volunteers on July 15.A third vaccine candidate developed by Oxford University and backed by AstraZeneca Plc will soon be tested in India. Serum Institute of India is in a manufacturing partnership with the UK’s AstraZeneca. The Pune-based Serum Institute has said it will be starting trials of the Oxford University’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate by the end of August on up to 5,000 Indian volunteers after getting the necessary nods and launch it by June next year if all goes well.Covaxin, which has been developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Virology (NIV), will be tested at 12 institutes, including All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) in Delhi and Patna, and PGI Rohtak.Testing of Zydus’ ZyCoV-D is limited to its research centre in Gujarat’s Ahmedabad right now and will be extended to multiple cities across the country.Zydus is looking to complete clinical trials of ZyCoV-D in seven months, the company’s chairperson said on Friday. The firm is looking to complete phase I and phase II clinical trials in the next three months and submit the data to the regulator, Zydus Cadila Chairman Pankaj R Patel said in a statement.It could take a total of seven months for the trials to be completed and for the vaccine to be launched, depending on the study outcomes and if the data is encouraging and the vaccine is found to be effective during the trials, he added. CovaxinCovaxin trials have already begun in All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Delhi, AIIMS Patna, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) in Haryana’s Rohtak, SRM Medical College Hospital and Research Centre in Kanchipuram and Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences in Hyderabad.The centres are conducting simultaneous phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials to study the safety and immunogenicity of different doses and adjuvant combinations of the vaccine developed by the biotechnology company, in collaboration with ICMR’s National Institute of Virology. An adjuvant is a compound that helps increase the effectiveness of a vaccine.Vaccine trials are yet to start at King George Hospital in Visakhapatnam, Jeevan Rekha Hospital in Belgaum, Gillurkar Multispeciality Hospital in Nagpur, Rana Hospital in Gorakhpur, Kalinga Hospital in Bhubaneswar, Prakhar Hospital in Kanpur and CROM Clinical Research Private Ltd and Medical Tourism in Goa.AIIMS DelhiAIIMS Delhi administered its first dose of Bharat Biotech’s vaccine candidate to a 30-year-old healthy man on Friday as part of its combined phase 1 and 2 trials for the drug.“The vaccine candidate was administered to the first trial participant — a healthy 30-year-old man — around noon on Friday. He was monitored for two hours to check for any adverse reactions. All trial participants will be monitored every day for the first seven days. They will then be followed-up on day 14 and day 28. They will be tracked for up to a year to observe any long-term impacts,” said Dr Puneet Misra, one of the investigators of the trial and a professor of community medicine at AIIMS.The centre has received nearly 3,500 applications for the trials so far, and 100 healthy participants will be enrolled from among them. Participants have to be between the ages of 18 and 55 years and have no comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension, heart or kidney disease.“Our priority is safety and hence we need healthy participants. Those who are called in for the trial have to undergo a battery of tests to determine their general health. They are tested for a current infection using RT-PCR test and for past infections using an antibody test. Participants are given the vaccine only if they are free of Covid-19. For now, we are also selecting participants only from Delhi and the National Capital Region for the ease of follow-ups,” said Dr Misra.The vaccine is currently being administered in two doses — 0.3 and 0.5 microgram. In the 0.5 microgram dosage, the vaccine is being given with two different adjuvants. Of the 100 who will be enrolled, 80 will get different dosages and combination of the vaccine, and 20 participants will receive placebos.PGIMSPGIMS became the second facility in India after AIIMS Patna, to begin the human trials. Dr Savita Verma, the principal investigator of the trial, said they had administered the first dose of vaccine (0.5ml) to three volunteers on July 17.“These volunteers were kept under observation for three hours. They tolerated the vaccine very well. Later, the volunteers were sent back home and a team of doctors will now examine their health every day. PGIMS, along with three other medical institutes, will conduct human trials on 50 volunteers in the first phase. The second phase will commence 14 days later after seeing the result of the vaccine in these volunteers,” she added.Dr Verma said 17 individuals have undergone rigorous medical scrutiny so far to check whether they have been previously infected with the virus or suffered from any liver, lungs or kidney ailments and any other infectious diseases.“Three of these volunteers, who were found eligible, were administered the vaccine today and the report of 13 is awaited,” she added.NIMSClinical trials for Covaxin began at the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) in Hyderabad on July 20 with hospital authorities administering the first vaccine dose to two volunteers. In Hyderabad, as many as 30 volunteers have registered with the NIMS for the clinical trials.“Of them, seven more subjects are available and they would be administered the vaccine in the next few days,” NIMS director Dr K Manohar said.According to an official familiar with the development, the volunteers are being drawn from different parts of the state. These subjects would be administered two doses of the vaccine. There will be three types of vaccines — three micrograms, six micrograms and placebo. Each subject would be given the second dose of the same vaccine after 14 days.For two days after administering the vaccine, the subjects would be monitored by a team of doctors in the Intensive Critical Care Unit (ICCU) before being discharged.“Their health condition will be monitored from time to time. The doctors would also look into the interaction with the vaccine digitally as well as through frequent physical check-ups,” the official said.SRMHuman trials at SRM Medical College Hospital and Research Centre began on Thursday with two volunteers being administered 0.05 ml of the vaccine each. They will get the next dose on day 14.Other sitesKing George Hospital (KGH) in Andhra Pradesh’s Visakhapatnam, which was also selected by the ICMR for clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccine, is yet to commence the exercise.“We have got the approval from the ICMR, but are yet to get the clearance from the state government. We have written to the Director of Medical Education to give the nod for clinical trials and once we get it, we shall start,” Dr K Indira Devi, in-charge superintendent of the KGH, told Hindustan Times.Institute of Medical Sciences and Sum Hospital, a privately-run medical college in Bhubaneswar, started screening prospective candidates on July 20. Reports said Nagpur’s Gillurkar Multispecialty Hospital and Research Centre, the only site for human trials of Covaxin in Maharashtra, is expected to start Phase 1 by end of July or the first week of August.Two private hospitals in Uttar Pradesh will also soon begin human trials of Covaxin, the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech.The two hospitals—Prakhar Hospital in Kanpur and Rana Hospital and Trauma Centre in Gorakhpur—are also among the 12 institutes across the country where the human trial of the vaccine candidate will be conducted.Prakhar Hospital is looking at a sample size of 50 people in the first phase and another 150 in the second phase of the human trial. The Rana Hospital, meanwhile, is awaiting a safety certificate before the trials can begin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/human-trials-for-covid-19-vaccines-by-bharat-biotech-zydus-underway-in-6-cities/story-FlIRk7lEIDMXdQafiLFmzO.html

Local media reported on Thursday that Aarti Rajak, 20, a resident of Shankar Colony in Ashok Nagar, the neighbouring district of Guna, reached the hospital with her husband Sunil Dhakad, 22, and their two-and-a-half-year-old child on Wednesday evening. Rajak said while speaking to reporters she took her husband to Guna with the help of driver of a loading vehicle who didn’t charge any money from them. While her husband lay under a tree inside the hospital campus, she approached a counter for getting a patient slip to consult a doctor but the man sitting there demanded money. She didn’t have enough money so she returned to take care of her husband and they spent the night under the tree. On Thursday morning, she again made an attempt to get a slip but another man at the counter said she would have to wait till the next counter opened. Her husband died at about 8am on Thursday. Kumar Purushottam, Guna’s collector, said on Friday he had ordered an inquiry on Thursday by Dr SK Shrivastava, the civil surgeon of the district hospital after he got to know that a man had died on the district hospital campus without treatment. “In his eight-page report, the civil surgeon claimed that as per the CCTV footage the woman reached the hospital campus at 4am on Thursday and didn’t approach any hospital staff for any treatment. No money was demanded from her as, as per the state government’s order no fee is being charged by the hospital for the patient slip,” Purushottam said.“The civil surgeon has also claimed in his report that the woman in her statement in the hospital admitted that she didn’t get inside the hospital campus and that as per statement recorded from the deceased’s friend Jameel Khan the deceased was suffering from tuberculosis and was liquor and drug addict,” he added. The collector said when someone approached any hospital, it is the duty of the hospital staff to provide treatment to them and show sensitivity towards them. “Hence, I have ordered a magisterial inquiry to be conducted by deputy collector Sonam Jain to look into the matter and if anyone is found responsible for dereliction of duty a strict action will be taken against him,” he said. The woman, who returned to Ashok Nagar with her husband’s body, could not be reached for her comments.

25-07-2020||India||SC to hear 10-year-old contempt case against Prashant Bhushan on August 4||The Supreme Court on Friday fixed hearing on a decade-old contempt case against advocate Prashant Bhushan on August 4 indicating that it would not allow his father and senior advocate Shanti Bhushan to be joined as a party in the proceeding. The apex court had issued a fresh contempt notice against the same lawyer this week for his tweets directed against the judiciary and the present CJI which is listed for hearing on August 5.Bhushan faced contempt over an interview given to Tehelka magazine in September 2009 where he had said that half of the last 16 CJIs were corrupt. His father intervened in the case bringing out evidence against the CJIs in a sealed cover and offering to go to jail if his son was punished for contempt. The contempt plea against Bhushan was moved by senior advocate Harish Salve who assisted the Court as amicus curiae (friend of the Court).The hearing on the contempt petition started in January 2010 and was last heard on May 2, 2012. When the matter was taken up after a gap of 8 years by a three-judge bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra, the Bhushan camp requested the Court to put off hearing in the case till physical court resumes.Shanti Bhushan who appeared through video conferencing told the bench, “I find it very hard to address the Court through video conferencing. This matter has waited for 10 years. It can wait for a few more weeks till physical court hearing resumes.”But the Court bluntly put to him, “You are too much senior to be impleaded (joined as party) in this case. It’s a suo moto contempt petition. We are not impleading you.” The former law minister insisted that a decision to not implead him should be taken after hearing his application. The bench replied, “Your application repeats what is stated by your son. You have said, ‘I’m ready to go to jail if he is punished’. All this argument is made out of love and affection. We understand our responsibility.”For Prashant Bhushan, senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan submitted to the Court that his case records were at Kasauli and cannot be procured. He requested for time to prepare on the question of having a Constitution Bench to hear the matter. He also raised doubts on Salve leading the contempt when he has not been officially appointed as amicus in the contempt case.The bench, also comprising Justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari, said, “We will give you time as per your satisfaction. At least, let us start hearing it.” Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for former Tehelka editor Tarun Tejpal, another contemnor in this case, said, “This is not a matter where something impending is going to happen, unlike any demolition matter. This hearing can wait for some more time. It has waited for 10 years.”The bench remarked, “Through the virtual court, we are hearing all matters, including constitution bench cases. We will hear you all patiently.” The Court posted the matter on August 4 stating that it would like Salve to assist the Court on the next date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-10-year-old-contempt-case-against-prashant-bhushan-on-august-4/story-JNh2Z5VekowNCKgUwO3PvL.html
25-07-2020||India||Can agriculture revive economy?||The Indian economy is all set to contract this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. There is only bright spot in this year’s economic story; the agriculture sector. A good rabi (winter) crop harvest, adequate rainfall during the ongoing monsoon and encouraging data on sowing on kharif (monsoon) crops, all point towards a good performance by agriculture. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman echoed these sentiments while speaking at the India Ideas Summit organized by the US India Business Council. “We have had a very good rabi crop. All of what were necessary, have been procured at reasonable price so that farmers are not left high and dry looking for purchasers. Now the estimate for kharif crop has also come. We can clearly see agriculture driving the revival”, Sitharaman said on Tuesday.Can a high growth rate in agriculture boost demand? This cannot be taken for granted. Real growth rate calculations take into account value of production at constant prices. The constant price method is necessary to ensure comparability across time periods. Day to day purchasing power, and therefore demand, is more likely to be a function of current or nominal incomes. A HT analysis of recently released National Account Statistics (NAS) data shows that real and nominal incomes need not move in the same direction for India’s farmers.The NAS gives value of output for all crops at current and constant prices from 2011-12 to 2018-19. The value of output for crops can be taken as a proxy for farm incomes. In constant price terms, value of output of crops grew at the highest rate, 5.9%, in 2016-17. This was not the year of fastest growth in nominal farm incomes, though. The highest nominal income growth was 15.3% in 2013-14, when the real income growth was 4.9%. In 2012-13, when real incomes grew at 0.6%, nominal incomes grew at 11.6%. This is more than the 11.1% nominal income growth in 2016-17, when real growth was the highest. (See Chart 1)To be sure, the headline numbers on value of output of all crops hide significant crop-wise differences. For example, real value of output for cereals and fruits and vegetables grew at the almost the same rate, 1.3% and 1.4%, in 2018-19. However the growth in nominal values was drastically different. It was 8.4% for cereals and 0.1% for fruits and vegetables. (See Chart 2A and 2B)When read in consonance with wholesale prices index (WPI) data, which shows that fruit and vegetable prices are far more volatile than cereal prices, the divergence between nominal and real value of output does not seem surprising. WPI is a more useful measure as far as tracking farm gate prices is concerned. (See Chart 3)While it is common to track rice and wheat output as a metric of agricultural performance, fruits and vegetables are as important as cereals when it comes to farm incomes. In 2018-19, the total value of output of fruits and vegetables in constant prices was Rs 3.74 lakh crore. For cereals, this figure was Rs 3.61 lakh crore.A bumper crop this year might create a glut in agricultural markets. Given the fact that non-farm output, and therefore purchasing powers, are set to contract, this could well lead to a sharp fall in food prices. If this happens, the current value of output of crops and therefore growth in farm income may be lower than real growth in agriculture. This will have a direct bearing on agriculture’s ability to boost the rest of the economy. If the agriculture sector has to play a lead role in economic recovery, policy intervention is needed to make sure that farm prices do not crash and put a squeeze on farm incomes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-agriculture-revive-economy/story-EXizCX1lD0ktZKkkv4m6uL.html

They added that school children will not be called for the ceremony as there are multiple guidelines that say children should stay at home during the pandemic.The Centre has asked all the states to promote the Centre’s Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme through various activities and messages during the Independence Day celebrations.According to the MHA advisory, “The events (at Red Fort and different states) organized could be web-cast in order to reach out people at large, who are not able to participate,”The celebrations in the national capital shall consist of the ceremony at the Red Fort that will include the presentation of a Guard of Honour by the Armed Forces and the Delhi Police to the Prime Minister, unfurling of the National Flag accompanied by playing of the National Anthem and firing of 21-gun salute. The Prime Minister’s speech shall be followed by the singing of the National Anthem and the release of tri-coloured balloons at the end. “At Home” reception at Rashtrapati Bhawan will take place.The MHA has said while organizing various events it is necessary to follow measures like maintaining social distancing, wearing masks, proper sanitization, protecting vulnerable persons and follow all other Covid-19 guidelines.The guidelines for the states include - unfurling of the national flag by the respective chief minister, playing of the national anthem, presentation of guard of honour by the police, including paramilitary forces, home guards, NCC, scouts, speech by the chief minister; and singing of the national anthem.“It would also be appropriate that Covid-19 warriors like doctors, health workers, sanitation workers are invited in the ceremony as a recognition of their noble service in fight against Covid-19 Pandemic,” the advisory said. “Some persons cured from Covid-19 infection may also be invited,” it added. “Performance of Police/Military bands may be recorded at places of historic importance associated with the Independence movement; and recorded versions thereof may be displayed through large screens/digital media, during public functions and on social media,” it noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-warriors-invited-to-muted-i-day-celebration/story-9IDOBgRRSedTpVCLfeQ2pI.html
25-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||July is usually the cruelest month in India. It’s too hot, humid, and rainy. Still worse, it is a long month (31 days) and doesn’t have any national holidays. The month — it’s still not over — has also seen a significant rise in the number of coronavirus disease cases in India.In the month since June 24, India has added 63% of its total cases (1.28 million on Thursday night). It has added 51% of its total deaths (30,630) in this period.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIt isn’t just India that has seen an acceleration over the past month. The world has added 40% of its total cases (15.6 million) and 23% of its deaths (635,666) in this period. The US has added 40% of its total cases (4.1 million) and 14% of its deaths (144,283). And Brazil has added 48% of its cases (2.28 million) and 36% of its deaths (84,207). The numbers (here and elsewhere in this column) are from HT’s dashboard, the NYT database, and worldometers.info.I have picked these three countries because they are the countries with the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the world. And they have pretty much driven the growth in numbers over the past month around the world. A month ago, the average (seven-day) contribution of these three countries to daily new cases was just around half (51%). On July 23, the average was 60%. The average (again seven-day) daily cases in the world grew 56% in this period. It grew 109% in the US, 18% in Brazil (whose numbers have swung), and 167% in India.Thus, while the virus is making its presence felt in new geographies, and raising its head again in some parts of Europe (which was expected as countries opened up; and the flare-ups are not really of alarming proportions), most of the world’s cases are still coming from three of the largest countries in terms of both geographical area and population. This isn’t surprising. Countries spread across a huge area, and with many states, are likely to see the coronavirus follow different temporal trajectories across regions. That’s what is happening in the US. That is what is happening in Brazil. And that is what is beginning to happen in India.Also read: Centre’s 5-point advice to 9 states driving recent Covid surgeIn theory, the pandemic should have behaved the same way in China, where the virus originated, but given Beijing’s lack of transparency about anything related to Covid-19, the world has no way of knowing how the pandemic played out (and is playing out) in that country.In India, the trend is clear.At one time, Delhi, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu together accounted for two of every three cases in the country. Over the past week, though, the three have averaged a little over one in three (38.5%). On Thursday, the proportion was 36%. Maharashtra continues to show more cases (mostly outside Mumbai, but while the number of cases in the city has fallen, the positivity rate is still high enough to indicate that not enough testing is happening), as does Tamil Nadu, although the state’s positivity rate has been plateauing for weeks, and Delhi has seen a sharp fall in daily cases. The majority of India’s cases are now coming from other parts of the country, including some that were once being touted as role models for managing Covid-19.Karnataka, for instance, saw 5,030 new cases on Thursday and its total tally stands at 80,863. In the past week alone, the state has added close to 30,000 cases. But numbers are also rising in other states: Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, Kerala, Gujarat, and Telangana. Much like the US, India should be prepared for a second phase of the virus’ run here. In the US, the slope of this curve has been steeper than that in the first phase. It is likely India will see the same thing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-DjGeQ7xAGRPqo0Xc28X06M.html
25-07-2020||India||Distrust and verify: US ups ante against China||The US government launched one of its most strident attacks on China yet with secretary of state Michael Pompeo on Thursday repudiating decades-old American policy of engaging with communist China as a strategy that “failed”, and asking allies and world powers to use “more creative and assertive ways” to press Beijing to change its ways.Pompeo drew on a significant cold war terminology and said China’s military had became “stronger and more menacing” and the approach to Beijing should be “distrust and verify”, adapting President Ronald Reagan’s “trust but verify” mantra about the Soviet Union in the 1980s.The comments come at a time when Beijing’s ties with Washington, as well as New Delhi, are at their worst in decades, and other countries – such as the UK and Australia – have expressed new concerns over threats emanating from China, particularly those relating to how Chinese companies may be helping the government spy on people around the world and the way Beijing may be flexing its muscles in territorial disputes.“The old paradigm of blind engagement with China has failed,” Pompeo said in a widely anticipated policy speech at a legacy California library run by the foundation of late President Richard Nixon, who re-established diplomatic ties with China and paved the way for its opening up to the world with a historic visit in 1972. “If the free world doesn’t change Communist China — [it] will surely change us,” Pompeo added, attacking what is one of the most significant Republican foreign policy achievements in the last five decades. “The free world must triumph over this new tyranny,” he said.It was Nixon’s visit to China in 1972, the first by an American president since the Communists took power in 1949, that upended a Cold War paradigm and paved the way for the normalisation of relations in 1979. The thaw was precipitated by a deterioration in China’s ties with the Soviet Union. Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping visited the US in 1979 after the establishment of diplomatic ties, smiling in photos as he tried on a cowboy hat in Texas. The Houston consulate that is being shut this week opened later the same year -- it was China’s first in the United States.Thursday’s speech was the fourth in a formatted series by senior members of the Trump administration framing the deteriorating relations with China, which has also been marked by a slew of punitive measures such as, most recently, the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston. On Friday, China ordered the US to close its consulate in the western city of Chengdu, ratcheting up the diplomatic conflict and prompting the White House to caution Beijing against engaging in “tit-for-tat retaliation”.“The current situation in Chinese-US relations is not what China desires to see. The United States is responsible for all this,” said foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin. “We once again urge the United States to immediately retract its wrong decision and create necessary conditions for bringing the bilateral relationship back on track.”China’s state-run broadcaster also quoted Wang as attacking Pompeo’s remarks: “Pompeo’s statement was filled with cold war mentality. It’s a combination of political lies by US politicians recently. We resolutely oppose this.” Also on Friday, the US State Department sent out a notice warning Americans in China of a “heightened risk of arbitrary detention”. “The kind of engagement we have been pursuing has not brought the kind of change in China that President Nixon hoped to induce,” Pompeo said at the lecture, adding: “President Nixon once said he feared he had created a ‘Frankenstein’ by opening the world to the Chinese Communist Party. And here we are.”He said there was now a need for “a new grouping of like-minded nations -- a new alliance of democracies” to change the way they deal with China. He did not specify which these nations were. “We cannot treat this incarnation of China as a normal country,” Pompeo said, adding the United States cannot do it alone because the Chinese have spread far too wide and deep into the world, unlike the Soviet Union, which had remained closed.When asked if he was urging nations to pick between the US and China, in line with a choice the US presented to the world in the 1940s between itself and the USSR, Pompeo said the choice for them was between “freedom and tyranny”.“If we bend the knee now, our children’s children may be at the mercy of the CCP (the Chinese Communist Party), whose actions are the primary challenge to the free world,” he had said in his speech, as he was laying out the threat the world faced form China. “General Secretary Xi Jinping isn’t destined to tyrannize inside and outside of China forever, unless we allow it,” he said. The secretary of state also argued for involving the Chinese people in changing the regime. “We must also engage and empower the Chinese people...a dynamic, freedom-loving people who are completely distinct from the Chinese Communist Party.” he said. He has been meeting Chinese dissidents and victims and survivors of Chinese oppression in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, and some of them were present in the audience at the invitation-only event. Scott Kennedy of Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies said cooperation with other democracies on China would be easier said than done, given the Trump administration’s record of dealing with allies.“How do you form a united front against China when the U.S. is bullying its allies, trashing multilateral institutions and pushing an economic decoupling (from China) that no one else supports?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/distrust-and-verify-us-ups-ante-against-china/story-9OHZT9gGipDs2W14RIf1zJ.html
25-07-2020||India||‘Dissent or defiance’: A ‘curious’ Ahmed Patel asks, throws in a scenario||Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel, in a Twitter post on Friday, threw in a scenario involving BJP chief and some MLAs going incommunicado. Broadening his argument, he said if the group is found to be collaborating with the opposition Congress what would one term it - dissent or defiance.The Congress in Rajasthan is battling rebellion from its very own Sachin Pilot and 18 dissident MLAs who are openly opposing their chief minister Ashok Gehlot. Till last week, Sachin Pilot was the deputy chief minister in the very government until he was sacked by the party for leading the revolt against CM Gehlot. Since the differences came out in public, team Pilot has been away from Jaipur and is reported to be camping in BJP-ruled Haryana. “Very curious to know if the BJP President goes incommunicado with 30 MPs , is actively collaborating with the Congress party & lodging himself in a Congress ruled stated under police protection - will it be mere dissent or defiance that merits disqualification?” tweeted Patel. Very curious to know if the BJP President goes incommunicado with 30 MP’s , is actively collaborating with the Congress party & lodging himself in a Congress ruled stated under police protection - will it be mere dissent or defiance that merits disqualification?Yesterday, the Rajasthan High Court ordered maintaining status quo on disqualification notices issued by the assembly speaker to 19 dissident Congress MLAs, including Sachin Pilot. The notices were served by the assembly speaker to the MLAs on July 14 after the party complained to him that the legislators had defied a whip to attend two Congress Legislature Party meetings last week. The MLAs argue that the issuance of disqualification notices by the speaker is a violation of their freedom of speech. Additionally, they also said that if a group of MLAs raises its voice against the style of CM’s functioning it cannot be termed defection. On the charge of defying the party whip, the MLAs contend that it applies only when the assembly is in session. The Rajasthan chief minister has repeatedly accused his former Number 2 of being hand-in-glove with the BJP and plotting the downfall of his government. Pilot, on his part, has maintained that he is not joining the BJP and is merely raising legitimate concerns against the party leadership of the state.Pilot, who is widely credited with leading the party’s successful 2018 poll campaign, was also sacked as the state unit chief. Before that he led a group of MLAs to Delhi to make his differences with the CM public. Last week, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, who is in Rajasthan as party’s central observer, asked Pilot to not accept the “hospitality” of BJP-ruled Haryana, if he was not joining the BJP.“Come back to your family, sit with your family and place your view before the family,” Surjewala was quoted as saying by ANI in Jaipur, where MLAs loyal to CM Ashok Gehlot are camping.The chief minister, however, was less accommodating and turned on the heat on the young rebel leader. “Our deputy chief minister and PCC president himself was doing the deal and was giving statements that no horse-trading was taking place. What clarification are you giving when you yourself were involved?” he had asked last week.However, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar denied any role in hosting the Congress rebel and several of his followers in a hotel in Manesar amid suggestions that its location indicated Pilot’s move had the blessings of the BJP leadership, which leads the ruling coalition in Haryana.Khattar denied the connection and said private hotels welcome everyone.“Private hotels are open for everyone, anyone can stay there. The Haryana government has no role in it,” said Khattar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dissent-or-defiance-a-curious-ahmed-patel-asks-throws-in-an-example/story-TpNy8lr6NL5a1YrVMK4K3I.html

The state elections are due in October-November but rising cases of Covid-19 and the call by some parties, including opposition RJD and BJP ally Lok Janshakti Party, to postpone them in view of the pandemic have caused some uncertainty.Quoting sources, news agency PTI said Nadda asserted that the NDA, which includes the BJP, chief minister Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) and Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan’s LJP, will remain intact and fight the polls together. His remarks assume significance as the LJP and the JD(U) have been sniping at each other for months.However, senior BJP leaders, including party general secretary Bhupendra Yadav, have rejected speculation about any serious differences in the alliance and maintained that its constituents will fight the assembly polls together.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nda-will-contest-bihar-polls-unitedly-says-bjp-chief-nadda/story-PYVgUeccPjX5w85BVhQmfL.html
25-07-2020||India||Covid stigma triggers group clash in Odisha, 18 arrested by police||The fear and apprehension over Covid-19 triggered a group clash in a village of Puri district today after a person from one village with a known positive case visited another village.Puri SP Akhileswar Singh said a person from Nisibhanra village under Puri Sadar police station area had gone to Kachapashi village when the people of the latter village attacked him over suspicion that he was infected by Covid. A Covid case was recently detected at Nishibhanra village which fuelled such speculation triggering a group clash. Few country-made bombs were also hurled by people of the two villages.In the clash, a person from Kachapashi village was injured and admitted to the Community Health Centre of Rebana village. Police later arrested 18 persons in connection with the group clash.Odisha’s road accident fatalities declined by 65 per cent during lockdownThe fear and stigma over Covid infection has led to several such incidents in the state. Early this week, a man in Mayurbhanj district had to carry his father’s body on a bike to funeral ground after they were deserted over fears that the man had died of Covid. The 56-year-old man had earlier tested positive, but had recovered. When he was being taken to a private hospital in Bhubaneswar from Mayurbhanj in a rented car by his son, he died on the way. The car driver then fled with the car fearing that the man had died from Covid. As the man’s son could not find a hearse van, he put his father’s body on a motorcycle and brought it to the cremation ground for last rites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-stigma-triggers-group-clash-in-odisha-18-arrested-by-police/story-dvvb5ukb9UGLSHZmzd8mgM.html
25-07-2020||India||Gehlot wants floor test after HC defers verdict||Congress legislators supporting Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot staged a dramatic five-hour-long demonstration at Raj Bhavan on Friday, demanding that governor Kalraj Mishra call a special session of the assembly and allow a floor test, which they said they were confident of winning in the midst of their power tussle with former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and those backing him.Hours earlier, the Rajasthan high court, which was hearing a plea by Pilot and his loyalists against disqualification notices sent to them, ordered maintaining status quo on the matter. The ruling meant the assembly speaker CP Joshi cannot decide on disqualifying Pilot and 18 other rebel Congress MLAs for the time being. The court also formally admitted the plea by the Congress rebels and deferred its verdict in the case.The decision triggered a flurry of activity in the Gehlot camp, which feels that going for an immediate floor test may be the best way to end the political impasse and save the government that has been staring at uncertainty in the wake of a split in its ranks.At around 2:30pm, legislators led by Gehlot arrived at Raj Bhavan in four buses from the Fairmont hotel on the outskirts of Jaipur where they have been staying. As Gehlot met the governor inside, the MLAs sat on the lawns, shouting slogans and asserting that they will stay put till the governor issues an order for the session. “The governor is our constitutional head. We have requested him [for the session],” Gehlot said outside Raj Bhavan. Earlier, he said he requested Mishra to call a session of the assembly on Monday, but there was no word from him. Gehlot said if the demand for convening a session was not met, MLAs will “not be responsible” if people gherao the governor’s house.The Congress party also accused Mishra of acting on the behest of the Union government. “Governors are supposed to uphold the Constitution and the laws, but governors in this country are acting at the behest of the Union government,” Congress leader Kapil Sibal told a virtual press conference.Mishra later assured that he will call an assembly session though he wanted certain clarifications from the government, Congress functionaries said as the dharna came to an end. They said Mishra wanted the government’s response on these issues before the announcement, and that these will be discussed at a cabinet meeting at 9.30pm.Governor Mishra, meanwhile, sent a six-point questionnaire asking the government to respond as to why the assembly session was being called. “There is no one above constitutional decorum. There should not be any kind of pressure politics...,” he said.He said he will follow constitutional norms to convene a session, denied there was any pressure on him from the BJP, and wondered why Gehlot was in a hurry to prove his majority on the floor of the House when no one had made such a demand.According to the law laid down by the Supreme Court, the governor notifies the holding of a session on the recommendation of the council of ministers.“...the law is clear that a governor is bound by aid and advice of his cabinet, as long as it has not lost its majority on the floor of the house. In a parliamentary system, there cannot be a constitutional authority that prevents a house from being called,” senior counsel Sanjay Hegde told HT.Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan said: “If the Council of Ministers has the confidence of the House, there is no question that the Governor is bound by their advice in convening the legislature.”Gulab Chand Kataria, the leader of the Opposition in the state assembly, said: “The chief minister is saying that the public will come and gherao Raj Bhavan. I would request the Centre that it deploy the CRPF [Central Reserve Police Force] in Rajasthan to maintain law and order. It should not trust the Rajasthan police.”Gehlot has the support of 101 members (though this does not include speaker CP Joshi). Pilot has 18 other Congress MLAs and three independents in his camp, taking his tally to 22. The BJP and its ally Rashtriya Loktrantrik Party have 75 seats. Bhanwarlal Meghwal, one Congress MLA said to be close to Pilot, is indisposed.If Pilot’s tally is added to that of the opposition alliance, it takes their number up to 97. A three-member swing from the Gehlot camp to the Pilot camp or to the BJP could lead to the government falling in the event of a floor test.The Congress accuses the BJP of instigating the political crisis in Rajasthan and attempting to topple the state government. The opposition party denies the claim and says the crisis was triggered by an internal feud in the Congress.Earlier in the day, the Rajasthan high court’s order to maintain status quo on disqualification notices issued by the state assembly speaker to 19 rebel Congress MLAs came as a breather for Pilot.“We are of the considered view that the present writ petition is maintainable. The writ petition is admitted. After completion of filing of pleadings of the parties and the intervenors, counsel for the parties shall be at liberty to file an application for early hearing of the writ petition. Till then, the ‘status quo’ as exists today viz-a-viz impugned notices dated July 14 shall be maintained,” the order by the division bench of chief justice Indrajit Mahanty and justice Prakash Gupta said.The Congress chief whip, Mahesh Joshi, filed a complaint before the speaker on July 14, seeking action against Pilot and the other dissidents under paragraph 2 (1) (a) of the 10th Schedule of the Constitution. The provision disqualifies MLAs if they “voluntarily” give up the membership of the party which they represent in the House.The rebels said Pilot never indicated any intention to leave the Congress party. In their petition filed on July 15, Pilot and other 18 MLAs submitted that were merely exercising their right to criticise party leadership and the functioning of the chief minister.The Pilot camp also challenged the validity of paragraph 2(1) (a) of the 10th Schedule, contending that the provision was very wide since even expression of opinion or views against party leadership are construed as defection.Meanwhile, the assembly speaker moved the Supreme Court and filed a special leave petition on Wednesday, challenging the July 21 order of high court directing speaker to defer disqualification proceedings. The top court said it will look into the crucial question of whether the high court can interfere in proceedings initiated by the speaker even before a decision on disqualification has been taken.Normally, when a matter is admitted, it takes a very long time before it comes up for hearing in due course, Supreme Court advocate Sriram Parakkat said. “But the high court in its order has given liberty to the parties to file an application for early hearing after filing all pleadings. So the court can take up the matter without much delay if such an application is filed and the court finds it fit to hold an early hearing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gehlot-wants-floor-test-after-hc-defers-verdict/story-h6qWGe9zXbLeIJ28G8W81N.html
25-07-2020||India||Kanpur case: Man abducted, killed by friend||A 29-year-old man’s friend allegedly masterminded his kidnapping in Kanpur for ransom on June 22 and killed him five days later with of help of his five accomplices fearing the plan may go awry after the former tried to escape from captivity, the Uttar Pradesh police said on Friday. The kidnappers continued making ransom calls after murdering Sanjeet Yadav and allegedly received money as part of a botched police ploy to trap them, prompting the state government to order a high-level probe into their conduct and inaction alleged by his family.Inspector general (IG) of police (Kanpur Range) Mohit Agarwal said five of the six accused—Gyanendra Yadav alias Ishu, Kuldeep Goswami, Neelu Singh, Ramji Shukla, and Preeti Sharma—have been arrested. He added they were looking for the six accused, Simmy Singh, who remains on the run. He added Ishu, Sanjeet Yadav’s friend, masterminded the kidnapping with the help of the other accused.IG Agarwal said the captors stuffed Sanjeet Yadav’s body in a plastic bag and threw it in the Pandu river on Kanpur’s outskirts. He added the kidnappers started making ransom calls from June 29 and first demanded Rs 50 lakh and later accepted Rs 30 lakh after negotiations. Agarwal said Sanjeet Yadav’s family alleged they paid the ransom amount and Barra police station in-charge, Ranjeet Rai and other police officers (the Additional SP and CO, who were suspended in the matter), knew about it as it was a part of the plan to trap the kidnappers on July 13. He said the plan failed as the kidnappers turned out to be smarter and asked the family to throw the bag carrying ransom money from a flyover after making them travel several kilometres. “Those arrested claimed they had not received ransom but the family claimed that they paid. This is yet to be verified,” he said. “Inspector Ranjeet Rai and a sub-inspector Ramesh Kumar were earlier suspended for negligence in the matter around 10 days ago.”Additional police superintendent Aparna Gupta, and circle officer Manoj Gupta were suspended on Friday for their negligence in the case.The state government named additional director general of police Bhagirath P Jogdand to probe the controversy over the ransom. Jogdand will also probe the police negligence, how the kidnappers managed to escape after calling the victim’s family to a certain place and their claims of paying the ransom amount, according to a statement released by the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kanpur-case-man-abducted-killed-by-friend/story-RcbsknJ2kTup17t7gsWojP.html
25-07-2020||India||US-China ties in nosedive as Trump faces Covid flak||Washington: The United States recorded its first Covid-19 case on January 21.“China has been working very hard to contain the coronavirus,” President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter three days later, taking an indulgent view of Beijing’s alleged culpability. “The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American people, I want to thank President Xi.”Six months later, on Thursday, Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, was declared a tyrant by Trump’s top diplomat Mike Pompeo.There have been more than four million Covid-19 cases in the United States, and over 144,000 fatalities. SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), may be the “China virus” or the “Wuhan virus”, as Trump and his aides have sought to portray it to shift blame, but it is an American problem, more than anything else.And one that could rob President Trump of a second term.Polls have been brutal on Trump’s handling of the epidemic. Joe Biden, the former vice-president and the presumptive Democratic nominee, leads the President by nearly nine points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls. Trump is also trailing Biden in the swing states that gave him the presidency in 2016.Trump is trailing Biden in more than just the polls.He is in such a desperately bad situation politically that he been forced to walk back his earlier attempts to downplay the epidemic. Trump has had to embrace masks (or any facial covering) after mocking Biden for wearing them; and cancel the Republican convention that he had wanted so badly to showcase his first term. He will accept the nomination virtually, it seems, following Biden’s lead.His frustration with China has grown exponentially at the same time. He has attacked Beijing for letting the virus escape its borders. “So it’s a shame that it happened. It shouldn’t have happened. China should have stopped it,” he said Thursday, re-litigating his case against China.Trump ran his 2016 campaign for the White House on the promise of ending China’s rogue behaviour on trade, including currency manipulation. He set into motion a series of measures soon after coming into office that led to a full-fledged trade war between the world’s two largest economies shortly.He pursued a trade deal even though it had become clear that China was not interested in conceding the main American asks, such as ending forced transfer of technology. He won a limited Phase 1 deal, but never got to the larger agreement that he had wanted to claim complete victory.It is no longer a priority. “The trade deal means less to me now than it did when I made it,” Trump told reporters Thursday.Trade ceded centre stage to Covid-19 as the main China issue when infections and fatalities began shooting around March. New York city and state soon replaced China’s Wuhan and Hubei province as the new epicentres of the raging pandemic, and Trump was left defending his shoddy handling of his administration’s first major crisis.Trump and his aides sought to deflect blame by putting it all on China, and soon US-China relations were in a precipitous downward spiral. This led to slew of sanctions, visa restrictions; and harsh remarks over the mistreatment of Uighur Muslims, restrictions in Hong Kong, and aggressive military postures in hot spots such as the South China Sea, and the disputed areas along its borders with India and Bhutan.Earlier this week, the Trump administration ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston, alleging it was being used as an intelligence-gathering hub. On Friday, China notified the US that it’s revoking the operating permit for the US consulate in Chengdu, according to a statement from Chinese foreign ministry.On Thursday, secretary of state Pompeo signalled the end of the decades-old US policy of engaging China with the hope of changing it and its behaviour.“The old paradigm of blind engagement with China has failed,” Pompeo said in a widely anticipated policy speech at a legacy California library run by the foundation of late President Richard Nixon, who re-established diplomatic ties with China and paved the way for its opening with a historic visit in 1972. “If the free world doesn’t change Communist China — [it] will surely change us,” Pompeo added, setting up his call for an international alliance of “like-minded” nations.There is a need for “a new grouping of like-minded nations -- a new alliance of democracies”, Pompeo said, without specifying which nations.In a question-answer session following the speech, the secretary of state said these nations will have the backing of the US for sure. When asked if he was urging nations to pick between the US and China, in line with a choice the US presented to the world in the 1940s between itself and the USSR, Pompeo said the choice for them was between “freedom and tyranny”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-china-ties-in-nosedive-as-trump-faces-covid-flak/story-Lnq44LQWwaPH2geCFKadtO.html
25-07-2020||India||Advani denies all charges in Babri masjid demolition case||Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Lal Krishna Advani, 92, on Friday denied all charges against him in the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition case and blamed the then Union government of fabricating them against him. Advani appeared before the special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court hearing the case to record his statements via video conferencing from his residence in New Delhi. His lawyer, KK Mishra, represented Advani in the CBI court in Lucknow. “LK Advani answered around 100 questions during court proceedings. He denied all allegations against him in the Babri Masjid demolition case and held the then Central government responsible for fabricated charges against him,” said Mishra. The Babri mosque demolition trial is currently at the stage of the recording of statements of the accused under Section 313 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), during which the accused get an opportunity to refute the prosecution evidence against them. With Advani’s statement, the CBI court completed the recording of statements of all 32 accused in the demolition case, except Shiv Sena leader Satish Pradhan, who has tested positive for Covid-19 and is under quarantine in Mumbai. The court has fixed July 28 for Pradhan to record his statement online. Another accused, Om Prakash Pandey of Uttarakhand, has been absconding for 16 years and the CBI court has issued orders to seize his property.All the accused have denied charges against them. Another senior BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi, 86, appeared before the court. The Babri mosque was brought down by on December 6, 1992 by “kar sevaks” who believed it was built on the birthplace of Hindu God Ram. The decades-old dispute was settled last year when the Supreme Court ordered that the site be given to a trust to build a temple. The court also ordered that alternative land be provided in Ayodhya for a mosque. Advani, Joshi, and others have been accused of being involved in the conspiracy to demolish the mosque.The temple’s foundation-stone laying is expected to be held in the first week of August with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in attendance. Advani, too, is expected to attend the event.In April 2017, the Supreme Court ordered the special court to conduct a day-to-day trial of the demolition case and to conclude it in two years. The deadline expired on April 19. The Supreme Court on May 8 issued a new deadline of August 31 with instructions to deliver the judgment by then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/advani-denies-all-charges-in-babri-masjid-demolition-case/story-zDAZYXh7tIAIIR4pYbzOBL.html
25-07-2020||India||Daily cases near 50k, hit new high for the 3rd day||With the highest single-day spike of 48,887 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), India’s tally of infections crossed the 1.3 million-mark on Friday. This was the third day in a row that India reported a record for new cases.After the United States and Brazil, India is the third worst-hit country in the world with 1,335,501 cases, and 31,394 fatalities that have been recorded in nearly five months since the first case on March 2.While Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu were responsible for nearly two out of every three new infections reported till early July, the latest burst of cases are the result of the spread of the virus to other states such as Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.On Friday, Maharashtra reported 9,615 new cases, the highest in the country, followed by Andhra Pradesh’s 8,147 and Tamil Nadu’s 6,785 cases, taking the total tallies in these regions to 357,117, 80,858 and 199,749 respectively. Delhi, with the third highest number of total cases in the country, reported 1,025 new infections. Total cases in the national capital are now at 128,389, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.As of Friday, the number of active cases in the country stands at 454,307, while 849,800 people (63.6% of those infected) have been cured or discharged.In the last week, India has added an average of 42,346 cases a day, up from 31,097 a day in the seven-day period before that. HT reported on Thursday that India’s trajectory of average new cases has overtaken Brazil’s and stands second only to that of the United States.On the back of the steady rise in the number of cases in the past week, the doubling rate of cases — the number of days it takes for a given number of infections to double — touched the lowest recorded in nearly a month. As of Friday, the doubling rate of cases was 19.3 days, the lowest since June 29 (see chart).On March 25, when the nationwide lockdown started, the doubling time of cases in the country based on the previous week’s rate of new cases was 3.4 days. In the second week of July, it touched the highest so far — 21 days. However, on the back of a week of consecutive drop in the doubling rate, the number now stands at 19.3 days.India’s average weekly test positive rate has risen from 7.7% in mid-June to 11.6% at present, but the aggregate level statistics mask sharp differences in testing performance across the country. Maharashtra has a test positive rate close to 21%, while for Uttar Pradesh, this number is just a little over 4%.With a total of 4,202,361 cases and more than 147,740 deaths, the United States remains the hardest-hit country in the world, with Brazil (2,303,661 cases and 84,440 deaths) and India trailing in second and third place in terms of total infection numbers. India’s case fatality rate (CFR) — the proportion of people who succumbed to the illness from among known infections — was 2.4%, much better than America’s fatality rate of 3.5% and Brazil’s 3.7%. Together, these three countries continue to account for a large majority of new cases. In the last week, the three worst-hit nations are responsible for more than 1 million (60%) of the 1.6 million new cases reported across the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/daily-cases-near-50k-hit-new-high-for-the-3rd-day/story-pWX2XwCds7aXIcR7rRS6aO.html

The government’s own guidelines prohibit large congregations and gatherings. A senior official in Rashtrapati Bhavan said that the At Home function will definitely happen, but with a much smaller group. “Usually, Rashtrapati Bhavan would invite about 1500 guests. This time, the invitee list might see just between 40 to 90 people. The function will be held in the conference centre.” That won’t be the only change. At Homes are known for the food on offer. ““But this time, we are contemplating if food should be served to guests or not. And if the food is to be served, how it should be served as arrangements have to be elaborate,”added the official. The Rashtrapati Bhavan’s pruned list may not even include all union ministers,or all ambassadors. “We have to pick and choose. We may call select diplomats to cover different regions. Only a few senior judges and a few editors from media might be included. We don’t see any scope for a large at-home gathering this time,” said the official.On his first and second anniversaries in office, Kovind visited a tribal village and an NGO for disabled children. This time, there is no such plan, but he will be engaged in charitable work and pay his respects to people safeguarding the health of the nation.His office will highlight his achievements: an austerity drive, donating 30% of his annual salary to fight the pandemic, the ban on plastic at Rashtrapati Bhavan, and the massive plantation drive in the estate. The President’s estate has also gone green with a biogas plant,the reuse of waste paper and a ferry service using electric vehicles.While all state visits are on hold, Kovid has hosted 9 state visits including the US president this year and received 15 global leaders. For the first time, ambassadors presented their credentials digitally.Officials said that Kovind wants to make the estate more accessible to people and has already had the huge collection of rare books in Rashtrapati Bhavan library digitized.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-hits-celebrations-for-kovind-s-3rd-year-in-office/story-N8gcxM7Wme9o0BrQOAOLuL.html
25-07-2020||India||Floor test best chance for Gehlot, say Congress leaders||The Ashok Gehlot government now sees its best chance in Rajasthan in a floor test in the assembly, after the Supreme Court refused to stay the Rajasthan high court proceedings about speaker CP Joshi’s disqualification notice to 19 rebel Congress MLAs led by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot.According to two party strategists aware of the matter, a section in the party was wary of Joshi’s decision to go to the Supreme Court to seek stay the high court’s proceedings They also said on condition of anonymity that since the high court put on hold its verdict (and effectively the disqualification proceedings), until the top court weighs on the larger issue of the court’s jurisdiction in the matter, proving a majority in the assembly quickly is the only way forward for Gehlot while he is still confident of the numbers.Also Read: ‘Dissent or defiance’: A ‘curious’ Ahmed Patel asks, throws in a scenarioThe Congress strategists also contended that governor Kalraj Mishra, a former Union minister in the previous Narendra Modi government , will not be able to hold back consent for an assembly session for long if an elected government seeks it. But they saw little merit in going to court for a direction to the governor to hurry his consent, fearing that it might add to the delay. A delay, they added, would only give the Opposition and the Congress rebels time to win over more MLAs to their side.As things stand, Gehlot appears to have the support of 101 members — the majority mark in the 200-member state assembly (though this does not include Joshi). Pilot has 18 other Congress MLAs and three independents, taking his tally to 22. The BJP and its ally Rashtriya Loktrantrik Party have 75 seats. One Congress MLA, Bhanwarlal Meghwal, is indisposed, though he is said to be close to Pilot. If Pilot’s tally is added to that of opposition, it takes their number up to 97. This means a three-member swing from the Gehlot camp to the Pilot camp or to the BJP could lead to the government falling in a no-confidence motion.Also Read: Politics of pressure will not work, says Rajasthan governorIf 19 Congress MLAs were disqualified, it would bring down the strength of the assembly to 181, and the halfway mark 91, giving Gehlot a comfortable majority.The Congress legal team, led by Abhishek Singhvi, supported Pilot’s disqualification citing his conduct and remarks of aides under Chapter 2 (1) (a) of the 10th Schedule of the Constitution which says a member can be disqualified “if he has voluntarily given up his membership”. But another section felt the evidence provided might not be enough to prove Pilot’s intention to leave the party. Chapter 2(1)(b) of Tenth Schedule says a lawmaker can be disqualified “if he votes or abstains from voting in such House contrary to any direction issued by the political party to which he belongs or by any person or authority authorised by it in this behalf without obtaining prior permission”. A senior Congress leader felt that once the house is convened, the Pilot’s camp refusal to adhere to party’s directions would be more serious grounds for disqualification than not attending two legislature party meetings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/floor-test-best-chance-for-gehlot-say-cong-leaders/story-lAIWnOZoVQBpDe0PYFjliK.html
25-07-2020||India||Centre’s 5-point advice to 9 states driving recent Covid surge||The Centre held an important meeting on Friday to review the coronavirus situation in nine states that have witnessed a rapid rise in fresh Covid caseload in the past couple of weeks and advised the respective administrations on key areas of focus to contain the disease. The virtual review meeting was chaired by cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba and was attended by the chief secretaries and health secretaries of nine states--Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Telangana, Odisha, West Bengal, Assam, Karnataka, Jharkhand and UP.States were advised to measure their containment efforts in five key areas—testing in containment zones, delineation of containment zones, intensive contact tracing, house to house search within containment zones and mapping of high-risk population—to be able to get a better grip on the situation.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesUnion health ministry said that states were asked to ramp up testing while being advised on the merits of sustained and aggressive testing with special focus on containment zones.“It was reiterated that sustained and aggressive testing is crucial for early identification of cases and to prevent the spread of infection,” the ministry of health and family welfare said.Breaking the chain of transmission was also underlined as another key objective, which the centre said could only be achieved through prompt and proper delineation of containment zones as per the guidelines issued by the government from time to time. States were also advised to go for intensive contact tracing and house-to-house active case search within containment zones.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19India on Friday recorded the highest single-day surge of 49,310 Covid-19 cases that has taken India’s virus tally to 12,87,945. The death toll has risen 30,601 with 740 fresh fatalities. The government has been insisting that it was more important to keep the fatality rate low relying on early detection and treatment, especially among the vulnerable section.This was reiterated in today’s meeting with the above mentioned states. They were told to conduct mapping of high-risk populations, particularly the elderly and those with co-morbidities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-s-5-point-advice-to-9-states-driving-recent-covid-surge/story-1hwihIlXzqw1co3q4dEPEN.html
25-07-2020||India||‘The HC has no regard for precedent’: Kapil Sibal||No court can pass any protective order for those against whom disqualification petitions are pending, senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal told Sunetra Choudhury in an interview, adding that he was shocked by the Rajasthan high court’s Friday order. He also said he was concerned about what’s happening in the Congress. Edited excerpts:What according to you was the import of the High Court judgement today? I am shocked, totally shocked. Obviously the HC has no regard for precedent. There is a 5-judge judgement of the Supreme Court which says that the proceedings before the Speaker till the Speaker decides on the disqualification are proceedings of the house. And that therefore, no court can pass any protective orders for those against whom the disqualification petitions are pending. It’s a decision which was taken way back in 1992 in a case in which I was also a counsel. That’s the judgement of the SC and it is binding on every court. It’s a sad day if institutional authorities do not give respect to judgements of court. The argument is that pointing out the faults of the Chief Minister doesn’t warrant disqualification... The disqualification notice is a matter of public record and is 3-4 pages long and gives all grounds and sets out what the fears are. It has nothing to do with what you are saying. Many of them (the dissident MLAs) said they want a trust vote to be held. Now, if you are a member of the party, and you owe allegiance to the party and you haven’t left the party, then what’s the trust vote you want to hold? Why have you gone to Haryana which is not a Congress state? And you are being protected by the Haryana police and the CRPF-- what is that got to do with what you are saying? The issue jurisdictional, till the Speaker decides on those issues, the court cannot pass an order-- that’s the law of this country.Also Read: Why can’t Gehlot wait for floor test: Mukul Rohatgi As we speak there is a dharna (protest) by Gehlot and his legislators at Raj Bhavan. The CM used strong words against Pilot and is now criticising the governor ... I remember Gandhiji and the days of the British Raj. when the powers that be never listened to the freedom fighters. Ultimately what did Gandhiji do? He held dharnas. What did our national leaders do? They held dharnas, so a dharnas is not an uncivilised act. As far as language is concerned, every person uses the language that is judicious to use, I don’t want to comment on that. We may not have any knowledge or information about what was been happening in the past within the state, and what actions were taken by certain people. And that, I guess, the CM is privy to and he may have said something. Media should look at the issue and not the words. What’s the issue here? A man says he’s a member of the Congress party, and yet the man says my people and I will not go to meetings of the Congress party. Here is a man who became MP in his 20’s, then in 2009, in his early 30’s he became a minister. He lost in 2014, then when the assembly elections took place, he became deputy chief minister. He had 5-6 portfolios. What’s he unhappy about? Is this an unhappy journey? Can he have any grievances? Which member of the Congress party got what he did at such a young age? I don’t understand and I’m 72 years old. Have you had a change of perspective? It was your tweet which alerted everyone to the crisis within the party. You expressed concern about the situation which was making Sachin Pilot leave.  Of course I am concerned. I am concerned about what’s happening in the Congress. I have said that publicly. I have said these issues should be resolved much earlier. Sometimes we have people who do not want to resolve these issues. I am not talking in favour of A or in favour of B, I am a Congressman at heart. I am not for or against somebody, I am for the ideology, I am for what it (the party) stands for. And I am hurt when things like this happen to the only opposition party that can fight this government which is running roughshod over people. That’s what I am upset about and I am upset with my party also.Also Read: Politics of pressure will not work, says Rajasthan governorCould you elaborate on that?I am wedded to the party. Never in my life, would I leave this party or this ideology. I am upset with everybody but am more upset with this government than with my party.The other side says that it is the prerogative of the governor to decide when to call the session?That’s also governed by the Nabam Tuki (Arunachal Pradesh) judgement. Governor has no discretion in the matter. If the government wants to call the session, why isn’t he calling it? What’s the problem?There is the pandemic... When in March, the Madhya Pradesh session was called, there was no pandemic? Today government offices are working in Delhi and Jaipur. And if you don’t want to call the session because of the pandemic, then have it through video conferencing. What’s the problem? You can have any excuse not to call the session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-hc-has-no-regard-for-precedent-kapil-sibal/story-nr9m1jZMXakD1zkbcKpmoN.html
25-07-2020||India||No relaxation in J&K 4G curbs yet, Centre tells SC||A special committee constituted as per the Supreme Court’s May 11 order to review restrictions on high-speed mobile internet in Jammu & Kashmir has decided against any relaxations for the time being, the Centre has told the apex court. In an affidavit on July 21, the Union home ministry said the committee on June 10 considered all aspects of the matter, including terror incidents, before deciding to continue the restrictions on 4G mobile internet. The committee will review the situation again in two months, it added.“A thorough and comprehensive consideration of all facets of the matter including [the] recent occurrence of terrorism-related incidents in the region was carried out [by the committee]. Ultimately, based on a wide-ranging assessment of the prevailing situation in this sensitive region, the committee arrived at a decision that no further relaxation on restrictions on internet services, including 4G services, could be carried out at present,” the affidavit said.The affidavit was filed in response to a plea from NGO Foundation of Media Professionals for initiation of contempt of court proceedings against the Centre and Jammu & Kashmir on the grounds that no action was taken to comply with the May 11 order.The May 11 order was passed after the NGO in April challenged restriction on mobile internet speed to 2G. The NGO sought restoration of high-speed 4G internet services saying patients, doctors, and the general public were unable to access the latest information, guidelines, advisories and restrictions about Covid-19 pandemic because of the restrictions. It pointed out slow internet speed makes telemedicine, or online consultation, impossible.The Supreme Court on May 11 refrained from passing directions to restore 4G services and instead constituted the committee comprising high-level government officers, including Union home secretary, to take a call on the matter. The committee was asked to examine the necessity to allow faster internet in certain geographical areas. The NGO in June filed the contempt petition saying there was no information available in the public domain whether the constitution of the committee was notified and whether it has conducted any meetings or passed any orders.The Centre told the court the committee was constituted by virtue of the May 11 order and no separate notification was required. The committee met on May 15 and sought further inputs before taking any decision. It again met on June 10 and decided not to relax the restrictions, the Centre said. “In view of the above, the contempt petition is misconceived and without any merit and is liable to be rejected.”A communications blackout and a lockdown were imposed in J&K in August last year as part of measures to prevent protests against the Centre’s move to divest the region of its special status. Most of the restrictions have since been eased even as the mobile internet remains restricted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-relaxation-in-j-k-4g-curbs-yet-centre-tells-sc/story-RILP9SPhDPMs8shbFdThrM.html
25-07-2020||India||Why can’t Gehlot wait for floor test: Mukul Rohatgi||The Rajasthan High Court on Friday admitted the plea of the state’s former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and 18 legislators allied with him (and against chief minister Ashok Gehlot) against their disqualification proceedings, and asked the assembly speaker to maintain status quo, effectively putting the proceedings on hold. The Supreme Court is already hearing a case on the high court’s jurisdiction in the matter. Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Pilot and the dissident MLAs, spoke to Sunetra Choudhury on is reading of the situation. Edited excerpts: It’s a very significant order. The bottom line of the case is this: if an MLA raises his voice and a voice of dissent against the CM or another senior functionary of the party to which he belongs for legitimate reasons, say putting a demand of his electorate which is not being looked at or to strengthen inner-party democracy, does this act of dissent make an MLA liable to lose his seat for which he has been elected for five years? That is the question. So, suppose Mr Pilot was going to the rally of an opposition party and saying dismiss the government, that may be a clear incident of him leaving the party. But a mere dissent by an MLA against his leader while remaining in the party, cannot be grounds for being chucked out.  No, no, it’s the wrong assumption. Whenever a provision of the law or the constitution is challenged, it is incumbent on the party to involve the government of India because the GoI has to defend its laws and the constitution. In fact, the petition will not be properly constituted if the union of India is not added. It should have been done in the first instance but since it was done in a hurry, it wasn’t . It is mandatory else the petition is likely to get rejected.Also Read: The HC has no regard for precedent: Kapil SibalThe governor is a constitutional functionary. He is not sitting there only at the beck and call of the chief minister. He has some discretion. Why and when he will call the house, he will have the reasons -- I don’t know, I am not privy to what’s happening . From what I’ve read, the Governor is entitled to say ‘Let’s not hold the session for the next two weeks because of the onset of Covid’. There are a large number of people infected with Covid and to bring 200 or 250 people into the house, into one room and debate for 10 hours or 20 hours and then have another 100 people, the employees of the assembly, there... .  It’s not as if the opposition is asking for a floor test, so that the government falls. It is the man himself (CM) who is asking for a floor test, so he can jolly well wait for 10 days or 20 days if the Governor so desires. What’s the urgency?Also Read: Not held hostage, say 3 MLAsThere is no question . In Madhya Pradesh there was a wafer thin majority. Gehlot is saying his majority is more than 25. If his majority is more than 25, what is the fear? Why can’t he keep his people together if it is that many? He wants a floor test for himself, to assure himself that he has more than 25. In MP and in other cases, the opposition wanted a floor test to pull down the government. Here there is nobody who is saying they have more than him. I am not a political expert and I don’t know who is inviting who. Whatever I have seen of Mr PIlot, he doesn’t want to join the BJP.  I haven’t spoken to Mr Pilot on those issues. I have only dealt with him on the issue of disqualification.That’s not akin to leaving the party voluntarily. 19MLAs are not ostriches, they are together because they believe in something, that’s their position.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-can-t-gehlot-wait-for-floor-test-mukul-rohatgi/story-3XXQ0nUtyEL6WQMVU9uufP.html
25-07-2020||India||3.5 mn hit by floods in Assam, Bihar||The flood situation in Bihar and Assam remained grim on Friday with close to 3.5 million people affected because of the deluge, officials in the two states said. Floods during the monsoon are not unusual in places like Bihar and Assam, but this year several parts of eastern Indian have received heavier rainfall and triggered severe floods.Officials said northern Bihar is among the worst-hit regions because of heavy rains in Nepal, which have claimed 132 lives there. The heavy rainfall has swollen the rivers that originate in Nepal.The Gandak has breached embankments in Gopalganj and East Champaran and flooded vast stretches in the districts. Engineer in-chief, flood control, water resources department, Rajesh Kumar, said the restoration work was going on the western embankment that breached in Gopalganj on Friday. Also read: Rework flood control strategies | HT EditorialThe floods in Bihar have so far affected around 7,65,000 people in 10 districts, officials said. They added Darbhanga is the worst-hit district, where the deluge has affected 3,25,000 people. The National Disaster Response Force and the state agencies have launched operations to rescue the marooned people and take them to safer places. According to the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) data, floods have affected over 2.7 million people in 26 of the state’s 33 districts. As many as 96 people have drowned and landslides triggered by heavy rains have left another 26 dead in the state this season.Over 50,000 displaced people have been sheltered in 301 relief camps while floodwaters have inundated crops over 1.22-hectare area across Assam.“We are witnessing the third wave of floods. Rainfall and flooding have been taking place since May end. While rainfall has taken place as per IMD [India Meteorological Department] prediction, climate change could be a reason for lack of a gap between waves of floods,” said Pankaj Chakraborty, state project coordinator, ASDMA.The floods continue to affect the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR) with 85% of its area of over 430 sq km inundated. This season, 125 animals of the park including 13 rhinos (9 due to drowning and 4 due to natural causes) have died in and around the park.Prince William, the second in line to the British throne, wrote to KNPTR director P. Sivakumar on July 21, saying he and his wife, Catherine, were heartbroken to hear about the appalling devastation to the reserve and its precious wildlife because of flooding. “We have the happiest memories of our visit to Kaziranga in April 2016 and are shocked by what has happened. The deaths of so many animals, including one-horned rhino, is deeply upsetting.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-5mn-hit-by-floods-in-assam-bihar/story-F0WYjfWpEqbqQEVUnwdw8K.html
25-07-2020||India||Politics of pressure will not work, says Rajasthan governor||Rajasthan governor Kalraj Mishra, the man of the hour, said he would follow constitutional norms to convene a session of the assembly, denied there was any pressure on him to not convene the assembly from the BJP, the party to which he belonged before becoming governor, and wondered why chief minister Ashok Gehlot was in a hurry to prove his majority on the floor of the House when no one had demanded that he do. Mishra spoke to HT on a day when Raj Bhavan saw the unprecedented scenes of lawmakers staging a protest on its lawns. He said the CM wanted to meet him and said the MLAs would also come along. “But when they staged a dharna in Raj Bhavan, shouted slogans, I had to be firm and told them “dabav ki rajniti nahin chalegi (politics of pressure won’t work)”. Rajasthan has seen a political drama over the past fortnight with 19 Congress lawmakers, led by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, mounting a rebellion against the chief minister. The launch of disqualification motions against them by the speaker has resulted in the battle reaching the courts with both the Rajasthan high court and the Supreme Court hearing cases related to this. Mishra said that the Rajasthan “cabinet has not taken a formal decision on convening the session of the Rajasthan Assembly; an informal meeting was held authorising the chief minister to take a decision. Neither any specific date or agenda was mentioned in their (the state government’s ) communique.”He added: “On July 23, the state government issued a letter inviting the assembly session at night with very short notice. Based on the merits in the paper, the Raj Bhavan examined and consulted by legal experts.”Following this, Raj Bhavan sent a letter to the Parliamentary Affairs Department of the state government mentioning that the date on which the assembly session was to be convened was not mentioned , and that there was no mention of formal cabinet approval. Meanwhile, Gehlot went public with his demand for a session and said he would not be responsible for his lawmakers picketing Raj Bhavan. Mishra said that he has never heard any chief minister give such a statement. “I am duty-bound to take constitutional advise on any letter that comes from you. And the Indian Constitution has given me this power. You expressed your desire on July 23 to convene a Vidhan Sabha session but before I could consult experts, you went before the press saying you will not be responsible for the gherao of Raj Bhawan,” he wrote to the CM. He also asked in the letter if the Rajasthan government is “unable to protect the governor”. Responding to the Congress allegation that he was under pressure from the top, Mishra said: “I am putting forth the constitutional position. You think there is any pressure?” Mishra demanded to know the emergency for summoning the session that too during the pandemic. “Why? What is the urgency? What is the agenda?” Nothing was spelt out in the letter he received, Mishra said. Commenting on the chief minister’s contention that he would prove his majority in the house, he said , ‘”Why? Who has demanded it?”He added: “After all the session has to be summoned as per the rules of the house. A 21-day notice is needed. The agenda has to be spelt out.”Raj Bhavan subsequently issued a statement reiterating many of these points -- that the cabinet note did not mention a date or an agenda; that it did not have formal cabinet approval; and that a 21-day notice is needed to call a session. The statement also asked for clarity on details of the cases in the Supreme Court and the Rajasthan high court “pertaining to some MLAs”, and information on how the session will be held in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. The statement directed the state government to “ensure the freedom and free movement to and from the assembly of MLAs” , perhaps a reference to most of them being lodged in hotels. Finally, it asked: “If the government indeed has a majority, what is the need to call a session to prove that majority?”(with Sachin Saini in Jaipur)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/politics-of-pressure-will-not-work-says-governor/story-pAjgrz64glodVqvJ3ZaE9K.html

He said the people of Rajasthan will gherao the Raj Bhawan and then don’t blame us for it. I feel such words don’t behove a person who repeatedly swears by democracy and calls himself a Gandhian. Any Constitutional position carries with it a responsibility, which these people should uphold,” he said.Gehlot has accused Governor Kalraj Mishra of acting under pressure for not convening the assembly session, despite his repeated requests and demanded that it be convened from Monday.Gehlot said his government should not be held responsible, if the public gherao the Raj Bhavan.The Congress has accused the Union minister of conspiring to topple the government after purported audio tapes - in which he was allegedly heard talking to the party’s MLAs - surfaced on social media. Shekhawat, however, has denied his involvement.“There is a political conspiracy where many things including false audio tapes have been used. Who are the people behind it and why they did it will become clear in coming days...I think it is a reflection of the infighting on his side. When we used to talk of it, they would refute it.

25-07-2020||India||Trade curbs signal decoupling from China||India’s order on Thursday, restricting purchases for large public projects (and even those being developed as public-private partnerships) from companies in countries that share a land border with it, citing national security concerns, is aimed at China, and, according to three government officials familiar with the thinking behind the order, will also deter private firms here from dealing with Chinese companies. This is a well thought-out move that will also deter all state-run banks and financial institutions from funding any public sector or private sector projects with direct or indirect connections with China, the officials added. “Thursday’s decision is certainly a retaliatory actions against Chinese aggression with wide-ranging impact. Even Indian states will stop procuring Chinese goods and services,” one of the officials said. The order is the latest in a series of moves aimed at reducing the penetration of Chinese commercial interests in India. Also Read: India builds a huge wall to stop Chinese firms from getting govt contractsIn April, India removed Chinese investments from the so-called automatic approval route fearing takeover of Indian firms at a time when the country was fighting Covid-19. The country also reacted to Chinese aggression in Eastern Ladakh in June in which 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese soldiers were killed. On June 29, the government announced ban on 59 mostly Chinese mobile applications, citing concerns that these are “prejudicial to sovereignty of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.” State-run BSNL was asked to keep Chinese suppliers out of its 4G upgrade project and it is likely that Chinese company Huawei, which has already been proscribed by some western nations who fear the data security of their citizens may be compromised. Also Read: US agrees to discuss social security tax burden of Indians working in AmericaThursday’s order will also bar, direct or indirect Chinese participation in strategic sectors such as power, petroleum, coal and telecom, the first official said. “In fact, some public sector companies are even contemplating taking legal opinion, how to scrap tenders already awarded to Chinese firms,” he added. Already the work at ~13,277 crore Talcher fertiliser and coal gasification project, which was awarded to Chinese firm Wuhuan Engineering Co Ltd last year, has been halted. HT reported this on July 7.Without directly naming China, India has also been raising its issues with the country at various forums. At the BRICS trade ministers’ meeting, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal called upon the members to build “trust” to prevent losing their role of pre-eminent trade partner, a message that was meant for China, the second official , who works for an economic ministry, said. “Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa are BRICS members and barring China, the issue of trust-deficit does not arise with any other members,” he added.Also Read: India imposes levy on all imported measuring tapes as Chinese dumping continues via third countriesThe first official said the Union government is cautious and plans to discourage states from using Chinese equipment and technology in the strategic power sector projects. It may even direct state-run financial institutions focused on the sector, Power Finance Corporation Ltd (PFC), Rural Electrification Corporation Ltd (REC) and Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA), to withhold financing to such projects that are based on Chinese technology or equipment, he added. Another major blow to Chinese companies would be their exclusion from implementing the government’s ambitious world’s largest smart metering project on security grounds, he added.A third official, who works in another economic ministry said, the government is considering duty protection against Chinese imports. There is a proposal to impose a basic customs duty (BCD) on all imported solar cells, modules, inverters and their components. HT reported on May 11 that India could also extend anti-dumping duties and safeguards on at least two dozen Chinese goods amidst concerns that a flood of imports would kill domestic manufacturers .

Anupam Manur, assistant professor at the think tank Takshashila Institution, said, “The banning of apps and stopping of procurement from China is merely signals of intent and posturing, but when these are not accompanied by actions and show of power, such as a counter-offensive somewhere along the border or building our maritime power in the Indian Ocean and South China Sea, these signals will lose credibility. The reality is that Beijing cannot be deterred without the use of hard power.”Samir Kanabar, tax partner at consultancy firms EY India said, “One would have to evaluate if the Order will delay the bidding process resulting into delay of large infrastructure projects.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trade-curbs-signal-decoupling-from-china/story-vvrtbK7P9JbLxgsJs7FAbI.html
25-07-2020||India||‘Americans can’t tell us what to do on Chabahar’: India envoy||India has told the US that it “cannot tell us what to do” regarding the development of Chabahar port in Iran, India’s ambassador to Tehran, Gaddam Dharmendra, has said.New Delhi is working to develop the port and heavy equipment has been ordered for the facility from countries such as Italy, Finland, Germany and China, Dharmendra was quoted as saying in an interview with Tehran Times.The envoy referred to “pressures” and said India is the only country which continues to “have a rupee-rial trade arrangement where we are financing bilateral trade between our countries”.“The fact [is] that we are working in Chabahar, we are buying equipment for Chabahar, we are preparing for Chabahar, we have told the Americans they cannot tell us what to do on Chabahar,” he said.The interview by Tehran Times was done on July 14, though a video with Dharmendra’s remarks emerged only on Friday.Chabahar port is being developed under a tripartite agreement signed by India, Afghanistan and Iran and has been granted a waiver from US sanctions. It was recently in the news when some reports suggested Iran had excluded India from a project to develop a rail link between Chabahar port and Zahedan on the border with Afghanistan.The external affairs ministry said last week that technical and financial issues yet to be finalised by Iran were holding up New Delhi’s participation in the railway project. Saeed Rasouli, the deputy minister for roads and head of Iran Railways, invited the Indian envoy for a meeting on July 20 to review cooperation on the Chabahar-Zahedan rail link. Rasouli said during the meeting that “vested interests were behind recent reports that Iran [had] excluded India” from the project.Dharmendra also told Tehran Times that between December 2018 and December 2019, Chabahar port had handled 6,000 tonnes of containers and more than a million tonnes of bulk cargo, including rice, sugar and wheat meant for Iran and Afghanistan.“Within one year, traffic has increased hugely, but it’s a new port, it takes time to develop,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/americans-can-t-tell-us-what-to-do-on-chabahar-india-envoy/story-1wSnyO71OMfESKYbrc5IHM.html
25-07-2020||India||We want House session from Monday, says CM||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday demanded that a special session of the assembly be convened from Monday even as he alleged that governor Kalraj Mishra was not issuing an order to that effect because he was under pressure.“We hoped that the governor would issue an order to call the assembly session yesterday (Thursday) night itself. I waited overnight but still there is no reply from his side. The governor has to give orders. There is no reason for him to stop,” Gehlot said outside Fairmont Hotel on the outskirts of Jaipur where the legislators supporting him are camping.Gehlot said the governor was requested, through a letter on Thursday evening after a cabinet meeting, to call an assembly session to hold discussions on the political situation, review the coronavirus situation and its impact on the state’s economy.Before heading for Raj Bhavan, Gehlot said if the demand for convening a session was not met, MLAs will “not be responsible” if the people gherao the governor’s house. “We have to convince him so that he calls assembly session,” Gehlot said outside Raj Bhavan, again pointing to what called pressure on the governor from “higher-ups”.The MLAs supporting him, who arrived at Raj Bhavan in four buses around 2:30pm, later staged a five-hour sit-in there. They shouted slogans and said they will stay put till the governor issued an order for the session. “Insaaf hamara nara hai (our slogan is justice); Gehlot ji tum sangharsh karo, hum tumhare saath hai (Ashok Gehlot, we are with you in your struggle),” they shouted.The protest was called off after Congress leaders said they got assurances from the governor that he will call a session though he asked the government for clarifications on a few issues.Alleging that there was a clear “conspiracy” by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to topple Gehlot’s government, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the governor must convene an assembly session. “The country is ruled by Constitution and law. The governments are made and run by the mandate of the people,” the former Congress chief said in a tweet. “The BJP conspiracy to topple the Rajasthan government is clear. This is an insult to the eight crore people of Rajasthan.”The BJP, however, has repeatedly rejected the Congress’s allegations linking it to the Rajasthan crisis, saying whatever is going on in the state is the result of infighting between Gehlot and former deputy CM Pilot. In the afternoon, after Gehlot met the governor again — their second meeting in 24 hours — he asked the lawmakers backing him to continue with their protest in a peaceful manner. “It has never happened in the history of the country that the governor has not given the approval to call an assembly session. The governor is bound by the decisions of the cabinet,” Gehlot said.Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyas, a Gehlot supporter, said the government has the support of 109 MLAs. “We have the mandate and we won’t allow death of democracy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-want-house-session-from-monday-says-cm/story-nVCQirkKU7gIOIQVoGZxtK.html
25-07-2020||India||Moderate rain predicted in Delhi from July 26 to 29||There was light rain in parts of Delhi on Friday, and the weekend is likely to see similar conditions with patchy clouds in the sky, weather officials said while separately issuing an intense rain warning for north and northeast India from the beginning of next week, which could compound the problem of flooding in the regions.The capital is likely to receive moderate rain in this period that is predicted to last from July 26-29. The predictions came on a day when images released by the United States space agency Nasa showed many areas in India detected total rain of over 100 cm (40 inches) from June 1 to July 20, with Assam — one of the regions hit hardest by flooding — recorded precipitation about 20% higher than normal. The difference in how monsoon rains are taking place across the country has to do with the location of where the trough of the system is – a line of lower pressure area which triggers precipitation.“Light rain on Friday was mainly due to a cyclonic circulation over southwest Uttar Pradesh. Palam has recorded about 4.4 mm rain while other stations in south Delhi have also recorded rain. The monsoon trough is presently to the south of Delhi. It is running across south Bikaner, Gwalior, Varanasi, Patna, Bolpur and Haldia in West Bengal. A western disturbance which is over Afghanistan now will affect the north-western region from July 26,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.This will likely lead to a spell of extremely heavy rains over northeast and north India next week, a second official added.“The western end of the monsoon trough is moving south and the eastern end of the monsoon is likely to move northwards again towards Himalayan foothills. It will be the fourth time it is moving to the hills and may accentuate flooding there,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.A cyclonic circulation is lying over Jharkhand while another cyclonic circulation is lying over southwest Uttar Pradesh and neighbouring areas. These systems are very likely to merge by July 25 and get less marked. A western disturbance as a cyclonic circulation is also lying over western parts of Afghanistan and neighbourhood.Under the influence of these meteorological conditions, widespread and very heavy rains are likely over northeast and east India (Bihar, Sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim) during the next 3 days, IMD said in its Friday bulletin.Very heavy rains are likely over Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar July and over Punjab & Haryana from July 26 to July 28. The intensity and distribution of rain is likely to increase over Sub-Himalyan West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh with extremely heavy rain (over 20 cm) likely in many places between July 26 and 29.IMD in its long range forecast issued on June 1 had forecast that northwest India is expected to receive excess monsoon rain at 107% of the long period average; Central India is likely to get 103% of LPA while south peninsula and northeast India area likely to receive 102% and 96% of LPA respectively with a model error of 8% (+/-).But until July 24, northwest India has a deficiency of -17% and northeast India has a surplus of 16%, contrary to prediction.IMD scientists said these trends could overturn in the next couple of monsoon months. But the main reason for this deviation from what was forecast is an unusually calm Bay of Bengal. At least 4 to 6 low pressure systems form over Bay of Bengal normally, bringing rain during monsoon months over the core monsoon region — mainly central India. But this year, there was only one system from June 1.As on July 23, 36 stations (20 in Bihar, 11 in Assam, 4 in Uttar Pradesh and 1 in West Bengal) are flowing in Severe Flood Situation including Brahmaputra; Gandak and Ghaghra. Severe flood is declared when water level is touching or exceeding the danger level but below highest flood level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/moderate-rain-predicted-in-capital-from-july-26-to-29/story-n901pF4tHylLEMmUAB70aN.html
25-07-2020||India||AIIMS administers first dose of Covid-19 vaccine as trial begins||The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi administered its first dose of Bharat Biotech’s vaccine candidate against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) – Covaxin, as part of its combined phase 1 and 2 trials for the drug, to a 30-year-old healthy man on Friday.Two other of the 12 trial centres for the vaccine, in Patna and Rohtak, have already administered the vaccine in humans.“The vaccine candidate was administered to the first trial participant — a healthy 30-year-old man — around noon on Friday. He was monitored for two hours to check for any adverse reactions. All trial participants will be monitored every day for the first seven days. They will then be followed-up on day 14 and day 28. They will be tracked for up to a year to observe any long-term impacts,” said Dr Puneet Misra, one of the investigators of the trial and a professor of community medicine at AIIMS.The centre has received nearly 3,500 applications for the trials so far, and 100 healthy participants will be enrolled from among them. Participants have to be between the ages of 18 and 55 years, and have no comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension, heart or kidney disease.The centres are conducting simultaneous phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials to study the safety and immunogenicity of different doses and adjuvant combinations of the vaccine developed by the biotechnology company, in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research’s National Institute of Virology. An adjuvant is a compound that helps increase the effectiveness of a vaccine.“Our priority is safety and hence we need healthy participants. Those who are called in for the trial have to undergo a battery of tests to determine their general health. They are tested for a current infection using RT-PCR test and for past infections using an antibody test. Participants are given the vaccine only if they are free of Covid-19. For now, we are also selecting participants only from Delhi and the National Capital Region for the ease of follow-ups,” said Dr Misra.The vaccine is currently being administered in two doses — 0.3 and 0.5 microgram. In the 0.5 microgram dosage, the vaccine is being given with two different adjuvants. Of the 100 who will be enrolled, 80 will get different dosages and combination of the vaccine, and 20 participants will receive placebos.Dr Randeep Guleria, director of AIIMS Delhi had earlier this week said, “Normally, a vaccine takes about 10 years to develop. That is because the different phases of the trial are conducted one after the other, after evaluation of the results. It is a financial risk if everything is done simultaneously as all vaccine candidates do not work and scientists might have to go back to the drawing board. But, in this case, everything is happening simultaneously. Even as the effectiveness of the vaccine is being studied, manufacturing capacity is also being built.”Dr Jugal Kishore from the department of community medicine at Safdarjung said, “We have to look at who gets these vaccines. It should be given to those at a higher risk of developing a severe disease like the old, those with comorbidities or the immunocompromised.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiims-administers-first-dose-of-covid-vaccine-as-trial-begins/story-JwvAchiEAwcX61CHzi3dEL.html
25-07-2020||India||India’s daily Covid-19 cases now second only to the United States||India’s trajectory of daily cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has now overtaken Brazil’s and stands second only to that of the United States, indicating that India may be beginning to close the gap on the South American country.In the seven-day period between July 16 and July 22, India reported 269,969 new Covid-19 cases against Brazil’s 260,962 —the second and third most daily cases in the world. This is the first time the weekly cases in India have eclipsed those in Brazil. In the seven days before that, India reported 200,159 new infections while Brazil reported 254,713, according to HT’s dashboard and Worldometers.The United States continues to report the highest number of new cases with nearly half a million new cases (478,899) coming in the past week.Also Read: ‘Treat SARI patients as potential Covid-19 cases’: ExpertsTo be sure, Brazil, with 2,231,871 cases of Covid-19 against India’s 1,238,374 (both as of Wednesday night) has nearly a million more cases than India, so India may not be overtaking Brazil in total cases any time soon. The US, meanwhile, has more cases than Brazil and India combined — 4,100,875 as of Wednesday.Together, these three countries continue to account for a large majority of new cases. In the last week, the three worst-hit nations are responsible for more than 1 million (60%) of the 1.6 million new cases reported across the world.Also Read: 4 months of Maharashtra lockdown: Economy needs a boost, say expertsDifference in trajectory America’s journey to becoming the worst-hit country in the world has been on the back on two massive case spikes. The first was centered in the country’s north-east with states such as New York, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania reporting high cases. This plateaued in about a month with new cases dropping through May and June. Towards the end of June, a bigger second spike was reported in new epicentres in states such California, Texas and Florida, pushing new cases to record highs again.In Brazil, the first case in the country reported on February 25, and cases started rising almost immediately in the country’s north and north-east. By early May, Brazil had more than 100,000 cases; with the number of cases doubling every 10 days. In June itself, the country reported nearly a million new Covid cases. However, cases appear to have hit a plateau in the past two week, averaging around 35,000 new cases every day, against nearly 39,000 in the first week of July.Also Read: Covid-19: What you need to know todayUnlike the other two nations, the caseload in India has grown gradually and has not had any abrupt spike. However, this may not entirely be good news because it also means that the country has not seen any plateau. While the new case trend lines for the first two countries are uneven, India’s has been steadily growing while showing no drop in cases so far. With almost all states (except Delhi) reporting record high cases over the past two weeks, this trajectory is not yet exhibiting signs of slowing down.But there are other similarities between the three countries as well — perhaps explaining the extended trajectory of the pandemic in them. The US is the world’s third largest country by geographical area, Brazil fifth, and India seventh. As the infection wanes in one part of the country, it waxes in another. In terms of population, India is the second most populous country in the world, the US third, and Brazil sixth. Expectedly, per capita infection and death numbers are low for all three countries compared to smaller and less populous nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-now-logging-more-daily-cases-than-brazil-us-ahead/story-xIMNrcWUJdfOE3sgW3WHKP.html
