The Covid-19 pandemic, economic recession and climate crisis are compounded by the lack of political and moral leadership. What would Mahatma Gandhi do had he been faced with this crisis?This thought experiment yields a nine-point action programme. One, far deadlier than the virus is the fear pandemic that has paralysed the world. Gandhi would ask us to first shed this fear, as he asked the Indians to shed the fear of the British. Two, caring for the sick was his natural instinct. People with Covid-19 need physical care and nursing. Gandhi would have nursed them. He would be fastidious about hygiene and mask usage. Gandhi’s emphasis on a healthy lifestyle, empowerment for self-care, and care in the community would make perfect sense.Three, Gandhi gave us his famous talisman to guide us to our duty towards “the most helpless and wretched human being that you ever saw”. The displaced urban migrant workers, hungry and humiliated, would unquestionably be his talisman. Gandhi would rush to them. He would help preserve their dignity and hope and join the walking bands of migrants as a symbol of unity and protest against the government’s apathy and irresponsibility. That would be his New Dandi march.Four, communal unity was the last but incomplete cause of Gandhi’s life. When the virus had arrived, some leaders were busy stoking communal hatred. Uniting against communal divisions would be Gandhi’s foremost cause, even risking assassination. He would try to unite people of all religions and castes and send them as volunteers to serve in each other’s areas.Five, the fear of infection and strict lockdown has forced people to shut their doors and shun social contact. Gandhi would question — how can there be neighbourhood and community without contact? I suspect Gandhi would go to the extent of launching a satyagraha by challenging the ghettos created by the lockdown. When the veil is suddenly removed, one sees clearly the depth of alienation the pandemic and fear has led to. It has made everybody “an untouchable”.Six, faced with Covid-19, the global and national leadership have committed blunders and changed the goalposts. Armed with little knowledge about it, judgement errors are natural, but where is the honest admission of failure? Gandhi would admit to his errors. And, surprisingly, that would make people trust him even more.Seven, in the past 12 years, we have seen that a globalised economy crumbles in the face of faraway tremors such as the financial crisis in the United States or the emergence of a new virus. Gandhi would remind us of the stability of local production and local consumption (gram swaraj). Eight, consumers will ask, “What about our needs?’ Gandhi would explain that this unlimited desire to consume is not a need. If we limit our greed, we can happily live without several excesses of modern society. Nine, Gandhi’s final piece of advice to us would be to pray. At the end of each day, sit quietly, reflect, and submit yourself to god, to life, to nature, to truth, to history. You have done all you could have. Now do not continue to carry the burden on your back. Realise the limits of your efforts in this infinite cosmos. Submit and say: “Thy will be done”. “Inshallah”. “Hey Ram”. We should not be waiting for Gandhi. We should be acting on what he would have done.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/faced-with-today-s-crises-what-would-gandhi-do/story-qTTc8zzWvKP3Yi1HJAFsBO.html

04-07-2020||City||Fadnavis alleges state’s priorities are misplaced||The Opposition leader of the state and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has come down hard on the state government for sanctioning purchase of vehicles for ministers at a time when the state is reeling under a financial crunch due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Speaking to the media, following his review of the Covid status in Panvel and Navi Mumbai, Fadnavis said, “Vehicles are not a priority and their purchase can be put on hold now. It is not as if there are no vehicles in Mantralaya. If someone does not have a vehicle then private vehicles can be used. The purchases can be done once the situation normalises. I don’t understand what the government’s priority is.”He added that salaries are not being paid and are being deferred. The salaries of even health workers are being deferred. The policemen who are working 24/7 are not getting the required support. “And yet decisions like the purchase of vehicles and other unnecessary works are being undertaken by the government. In the present circumstances, the chief minister and the deputy chief minister, who is also the finance minister, should take stern measures and policy decisions,” Fadnavis added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fadnavis-alleges-state-s-priorities-are-misplaced/story-tBf5FARpgHMlOzgqB299jM.html

04-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram looks at setting up plasma bank||After Delhi, Gurugram too may have its own plasma bank to treat critical patients suffering from Covid-19.Plans are afoot with the district administration creating a database of more than 4,000 patients who have recovered from the disease and are willing to donate plasma, said health department officials.Convalescent plasma therapy, in which antibody-rich plasma from recovered patients is injected into recovering individuals to help them stave off infection, has previously been used during the Sars and Mers outbreaks (which were also caused by viruses in the same family as the coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19).Plasma is a major component of a person’s blood, making up almost 55% of it. A plasmapheresis machine separates it from the blood and returns the rest -- the red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets -- back into to the donor who typically supplies 300-500 ml of plasma, and the transfusion process takes between 60-90 minutes. Although promising, the effectiveness of the treatment is still in the experimental stage.However, with many cured patients reluctant to return to hospital and families of patients finding it hard to locate plasma donors, Delhi had earlier this week instituted the country’s first plasma bank at a hospital.Starting a plasma bank, however, requires a series of approvals from the state government and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for which senior doctors from the state’s Covid-19 nodal hospital - Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) Rohtak – are likely to visit the city next week. Currently, Gurugram has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the state, which is likely to breach 6000 mark soon. Nearly 4496 patients have recovered till now, and 140 patients are critical. The decision to set up a bank in Gurugram has come at a time when the Haryana health minister Anil Vij on June 30 said that plasma therapy will be started in five medical colleges of the state – Rohtak, Bhiwani, Jhajjar, Sonepat and Nuh Shubhi Kesarwani, officer in-charge for the project, said, “Our teams in coordination with the Red Cross Society are following up with the recovered patients and maintaining data base. Till now, 500 patients treated for the coronavirus in the city have been approached, out of which 50 are ready to donate their blood for plasma therapy.”Officials are also studying the details of Delhi’s plasma bank at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS), Vasant Kunj. “The proposal is in the initial stages, as we are in talks with doctors at PGIMS Rohtak where convalescent plasma trial has recently started,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, who is coordinating with Rohtak team. “It is not an easy process. Before anything starts, we need to have facilities where we could check antibodies in the blood that can be transfused. For this we will be sending our plan to the state government for approval.”Dr Dhruv Chaudhary of PGIMS- Rohtak, who is also the state’s nodal officer Covid-19 tertiary care, said that the proposal from the administration and the health department has been received. “Since the convalescent plasma therapy has already started in PGIMS Rohtak, we would be able to help Gurugram health team in setting up the plasma bank,” he said, adding that the plasma treatment costs ₹9,000 in their government set up.Currently, Dr Chaudhary and his team has initiated the ICMR’s clinical trial ‘A Phase II, Open Label, Randomised Controlled Trial to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of Convalescent Plasma to limit Covid-19 Associated Complications in Moderate Disease” called as the PLACID trial, in PGIMS Rohtak. Besides Rohtak, a private hospital in Gurugram is also conducting plasma therapy. Explaining the necessity of having apt facility for antibody testing to start a blood bank, Dr Chaudhary said, “The concentration of antibody in the blood plasma has to be checked before it is transfused in a patient. In this process, the blood taken from the recovered patients is diluted repeatedly. The concentration of the plasma is diluted in ratio like 1:60, 1:80 and 1:320 just to check till what level of dilution the sample will come out as positive. The highly diluted samples which turns to be positive, are the ones with high antibody levels.”“To check its effect, neutralizing antibody test is being done. It is only after the technical process, the plasma is transfused in the Covid-19 patient for recovery,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-looks-at-setting-up-plasma-bank/story-9MGbQgQnXynwndCPQs7h1I.html
04-07-2020||Mumbai||Heavy rainfall on Saturday leads to waterlogging two days in a row||Waterlogging was reported in several low-lying areas on Saturday, including Hindmata, Dadar, King’s Circle, Matunga, Milan subway, Dahisar subway, Gorai, Kandivli and Andheri subway. On Saturday, a high tide of 4.63 metres was recorded at around 12.23pm, which coincided with heavy rain in the western and eastern suburbs. However, waterlogging was reported only after 4pm. According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), waterlogging was reported from 10 major spots, including Hindmata, Dadar terminus, Dharavi junction, Matunga, Wadala, Byculla, Chembur, Andheri subway and near National College in Bandra (West). This was the fourth time waterlogging was reported in the city in the past month. Following reports of waterlogging on Friday, BMC had said the flooding was not caused by blockage in drains, but because high tide and heavy rain had coincided. Activist Abhijit Joshi, a Matunga resident, said, “On Saturday the high tide was at around noon, but waterlogging started between 4pm and 5pm. If the cleaning of gutters was done why was there waterlogging on Saturday?”Sanjay Darade, deputy municipal commissioner of stormwater drainage, BMC, said, “There was a high tide in the afternoon followed by heavy rainfall, and hence the water took time to drain. But our staff was on the spot wherever waterlogging was reported.”Mumbai traffic police said waterlogging was reported across the city, including near JJ flyover, Pydhonie, at multiple locations in Kurla, LBS Road, Mahalaxmi temple, Nagpada, and Dockyard station. Traffic had to be diverted near Khar Masjid on SV Road, King’s Circle, Andheri subway and in Mazgaon.On Saturday, four house and wall collapses were reported in the city along with approximately 32 trees falling. Nine incidents of tree fall were in south Mumbai; three in eastern suburbs; and 20 in western suburbs. Ten complaints of short circuit were also reported. No injuries were reported from any of these incidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/heavy-rainfall-on-saturday-leads-to-waterlogging-two-days-in-a-row/story-5pMXVSSYDQ8uIlqAE43V3M.html
04-07-2020||City||Gurugram: GMDA begins pre-construction work for 3 STPs||Gurugram: The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has received the state government’s nod to build three more sewage treatment plants in the city, – at Bajghera, Dhankot and Jahajgarh – officials in the Authority’s infrastructure department said Saturday. However, due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown imposed to curb its spread, execution of the projects will take at least another year-and-a-half, they clarified.“The STPs of Bajghera and Dhankot have been in the pipeline for some time. As the lockdown has eased, we have opened tenders for them. Both areas are currently disposing of the bulk of their sewage untreated into the city’s drainage system. The chief minister gave his nod for the projects and we are already carrying out technical evaluation for both STPs,” said Pradeep Kumar, chief engineer, GMDA. In addition, the GMDA and the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) together are setting up a 20 million liters per day (MLD) sewage treatment plant in Jahajgarh. “The corporation and the GMDA were building two separate 10MLD plants nearby, but there has been a land acquisition issue with the GMDA’s proposed STP in Sector 107. It has been decided now to split the costs and create one 20MLD capacity STP at the civic body’s location in Jahajgarh, which we will oversee,” Kumar said. A tender for this project has been floated, and pre-bid meetings with potential vendors have been conducted, he added.MCG QUOTEWhile the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had earlier directed the district administration to complete all capacity building (for treatment of sewage) by December 2020, Kumar explained that the deadline is no longer feasible. “We had already asked for an extension of the deadline prior to the lockdown. We will make another appeal to the NGT to allow till at least December 2021. The past three months have been a huge setback, and even though we are trying to make up for lost time, our contractors themselves are unable to find the required work force,” Kumar also said.The GMDA currently treats 388MLD of water every day at its STPs at Dhanwapur and Behrampur, of which it uses roughly 25MLD of recycled water in green belts and discharges the remaining into the Najafgarh drain. Besides that, the city discharges roughly 80 to 90MLD of untreated water to drains and in open areas leading to Najafgarh drain from unauthorised colonies, many villages and other areas. “With these three upcoming STPs, the GMDA will be able to treat about 410MLD of sewage per day. “That should bring us in compliance with the NGT’s instructions,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-gmda-begins-pre-construction-work-for-3-stps/story-VuhHCkldW5MwB9NvzbzNwL.html

04-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Over 1,000 properties identified to turn into Covid isolation centres if cases surge||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has identified at least 1,360 properties, which include banquet halls, clubs, hotels, guest houses, paying guest accommodations, hostels and religious institutions as potential sites for establishing isolation centres, officials said Saturday.On June 17, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had directed officials in Gurugram to identify potential sites that can be used as isolation centres if cases of coronavirus (Covid-19) disease surge and number of hospital beds fall short.In this regard, the MCG had held a meeting with officials of the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) on Monday and the district education department at its Sector 34 office to identify large-scale properties across the city that can be used for setting up isolation centres.Subsequently, officials of the MCG’s tax department were tasked with identifying such properties. Based on its property tax data from March 31, a copy of which is with Hindustan Times, the MCG has identified 64 banquet halls, 57 clubs, 174 hotels, 321 stand-alone hostels, PGs, guest houses, and 744 religious and charitable institutions in the city. The list also includes 5,055 institutional properties such as schools, universities, and government buildings.“Aside from the 1,360 properties, we are also estimating that the city has more than 2,000 colleges and schools that can also be used for isolation purposes. However, we are working towards figuring out the exact number. We realised that logistically, we cannot approach owners of all such buildings individually. Hence, we will be using the assistance of resident welfare associations (RWA) to help identify properties that aren’t located in congested, narrow lanes, are based at secluded spots and can accommodate at least 25-30 beds,” said an official privy to the matter, requesting anonymity.The official further said that once identified, both the RWA and the MCG will approach owners of such establishments to lease their properties for setting up isolation centres.Surender Singh, MCG additional commissioner, said that of the 174 hotels, 93 have been identified for setting up isolation centres.“We will be setting up isolation centres in two stages. In the first stage, we will be offering isolation in hotels only. In the eventuality that cases tally surges further and hotels also run short on beds, only then we will activate the second stage which includes PGs, guest houses, hostels, schools, colleges, and religious institutions as isolation centres. We have essentially taken pre-emptive measures by creating a database of places that can be quickly turned into isolation centres to ensure the city does not encounter shortage of beds,” said Singh.Singh said that he has held meetings with a large number of PG, guest houses, schools, colleges, and religious institution owners, who came forward for the initiative this week. He said that he has asked them to submit a seven-point checklist in this regard.“We have asked them to give details such as the total number of beds that can be accommodated in their building, types of entry and exit, whether they have toilets, water connection, electricity connection, among other such issues to create a database for the future,” said Singh.He added that he has directed the zonal taxation officers (ZTOs) to approach banquet hall owners and also present them with the seven-point checklist. In addition, he also said that the MCG has created a helpline number-1950-from where Covid-19 patients can seek details on isolation facilities.Last month, Vivek Kalia, nodal officer, hospital and ventilator management, had projected that if the number of Covid-19 cases in the city reaches one lakh in August, Gurugram would require at least 37,000 beds and more than 2,000 ventilators.On June 15, Sonal Goel, the nodal officer for facilities and bed management in hospitals, at a meeting with Haryana government officials had said that the city currently has a total of 4,314 beds and 329 ventilators.The MCG has also tied-up with RWAs for setting up home isolation centres within their plotted colonies, societies, and condominiums. Until June 26, 19 RWAs had set up such a facility in their respective areas.Aside from this, in assistance with local RWAs, the MCG is also in the process of establishing a 75-bed isolation facility at a community centre in sector 27 that can accommodate Covid-19 patients that need oxygen support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-over-1-000-properties-identified-to-turn-into-covid-isolation-centres-if-cases-surge/story-zx5ATA1pSpNGsh3K5ngqWK.html

The village comes under the Kasna police jurisdiction.The action comes hours after the house of Vikas Dubey in Kanpur, who is allegedly responsible for the brutal killing of eight UP police personnel on early Friday morning, was razed.The police said that Bhati, who is currently serving time in Hamirpur jail, had gradually constructed a structure on the land that he had acquired through fraudulent means.“He is booked under the gangsters act. According to provision 14a of the act, any property of his that has been acquired illegally can be attached. It was during this process that we came across the property in Ghangrola. The building was demolished on Saturday evening as it was an illegal structure constructed on government pond land,” said Prabhat Upadhyay, station house officer, Kasna police station.The land is spread across about 700 square metres and is valued around Rs 36 lakh, said the police, adding that following the demolition, locals gathered around the site after which police force was deployed in the area.A senior police official said that there are several more such illegally obtained properties of the gangster scattered across the Gautam Budh Nagar district and action will be taken to attach them all in the coming days.

04-07-2020||City||Noida: Month later, malls as empty as first week of reopening||Noida: Even though a month has passed since they were allowed to reopen, the shopping malls of Noida bear a deserted look. As a result, shopkeepers say they are facing heavy losses and hope for some rebate in the rents to sustain.While some malls such as DLF Mall of India at Sector 18, one of the largest in the city, is yet to open, several shops are still closed in those which are open food courts in some are non-functional. Officials of many malls say that while footfall is slightly better since the first week of reopening, people are still largely keeping away due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Managers said even on weekends, when malls used to be packed with shoppers in pre-Covid days, the footfall now is barely a sliver.“There is hardly any business, despite it being a weekend. Earlier, our stall used to make a minimum sale of Rs 40,000 on weekends while on weekdays it used to be between Rs 15,000 and Rs 20,000. Compared to that, at Rs 1,400 so far, my sale today has been abysmal. Only a few dedicated customers are coming and they don’t even try the products. People are scared,” Ritu, who manages a cosmetic stall at the Great India Place Mall at Sector 18, said Saturday.A bookstore owner at the same mall said that re-opening the shop felt like starting from scratch, with hardly any sale.“The sale is less than 80% of what it used to be. It almost feels like we will have to start from scratch. The shop owners have decided to form an association to request the mall management to give us some rebate in rent,” said Peeyush, a bookstore owner at Mall of India.Commercial establishments such as malls, hotels and restaurants in the city were allowed to reopen from June 8.“The footfall has increased and almost 70% of our shops are now open and sales have also increased but this is of course nothing compared to pre-Covid times. Like earlier, if we had about 45,000 to 50,000 visitors during the weekend, the maximum footfall after re-opening is around 4,500,” said a mall manager at Gaur City mall, Greater Noida west, asking not to be identified.While the number of visitors is less, an HT visit revealed that malls were taking necessary measures as directed by the state government, including sanitisation, no-mask no-entry system and thermal screening before entering, among others.Managers say that while they have made all the necessary arrangements in place to make the dining experience at the food-court safe, only a few outlets have opened up.“The footfall has increased a little but the numbers are still a long shot from their pre-Covid average. I guess it will still take a few more months to get there. There are few outlets in the food court which have opened now. There is also an issue with the timing, as we have to start closing the mall by 7.30pm to meet the curfew timings, which is the peak hour for mall visitors,” said Angad Makan, head, Logix city centre mall.Since the visitor’s influx was low, social distancing was not an issue, many managers added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-month-later-malls-as-empty-as-first-week-of-reopening/story-53FGYon7O2yWPLHgOAeWnO.html

Out of 163 inmates and 17 staff, 13 inmates have been found Covid-19 positive. For those who have tested negative, we are trying to get their samples tested through lab-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),” DM said.Suhas further said that chief development officer Anil Kumar Singh, along with district panchayati raj officer and health workers, visited the observation home on Saturday. “Each inmate has been given two masks and a bottle of hand sanitizer. We have also asked the health officials to sanitize the whole premises,” he said.Dharmendra Maurya, caretaker of the observation home, said that seven of the infected inmates were new to the correction centre and had been serving the two-week mandatory isolation in two separate rooms on the campus. “It appears that the infection has spread due to the use of common toilets. We are now taking special care of remaining inmates as they are now being served lukewarm water and tea. As a precautionary step, we have removed water coolers from the common area,” Maurya said.Meanwhile, district probation officer Atul Kumar Soni, who is the official in-charge of the observation home, claimed that out of 13 inmates who had tested positive on Thursday, eight have been declared negative through RT-PCR test. “As the rapid antigen testing is not much credible, we conducted their RT-PCR tests. Eight have been found negative, while the reports of remaining five are still awaited,” he said.However, contradicting Soni’s claims, district chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri said that if a person tests positive on rapid antigen kit, there is no scope to cross-examine it. “We conduct RT-PCR test for only the person who has tested negative through rapid antigen test,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/13-inmates-test-covid-19-positive-at-juvenile-home-in-gautam-budh-nagar/story-N57vueHO21q7USi8IMSG9J.html
04-07-2020||City||Gautam Budh Nagar district received 260,000 distress calls since Lockdown 1.0||Noida The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration has urged residents to use the Covid-19 helpline as much as possible in case of any pandemic-related emergency, and said that over 260,000 calls were received through different helplines since the first phase of lockdown was announced in March.Officials said that at least 400 calls are received daily on the 24-hour Covid-19 helpline number – 1800 419 2211 – at its integrated control room which was launched on April 4.“Till Thursday, at least 260,000 calls were received through different helplines and the numbers are gradually increasing. A team of 20 to 50 staff work at the integrated call centre alone, depending upon the call flow. With increasing number of queries, we are looking forward to increasing the strength of staff handling the helpline,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, GB Nagar. The complaints through the helpline are received by the staff from district administration, police, health department and other local authorities.“Apart from focusing more on the sampling and strengthening out isolation facilities, we are also trying to keep the residents informed and we urge them to reach out to us to avoid any confusion or to seek any help related to the Covid-19,” the district magistrate said.He said that with time the nature of calls have changed. “Earlier, most of the calls were related to the food and ration, which were being distributed through community kitchens. Now, they are about the health related issues. Many people enquire about the symptoms related to Covid-19, and want to get tested,” Suhas added.The officials said that there are different parallel helplines in the city which are being used since the lockdown was announced on March 25. “There is a separate helpline for chief medical officer. Then there is one announced by the police. Besides, each development authority has its own helpline. The latest in the series is the integrated helpline that has been working round the clock,” said Rakesh Chauhan, district information officer, while explaining the large number of calls. The district has so far recorded 2,569 positive cases, the highest for any district in the state, according to official figures updated till Friday. Of the total positive cases in the district, 1,005 are active patients, the data shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gautam-budh-nagar-district-received-260-000-distress-calls-since-lockdown-1-0/story-rDe7SaCEljPpzeyGeGpY3M.html
04-07-2020||Noida||Business revenues down by 85%, claim owners||Local businesses in Noida claim that their revenues in the last three months have gone down by nearly 85%, while standalone shops in markets are functioning at only 15% to 20% of its capacity due to the odd-even rule and night curfew.They claim they are being discriminated against as malls in the district were allowed to operate seven days a week while.“A standalone shop is operating barely 12-13 days in a month, which reduces to productivity to 33%. If we factor in the night curfew which cuts into prime business hours, the functioning capacity of any business comes down to 15 to 20%. The footfall is also so low and so there is hardly any revenue, falling by as much as 85%,” said Sushil kumar Jain, president, sector 18 market association.He said that the meagre demand in the markets is only for basic necessities like food, stationary, clothing, etc.“No item except the basics is important these days. There was some demand for purchase or service of electronic/ electrical gadgets or phones in the beginning when markets opened but even that has dwindled now. And with most people working from home, market requirements have reduced drastically,” said Jain.In view of the Covid-19 pandemic the district had ordered shops in market areas to open on an odd-even basis based on their shop numbers given by the market. One day is a mandatory sanitisation day for all.“Very few restaurants have started business. The timings are not in our favour. We are required to shut down before the dinner rush and with the present weather conditions, lunch hours don’t see many customers. For us opening is not even worth the effort and with the current non-existent footfall, regular operations will only lead to wastage of food. We are hopeful that the curfew timings will revise from July 10 and then we can decide further,” said Varun Khera, a restaurant owner.Business owners feel that certain segments like retailers, travel businesses, jewellery stores have been affected worse than others.“Our revenues have dropped by nearly 90% so much so that it doesn’t even make sense to open the agency. International flights are the major source of profit and that business is at hardly at a 30% capacity. With no student travel, business is meagre. We don’t know when the situation will improve,” said Sunil Dang, owner of a travel agency in sector 18.Business owners had even earlier requested the administration for changing the odd-even rule to six days a week but to no avail.“There is no official order for changes in the odd-even system for now,” said district labour commissioner, PK Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/business-revenues-down-by-85-claim-owners/story-v2zitDl1sQ7a4HsfsSNyKJ.html

Sanjay Pandey, an assistant hydrologist, and technician Chander Parkash Midda besides a middleman were also arrested.

04-07-2020||Dehradun||‘Operation Monsoon’: Corbett Tiger Reserve to check poaching in rainy season||A state forest department-led patrolling season ‘Operation Monsoon’ to check poaching in the Corbett Tiger Reserve in the ongoing rainy season has started from July 1. In the operation, about 700 forest department staffers are being deployed in the world famous tiger reserve for round-the-clock patrolling during the monsoon, said officials. RK Tiwari, wildlife warden at CTR said, “The forest department has done the required preparations for the operation which includes giving fresh stock of ammunition and rations to our men deployed in posts deep in the Reserve.”Tiwari said the patrolling season is significant considering the fact that chances of poaching increases during rainy season. The reason behind this, Tiwari said, is stated to be the ease with which poachers find it easy to enter the forest through broken pathways or waterlogged places. He also informed that during patrolling season this year, the department would be emphasising on, “drains, rivulets and other water bodies connecting the Reserve to UP as through these water bodies possibility of UP poachers coming in CTR is more.”“Special surveillance teams were also set up this season for surprise raids during the rainy season in CTR that is spread in an area of 1,300 sq km,” said Tiwari adding patrolling is being done on foot, elephants and All Terrain Vehicles in the CTR.In view of monsoon being breeding season for tigers, damage of roads and safety of tourists, the NTCA in August 2015 asked tiger parks in the country to remain shut during the season. It, however, allows field directors to take a decision on their own after looking into prevailing conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/operation-monsoon-corbett-tiger-reserve-to-check-poaching-in-rainy-season/story-z57BAAihhHchsICEdiKhDI.html
04-07-2020||Chandigarh||Roundabout: My Other Half – Telling tales of the storyteller from Sialkot||The greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved; loved for ourselves, or rather, loved in spite of ourselves. So said French writer Victor Hugo and this conveys a lot because to be a writer’s wife is not the easiest of things. For one, it means always coming second to his first love – writing. Yet she is to be the muse as well as the first reader, critic and much more. Perhaps, it is not so complicated to be a writer’s husband for an author making her way from second sex knows and accepts that she has to be her own support more often than not.However, there have been women who have been immensely supportive in the writing careers of their partners and very often been their fans, loving the person first wedded to the pen, in spite of it all as Hugo puts it.In the hands this weekend is a delightful, slim volume titled My Other Half by Red River Books in which Krishna Paul wife of Urdu fiction writer Joginder Paul, engages in conversations with Chandana Dutta. It is indeed a narrative that comes straight from the heart and leaves the reader enriched and elevated in this story of love and caring. Indeed, it is all about the past which is very much a part of the present.The writer’s wifeWriter Chandana says: “The writer’s wife: Well, that’s what I thought of her when I began to read the works of Joginder Paul and plan projects around them. But over time I could not see her just as a writer’s wife, the fallback person.” The conversations with her revealed to Chandana that she was a person as much in command of her universe as was Joginder Paul, who was in command of the universe of his words. It was an amazing role that Krishna played in holding the fort all those years so that her husband could write uninterrupted. One endorses these thoughts and I have memories of meeting the Pauls long ago at their south Delhi home even before I had made an acquaintance with their daughter Sukrita, who is now a friend.My first introduction to Joginder Paul was when he had come to participate in a literary event at Panjab University and city poet Kumar Vikal had heartily praised his stories. Years later I was to visit their home to take permission to translate Dera Baba Nanak, which is one of the most heartwarming stories of a humane gesture in the mad frenzy of the great divide. That one visit made me an insider as it used to be with the littérateurs of yore. It also gave me a chance to listen spellbound to the very adventurous vignettes of their lives.Suitable boy in AmbalaIn early 1948, Krishna’s parents decided that their daughter had passed her senior Cambridge with distinction in six subjects so it was time to discontinue studies and find a suitable boy and marry her off. Krishna always took glee in relating the consequences that led to her marrying Joginder and so also in this book. Krishna’s father was an unlettered but wealthy businessman in Nairobi, Kenya. On a mission of groom-hunting in Delhi, they received a proposal from Ambala. There a relative’s cousin took them around the place and in the father’s eye he became the suitable boy.Krishna’s description of the meeting in Ambala is most readable in its comic sadness. Joginder has been uprooted from Sialkot with his family and they are staying in a shabby evacuee property. He is supporting the family by running a milk procuring and selling business from home although he is already a well published author. There the vow is made as Joginder tells her with a pinch of humour that he could not have turned her away as his mother believed in the old tradition of not turning away good luck and fortune that had come knocking their way. Krishna too loses her heart to this unusual young man who wears a pyjama and gobbles some half a dozen rotis sitting across the stove from his mother. “I somehow knew that here was someone who would let her continue with her studies. And so he did!”Together they moved to Kenya, then to Aurangabad and finally their love nest in Delhi with Krishna being the first reader of his stories and also the Hindi translator. This is how love stories are made and this one is so engaging. As author Chandana says: “ This seamless bend of time, both full of love and wit, makes life seem so worth its while!”nirupama.dutt@hindustantimes.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/roundabout-my-other-half-telling-tales-of-the-storyteller-from-sialkot/story-Vqb7rbFtrHA4hRYb8yHDuO.html

Prasad has been convicted in four of the five fodder scam cases in Jharkhand. While two cases pertain to the Chaibasa treasury, the other two are regarding withdrawal of funds from Deoghar and Dumka treasuries. He is facing 14 years jail term in the case pertaining to illegal withdrawal of funds from Dumka treasury in the 1990s and the bail petition was moved in this case. The bail petition in the RC 68A/96 case was filed on Friday. Counsel Prabhat Kumar said the bail has been sought on the ground that Prasad’s health condition is deteriorating. The fifth case that Prasad is facing is being heard by a special CBI court in Ranchi pertaining to fraudulent withdrawal of money from Doranda treasury. Prasad, who is in jail since December 2017, is currently undergoing treatment at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences in Ranchi. He has already been granted bail in the Deoghar case and in one of the two Chaibasa cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/lalu-prasad-moves-bail-plea-in-jharkhand-hc-in-fodder-scam-case-citing-ill-health/story-K3FQIDTTOr0b1OguwOwiNK.html
04-07-2020||Chandigarh||Random Forays: A sense of humour in times of despair||When a writer attempts to lighten the mood of his readers, he faces a rather onerous and daunting task, not only in pandemic-related painful times, but at any moment in history. For life, and the world, have always managed to accomplish the task of dampening the general mood, even souring it, beyond redemption.Life, after all, is full of its bumps and rubble, its humps and trouble. There is nary a moment when news of the unsavoury variety will not come intruding into your relative sense of calmness. In these times of unstoppable always-on gadgets and that mother of all intruders, the internet, even more scarce is the moment which is undisturbed by unwarranted intrusion.Thus, even to try and inspire friends or acquaintances to adopt a sunny, cheerful, lighthearted attitude towards life, is fraught with risk of the kind that only a bullfighter who tries to appease a raging bull has ever encountered. Moreover, the Indian summer is at its peak, and people’s nostrils tend to flare up much more at such times.Humorous banter might not therefore receive the welcome it perhaps deserves. But then writers are dogged people, and they buckle down to write what they have to, people’s moods and outdoor temperatures notwithstanding!When a not-so-young-man called up the other day from the interiors of Haryana, he gave me reason to not only smile, but also to mention him in this column. Having called at a late hour, he began with an enthusiastically cheery “Good night, sir!” I was a little taken aback at this, and nonplussed for a minute, but when he repeated these words, I got the thrust of what he meant. Instead of responding in the same vein and closing the conversation with “Good night!” I decided to answer him with a “Namaskar” and we chatted for five minutes.Ways of communicating have necessarily found new avatars. Webinars are the order of the day. Most of us have become actors these days for we have to appear on screen. What is extremely difficult for all generations except GenX to understand is that the virtual world requires us to be ourselves just as much as reality does.These days I am a part of several webinars and I have learnt a few new facts as a result. There are webinar intruders, webinar escapists and webinar experts around. Some people are just very informal on webinars, believing that they can ‘feel at home’ because they are working from home and not from office! Some snore, others wash dishes, while on a webinar!My friend Atul Khosla, pro vice chancellor of Shoolini University, has spoken at over a hundred webinars on Zoom and says he has become a ‘Zoombie’!Work from home also has hilarious consequences. A grandmother popped into a 20-year-old intern’s call with his manager and scolded the senior person on camera for turning her home into an office. The icing on the cake was that the manager’s mother appeared on the other end of the call and totally agreed with her!The banning of Chinese apps has queered the pitch but Indians have great resilience and will surely come up with apps which are even more impactful. TikTok has been ticked off, so to say, but similar Indian apps have already registered millions of users and the day is not far when we will have people swearing by something like ‘Been Bajao’ instead of TikTok.The new appearance that we have to present to the world, with masks on, is also leading to piquant situations. Some people wear a mask as if their life depends on it, and it might well do. But others wear it as if it is an accessory of the chin alone, and not of the face. Colourful and fashionable masks have made a killing in the market, with designers coming up with extremely creative ideas already.Finding humour in exacting situations is not everybody’s cup of tea. But that is the way that life must be led. By finding the smile within us when all is seemingly going wrong and spreading the smiling habit to all we live more meaningfully, for sure.vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/random-forays-a-sense-of-humour-in-times-of-despair/story-ZSmnX1PvqZ3mgRlGnPgCpK.html
04-07-2020||Chandigarh||Witerati: Of ‘Chini Kum’,migrants’ maps& China’s TikTok apps||As it’s been long since the hyped “Hindi Chini Bhai Bhai” slogan suffered a bye-lateral burial by being dumped into diplomatic folklore and history books, like a long-lost Bhojpuri or Bihari sub-dialect, it is the current “Chini Kum” narrative that’s scripting life in India Unlocking.As with hashtags, so also with households, Covid-19 has overnight been upstaged by another “C” – China – in its role of Villain No 1. Smacks so much of a Prem Chopra-outrivalled-by-a-Shakti Kapoor script.The “Chini Kum” narrative – driven by hashtags #RIPTiktok, #BoycottChineseApps blah blah – has found resonance not only in the garrulous gabs of tamasha TV or Twitterati. It is also echoing in the living rooms of the Lollitas, Lamba jis and Lala jis.Of much ado about migrationIncredibly Indian, isn’t it, how India Unlocking’s migration narrative has suddenly got skewed – it now boasts a new metaphor, a substitute symbolism.Till now, migration was the outflux mapping out between urban and rural India - The Return of the Native. Ah, but (mis)trust the Chinese to trudge in to trigger a parallel migration. Digital natives of Dhulia to Dhanbad migrating from TikTok in the direction of a different digital home.Blame it on the banning of 59 Chinese apps in the wake of India-China tensions. TikTok’s pain is Instagram and YouTube’s gain. Oh, actually, if one factors in the TikTokers’ small-town scorn for the elitism of Instagram or YouTube, then TikTok’s pain could spell home-grown app Chingari or Mitron’s gain.What this also translates into is a tectonic shift in the ground reality of India Unlocking’s middle-class households.The Lollitas are spectators or sufferers of the double migration – seeing not just a majority of maids, Lalitaas and Lajjos, migrating from the metropolises to Malda or Midnapore, but now also migrating from TikTok.Seen more as the semi-urbanites’ social media platform, remember how TikTok had overnight made star sensations out of the Kaamwali Bai or Kabadiwala Bhai? Remember, how when the Lollitas thought the Lalitaas were bestowing benediction on the stains on the floor by flailing the mop-stick with a vampish vengeance, the latter were actually rehearsing or choreographing the moves for their next TikTok video?No wonder, now the Lollitas are a bit befuddled about which is a more “burning” concern (that is, if you don’t count the frozen GST-grilled Parottas or Paranthas burning on the tawa bemoaning the Bai’s exodus) – the Lalitaas and Lajjos migrating from metropolises or migrating from TikTok.Alas, those latkas ‘n’ jhatkas of the Lalitaas with the broomstick or their lip-syncing to “Tu cheez badi hai mast mast” before the bathroom mirrors of the Lollitas face a freeze till TikTok’s Bais and Bhais figure out a different digital home. Lalitaas’ pain is Lollitas’ gain.But trust those Blabbermouths of Breaking News – Arnab Goswami & Co – to bring their melodrama into this “Chini Kum” narrative. Where was the need for Arnab to babble, “The sheer suddenness of the move, the unexpected nature of the move, the unpredictability of the move ...”? It almost seemed he was egging on the Lalitaas and Lajjos by felicitating their flux from TikTok. No wonder, his Theatre of the Absurd had trolls twaddling that it was Arnab who was the “real TikTok star”.If you’ve ever watched Poodles or Persian Cats chase after chicken lollipops first, and then suddenly starting to steer their heels in a divergent direction to dash after sausages, you may detect definite resemblance to New Normal’s muddled migration maps.The curious case of TikTok tasting the Chini Kum narrative and twattling – Who Moved My Cheez!Of Swiggy & sweet ‘n’ sourThe Chinese app ban and subsequent migration from TikTok are also playing party-poopers for the poor neighbourhood Khanna jis and Khullar jis (K&K).Remember, how the Lalitaas and Lajjos on neighbouring balconies, aspiring to be anointed TiKTok’s future “Revolver Ranis” etc – would engage the Glad Eye of the K&Ks?Alas, as the Khanna jis and Khullar jis now stand deprived of those TikTok-driven latkas ‘n’ jhatkas of the Lalitaas – practised and perfected in pochaa-jharoo mode – they have been trying to divert their male gaze to temptations called Reshmi Kebabs or Nargisi Koftas proffered by Swiggy or Zomato. Only to learn that half the apps that are supplying Sweet ‘n’ Sour Chinese or desi gastronomic distractions to their Glad Eye are also in the eye of the storm. The Party-poopers – nuggets of news trickling in that Swiggy, Zomato & Co too thrive thanks to Chinese funding. Thus, they too are inviting a taste of hashtags #boycottchina blah blah.The curious case of gluttony’s glad eye grunting – Who Moved My Chinese!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/witerati-of-chini-kum-migrants-maps-china-s-tiktok-apps/story-9GZySaQBpZjuAdVhMbsM6N.html

However, the PU faculty has denied the allegation.It is learnt that the Sonepat law varsity vice-chancellor Prof Viney Kapoor was given the PhD thesis of a PU student for evaluation as an external examiner. The controversy erupted between Prof Kapoor and Dr Ajay Ranga, a faculty of University Institute of Legal Studies (UILS) and PU senator, after she had written a revision for the thesis.In her letter she said, “On June 5 morning, I received a call from Dr Ajay Ranga. He started using abusive language, asking how I could write a revision in the PhD report of his candidate. He threatened me of facing consequences and said he will file a case under the SC/ST Act against me.”Prof Kapoor said she is shocked that “this is the level of a PU teacher and that the university allows any supervisor to contact and abuse the external examiner and harass them in this manner. “If he can use threatening language against a woman and that too to a vice-chancellor, then I am shocked what kind of language he might be using towards his women colleagues at Panjab University,” she stated in the letter.PU SENATOR DENIES ALLEGATIONSRanga admitted calling Prof Kapoor, but denied the accusations of him threatening her. He said, “I called her on June 4, but I did not threaten her. This move seems to me as politically motivated as senate elections are approaching. Before she sent the report of the thesis back, she was given many reminders since last year. I will take legal action against her in the future.”MATTER NOW WITH STANDING COMMITTEEPU has forwarded the matter to its standing committee. Dean University Instructions Professor RK Singla said, “The university has received the complaint and the matter has been referred to the standing committee.”Panjab University controller of examinations Prof Parvinder Singh said, “The thesis was submitted last year in March. More than ten reminders were given to the examiner by the secrecy branch after that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sonepat-law-varsity-vice-chancellor-seeks-action-against-pu-senator-for-verbal-abuse-threats/story-3IuCuKn6sYUMQii2hUqY7M.html
04-07-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Our Take: With adopting a pet comes great responsibility||By notifying the Chandigarh Registration of Pet Dogs (Amendment) By-laws 2020, the UT administration has taken its first steps towards a more structured, coherent strategy in controlling the dog population in the city, where cases of dog bite had touched 10,387 till September, 2019.According to the by-laws, a fine of Rs 5,000 will be slapped on those not registering their pet dogs, a tenfold rise from Rs 500 charged earlier. Even applying for registration will cost owners Rs 500 instead of Rs200.There are about 8,000 pet dogs registered in the city, the fear of fines is likely to push more people into getting the paperwork done for their pets, and as a result be accountable for any incident involving the animal.Maintenance charges of ₹100 for dogs seized or detained under the by-laws have been increased to ₹1,000 to claim the pet.The by-laws state it is mandatory for dog owners to register each pet at the municipal corporation office once the canine is four months old. Only two dogs are allowed per family.Control and regulation of strays as well as pets is urgently required in the tricity with attacks by pets too reported frequently. Earlier this year,a pet dog bit two people in quick succession in Sector 30, Chandigarh, but the owner, despite having a case registered against him under Section 289 of the IPC for negligence in preventing harm to others from an animal in his possession, was released on bail. The dog had reportedly attacked five people in all.With adoption of a pet comes great responsibility... of ensuring that it is taken care of and does not harm others. Increased fines for non registration of dogs will deter people from getting pets on a whim without assessing their own capacity to nurture and protect the animal and ensure it does not get into trouble.Residents have to be brought to task for flouting rules. Most of them are not picking up their dog’s stools while taking the animal out for a walk. Not many choose to muzzle ferocious breeds while taking them outdoors – and another matter of concern is that no system of licencing exists in the country for such pets.Designated areas have to be marked out where the animals can be exercised – as is done in Western countries. It is also time for the authorities take a recount of the stray dog population and ensure the animals are neutered and vaccinated.PET PEEVEWhat can be done to save the city from going to the dogs? What more needs to be done to ensure responsible dog ownership/stray control in the tricity?

While expressing the hope that the locusts will spare Punjab, he said an MI17 chopper had been earmarked for spraying chemicals and the operation will start from Rajasthan soon.On the Covid-19 situation, the CM said things were not good, as cases are on the rise across India, and even Punjab touched the 6,000-mark, along with 157 deaths. He reiterated the importance of social distancing and wearing of masks.A student wanted to know his chances of travelling to Canada where he has an exam in September, Captain said while he expected international travel to be open before that, the state government will also try to get his name on the list sooner if flights resume.To a question regarding the high court’s decision on payment of school fee in the absence of classes, the CM said the state government was in the process of filing a review petition in the high court.Meanwhile, in a major initiative for general ex-servicemen, Amarinder announced the number of attempts in PCS examination to six instead of four. While the SC candidates among the general category will continue to get unlimited chances, candidate from the BC category of ex-servicemen can take the exam nine times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-keep-fighting-against-anti-farmer-ordinances-capt/story-DXkq3XOuGCM1KtXg1L53jK.html

The UT administration wants the MC to follow strict financial discipline, while councillors accuse the commissioner of centralising spending. “Approvals that were earlier given by an executive engineer (XEN) level officer now go to him. He asks umpteen questions before clearing any expenditure. This is delaying the implementation of development works in our wards,” said a councillor, requesting anonymity. Defending his boss, a senior MC official said, “Only those works for which the MC has funds get the nod. Earlier, councillors could pressure junior officers into sanctioning works, but now it’s hard for them to do as they please.”With no challans due to Covid-19, vendors have a free run in MohaliCovid-19 has come as a blessing in disguise for vendors or rehri and phariwallahs in Mohali with the enforcement wing of the municipal corporation staying put in office.

The leftover parsad was taken to the gurdwara where it was consumed by me, my two grandsons, my wife, and six others. After some time, we started choking and some vomiting.”They went to a local doctor for treatment. The granthi and his family are stable but others were taken to a Tarn Taran hospital.Councillor Sarabjit Singh Lali said, “There was a dispute between two sons of Sharanjit over possession of the family house after her death. Someone may have laced the parsad with poisonous substance. Strict action should be taken against the guilty.”City police station SHO Saminderjit Singh said preliminary investigation shows that the parsad may have been laced with some poisonous substance. “Investigation to ascertain identity of the accused who mixed the poisonous substance in parsad is on,” he said. A case was registered against unidentified persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/10-take-ill-after-consuming-parsad-at-tarn-taran-gurdwara-three-critical/story-rpTiHljgD9poSM4fsn6SZI.html
04-07-2020||Chandigarh||Despite Chandigarh adviser’s direction, pvt lab to seek prescription for Covid-19 test||Even though UT adviser Manoj Parida on Friday announced that a doctor’s prescription is no more mandatory for Covid-19 testing from a private lab in Chandigarh, SRL Diagnostics — the only lab authorised to conduct these tests here — on Saturday maintained that it will go by the “guidelines of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which essentially requires a prescription from a registered doctor”.The new ICMR guidelines call for a prescription of either a government or registered private doctor, said a spokesperson of the lab.However, Parida said the private lab will have to follow directions issued by the central government, and the UT administration has just passed them on to it.The ambiguity seems to have arisen due to a recent letter of the Union health and family welfare ministry to all states and union territories, a part of which states, “ICMR strongly recommends that the laboratories should be free to test any individual in accordance with its guidelines and state authorities must not restrict an individual from testing.” The letter initially states that private medical practitioners can also prescribe Covid-19 test in addition to government doctors.“Even private labs can ascertain whether the individual coming for testing fulfils the ICMR guidelines and go for the test accordingly without prescription from any medical professional,” a senior UT health official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/despite-chandigarh-adviser-s-direction-pvt-lab-to-seek-prescription-for-covid-19-test/story-NLeEwJztevqzpAdlgACEkK.html

The total area of Taljai hill is about 110 acres and the primary objective of this proposal is to restore and enrich the greenery of Taljai hill by means of water and soil conservation measures and providing protection from illegal encroachment of the hill, according to the PMC initiative with people’s participation.Earlier, congress corporator Aba Bagul had proposed various initiatives on the 110-acre Taljai hill plot.NCP corporator Subhash Jagtap said, “The proposal of installing solar panels included cutting around 300 trees which were not at all acceptable. Hence, my opposition to the proposal was obvious. There are almost 13 projects started by Aba Bagul which are not maintained and closed after a few months of the inauguration. I am not opposing the forest eco-park project as it does not include cutting of trees and damaging the environment and the only trees which will be felled are the Gliricidia trees, which are useful for prevention of soil erosion, but are harmful to other trees.”NCP corporator, Ashwini Kadam said, “The proposal of Aba Bagul was not beneficial for the residents. The new proposal is mainly focused on developing an oxygen park at Taljai hill. The proposal also includes small amphitheatres and cultural facilities. Moreover, sports facilities such as cricket stadium, skateboarding ramp, and rock-climbing facilities will also be part of the project.”Local residents continue to remain unhappy with the whole concept of a development project.Aishwarya Dhere, a regular visitor of the Taljai hill, said, “I go there to exercise and meditate in peace and according to me there is enough oxygen at Taljai hill. Developing any cultural and sports facilities on a beautiful natural place like Taljai hill will be like losing the essence of nature.”Aditya More, who also is a regular visitor to Taljai hail believes there isn’t a need for amphitheatres and sports complexes at Taljai Hill.“It will attract more crowd which will cause noise and air pollution and will affect the animals living inside the jungle. Taljai Hill is much more beautiful without all these materialistic add-ons,” More said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/ncp-corporators-switch-sides-on-taljai-hill-development-plan-after-ajit-pawar-approves-13-cr-project/story-FVd6L8dEmERURdIfaAtNHN.html

Jai Ram Thakur said, “ It is essential that we constantly interact with the beneficiaries and have a mechanism to get their feedback regarding different schemes. Optimum use of technology must be ensured.” He directed the BDOs to have a detailed database at panchayat level so that it was available at the click of a button.In the first phase, the state government had decided that beneficiaries of schemes such as Ayushman Bharat and HIMCARE, Ujjawala Yojana and Grihini Suvidha Yojana, housing schemes like Pradhan Mantri Aawas Yojana, Mukhyamantri Aawas Yojana, workers registered with Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board, ASHA workers, Pradhan Mantri Kissan Samman Nidhi, Social Security Pension beneficiaries, Sahara Yojana, and Jan Dhan Yojana will be listed. He said the list of beneficiaries should be provided to the panchayats and must be readily available with them and all lists must be made available to panchayats by tenth of the month. He directed the BDOs to get webex software loaded in the mobiles of the beneficiaries and also train them regarding its use.Efforts will be made to increase enrolment in govt schools:CM Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Saturday said efforts will be made to increase the enrolment of students in government schools, particularly at pre-primary and primary levels.Addressing the review meeting for budget assurances for the year 2020-21, the CM said there should be qualitative improvement in education so that students could get good education near their homes.CM said that the Swaran Jayanti Gyanodaya Cluster Sreshtha Vidyalaya Yojana was being launched. Under this scheme 100 Schools of the state will be improved by bringing them qualitative changes and student -teacher ratio will be ensured in the state. He said Rs 15 crore would be spent under this scheme. The CM said that the Medha Protshan Yojana launched by the state government had proved to be a boon as they were getting an incentive of Rs 1 lakh for pursuing coaching for various exams such NEET, IIIT.

Gaba’s interim bail was dismissed in the wake of the Punjab and Haryana high court order of July 2 that was in line with the Supreme Court observation that “bail in cases involving heinous crimes, like the offences under the Narcotic Drugs & Psychotropic Substances Act, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, may not be granted as a matter of right”.Gaba was granted interim bail on March 28 and it was extended on May 8. Gaba, in February this year, had surrendered before the court in connection with the money-laundering case against him.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had chargesheeted nine members of Gaba’s family, associated with his 11 firms, in connection with the Bhola drug case for the alleged violation of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).Besides Gaba, his three sons — Gurjit, Gurmesh and Mahesh — father Suresh Kumar, brother Harmesh Gaba, 23-year-old grandson Khushwant Gaba, Gurjit’s wife Rekha and Harmesh’s wife Sudesh Rani were booked.The ED’s chargesheet had listed 11 firms, jointly owned by the Gaba family, and their properties at Phillaur, Goraya and Una (Himachal Pradesh).The ED had registered the money laundering case after former Punjab Police DSP and drug lord Jagdish Singh Bhola had in January 2014 accused Gaba of trading in synthetic drug pseudoephedrine in association with Delhi-based smuggler Varinder Raja.Gaba has business interests in cold storage fibre, real estate and pharmaceuticals in Una and Baddi districts of Himachal Pradesh.Gaba was acquitted in the Bhola drug case while his son Gurjit Singh Gaba alias Monu was convicted and sentenced to 10-year jail. Their manager Suresh Kumar was awarded 12-year imprisonment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/money-laundering-case-interim-bail-dismissed-industrialist-gaba-back-in-jail/story-poxDUDOOsD8L2LzzeqUaDN.html
04-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh private schools seek deferral of last date to upload balance sheets||Private schools in the city have sought the postponement of last date of uploading balance sheets on their websites saying that the matter is sub judice.The independent school association has written to the district education officer in this regard. The body has asked for the date to be postponed by a fortnight.Last month, the schools were asked to send compliance reports before July 4 regarding uploading of balance sheets online, along with the undertaking that they charged only tuition fee for the last academic year.“This is to request you to postpone the last date for uploading of balance sheets on the school websites by a fortnight as the case related to this is still sub-judice in the Punjab and Haryana high court and is likely to be decided on the 14 of this month,” reads the letter.The body has also requested that no coercive action be taken against schools till the final disposal of the case.The fee regulatory body of Chandigarh had issued fresh show-cause notices to all 79 private schools of the city last month. This is the second round of mass show-cause notices issued to the schools for non-compliance of the provisions of the Punjab Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institutions Act, 2016. Previously on May 26, 51 private unaided schools of Chandigarh were asked to explain their position within seven working days.District education officer (DEO) Harbir Anand said, “We have received the letter from them and I have forwarded it to director school education (DSE).”However, DSE Rubinderjit Singh Brar said, “We will seek the details from DEO on Monday about the compliance by private schools.”The standoff between the UT education department and private schools started when the UT directed them to defer the collection of school fees during the lockdown period. The schools, however, ignored the directive saying they won’t be paying salaries to their staff unless they were allowed to collect fees. Later, invoking the fee regulation Act, then DEO Alka Mehta asked the schools to upload their balance sheets online.VIOLATING ACT PUNISHABLE OFFENCEAs per the Act, which was notified in 2018 in Chandigarh, if any school contravenes the provisions, it shall be punished with a fine between ₹60,000 to ₹4 lakh depending on the number of violations and the level of school (primary, middle, secondary).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-private-schools-seek-deferral-of-last-date-to-upload-balance-sheets/story-pFImgxmR4bUw0TlASKRIaP.html

04-07-2020||City||With Ludhiana MC facing shortage of space, stray cattle menace is here to stay||With the municipal corporation (MC) facing a shortage of space to shelter the stray cattle of the city, a solution for this menace seems to be a distant dream.The MC officials are claiming that a cow shed will be ready within two weeks at Burj Powat village, 53 km from the city, and that the process of shifting stray cattle will commence soon after that. But the shed can only accommodate around 150 animals, while hundreds of cattle roam around on city roads, posing a grave danger to the lives of commuters.One of the MC officials requesting anonymity said, “More sheds can be established at Burj Powat, but establishing a shed in a village is not a solution. The MC will also face trouble transporting the cattle as it takes around an hour to reach the village that is situated in Machhiwara area. The residents might get relief after the MC establishes a gaushala in Noorpur Bet area.”The MC had approved the building of a gaushala on 2 acre land in Noorpur Bet area, but the project has not yet started at the ground level. Only the contract has been allotted to the management of Govind Godham at Hambran road for lifting of the stray cattle.The MC officials said that now, even the Godham management is also not lifting the cattle on a daily basis due to space shortage. The Godham has already sheltered around 1,300 cattle and the MC pays around ₹13 lakh to the management for their upkeep on a monthly basis. The MC has tried to sign a pact with few other gaushala managements in the city, but to no avail.The MC had also proposed registration of dairy animals to catch offenders who leave dry cows on the roads. But that project never saw the light of day either. A resident of Tajpur road area, Ashok Verma, said, “Large number of stray cattle roam on the roads in our area and accidents take place due to the same. Apart from finding a shelter for the cattle, the MC should also come up with an idea to punish dairy owners who abandon the animals.” Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “The MC is working to establish a gaushala in Noorpur Bet area as the civic body is facing trouble finding space. The shed at Burj Powat will also be ready within two weeks. The management of Govind Godham lifts the cattle at the time of emergency and efforts are being made to keep a check on dairy owners.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-ludhiana-mc-facing-shortage-of-space-stray-cattle-menace-is-here-to-stay/story-7MPWCl4CvCS7IIxPlGwXWI.html

04-07-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers reduce area under paddy cultivation in Jalandhar, experts say it may help improve groundwater levels||There has been a fall in the area under paddy cultivation in Jalandhar due to the non-availability of labour amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Experts say the development may help improve the area’s groundwater levels. Farmers have transplanted paddy over 1.4 lakh hectares since June 10. Around 20-20,000 hectares will be used to grow basmati rice that needs less water, said chief agriculture officer Surinder Singh. In 2019, paddy was transplanted over 1.74 lakh hectares. Taking account of labour shortage, the Punjab government had allowed the farmers to start the paddy season from June 10. Transplantation of paddy generally begins on June 20 and lasts over 20 days. District agriculture development officer Naresh Gulati said, “As labour was expensive this season, some farmers transplanted paddy over a smaller area.”In Jalandhar, paddy was sown over 1.73 lakh hectares in 2018 and over 1.72 lakh hectares in 2017.A reduction in the area covered under paddy will help to improve the groundwater level as all ten blocks of Jalandhar have been overexploited, say officials. “The government had also directed the agriculture departments to reduce at least 3 lakh hectares from 29.3 lakh hectares, the total area under paddy cultivation in 2019 across the state, by promoting basmati and maize crop to check the depleting groundwater level,” a senior agriculture officer said.According to the Punjab Central Ground Water Board’s 2019 report, Punjab tops the country in over-exploitation of groundwater at 79% and Jalandhar is among the four worst-affected districts in the state.‘REDUCED CULTIVATION BY HALF’A farmer, Jagjit Shergill of Hoshiarpur’s Bajwara village, says that as there was no migrant labourers and local labour was expensive, he transplanted paddy over 10 acres of his land against last year’s 20 acres.Gulati said around 2,500 to 5,500 litre of water is needed to produce a kg of rice and for one hectare of paddy field 50-60 lakh litre is required, depending on the soil quality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmers-reduce-area-under-paddy-cultivation-in-jalandhar-experts-say-it-may-help-improve-groundwater-levels/story-d4QlG6KP83r13zcVcpHI1N.html
04-07-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: A mousetrap for fish||Along the banks of a wetland, life thrives in all its resplendent glories and diversities. And so do hunters and illegitimate killers. Rambling along the thorny and undergrowth-lined northern banks of Mirzapur dam in the Shivalik foothills on Tuesday, I was making heavy headway with a wary eye for serpents. But something impelled me to keep moving on, lured as I was by the unexplored wilderness. Perhaps, it was something else that Nature was driving my fated footsteps towards.I stumbled upon a suspicious, basket-like contraption placed in a wedge of submerged weeds. The weeds poking out of water would twitch nervously from a submerged source. I realised it was a fish trap, an innovative contraption fashioned from riverine grasses and slim bamboos with a door of sharpened spikes that lets a fish come in but the trapdoor closes behind the fish. It works very much like a mousetrap with nine-tenths of its structure submerged in water and is normally used to nail large fish. The trap allows the poacher to fetch the trapped fish at his leisure as the fish remains alive and flesh preserved within the water even as the victim paces the aqueous trap like a tiger wandering distractedly along the perimeters of a zoo enclosure.This is the second occasion that I have come across such a mousetrap for fish, the first being while on a tour of the Harike Wildlife sanctuary in December 2015. The wildlife officials had removed the trap from Harike’s waters. I proceeded to pull out the Mirzapur trap and discovered there was no big fish but nearly a 100 very small fish or minnows, tinier than goldfish that had entered the trap and could not get out. They had been left to rot and stagnate in the trap as their size was too small to appease the taste buds of the poacher. They looked helpless with a wide-eyed innocence as human babies snatched from the comforting bosom of free waters. I liberated the little ones, who bounded away in the waters without so much as a grateful glance over their shoulder. I did not fault the fish for their lack of grace and general distrust of humanity.SPIDER HUNTS THE DRAGONFrom that fish poacher a genuine hunter was just a few steps and 24 hours away on the Mirzapur banks. The day after, on Wednesday, I again made my way to the spot where I had dismantled the fish trap. As I stood gazing at the waters and imagining the happiness of the freed ones below the gentle ripples, I observed a whitish twig that looked like a piece of driftwood that had washed ashore and had dried. But the funny thing was that a beautiful Red-veined Darter dragonfly was poking out of one end of the supposed driftwood. On closer examination, I realised it was a huge spider which had preyed upon the insect. Not only did the spider mimic a piece of natural bank litter but it was completely still. Not a twitch, as still as its dead prey. The ingestion of the dragonfly was so measured that it seemed it would take a lifetime. As I watched, another dragonfly and a damselfly hovered dangerously close to the spider. But the spider did not bother. It had its food and would not prey until it needed to do so again. Neither, like humans, would it kill many more that it needed to, just to cater to unforeseen eventualities like a frenzied over-stocking of rations for a Covid lockdown. Or, succumb to the sheer lust to kill and stack up, and assert a murderous dominance like the Chinese dragon!On verification from experts later, the Mirzapur spider was identified as a Fish Spider belonging to the genus, Nilus. It derives its name from its penchant for preying upon small fish that nibble along the shores and are deceived by this ingenious ‘bagula bhagat’. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-a-mousetrap-for-fish/story-p2AzQ0BXG4eJMQx4OsBr4J.html
04-07-2020||City||J&K Congress protests against hike in fuel prices for sixth consecutive day||The Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee on Saturday staged a protest for the sixth consecutive day across Jammu region against the hike in fuel prices by the BJP government.State Congress chief Ghulam Ahmed Mir said the week-long protest throughout the country is an attempt “to awaken the government to the hardships of people”. “The continuously rising prices of diesel and petrol, for 22 consecutive days, has increased the burden on people. The BJP government has also increased transport tariff by 30% in Jammu. No money is percolating down to the middle class or poor people. No financial relief is provided to the public. As a result, the local consumers are suffering on a daily basis.” Mir said.The high retail price of petrol and diesel continues to impact the common man even though global market has thrown enough cues for a sharp cut in the price of auto fuels, he added.He said when the BJP came to power in May 2014, excise duty on petrol was only ₹ 9.20 per litre and on diesel ₹ 3.46 per litre. In the course of six years, the BJP increased excise duty to ₹ 23.78 per litre on petrol and ₹ 28.37 per litre on diesel.Meanwhile, District Congress Committee (Jammu rural) president Hari Singh Chib and Senior party leader Mohinder Bhardwaj led a massive protest march from Tara Chowk in Bishnah to Tehsil Office and submitted a memorandum to the tehsildar against the continuous increase in the prices of petrol and diesel over the past two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-congress-protests-against-hike-in-fuel-prices-for-sixth-consecutive-day/story-JzVlUFUgsNPmjvqhWzr61J.html

A two-member survey team from Dehradun, aided by their counterparts from Nepal, has measured the disputed land at Baluwa village in Dhaka block under Sikarahana subdivision of the East Champaran district on Thursday and Friday.“The two-day survey has been conducted by a joint team from India and Nepal.There will be clarity after the report is submitted,” said Shirsat Kapil Ashok, district magistrate (DM), East Champaran.Earlier, DM Ashok had sought the help of the Geological Survey of India (GSI) officials after the Nepalese authorities last month raised objection over the fortification work being done along the embankment of the Lalbakeya river in Dhaka block in a bid to contain the flood fury.Nepalese authorities maintained that some parts of the construction fell under their territorial jurisdiction.The construction work for about 400 metres -- between pillar number 346/5 and 346/7 -- had to be suspended following Nepal’s objection.“The joint survey team has made demarcation at certain places on the Indo-Nepal border. However, we need to wait for the report,” said Babban Singh, an engineer, who works for the state’s flood control and drainage division.The demarcation has been put at 14 places, said local villagers.Located about 45 kilometres (km) north-east from Motihari town, the headquarters of East Champaran district, the embankment on the Lalbakeya river starts from a railway track and stretches up to about 4.11 km along Baluwa and Guabari villages in Dhaka block on the Indo-Nepal border.Of the 4.11-km-long embankment, 3.6 km was to be fortified before the onset of monsoon fury.The villagers are worried about the suspension of the fortification work along the embankment.Over a dozen villages, including Gubari, Baluwa, Bhawanipur, Heerapur, Mahuwaha, Phoolwariya, Chandanbara, Distiya, Barewa, Kusmahwa, Saratha, and Jamuwa among others, will be submerged by floodwater, if there is a breach in the embankment this monsoon.Lalbakeya river, which traces its source in Nepal, passes through the villages of Dhaka block before it becomes a tributary of Bagmati river. The river turns swollen during monsoon because of heavy rains in adjoining hilly Nepal.The district administration has assured all help to the panic-stricken villagers.“All necessary fortification work will be done soon in compliance with the Central government’s guidelines,” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/indo-nepal-joint-field-survey-team-launches-exercise-to-settle-dispute/story-LUjKHbggmBEy7VfSCFLYBO.html

04-07-2020||Chandigarh||Not stumped by Covid-19, Chandigarh, Punjab cricketers find ways to train for season ahead||After the Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI) indicated that the Indian Premier League (IPL) season may start in October, domestic players in Punjab and Chandigarh have started working on their improving their fitness levels.Amid Covid-19 induced restrictions, Chandigarh captain Manan Vohra, known for his strict fitness ethic, has set up a small gymnasium at his house.“For the first two months of the lockdown, I did not step out of the house. It was then that I decided to set up a small gym at home to keep up with my fitness regime.”Ask him if he faced any difficulties in training, the 26-year-old opening batsman, says, “It felt a bit odd to do everything without a trainer but I learnt a lot in the process. I would ask my domestic help to throw balls at me while I batted in the nets on the terrace. With the lockdown relaxed, I now go to the local academy for a net session.” Vohra had led the Chandigarh team in its debut domestic season last year and used to play for Punjab before that. He is in touch with his teammates through video calling and they frequently share their fitness routines with each other. Vohra, a member of the Rajasthan Royals, is looking forward to the IPL season. “Cricket will be played a little differently this season. We will have to wait for directions from UT Cricket Association (UTCA) to learn more about it,” he says . CYCLING IS THE WAY TO GO Many Chandigarh cricketers swear by the benefits of cycling. Medium-pacers Jaskaran Singh, Jagit Singh, Harmeet Singh and spinner Arpit Singh have added long-route cycling to their fitness regimen. Lanky medium-pacer Jaskaran says, “I have developed a love for cycling in the last month. We take the Morni Hills route and it is a superb experience.” Jaskaran says the lockdown gave his body time to repair any wear and tear. “There is a park near my house in Phase 9, Mohali. These days I go there for spot bowling all by myself. To keep fit, I have set up a small gym at my house. I weight train at home,” he said. In wake of the pandemic, Cricket practice is barred in Chandigarh and the administration-run cricket grounds are still not open. Currently, the Sector-16 stadium serves as a jail for curfew offenders. Last season, domestic tournaments had started in the month of September. However, this year it is learnt that the Ranji Trophy will be held after the IPL.A CHANCE TO RECUPERATE Punjab captain Mandeep Singh says the lockdown has taken him to the year 2016 when he felt the fittest. Mandeep had made his T20 and ODI India debut the same year. The Jalandhar-based cricketer was in touch with Punjab trainer Jatinder Billa throughout the lockdown and follows an advised fitness regime. “Covid-19 has put everyone in a tricky situation. Everyone had to find different ways to maintain fitness. I, too, developed a passion for cycling. Wicket-keeper Abhishek Gupta and I cycle around 40-50km on weekends. I do my weight training and cardio at home,” says Mandeep. He says his mentor Vikram Rathore kept him going during the lockdown. “I will be starting knocking in the nets soon. I keep talking to my mentor Vikram Rathore who is a great influence. I have changed my diet and sleep patterns. If one wants to become a test cricketer both diet and sleep pattern are important,” says Mandeep, who has switched to ‘desi Indian food’, including ghee and milk. “I feel confident about my fitness after four years. After my back surgery, I never thought I will feel so fit again. I hope I able to continue like this for sometime more before any camp is organised and net practice and match practices begin,” says 28-year-old Mandeep, who will be playing for Kings XI Punjab in the IPL. Other Punjab cricketers are also training hard in their home districts. Punjab speedster Siddharth Kaul and his brother Uday Kaul, who plays for Chandigarh, are training at their home in Zirakpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/not-stumped-by-covid-19-chandigarh-punjab-cricketers-find-ways-to-train-for-season-ahead/story-50FKd0OLHqipzixzb4S0dP.html

Seven other people, including a civilian, were also injured in the attack from the roofs of Dubey’s residence and the houses nearby.The ambush on the 13-member police team began after they reached Bikru around 1:20am on Friday, a day after Rahul Tiwari, a resident of the village, filed an attempt to murder case against Dubey.A source in the police department said the initial investigation hinted that Dubey was well aware of the police raid at his house and prepared to deal with it. Dubey was apparently tipped off by his men in the police department about the force from three police stations in Bilhaur, Bithoor and Chaubeypur moving towards his village.The killings prompted a massive hunt for 48-year-old Vikas Dubey, a hardened criminal who faces 60 cases and carries a reward of Rs 25,000, and his group after they escaped Bikru village in the dark.“To nab Vikas Dubey and his accomplices, as many as 25 teams have been formed which are conducting raids in different districts of the state and other states as well,” Mohit Agarwal, inspector general of police, Kanpur, said on Saturday, according to news agency PTI.Police said the surveillance team was scanning more than 500 mobile phones and efforts were on to retrieve information related to Dubey, who has faced about 60 criminal cases.The special task force (STF) of UP police has also been roped in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/kanpur-firing-vikas-dubey-s-house-razed-with-earthmover-used-to-block-police-team/story-OVNlqocDa2QvZSratRxR0H.html

04-07-2020||Bangalore||Karnataka task force recommends booth-level committees to fight Covid-19||Amid the rising Covid-19 cases in the city, the Karnataka Covid-19 Task Force has decided to set up booth-level committees across the state including 8,800 here for effective monitoring and surveillance. The task force also released detailed guidelines for home isolation for asymptomatic cases including 17 days ‘home isolation’ for patients below 50 years of age. It also warned of legal action against those health workers for disrespect to the bodies. Briefing reporters after the meeting on Friday, Medical Education Minister Dr K Sudhakar said the local management will be strengthened for effective monitoring and surveillance of Covid-19 cases. “There will be booth-level task force committees throughout the state right from the village to Bengaluru. These task force committees will act at the ultra local level. The task force will act as a structural and functional unit of Covid-19 dealing with monitoring, surveillance, checking of all the ILI cases, ambulances and hospitals,” he added. He also said the committees will comprise one member each from the Health department, police department, municipalities or Panchayat, volunteers, valveman. The committee will have five to six members. The principal secretary in the Village Development and Panchayat Raj department L K Ateeq has been appointed as the nodal officer to manage the task force in the rural areas whereas in the urban areas, the Urban Development secretary, the municipal administration directors and the municipal commissioner will form the local task force. “In Bengaluru alone 8,800 teams will be formed, which will be coterminous with the 8,800 booths in the city. They will provide the real-time data. They will be imparted training,” the minister added. Noting that there were about 8,800 electoral booths in Bengaluru city and each booth will have a task force committee, he said a nodal officer has been appointed to oversee this. The state level task force also came out with a slew of conditions. As far as home isolation is concerned, it would apply for patients who are below 50 years and have no symptoms of any other disease, and their homes should have a toilet and have an attendant. He also said home isolation duration has been increased from 14 to 17 days. “People should not get fever in the next three days after completing 14 days, else they will be quarantined for another seven days. If they don’t get fever then they will be freed to perform their personal activities,” Sudhakar said. Those who are above 50 years and have comorbidities, will be treated at the COVID care centres only and they will be under medical supervision and be subjected to regular tests. The state is also making arrangements for telecommunication for those who are asymptomatic but wish to speak to a doctor. It was also decided to have at least two ambulances in each of the 198 wards of Bengaluru. The minister said the additional commissioner of police (traffic) will be the nodal officer to coordinate the movement of ambulances. The task force has also appointed a nodal officer to manage the hospitals based on the availability of beds and ventilators. The officer will provide real time information about beds. “We want to make sure that no one has to run from one hospital to another,” Sudhakar said. On the cremation of the bodies, Sudhakar said guidelines have been issued on how to handle bodies at mortuaries, taking them in the ambulances, human treatment to the deceased while performing the last rites and fumigation of the bed. “Legal action will be taken against those who treat bodies in an inhuman way,” Sudhakar said. The state-level task force has also decided to arrange for test reports within 24 hours. It has also been decided to increase the testing capacity from the existing 15,000 a day to 25,000. In view of the spurt in Covid-19 cases, the task force also recommended antigen tests in crowded areas to check whether there was community spread. To a question on closing down the border, the minister said there is no question of lockdown. “We cannot hide from this disease. It is not a solution.We have to live with it now, yet maintain a distance from it,” he added. Sudhakar, who is a doctor himself, said Covid-19 is not as deadly a virus as those he had seen in the past and asked people not to be scared of it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-task-force-recommends-booth-level-committees-to-fight-covid-19/story-rz0Mn29CFvP0xpAgBKJD0I.html

04-07-2020||Lucknow||Kanpur firing: Crackdown on criminals ordered a month ago||A month ago, director general of police HC Awasthi expressed concern over attacks by criminals on police personnel.In a circular issued on June 4, the state police chief directed police of all the districts, as well as the commissioners of police of Lucknow and Noida, to crack down on criminal elements to check recurrence of such incidents. The increasing attacks on the police put a question mark on the leadership of superintendents of police and other senior officers posted in police ranges and zones, he said.Awasthi said criminal gangs attacked police teams to escape from the spot or to get criminals released from police custody.In many cases, it was observed that a delay in cases of murder, kidnapping, rape or biased action by policemen provoked criminal elements to target police personnel. Lack of strict action boosted the morale of criminals, he said. Police officers should coordinate with influential local people and people’s representatives, Awasthi said. Attacks on police personnel not only made an adverse impact on their morale but also on their image, he noted. Police officers should move with adequate force o take on the gangsters, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/kanpur-firing-crackdown-on-criminals-ordered-a-month-ago/story-jIt1HTc4pe2zuDa1a4eeCO.html
04-07-2020||City||Firing from rooftop, shot point blank: How they were killed||The brutality with which Vikas Dubey and his armed band of criminals murdered the eight policemen in a well-laid ambush indicates that he had decided to kill them right at the moment they stepped onto this turf.Dubey and other criminals did not merely keep firing indiscriminately from the rooftops but also took their aim carefully and targeted the policemen by going after them and shooting them point blank in the head and the chest — to ensure their immediate death.Police officers, who managed to build sequence of events that led to this carnage, said the team came under heavy firing as soon as they crossed the JCB blockade which Dubey had laid as a part of his ambush strategy.Taken by surprise, team of cops looked for cover in the middle of village as they could not have gone back due to the JCB and their own vehicles blocking the four foot wide concrete road.Five policemen had taken shelter in small 2x5 foot toilet, just few metres away from Dubey’s house.A group of criminals kept firing at the structure not allowing the cops crammed in that small space to retaliate.Another group reached the front of the toilet and killed them.No less than four constables were shot multiple times in the back and the chest and the sub-inspector Nebulal with them who was behind them had one gun-shot, said the officials.Sub inspector Atul Singh was shot multiple times outside the Dubey’s old house in which he was trying to get in.Station officer Shivrajpur Mahesh Yadav had managed to enter the house of Prem Prakash Pandey and hid himself behind the gunny sacks. He was shot seven times in the back and chest by criminals who came off the roof tops. Dubey and few of his men cornered circle officer Mishra inside the house of Pandey. He had jumped the wall to get in the open space when Dubey arrived with an axe. He hit him with it many a times on leg and other parts of the body. As he lay on the ground Dubey shot him in the head and walked out of the house, officials said.In the village, the walls of the houses bear the testimony of vehemence with which the criminals acted and fired in all the directions.“It is clear that right from the beginning Dubey did not want anyone to leave the village alive; he wanted them dead. That is why the criminals shot the policemen not one but many times to make sure they are dead. They were brutal,” said a senior officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/firing-from-rooftop-shot-point-blank-how-they-were-killed/story-nZMyLvlK8SuFZd3YW9gSaP.html
04-07-2020||Lucknow||Kanpur firing: Ambush readiness hints at presence of mole in police dept||Was it the failure of the police leadership in planning the raid or did a mole in the police department inform Vikas Dubey and his men, helping them plan an ambush? There are many questions being raised in connection with the attack on the police team that killed eight cops, including a deputy SP and a station officer, in Kanpur early Friday morning..Local police personnel were well aware about Vikas Dubey, who has over 60 criminal cases against him since 1997 and is high headed and daring. His habit of harbouring criminals at his house in Bikru village was known to everyone and also the existing firepower with him.Some said the police team was ill-prepared despite knowing the background of Dubey and fell to bullets fired by criminals from the rooftop of his house. They said it was the failure of the local police leadership that they did not plan the raid properly leading to so many mortalities.A source in the police department, however, said the initial investigation hinted that Dubey was well aware about the police raid at his house and prepared to deal with it.“Dubey was apparently tipped off by his men in the police department about the force from three police stations Bilhaur, Bithoor and Chaubeypur moving towards his village. He and his men blocked the main entrance of the village by placing an heavy earth moving machine before the police team reached there,” he said and added, “Following this, the police personnel came out of their vehicles and walked to Dubey’s house”. He said Vikas Dubey and his accomplices, who were well prepared, opened indiscriminate fire on the police team when they tried to enter his fortress-like house in the village. Special Task Force (STF) are trying to nab Vikas Dubey and the mole who leaked the information about the police movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/july-4-ambush/story-VmboNPYTnxQk0zKmDxJyXM.html
04-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots charge sheet: Hindus incited on WhatsApp group to attack Muslims||On the second day of the riots in North East Delhi on February 25, a group of men created a WhatsApp group — Kattar Hindut Ekta — and asked all Hindu residents to attack Muslims, according to Delhi Police’s charge sheet filed in a city court on Tuesday. Police said the charge sheet is related to FIR No 102/20 registered at the Gokalpuri police station in connection with the murder of Hamza, who is referred to by a single name in the police records, who was among the nine Muslim men whose bodies were recovered from the Bhagirathi Vihar drain on February 25 and 26. Police arrested nine men, Lokesh Solanki, Pankaj Sharma, Sumit Chaudhary, Ankit Chaudhary, Prince, Jatin Sharma, Rishab Chaudhary, Vivek Panchal, and Himanshu Thakur. The nine are currently in jail. Police said that the administrator of the WhatsApp group -- initially there were 125 members -- brought together other rioters. The charge sheet also mentions that on February 26, at 11.39 pm, Solanki posted a message where he claimed that he and his “team” could come from “Ganga Vihar” and that they had “arms and ammunition.” Ganga Vihar adjoins Bagirathi Vihar. According to the charge sheet, Solanki’s second message at 11.44 pm claims that he and his team have killed “two Muslims” and thrown their bodies in the drain. The court is yet to take cognisance of the charge sheet and the arrested persons are yet to reply through the lawyer. The counsels for the accused persons will appear before the court and make the submission after the court takes cognisance.The charge sheet adds that the group murdered nine Muslims in all. The charge sheet also mentions how the men assaulted the Muslim residents.“Their modus operandi was that they used to catch the people and ascertain their religion by asking name, address and identity card. They were forcing them to call out “Jai Shri Ram’ many times.” Those with a Muslim name in the ID card, and who refused to chant the slogan were “ bluntly attacked and thrown into the Bhagirathi Vihar drain,” the charge sheet says. Delhi Police has filed at least 111 charge sheets thus far in connection with the riots, in which they have named 650 people. At least 53 persons died while around 400 were injured in the riots that broke out in parts of North East Delhi. Police in the charge sheets have alleged that the riots were planned by student activists, locals politicians, and some activists of the anti Citizenship Amendment Protests. Student leaders from Jamia Millia Islamia and JNU have been arrested in connection with the riots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-charge-sheet-hindus-incited-on-whatsapp-group-to-attack-muslims/story-O5FgWKrf2xAM8kIOxDqJVO.html
04-07-2020||Mumbai||Submit details of incidents similar to what happened at Sion hospital: Bombay HC to BJP legislator||The Bombay high court (HC) directed Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Ashish Shelar to submit the details of other instances in which the bodies of Covid-19 patients were left unattended in the wards of civic and government-run hospitals.Referring to a video of Sion Hospital in which the bodies of Covid-19 victims were lying on beds or floor of the ward where patients infected with the virus were being treated, Shelar in his petition claimed that similar scenes were played out at other facilities too.As the court was informed by the state that the Supreme Court was already seized of petitions relating to management and disposal of bodies of Covid-19 victims, it posted the hearing of the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the BJP legislator to July 23, after the hearing in the Apex court was completed.On Friday, the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice NJ Jamadar was informed by the state through advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni that the HC did not have a propriety in the PIL as the SC was already hearing petitions related to issues similar to what was raised by Shelar in his PIL. The state also submitted that it was following the guidelines issued by the Centre over the disposal and management of bodies of Covid-19 patients. However, senior counsel Rajendra Pai, along with advocates Akshay Pai and Omkar Khanvilkar, who appeared for Shelar, submitted that as the bench widened the scope of the petition in light of the instances similar to that of Sion Hospital, they wanted to submit the same in the form of an affidavit and hence the hearing of the PIL should be deferred.After hearing the submissions, the court directed Shelar to submit videos and information of other instances in an affidavit and also directed the state to file a rejoinder, if any, before the next hearing.In the earlier hearing, the state and BMC submitted the report of the committee that was constituted to probe into the video of the Sion hospital incident. Shelar’s counsel then sought a probe by the committee into the other instances of the alleged mismanagement too that were mentioned in the PIL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/submit-details-of-incidents-similar-to-what-happened-at-sion-hospital-bombay-hc-to-bjp-legislator/story-JbvYK44afKgXh5n7h1QfuN.html
04-07-2020||City||More people turning towards smaller cities with more green spaces: Survey||An international research survey has found that one of the impacts of the Covid-19 outbreak is that more people are thinking about living in smaller cities than metropolises, and seeking green and open spaces. The survey spoke to over 550 decision-makers, policy experts and business owners in over 45 countries, including India. Titled “Project Impact: Impact of Covid-19 on Cities and Mobility”, the survey was conducted between May 1 and June 7, via questionnaire and interviews by global think tank Cities Forum, Gujarat-based CEPT Research and Development Foundation (CDRF); GIZ, a German development agency, and Ideal Management Consultants. Subjects shared their responses via questionnaires and interviews. The survey found 89% of respondents felt cities need to invest more in cycling and walking infrastructure and 76% felt working remotely had made them question the decision to live in big cities. “There is a strong likelihood of people preferring to live in smaller cities rather than large cities,” reads the report, adding that 88% feel inclined to working and living in areas with more green and open spaces. Of the experts, 49% predicted smaller cities with lower densities will be preferable in the immediate future. Shailendra Kaushik, co-founder, Cities Forum, said, “Many experts believe that the trend of shifting to smaller cities has already begun. This will also result in land-use changes in cities where mixed-neighbourhoods will be preferred and there will be a reduction in overall mobility demand.” Respondents said public transit trips will not return to pre-Covid levels immediately and the confidence to travel in public transport will only increase gradually. PRK Murthy, director (projects), Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, has been quoted in the report saying, “I expect there would be drastic reductions in the demand for public transport. The demand for public transport would be less in the first two to five years and in the long term, after five years, the demand for public transport is expected to reach pre Covid-19 levels.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/more-people-turning-towards-smaller-cities-with-more-green-spaces-survey/story-BfJF9N28cXBwKQps4b5txM.html

The bidders quoted almost three times what the government had expected. RDD has now asked district administrations to procure Arsenicum Album 30 at their level and distribute it.In June, RDD had planned to distribute Arsenicum Album 30 in rural areas and expected each bottle to be priced between Rs 8 and Rs18. RDD minister Hasan Mushrif said this decision followed the ministry for Ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, siddha and homeopathy (Ayush) recommending the drug as a prophylactic. To this end, RDD had decided to use Rs 25 crore accumulated from unutilised grants given by 13th and 14th finance commissions over the last 10 years for development of rural areas. However, the two qualified bidders quoted Rs 23.92 and Rs 23.74 for a bottle of 100 pills. “The rates were higher than expectation as it involved packing and transportation of the drug across the state,” said an RDD officer on condition of anonymity.When RDD learnt some local bodies, including the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), had procured the stock at much lower prices, it decided to scrap the bidding process. “The bidding process started around three weeks ago and there was high fluctuation in price of the pills when it was underway. Instead of going into more negotiations, we decided to ask the district administration to procure and distribute,” said Arvind Kumar, principal secretary, RDD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-s-plan-to-buy-homeopathic-pills-fails-as-bidders-quote-higher-prices/story-fckj3Tn4Z7J9hYyTibEKKI.html

For ICSE students, an average of the marks of a candidate’s three best papers along with the percentage of marks that the student secured in the internal assessment of the respective subject will be considered while calculating the marks of the papers that were cancelled owing to the Covid-19 outbreak. For ISC students, the board will calculate the average of best three percentage marks along with the percentage obtained by the candidate in project and practical work in the subjects will be considered to score the pending papers.In the circular, the board stated that it arrived at the marking formula with the help of reputed statisticians from premiere institutes in the country.“Detailed analyses were performed on the data from the past board examinations from the years 2015 to 2019 as well as the year 2020 board examination. Extensive scenario analyses were done based on different papers. Most importantly, the weights were chosen so as to ensure fairness to all the candidates appearing in the board examination this year to the best possible extent,” the website stated.School principals said they were yet to hear from the board officially.“The formula is a very detailed one and we would need some time to understand it carefully. We will also await further guidelines from the board on this,” said Kavita Sanghvi, principal at the Chatrabhuj Narsee Memorial School in Vile Parle.On June 3, the state asked CISCE to cancel the remaining ICSE and ISC papers or postpone them further. The board agreed to cancel the exams in the state, following a petition filed by a Mumbai-based and extend the cancellation across the country while responding to a petition in the Apex court.Around 23,000 students have registered for the ICSE (Class 10) and ISC (Class 12) exams from the state this year.Meanwhile, the board also announced to reduce the syllabus for Class 9 to Class 12 owing to the significant shortening of the academic year and the loss of instruction hours. Students can find the revised syllabus on the board’s official website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/marking-scheme-for-pending-icse-and-isc-exams-released/story-dvgMl05L5syZKjViGWQcON.html

All the colleagues in the cabinet are with the CM on the steps that he is taking to control the Covid -19 outbreak situation. There are always some differences in every house. As per the instructions of our leader Sharad Pawar, it is our responsibility to extend full support to CM,” Awhad said.He made the statement at Navi Mumbai on Friday, while reviewing the Covid-19 situation in the city. The minister also informed that two new testing labs will be set up in Navi Mumbai in a week’s time.“Thane guardian minister Eknath Shinde informed that the testing facilities in the city need to be ramped up. So I issued instructions to increase swab and antigen testing facilities, procurement of more medicines and increase in the number of ventilator and oxygen beds. I asked NMMC civic commissioner Annasaheb Misal to ensure that at least two testing labs in the city are functional in by next week. The doubling rate is reducing and hopefully the spread of the virus will reduce in the region,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-differences-with-maharashtra-cm-says-ncp-minister/story-pBYb4aml5SQAKfOHLtIw9J.html
04-07-2020||City||Maharashtra CM, Sharad Pawar meet amid talks of discontent in MVA govt||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) supremo Sharad Pawar met chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray at the proposed Bal Thackeray memorial site in Dadar on Friday, amid reports of discontent among the three ruling partners over the decision-making process pertaining to the lockdown orders and the rising Covid-19 cases. The duo reportedly discussed on a range of issues, including the resumption of activities for the revival of the economy, containment of the virus spread and coordination between the three parties of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance.District administrations and some of the civic bodies across the state imposed a stricter lockdown soon after CM announced an extension of the ongoing lockdown on Sunday, while hinting at more relaxations. With different authorities imposing different rules, there is confusion and anger among the citizens, and the state ministers from the Congress and NCP also expressed their discontent over it, claiming that they were not taken into confidence over it. A section of the ministers from the two parties also complained about the dominance of the bureaucracy in the MVA government. The ministers cited the recent notification to extend the lockdown issued by the then chief secretary Ajoy Mehta on June 29, without keeping the leaders from two parties in the loop. “Mehta is appointed as the chief advisor to the CM after he retired as CS [chief secretary] on June 30. His appointment in the CMO [chief minister’s office] was opposed by the Congress and NCP. We fear that the dominance of the bureaucracy may only continue after this development. The Congress raised a similar complaint with the CM when some leaders met him two weeks ago. We want the ministers to be taken up into confidence while taking decisions related to larger public interest. Pawarsaheb is expected to have discussed these issues with the CM,” an NCP leader said.Pawar also reportedly discussed the rising number of cases in the state and the steps that need to be taken. Though the NCP chief is in favour of more relaxations for industrial and commercial activities to ensure the revival of the economy, he also expressed his reservations over relaxations in areas that are seeing a spike in the cases. “He, however, pressed for the need to avoid the confusion among the people over the lockdown curbs as was witnessed this week. It appeared that the political leadership and the administration were not on the same page while taking lockdown-related decisions,” the leader said. While Mumbai Police prohibited citizens from venturing beyond the 2-km radius of their homes except in the case of emergencies and to go to work, some other municipal bodies imposed a curfew-like lockdown for eight to 10 days. According to a Congress leader, the police’s 2-km rule did not go well with many in the state cabinet. The leader said that even Sena leaders are not happy with certain measures. “There are differences within the Sena leadership over the lockdown implementation in Thane and even over the bureaucratic reshuffle. However, things have been improving and it is not as bitter as it is being projected outside,” the leader said.Nashik, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg, by using the power delegated to local authorities, in an order early this week also imposed stricter norms. On June 18, ministers from Congress, Balasaheb Thorat and Ashok Chavan, met CM with their grievances and demanded an equal share in decision-making. The two parties also demanded for better coordination among the ruling parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-cm-sharad-pawar-meet-amid-talks-of-discontent-in-mva/story-XitlHdmcTodxBtEvpQhdqI.html
04-07-2020||City||Thane’s Covid-19 cases inching towards the 10K-mark||Thane on Friday recorded 420 cases and 17 deaths, its highest-ever 24-hour spike, which took the total number of positive cases to 9,950 and deaths to 350. However, Thane also recorded a recovery rate of 51% on Friday. Although the recovery rate is 51% in the city, a spike in the number of cases was observed this week, owing to which the city is under a complete lockdown till July 12.“Effective measures are in place to ensure a control over the increasing number of cases in the city. We are conducting door-to-door screenings and thermal scans. The number of cases rose after we eased certain lockdown measures. Many who are a part of the essential services also travel work. If they contract the virus, then their families too are infected,” said Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner, Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC). The civic body believes that enforcing a strict lockdown will be one of the biggest measures to break the chain and control the spread of the virus. Last month, areas such as Mumbra, Lokmanya Nagar and Savarkar Nagar remained the hot spots, but on Friday, the cases showed a surge in areas such as Naupada, Kopri, Majiwada and Manpada.At neighbouring Kalyan and Dombivli, the total cases reached 8,049 cases on Friday after 564 new cases were reported from the twin cities. With three new deaths, the toll surged to 130. Like Thane, Panvel too on Friday recorded its highest single-day rise of 186 new Covid-19 cases. The total cases shot up to 2,587 with the new cases, while one person also died due to the virus, taking the total deaths to 80.A day before Navi Mumbai goes into the 10-day lockdown, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) on Friday reported its third highest single-day spike of 257 Covid-19 cases. A total of 7,345 cases were reported in areas under the NMMC’s jurisdiction till Friday. The eight deaths on Friday took the toll to 232.In Navi Mumbai, Kopar Khairane reported the most cases (61) on Friday, while 46 cases were seen in Airoli and 43 in Ghansoli. The recovery rate in the city is 56% now, with 152 people discharged after recovery on Friday.

04-07-2020||Mumbai||HC sets aside decision of AAI’s appellate committee on maximum permissible height||The Bombay high court has set aside a 2019 decision of the appellate committee of the Airport Authority of India (AAI) wherein it restricted the maximum permissible height of buildings coming up within the two-kilometre radius of any of the two Airport Surveillance Radars (ASR) of the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport. Three developers who were developing properties beyond the two-kilometre radius of one of the ASR were aggrieved as the AAI said that the committee’s decision on height restriction would apply to them and they would not get a No Objection Certificate unless they complied with the committee’s decision. The court however held that the decision to frame rules was the prerogative of the central government and the committee had acted beyond its jurisdiction while taking the decision and hence set it aside.A division bench of justice S J Kathawalla and justice BP Colabawalla while passing judgement on the petitions filed by Kalpataru Ltd, Klassik Homes Pvt Ltd and United Industrial House Premises Cooperative Society Ltd observed that the appellate committee lacked jurisdiction to impose conditions or formulate rules as it did not have rulemaking or general administrative powers.In April 2018, the Central Government had proposed to amend the Height Restrictions for Safeguarding of Aircraft Operations) Rules, 2015 and had sought suggestions and objections. One of the proposed amendment was to make the maximum permissible height available to a plot under development, only if it is at a distance of more than or beyond two kilometres from all the ASR’s that service an airport, where there are more than one ASR’s. The appellate committee was constituted in 2019 to consider the suggestions and objections and convey the same to the central government.On April 23, 2019, the Appellate Committee, after considering the objections and suggestions received decided to adopt the said proposed amendment based on Draft 2018 rules. As a result, the maximum height permissible was reduced from what was allowed as per the 2015 Rules.The three developers had approached the AAI in May, 2019 seeking a NOC for grant of highest permissible top elevation for their projects based on the 2015 Rules which were in force at the time of making the application. However, three months after receiving the applications the AAI responded asking the developers to abide by the April 2019 decision of the committee. This implied that they would get reduced maximum height permissible. Aggrieved by this the developers moved the HC.While submitting on behalf of Kalpataru, senior counsel Virag Tulzapurkar apprised the court that the Appellate Committee decision was without any legal authority or jurisdiction. However, additional solicitor general Anil Singh for AAI and union of India opposed the submissions and said that the petitions were not maintainable as the developers had an alternative remedy available for redressal of their grievances. Singh further submitted that due to high degree of air traffic congestion and density at the Mumbai Airport, higher standards of safety need to be maintained and therefore the Appellate Committee took such a decision.After hearing all sides the bench observed, “We are of the view that said the decision is entirely without the authority of law and in excess of the jurisdiction and power of the Appellate Committee. It is clear that in taking such a decision the Appellate Committee was not acting as an appellate forum or authority exercising any quasi-judicial functions, for which purpose alone it was constituted under the 2015 Rules.” After setting aside the decision of the committee, the bench noted that it did not mean that it was issuing any directions to the AAI to grant NOC of any particular height and said that AAI can consider the applications for grant of NOC afresh within a period of four weeks as per the existing laws and regulations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-sets-aside-decision-of-aai-s-appellate-committee-on-maximum-permissible-height/story-iZuDs43kqIJxWVjyHVLNBP.html

They were denied salaries by their employers and had been in contact with me for the past few days.”“I apprised the officials in the ministry of affairs of the same and these people have returned to the country, but what about others? The state government should take up the matter with the union government and arrangements should be made to bring back stranded people from Arab countries and provide concessional air tickets to them,” he added.“ The returnees also have lists of names of stranded persons and will forward those to the state government,” said Bains.Bains alleged that chief minister (CM) Captain Amarinder Singh had failed to perform his duty and it seemed like he had isolated himself due to the pandemic.CM should appoint a deputy CM in the state so that the government can perform its duties, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bring-back-residents-from-arab-countries-ludhiana-mla/story-pB6anKeqXb7LrrfpLUN5uJ.html

The 71-year-old was admitted to Guru Nanak Hospital on June 17, after she complained of breathlessness. She was buried at a cemetery in Malad. Khan rose to fame in the 1980s and 90s, when she collaborated with top stars Sridevi, Madhuri Dixit and Juhi Chawla. Juhi Chawla remembers ‘Bollywood’s Masterji’I have many memories of working with her from early in my career up to a TV show, Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 3, in 2009. Saroj ji was sheer magic, when she danced or choreographed. You couldn’t take your eyes off her when she began to dance. Her sensibilities regarding direction of a shot in a song, expressions and movements were superlative. She had a fine sense of humour and we bonded over that. She was top-notch whether it was the way she took the shot, or how she wanted an actor to perform, or guiding them on how to dress up in a song.The first time I worked with her was for the song, Lagi Aaj Saavan ki fir who jhadi hai, from Chandni. We were shooting in Chandivli studios. I was relatively new and anxious to shoot for a Yash Chopra film and with the top choreographer of the time, Saroj ji. Thankfully, every take was okayed after one or two takes. Then we shot many songs, including some of my most famous ones. I remember shooting for Hum Hain Rahi Pyaar Ke title song, Main koi aisa geet gaoon from Yes Boss, Ishq Hua from Ishq, songs in Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman and a few others.I remember she shot ‘Main teri rani tu raja mera’ in Lootere. I was coming from Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, so from ghagra choli to just a shirt was an image makeover. When I saw how Masterji shot it and how the song turned out, I was amazed. Saroj ji could make everything look classy. That was her gift. She had the finesse to make a seductive song look good and not cheap. Another song that I remember was in Karobaar. We were shooting in South Africa with Anil Kapoor ji and Rishi Kapoor ji and Rakesh Roshanji was directing us. I remember crying and insisting that I would feel comfortable shooting the song only with Sarojji. Rakesh ji was kind and called her up. She was in India, shooting for some other film and came after a few days. In the 1990s, she was booked and overbooked at times too. Whenever I worked with her, it would take me a day or two to get into the groove and in the next two days, the song would be over, and then we would connect after six months on the next song. I loved working with her, but was always anxious.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/saroj-khan-made-every-dance-move-look-classy/story-5r55ltdjRbqaFv7F2nZ1TN.html
04-07-2020||City||Covid-19 outbreak: Mumbai’s recovery rate touches 63%||The recovery rate of Covid-19 in Mumbai has jumped to 63% from 55% within a week. As of Friday, of the 82,074 total Covid-19 cases, 52,392 patients have recovered and have been discharged. On Thursday, over 5000 patients were discharged in Mumbai, the highest in a single day. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) commissioner IS Chahal said on Friday morning, “Despite a cumulative figure of 80,600 positives in Mumbai today, our discharged patients are now 50,600 – a staggering 63%. We have only 9,500 patients on hospital beds, including 874 suspected walk-in patients.”Experts and doctors have posed questions about whether patients are being discharged early and need to continue with institutional quarantine or hospitalisation longer. On the other hand, they have stressed the need to keep hospital beds available at all times. Keeping mild or moderately symptomatic patients on beds in hospitals or Covid health centres longer than the present time prescribed by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) may lead to Mumbai facing a shortage of beds, according to public health experts.Chahal said, “Mumbai’s discharge policy for Covid-19 patients is strictly as per ICMR guidelines, with zero exceptions.” According to the current discharge policy of the state government, mild and very mild Covid-19 patients can be discharged on the 10th day, if they have not shown any fever for three days in a row. Moderate symptomatic patients can be discharged after 10 days provided they have oxygen saturation above 95% for four days; if not, such patients can be discharged after their symptoms have resolved and oxygen saturation is maintained for three days in a row. For severely ill patients, discharge is allowed after complete recovery and a negative result on a Covid-19 test. Asymptomatic patients can opt for home quarantine, or are discharged from institutional quarantine facilities on the 7th or 8th day.According to a member of the task force of doctors appointed by the state government in April to curb rising fatality, Covid-19 patients have died after being discharged too and health workers must follow up with patients for 14 days after discharge.However, IS Chahal denied that this holds true for Mumbai.Madhav Sathe, retired professor of microbiology at Nair Hospital,, said, “It is better if a patient stays in a hospital for 14 days. After recovery, even though Covid-19 is cured, whatever immune modulation has taken place remains. Patients are hence afflicted by a phenomenon called cytokine storm that leads to formation of clots in blood vessels. This is called intra-vascular coagulation and can be fatal. In such cases, it is better to keep the patient in the hospital.” Sathe said, “When a patient is being discharged, it should be done after giving him medicines for 10 to 12 days, and follow up is needed for all patients because medicines have to be chosen with a lot of precision.” Sanjay Pattiwar, a city-based public health consultant, said, “Considering the work load and patient load, it is necessary to follow the guidelines for discharge. The criterion is whoever can manage at home with counselling for seven days can follow home quarantine. Those who do not show symptoms can be discharged, so that beds are made available for new patients.”Mumbai on Friday registered 1,338 new Covid-19 cases and 73 deaths. The total number of cases in Mumbai is now 82,074 after adding 37 cases recorded earlier; and total deaths are 4,762. The growth rate of cases in Mumbai is 1.72%, and the doubling rate is 41 days.The city has 13,422 Covid-19 beds in hospitals for serious and critical patients with other health complications, of which 3,871 were vacant as of Friday morning. Civic officials said 127 ICU beds and 67 ventilator ICU beds are vacant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-outbreak-mumbai-s-recovery-rate-touches-63/story-byu6NSQNacTpqVDYNLk5TJ.html
04-07-2020||Mumbai||State BJP chief appoints new executive committee for Maharashtra||State Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Chandrakant Patil on Friday announced the new executive committee for Maharashtra, even as he clarified that former minister and Other Backward Class (OBC) leader Pankaja Munde would be given a “national role” in the party. The jumbo state executive includes 12 vice-presidents, five general secretaries, 12 secretaries, a treasurer, an organisational secretary and 68 executive committee members. Besides, there are another 139 invitees and 58 special invitees.Munde, daughter of senior BJP leader, the late Gopinath Munde, who lost the state Assembly polls last year, was said to be sulking and had post results pointed to internal factionalism and centralisation of powers within the state unit. “Pankaja Munde is set to get a role at the national level soon. This was indicated to us by the Centre. She will also continue to be a part of our state core committee and work side by side with us,” said Patil, at a press conference in Mumbai. “The state executive has been formed after much deliberation and aims to ensure fair regional and community representation to all our party leaders.”Munde, who congratulated the new executive on Twitter, also thanked Patil for announcing that she would have a role to play at the national level.The new organisational announcement has been pending since Patil was appointed the state chief last July. The new state executive committee is a bid to accommodate a majority of its established leadership, including those who had been sidelined last year ahead of the polls. But the key positions like appointments of general secretaries shows that leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis continues to call the shots in the party organisation.Chandrashekhar Bawankule, a former minister from Vidarbha, who had been denied state assembly ticket and is said to have cost the party vis-a-vis seats in the region, has been rehabilitated as one of the five general secretaries. The other general secretaries include two-time Nashik legislator Devyani Farande, Sujitsigh Thakur (second stint), former state minister Ravindra Chavan and former officer on special duty to chief minister, Shrikant Bharatiya.Other sidelined senior leaders like Vinod Tawde and Eknath Khadse who were also denied tickets have been accommodated, but only as special invitees to the executive committee. Khadse’s daughter-in-law Raksha Khadse has been named the state secretary, while Munde’s sister Pritam Munde has been made a vice-president. The other vice-presidents include former ministers Ram Shinde (who lost polls), Jaykumar Rawal, former chief spokesperson Madhav Bhandari, Prasad Lad, Suresh Halwankar etc.The party has also given a leg-up to former media incharge and spokesperson Keshav Upadhayay as the chief spokesperson of the state BJP.BJP MLA from Mulund Mihir Kotecha is the new treasurer of the party, while the organisational secretary post continues to be with Vijay Puranik. “An overall assessment of the state executive shows a clear imprint of Fadnavis, who has ensured people close to him are given relevant posts. But it’s also a balancing act to not alienate anyone,’’ said a senior party leader and state functionary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-bjp-chief-appoints-new-executive-committee-for-maharashtra/story-xz9AF1WpcvWyshhHDV6erJ.html

04-07-2020||Mumbai||Former customs officer convicted in graft case||The special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court on Friday convicted former customs officer in a bribery case registered in 2002. The officer had absconded and was lived in Uttar Pradesh under a false identity. He was caught in March last year.CBI had registered the case against accused Abhinav Singh, then appraising officer of the customs, and Samdarshi Jaiswal along with few companies for cheating, conspiracy and corruption.Singh was found guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment for the period he has already spent in jail since his arrest. While the prime accused Jaiswal died during the trial.As per the CBI case, 18 duty entitlement pass book (DEPB) scrips from the office of joint director general of foreign trade (DGFT) in the name of four companies, forged shipping bills and forged bank realisation certificate were recovered. The scrips were sold by Jaiswal to various parties. Out of 18, 17 were dishonestly utilised for import of goods, which caused a loss of around ₹4 crores to the Government of India.As a part of the conspiracy, Singh was accused of abusing his position as appraising customs officer. He allegedly confirmed the genuineness of the past exports against few of the DEPB scrips and also corresponding documents. This, the CBI claimed, was done by Singh after accepting a bribe from Jaiswal. The agency alleged that Singh had accepted the car from the accused as a bribe.The CBI prosecutor Jitendra Kumar pointed out that the accused played a key role. However, he contended that the main accused died pending the trial. Singh was arrested in 2002 when CBI first registered the case but later absconded.It was revealed that after his escape, he shifted to Uttar Pradesh and worked as a professor in a medical college. He was arrested in March last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/former-customs-officer-convicted-in-graft-case/story-wO7MTabHFUlyd67QiNxwqL.html

He remained in the civic-run Cooper Hospital for a month and moved back to his hometown in Jhunjhunu in Rajasthan. “I took very long to recover. I came back to my hometown and wanted to go back. However, my hands never healed completely. The company where I worked in Mumbai wouldn’t have taken me back,” he said.Shikhawat then started to work at a garment shop in Jhunjhunu, handling receipts and cash. “I could only do limited work because my hands were severely damaged. But owing to the lockdown, the shop too was shut. Amid the lockdown, I am struggling to even get odd jobs,” said Shikhawat.Shikhawat received ₹1 lakh compensation from the Western Railway. Shikhawat is now dependent on the family’s farm to support his wife and two children, but that income too gets divided among other members of the family. On the fateful day, two people lost their lives as a part of the bridge collapsed, while Shikhawat was among the three injured.The 45-year-old was heading to his factory in the western suburbs where he worked as a security guard. As the pathway collapsed, Shikhawat fell inside the rubble on to the railway tracks. “The incident is still fresh in my mind. I was walking on the bridge and directly collapsed onto the railway tracks. I was under the debris the next minute. People rushed to help and pulled me out of the debris.”A detailed report by the Western Railway later revealed the collapse was due to heavy corrosion and increased weight of utilities on the bridge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/gokhale-bridge-collapse-survivor-continues-to-struggle-lockdown-worsens-his-woes/story-X6XQ3UFM4hlzj9uAc0IwhJ.html

04-07-2020||City||No funds released to contractor, construction of Ludhiana govt school building comes to standstill||The construction work of the new building for the Government School at Millerganj came to a standstill on Friday after the state education department failed to release funds to the contractor.The foundation stone of the Rs 2-crore project was laid at the site last year in June. A three-storey building consisting of 17 classrooms is slated to be constructed at the site.However, a visit to the site revealed that only the piling work was done and the contractor had spent Rs 35 lakh from his own pocket. The workers stated that earlier due to the lockdown, the construction had come to a halt. After it was resumed last month, the piling work was done.Kuldeep Sood of RS Builder and Contractor said, “We started the construction work a week before the lockdown was imposed and had to stop after that. We resumed work a month ago and have completed the piling work so far. Labour has to be paid, but the higher authorities have not released even a penny.”District education officer, secondary, Swaranjit Kaur, said, “The plan of the building has been finalised and the foundation work has started. I will check with the public works department engineer regarding the funds; the state education department sends funds for construction of new classrooms.”In 2014, 13 classrooms of the government school at Millerganj had been declared unsafe by the public works department after which the 300-odd students of classes 1 to 8 were shifted to another building and the former structure was demolished.Only last year, the state education department had decided to come up with a new government school and to utilise this land to construct a new building. In Millerganj area, there is one government senior secondary school that caters to students from nearby areas that has been running in double shifts for the last six years.The school education secretary, Krishan Kumar, could not be reached for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-funds-released-to-contractor-construction-of-ludhiana-govt-school-building-comes-to-standstill/story-kS4IxpBeFH6KiRY3P9WZEK.html
04-07-2020||Chandigarh||Unavailability of gadgets, kids’ increased screen time rising concerns among parents in Ludhiana||At a time when Covid-19 has disrupted the school academic year, teachers are focusing on e-learning methods on digital platforms to stay connected with students.With schools in the district slated to remain closed till July 31, some households are faced with an academic blackout in the absence of technology.Harmeet Kaur Waraich, principal of Nankana Sahib Public School, said, “Online classes are the best option to connect with the students, and teachers are working hard to prepare the lessons. For primary classes, sessions are conducted once a week, for others, three times a week. Recorded lectures are also being sent to the students.”Paramjit Kaur, principal of BCM Arya Model Senior Secondary School, Shastri Nagar, said, “With everything going digital, we need to assure efficiency in learning methods, too. Teachers are making a lot of efforts to conduct classes and sufficient breaks are being given to students after every class to relax.”For teachers, too, preparing videos and taking classes online is a challenge. A teacher of a private school, Ankita Khosla, said, “Being a mathematics teacher, I have to take three classes in a day. To conduct them, I prepare videos and gather a lot of content to bring clarity to the students regarding the topic. I follow a proper schedule and remain in touch with my students.”However, parents argue that due to the unavailability of smartphones and computers/laptops, many students are unable to attend the online classes. Besides, there is growing concern about the increasing screen time of students.A parent, Gurminder Kaur, said, “I have two kids and both of them have been asked by the school authorities to attend online classes from 8.30am to 11.30am from July 1. Earlier, the schools were sending only online material and no interactive classes were conducted. We do not have a computer or laptop at home, and my elder daughter uses my phone to attend the class, while the other one has to miss the class. I have raised this issue with the class teacher, but it is not possible for them to change the timings.”Another parent, Ishneet Sharma, said, “Online education is a boon. My daughter is studying in Sacred Heart Convent School and children need a positive direction which is being provided through online classes. In the current scenario, it’s the virtual classes that are keeping them positively engaged and helping them learn and move forward. However, the pace of moving ahead for each student could be different. Online classes have certain drawbacks: harmful effects on the eyes and health, but children if left completely free, will be at a loss.”With online classes, the screen time for children has also increased in the last three months, thereby adversely affecting their eyesight. Dr Priyanka Arora of ophthalmology at DMCH said, “We are receiving four to five children in the OPD, complaining of eye strain. Children are spending a lot of time on gadgets; even classes are being held online. There is a need for parents to engage their children in creative activities in leisure time to bring down the number of screening hours. While conducting online classes, school teachers should also give frequent breaks so children can rest for 10-15 minutes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/unavailability-of-gadgets-kids-increased-screen-time-rising-concerns-among-parents/story-wwepTnYGMy5Pji7mQdo0gI.html

The man, Abuzar Shaikh, was booked under section 295 (destroying, damaging or defiling a place of worship or sacred object with intent to insult the religion of any class of persons) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).On May 4, the court had granted him protection after it was informed that the man was wrongly implicated and in fact had lodged a non-cognisable offence against members of the Tablighi Jamaat for assaulting him. The bench of justice SS Jadhav while hearing the pre-arrest plea of Shaikh through advocate Vishal Saxena was informed that his client had been critical of the Tablighi Jamaat for holding an event in New Delhi amid the coronavirus outbreak. Saxena submitted that Shaikh had to bear the brunt of his criticism and was allegedly assaulted and spat on by the members of Jamaat, about which he had uploaded a video on social media.After the video was uploaded, the members of Tablighi Jamaat filed a complaint against Shaikh at Shahunagar police station. He was also booked for criminal defamation and other penal provisions, based on the complaint made by members of the religious group. Saxena informed the court that Shaikh had also filed a complaint against the members of Tablighi Jamaat and as he was falsely implicated, he should be granted pre-arrest bail.After the police sought further time to complete investigations into the counter complaints, the court extended Shaikh interim protection from arrest for eight weeks and directed that in the event of arrest, the petitioner should be released on bail on furnishing personal bond of ₹25,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bombay-hc-extends-pre-arrest-bail-of-man-who-criticised-tablighi-jamaat/story-baGcJWz8TrKDH4RRyy7UDO.html

The cars will cost ₹1.37 crore to the exchequer. The six Innova Crysta seven-seater cars costing ₹22.83 lakh each are meant for use of school education minister Varsha Gaikwad, her deputy (MoS) Bachchu Kadu, sports minister Sunil Kedar, his deputy Aditi Tatkare, the additional chief secretary of the school education and sports department, while the sixth car is for the office use of the department. A government resolution (GR) giving sanction for the purchase from a Mumbai-based agency was issued on Saturday.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has given special sanction for purchase as the price of the cars was exceeding the approved limit of ₹20 lakh for vehicles used by ministers. The state has sustained revenue loss of more than ₹50,000 crore in the past four months due to the lockdown announced after the outbreak of the pandemic. Officials in the finance department said exceptional sanction for the vehicles meant for the secretary and office use was unwarranted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/amid-cash-crunch-maha-nod-to-buy-1-37-cr-cars-for-4-ministers-babu-deparment/story-KDhvQUAagVFbxcEQB4ydsJ.html

The criminals fled after the attack on police personnel. It was a conspiracy. An earthmover machine was put there deliberately to stop their way and in the darkness, they were attacked. This incident would not have happened without a well-planned conspiracy,” the DGP said.“Forensic team from Lucknow and the local forensic team have collected evidence to unravel the conspiracy behind this attack. Further investigations are underway,” he said.The DGP added, “The SSP is supervising various teams and the STF teams are also working in this.” A total of eight police personnel including Deputy Superintendent of Police Devendra Mishra have lost their lives after they were fired upon by criminals in the early hours of Friday.The incident took place when a police team had gone to raid history-sheeter Vikas Dubey’s house.Earlier today, the Inspector General Kanpur said that two criminals allegedly involved in the killing of eight police personnel in Kanpur have been neutralised.“During a combing operation following last night’s encounter, two police personnel were injured and two criminals have been neutralised,” Mohit Agarwal, IG Kanpur had told reporters.“We have also recovered weapons that were used in firing at the police personnel at night. A search operation is currently underway to nab other accused. Villagers have been called for the identification of the two deceased criminals,” he had added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/kanpur-incident-a-well-planned-conspiracy-up-dgp/story-OlDgiDCY6XphSX5nle7R0N.html

04-07-2020||Chandigarh||Proper poultry care in summer yields good results: GADVASU expert||Summer is a challenging season for poultry farming therefore many precautions need to be taken right from the onset of rising temperatures. This was stated by APS Sethi, head of animal nutrition department, Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU).He said that poultry birds do not have sweat glands and have a thick cover of feathers. During summer months they consume less feed and more water due to which their growth rate, egg production, eggshell quality, and hatchability are all adversely affected and their mortality rate is high.Disease incidence in the flocks also increases because of wet litter, immune-suppression, vaccination failures, and contamination of drinking water, he added.Sethi said that there should be a grass cover on the grounds surrounding the poultry house which will reduce the reflection of sunlight into the house and vegetation should be kept trimmed to avoid blocking air movement and to help in reducing rodent problems.He said, “Keep a reliable, clean, cool source of water available to help the birds cope with high temperatures. As the birds excrete electrolytes during periods of heat stress, electrolytes can be added to the drinking water. In the case of nipple drinkers, frequent checks of nipples should be monitored.”During summer season nutrient intake by the birds should be increased and part of the energy should be supplied through fats and oils, he added.“Feeding should be done early in the morning and late in the evening. Feed withdrawal from 9am to 4.30pm is very effective in reducing heat stress mortality. Feed intake and digestion produce nearly 7% additional heat in the body and is maximum after 4 to 5 hours of consumption. This should not coincide with the hottest part of the day (2 to 3pm),” the expert said.Sethi said that the crude protein level in the feed should not be increased and preferably vegetable protein sources should be used.Egg collection frequency at the farm should be increased and the cold room should be available for egg storage in hot summer months, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/proper-poultry-care-in-summer-yields-good-results-expert/story-tnQMlVGPYFp3aFrj1nfduJ.html
04-07-2020||Mumbai||38 spots waterlogged within 2 hours of heavy rain||After two hours of heavy rain on Friday morning, waterlogging was reported in 38 parts of the city, washing away the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) claims of having completed most of its monsoon preparation. However, BMC said the waterlogging was due to rainfall coinciding with a 4.41-metre high tide at 10.49am.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), between 8.30am and 8.30pm on Friday, Colaba recorded 161.4 mm rain, while 102.7 mm rain was recorded in Santacruz. Overall, the number of waterlogging spots in Mumbai increased to 336 this year from 273 in 2019.“There was no problem with our pumps and nor was the passageway for drainage blocked anywhere, but waterlogging was reported due to high tide along with rainfall,” said Sanjay Darade, deputy municipal commissioner (stormwater drains). During high tide, BMC closes floodgates to keep the rising seawater from entering the city, which prevents rainwater draining out. Flooding was reported in areas known to be prone to waterlogging, like Hindmata in Dadar as well as parts of Sion and Milan subway in Santacruz. Slow-moving traffic was reported in both the island city, at areas like Churchgate, Worli Naka and Nana Chowk, and in the suburbs. Traffic needed to be diverted due to waterlogging in some parts of the city.Sandeep Bhajibhakre, deputy commissioner of police, (traffic, suburbs), said, “Around two feet waterlogging was reported at Andheri subway. Hence, we closed the subway and diverted traffic in the area.” Flooding was also reported in parts of Bhulabhai Desai Road, Cuffe Parade, Marine Lines, King’s Circle and Byculla. New waterlogging spots were reported in Goregaon, Andheri, Santacruz and Churchgate.Prior to the onset of the monsoon, BMC had said it had completed 95% of the desilting and cleaning of the city’s drains. In February, the civic body said drains at the low-lying Hindmata junction had been augmented so that they could handle 50mm rain per hour. Hindmata junction sees flooding whenever there is more than 25mm rain and it reported waterlogging on Friday.“We have definitely improved the flooding issue at Hindmata junction, considering earlier, water was taking a long time to drain,” said Darade. “If there had been no high tide, despite heavy rainfall, there would have been no flooding.’’ He said the new waterlogging spots were due to the high tide coinciding with heavy rain. Activist Godfrey Pimenta said, “We totally disagree with the 95% figure quoted by BMC. For instance, no cleaning and desilting of nullahs in Sahar Airport, Marol, Kurla, Worli Koliwada etc has been done. In case of heavy monsoon, the above area will face unprecedented flooding and cause untold loss and damage.”High tide (4.57m) is expected today at 11.38am and on Sunday, a 4.63m high tide is expected at 12.23am. IMD has issued a red alert (very heavy rainfall) for today and a yellow alert (heavy rainfall) for Sunday.(With inputs from Suraj Ojha)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/38-spots-waterlogged-within-2-hours-of-heavy-rain/story-8CKmK2JH5lwJLB443qaSlL.html

04-07-2020||Mumbai||Expect very heavy rain in Mumbai, Thane today: IMD||The island city and suburbs on Friday recorded over 100 millimetres (mm) of rain in a day. South Mumbai recorded more rain than the suburbs, with an intense rain spell of 157 mm in approximately three hours. Between 8.30am and 5.30pm on Friday, the city saw very heavy rain, with 161.4mm and 102.7mm of rain recorded at Colaba and Santacruz weather stations respectively. “Both the city and suburbs from Friday morning onwards had very intense connective clouds that had the potential to cause 30-50 mm rain per hour within three hours. Similar intense rain is expected on Saturday followed by a drop in intensity from Sunday onwards,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, India Meteorological Department (IMD).For today, IMD has issued a red alert (extremely heavy rainfall) for Mumbai, Thane, Palghar and Raigad. A red alert directs authorities to take necessary action for extremely heavy rain at isolated places in a region. For Sunday, a yellow alert (be updated for heavy rain at isolated places) has been issued for Mumbai, Thane, Raigad, Ratnagiri, and Sindhudurg. An orange alert (heavy to very heavy rain) has been issued for Palghar, for Sunday. “The active monsoon current is being triggered by three weather systems — a cyclonic circulation over south Gujarat at the lower and mid-tropospheric level that is likely to persist for at least two days; an offshore trough running from Maharashtra to Kerala coast; and high convergence due to strong westerly to southwesterly winds, carrying a lot of moisture from the Arabian Sea over the coast,” said Hosalikar.In addition to this, a vortex (localised low-pressure circulation) will form over the Mumbai region, said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at University of Reading.”This will lead to rain enhancement over the weekend. Intense spells are expected during Saturday afternoon, evening; and Sunday morning. Rain-related disruptions are expected with rainfall accumulation higher towards Palghar, Thane and Raigad,” said Deoras.Professor Sridhar Balasubramanian, department of mechanical engineering and IDP Climate Studies at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, said, “Very heavy rains can’t be ruled out with some places likely to get 200-250 mm in a 24-hour period. There will be waterlogging and possibility of localised flooding. Caution needs to be exercised in these difficult times.”IMD classifies 20-30mm rain per hour as intense spell; 30-50mm per hour as very intense rain; 50-100mm per hour as extremely intense rain spell; and over 100mm per hour as cloud burst. IMD further classifies 15.6-64.4mm as moderate rain; 64.5-115.5mm rain as heavy; 115.6-204.4mm as very heavy; and over 204.5mm as extremely heavy rain.For the first time during monsoon, IMD on Friday released an impact-based forecast that highlighted high risk due to very to extremely heavy rain. It indicated waterlogging in many parts of low lying areas, localised and short term disruption to municipal services such as water, electricity etc; major disruption of traffic flow; and also suggested the possibility of collapse of old buildings and tree fall incidents. In such circumstances, IMD has suggested action in the form of proper regulation of traffic and restrict movement of citizens in affected areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/expect-very-heavy-rain-in-mumbai-thane-today-imd/story-6r1r7IgJdzrxiO4fZnXYRI.html
04-07-2020||Mumbai||BMC begins rapid antigen tests, north Mumbai will be priority||A day after receiving one lakh rapid antigen kits from a South Korean company, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) started testing for Covid-19 from Friday. Considering the growing number of Covid-19 cases in the northern parts of the city, BMC will run a majority of tests in those wards. BMC procured 1 lakh kits from South Korean firm SD Biosensors , the only company approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), on Thursday night. According to the protocol, every positive report from the testing will be treated as ‘true positive’, while negative samples will have to be mandatorily re-tested by RT-PCR process. Every day, 2,000 rapid tests will be conducted, which will push the number of daily tests in the city to 7,000.Currently, BMC is conducting 3,500-5,000 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests daily. Like RT-PCR, rapid antigen kits detect the presence of molecular pathogens of the coronavirus. RT-PCR takes almost eight hours to give results, while reports of the antigen-based test that uses nasal swab samples are out within 30 minutes.In the initial stage, BMC will run tests on suspected patients and high-risk contacts in wards namely R-N (Dahisar), R-C (Borivli West), R-S (Kandivli), P-N (Malad), P-S (Goregaon), K-E (Andheri East) and K-W (Andheri West). According to BMC’s data, K-E has reported the highest number of Covid-19 cases (5507). K-W is in the fourth position with over 4,706 cases, as of Thursday.“Along with this, we will start testing symptomatic patients from hospitals to get faster reports,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.BMC plans to gradually start testing high-risk contacts of infected patients from containment zones to find more patients, especially those who are asymptomatic. Almost 40,000 Covid-19 frontliners will also undergo the test, BMC officials said. “With more testing, the number of cases will also increase. But this will also ensure early treatment of patients. Expecting a surge in cases, we have also increased the bed strength in intensive care unit (ICU) to over 1,500,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the Covid-19 state task force. Medical experts have welcomed the civic body’s move to begin rapid antigen testing. “In Mumbai, almost 80% patients are still not identified as asymptomatic. Although they don’t have symptoms like cough and cold, the chances of them spreading the infection is less, but they are still infectious. The more we identify and isolate them, the chain of reaction will break,” said Dr Abhijit More, co-convenor, Jan Aarogya Abhiyan.With the relaxation of the lockdown, epidemiologists said sero-survey and antigen testing will provide the real picture.“Sars-Cov-2 (the virus which causes Covid-19) is still unknown to us. We need more data and analysis to understand its demographic and geographical outspread. Rapid test is not only fast, but the kit is also pocket-friendly. It’s the need of the hour,” said Dr Lancelot Pinto, city epidemiologist from Hinduja Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-begins-rapid-antigen-tests-north-mumbai-will-be-priority/story-rsDMn4J0wNqNjM1R3svT8K.html
04-07-2020||Mumbai||3 cops succumb to Covid-19; state toll 65||Three policemen including an assistant police inspector died of Covid-19, taking the number of fatality in the state police force to 65. Of the three deceased, two died in the past 48 hours while the third policeman had died five days ago but his post-mortem report on Friday revealed that he was Covid-19 positive. Meanwhile, 35 police personnel from Thane Police commissionerate tested positive on Thursday.Of the three deceased, the assistant inspector, aged 52, was posted at Samtanagar police station and developed symptoms of Covid-19 a week ago. After testing positive on June 26, he was admitted to Oscar Hospital in Kandivli for treatment where he died on Friday morning, a senior police officer said.Another police officer said, “After 19 years of service in defence, he joined the Mumbai Police force as police sub-inspector in 2009.” His younger brother is also in the police force and is attached to Mumbai Police’s crime branch unit-11. A 54-year-old head constable attached to the Thane Rural police headquarters succumbed to the disease on Thursday while undergoing treatment at Vedanta Hospital, confirmed Niket Kaushik, inspector general of police (Konkan Range).“He showed symptoms on June 25 and tested positive on June 26. He was later admitted to Vedanta Hospital for treatment. He was given an aid of ₹1lakh for medical treatment,” said Shivaji Rathod, superintendent of Thane Rural police.Constable tests positive after deathA constable was found to be Covid-19 positive four days after his death. The cop’s family had refused to accept the body, following which KEM Hospital conducted a post-mortem wherein the cop, posted in the Anti Narcotics Cell (ANC), was found positive. He had suddenly fainted and collapsed at home on June 29. He was taken to KEM Hospital where he was declared dead minutes after admission.The hospital informed his family that he died of cardiac arrest and was not conducting Covid test as ICMR guidelines prohibit post-mortem only for the purpose of testing if the person was Covid positive.After the deceased’s wife tested positive, she demanded that a post-mortem be conducted of the body. Former BJP MP Kirit Somaiya, too, raised the issue with the government. The hospital was then allowed to conduct post-mortem as an exceptional case.Speaking to HT the deceased’s wife said, “My husband had raised suspicion that he may have contracted the virus and was asking me and other family members to stay away from him. We wanted to take the body to Satara where our parents stay, but to ensure everyone’s safety we insisted on post-mortem.”The state government has promised the families of deceased policemen a compensation of ₹50 lakh each. In addition, ₹10 lakh would be given from the Police welfare fund or Martyrs’ Funds and one family member of the deceased personnel will be given a government job.So far, 2,906 policemen have tested positive for Covid-19 in city police force with 42 deaths. 498 policemen are undergoing treatment while more than 2,260 have recovered. In the state police force, around 4,800 personnel have tested positive, of whom, 1,025 are undergoing treatment. The death toll in the state police force is 65 now.35 cops test positive in Thane commissionerateAs many as 34 police personnel, including a senior police inspector, from Thane Police commissionerate tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday. The senior police inspector has been admitted to a hospital while five of his teammates have been quarantined.The infected personnel are from different police stations including Thane Nagar, Shil-Daighar, Shrinagar and Naupada police stations. Some of the infected are also from the Quick Response Team and traffic department. Deputy police inspector B Patil said, “The number of positive cases have increased as people’s interaction with police has increased after lockdown norms were eased last month. All these are field officers who contracted Covid-19 on duty. We have ensured that they receive proper treatment while their families are taken care of.”Cyber police warns against sharing list of Covid patients on groupsThe state cyber police department on Friday said many WhatsApp groups are sharing lists of those infected with Covid-19. “Such act amounts to an offence and if any person is found indulging in such act they would face lawful action,” said inspector general (cyber) in a statement. Cyber police officers have appealed to all WhatsApp group administrators to remove those members who indulge in such unlawful act and change the setting of the group to ‘only admin’.(With input from Anamika Gharat)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/3-cops-succumb-to-covid-19-state-toll-65/story-gEw9M1l09xgMqWqnZkfDPO.html
04-07-2020||City||Submit daily updates on those who are critical: Thne chief instructs||With an aim to bring down the fatality rate within the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), the municipal commissioner, Dr Vipin Sharma on Friday instructed all assistant municipal commissioners to visit Covid hospitals or facilities within their ward and submit a daily report of the condition of patients, especially the old and critical. “Apart from contact tracing and testing, our aim is to decrease the fatality rate in the city. For this, we have to ensure that all patients receive timely treatment. All assistant commissioners have been asked to visit the hospitals or Covid care centres in their vicinity every morning, before reporting to work. They will ensure that if any patient is critical or facing any problems, are attended immediately,” said Sharma.TMC has so far recorded 350 Covid deaths, among them, 212 deaths were reported in June itself. “It was observed initially that family members would avoid reaching out to a doctor; this often led to a delay in the treatment. Moreover, provisions for ventilators have been made so that patients above 50 years of age can be attended to immediately in case of an emergency. Proper care and timely treatment will help reduce the fatality,” said Dr Dinkar Desai, president, Indian Medical Association, Thane chapter.Increased contact tracing, tracking patients from fever clinics and surveys in containment zones are some of the ways the civic body and the Indian Medical Association are trying to bring down the fatalities in the city.E-pass will be available onlineThane Municipal Corporation has introduced the facility to avail e-pass on the DigiThane Covid-19 dashboard. This is to ensure those in essential services are able to access the passes with ease. The facility is available on the website, on-call or even on mail.

04-07-2020||Mumbai||City air 30% better in lockdown than 2024 NCAP target||The air quality in the city was around 30% better during 74 days of lockdown than its 2024 target under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP).Notified in January 2019, NCAP was proposed by the Centre in its attempt to reduce the concentration of particulate matters — PM2.5, PM10 (breathable pollutants that can easily enter the lungs and cause health ailments) — by 20-30% by 2024. Over the course of the year, 122 non-attainment cities were identified and air pollution action plans were developed and approved for 102 of them.During the lockdown from March 25 to June 8 owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, researchers calculated that Mumbai witnessed a 29.5% decline in PM2.5 and 44.3% decline in PM10 levels compared to the NCAP 2024 target. While the NCAP target for PM2.5 level was 28 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m3), Mumbai recorded an average of 19.7 μg/m3 during lockdown. The target for PM10 was 105.7 μg/m3, while the city recorded 58.5 μg/m3. A similar analysis for Delhi showed a 31% decline than its NCAP target, 54% decline for Kolkata and 29% decline for Bengaluru than their respective NCAP 2024 targets for PM2.5 pollutant.The analysis — NCAP vs Lockdowns: An Assessment for Four Indian Cities — developed by Mumbai-based air quality research group Respirer Living Sciences (RLS) and Delhi-based communications initiative Climate Trends was released on Friday. Data for all cities was sourced from air quality monitors setup by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which is recognised as official data used to track the progress of NCAP by the Centre.An overall trend established by the study showed the unprecedented lockdown measures resulted in all four cities achieving 95% of their 2024 NCAP targets.Researchers said their analysis revealed that achieving clean air targets was possible much earlier than 2024 if restrictions were imposed on human-induced pollution sources in a phase-wise manner. “The lockdown period helped us understand the effects from anthropogenic (human-generated) emissions. This period is a marker for policy makers on how they can achieve what has been planned in the coming four years, in a relatively shorter period,” said Ronak Sutaria, chief executive officer, RLS.SN Tripathi, NCAP apex committee member and professor of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur, said, “The lockdown air quality data is being carefully studied by us and it is providing crucial information on baseline or background levels. This would help us to consider revisiting existing air quality safe standards for the country.”The annual safe standard for PM2.5 as per the World Health Organization (WHO) is 10 μg/m3 while the national standard is 40 μg/m3.According to Sagnik Dey, a professor at IIT-Delhi, of the eight primary polluting sources in India, four sources — construction, industries, brick kilns and vehicles — were inactive during lockdown while household emissions, open burning, diesel generators and dust were active. “Background levels for PM2.5 concentration during lockdown range between 20 μg/m3 and 49 μg/m3 across Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata; which means that in the best case scenario we cannot go below that,” said Dey.Meanwhile, the latest analysis also assessed PM2.5, PM10 levels in four cities across 2017, 2018 and 2019 to highlight the effectiveness of NCAP in bringing down air pollution over the years, taking 2017 levels as the base year. While PM levels fell short of NCAP targets for all four cities in 2019 compared to previous years, Kolkata witnessed a 24% improvement followed by Bengaluru at 19.8%, Mumbai at 16%, and Delhi at 6.4%.“Lessons from the lockdown make it clear that city action plans need to be much more comprehensive in their strategy and approach to air pollution management,” said Aarti Khosla, director, Climate Trends.Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) chairman Sudhir Srivastava said that reduction in transport pollution and work from home policy during lockdown had built an avenue to implement Mumbai’s action plan target for ‘staggered work hours’ for areas such as BKC and Parel. “Baseline data (from the lockdown) for a densely-populated city like Mumbai will tremendously help in source apportionment, especially for anthropogenic ones. This also expedites the process for obtaining necessary pollutant reduction as per our action plan through a more refined and enhanced approach,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/city-air-30-better-in-lockdown-than-2024-ncap-target/story-qBUt0SKLtnQBYd4wqRWpfN.html

The institute’s director Subhasis Chaudhuri had said the senate’s decision to conduct online classes is applicable only for the autumn semester. The institute has remained shut since March 14 and an early summer vacation was announced from April 1 to May 31. While classes for the spring semester of 2020 concluded prior to the shutdown, exams were pending. On May 17, the administration announced an elaborate scheme to do away with spring semester exams and promote students based on their scores in the previous semester.“At this pressing time, when many of our students need help, we are thankful to our alumni in the United States for opening their hearts in supporting their alma mater’s students. Since we are still at 50% of this specific fund, we hope many others will come forward to help our students in need,” said Chaudhuri.IITBHF was established as a non-profit organisation to assist IIT-B and received its status as a tax-exempt organisation from the Indian Revenue Service on July 5, 1996.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iit-bombay-alumni-raise-2-3-crore-to-help-500-ug-students-with-laptops-broadband/story-2FjbdXVQA4QIwSdc01tdDK.html
04-07-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Police deny claims of assault during lockdown||In an affidavit filed in the Bombay high court (HC), the Mumbai Police have refuted the allegations that a porter was stopped and assaulted by police while enforcing lockdown in south Mumbai. The said porter allegedly succumbed to the injuries.Iqbal Gani Avalkar, an inspector attached to JJ Marg police station, filed the affidavit in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate Firdause Irani, who claimed that he himself, his wife and two sons were badly beaten up by local police personnel and civic officials outside his residence at Goregaon (West).Claiming that there have been several instances of police excesses under the guise of enforcing lockdown, Irani had cited report of a human rights organisation claiming that at least 15 persons have died due police high handedness during Covid-19 lockdown, and those include two from Mumbai.The two persons were identified in the report as 47-year-old Sameer Jamal Khan, who was allegedly assaulted by policemen in south Mumbai, and Raju Velu Devendra, who was allegedly beaten to death by personnel attached to Juhu police station.Avalkar has refuted the claim and said Khan, who was carrying a refrigerator and two cloth bundles on a handcart to Null Bazaar locality, was not even stopped by police anywhere, which was corroborated by CCTV footages.In the case of Devendra, assistant commissioner of police Dattatray Bhargude filed an affidavit stating that the investigation into his death has not proceeded further as the family members of the deceased did not come forward to record their statements despite repeated requests. He further added that he could not summon any witness as the spot of incidence lies in a containment zone.The bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice NJ Jamadar adjourned Irani’s petition for two weeks to enable the police to file affidavit in reply to his allegations about him and his family members being beaten up.Irani, a lawyer and human rights activist, alleged that on April 16, 2020, he, his wife and two sons were assaulted by sticks by policemen and civic officials for no apparent reason. On Tuesday, Irani pointed out to the court that after the incident he has received hundreds of complaints from people having faced police excesses during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-deny-claims-of-assault-during-lockdown/story-8INGywU80OTierldyOCb2L.html
04-07-2020||Mumbai||Government’s decision to cap air fares hurting air travel: CAPA||The government’s decision to temporarily fix a cap on air fares following the resumption of domestic passenger flight services in a graded manner is impacting air travel demand as airlines are unable to offer tickets at lower prices to customers, observed aviation think tank Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA).CAPA, a consultancy and advisory firm specialising in aviation sector, said adopting such a mechanism takes away an airline’s flexibility to charge fares at a lower rate when demand is on the lower side. “The temporary fare caps by the regulator are impacting demand. The pricing restrictions mean that the airlines have less flexibility to offer lower fare to stimulate demand,” CAPA said in a report on Friday. Airlines fix ticket prices based on the prevailing demand and also roll out various low fare offers and schemes to stimulate demand, particularly in low travel seasons. The period between January and March as well as July and September are considered to have low travel demand. At the time of resumption of domestic commercial flights after a break of two months on May 25, the ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) had categorised all domestic routes into sectors (bands A to G) based on flight durations. This system will remain valid till August 24. The move to put an upper and lower threshold to ticket prices for domestic flights was aimed at preventing any sharp rise in fares due to pent-up demand while ensuring that finances of airlines are not crippled amid high costs. In addition to fixing the band prices, airlines are also supposed to sell at least 40% tickets at the mid-level of the upper and lower band.“The impact (of the fare cap) may be greater in the second quarter of this financial year as demand is historically weak during this period (July-September). Continuing with price control beyond August would be a strategic mistake by the regulator which could further harm the financials of airlines,” CAPA added.A senior airline executive, however, did not agree with CAPA’s report while another executive said the report seems to be partially true. The senior airline executive said, “The government caps are fair and reasonable. Airlines otherwise will go down to ridiculous low level of fares to get passengers.” The official said that going forward the potential for domestic travel is looking good and added that the fare caps would help the market be stable in terms of pricing. Another executive of a low-cost airline said, “Though the report is partially correct, demand for travel is currently low due to fear of Covid-19 and the mandatory quarantine days imposed by different states. Hence, even if the airlines are able to lower the cost of tickets, it is unlikely to attract travellers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/government-s-decision-to-cap-air-fares-hurting-air-travel-capa/story-kQ7ahDYzQxQrTOuygRLV7M.html

To provide the last-mile connectivity and reduce carbon emissions, electric autorickshaws will also be introduced outside the suburban railway stations.“Electric vehicles are a step forward in reducing carbon emissions. Along with e-autorickshaws, we will also be introducing the electric bicycles in order to promote social distancing,” a CR spokesperson said. The e-bikes will be introduced outside Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Kurla railway stations, whereas, the electric autorickshaws will be introduced outside Ghatkopar and Kurla railway stations. Later the autorickshaws will also be introduced outside Bhandup, Mulund and Thane railway stations.Electric bicycles, also known as e-bikes, are battery-powered. Electric autorickshaw is also battery-operated and is used as an alternative to compressed natural gas (CNG), operated autorickshaws.Passengers will be able to book the cycles and autorickshaws in advance through a mobile application before reaching the railway station. The zonal railway has floated tender for the mobile application. However, the fares and payment mode for e-bikes and e-autorickshaws have not been finalised yet.The zonal railway has also floated tenders for electric bicycles for a period of one year. Tenders for electric autorickshaws outside Kurla and Ghatkopar railway stations have been allotted. The service is likely to be introduced soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/you-can-take-e-bikes-e-autos-from-outside-cr-stations-soon/story-4ebx5Dbaa3BatSg6MmftPN.html
04-07-2020||Mumbai||BMC collects 6,000 blood samples for sero-survey||Over the past five days, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has tested more than 6,000 people in Mumbai under sero-survey to monitor the trend of the prevalence of Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19. The civic-body expects to complete the survey within the next two to three days. Under the national sero-survey of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), BMC has been collecting blood serum samples through door-to-door examination in the three wards— M/W (Tilaknagar and Chembur), F/N (Matunga, Sion and Wadala) and R/N (Dahisar and Mandapeshwar). Sero-survey is being undertaken in collaboration between the civic body, Niti Aayog and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.In sero-survey, a group of individuals undergo blood tests to detect the presence of IgG antibodies that are produced against Sars-Cov-2. This is done to identify the individuals who were previously infected with the virus and have now recovered. A total of 10,000 blood samples from individuals aged above 12 will be collected as random samples from slum and non-slum areas in the city.“The Central government has given us the task to collect 10,000 samples. Within the next two to three days, we will be able to collect the remaining 4,000 samples unless rain hinders the survey,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. “We will get the report of the survey after a week.”R-North is one of the wards with fewest Covid cases in the city with 1,759 cases, while M-West has 2,464 cases and F-North had 3,499 cases among wards with higher number of cases.“The survey will help us gauge the spread of the virus. It will also help to detect hidden carriers among people. Overall, it will give us a perspective on the pandemic and our preparations,” said Kakani. In the first phase, ICMR conducted the first sero-survey in the last week of May where more than 60 districts across the country were covered. It also included 10 hotspots in Mumbai including slums of Kandivli, Deonar, Dharavi and Kurla-Sakinaka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-collects-6-000-blood-samples-for-sero-survey/story-oUGvRpFjZ8BBYBg7GNrV9H.html
04-07-2020||Mumbai||FDA minister warns Patanjali: No false claims||State food and drug administration (FDA) minister Rajendra Shingne has warned Patanjali of strict action if it misled people saying its newly launched Coronil cures Covid-19. Shingne, in a press statement issued on Saturday, said the medicine launched by Patanjali does not cure Covid-19, though the company was claiming so.“The advertisements are misleading and spreading misconceptions among the people. The tablets launched by the company are, in fact, useful in boosting immunity as it contains ashwagandha, tulsi and giloy. Such tablets do not cure coronavirus. If the company continues to mislead through its advertisements, action would be initiated against it under Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act,” he said.Citing that the name of the tablet Coronil and its advertisements are misleading and build up confusion about the drug among the people, the minister said people should understand that it is only an immunity booster and not a cure for Covid-19. He further added that FDA would initiate an action against the company with the help of the home department. SK Tijarawala, spokesperson, Patanajli Ayurveda, said, “We have neither been making any advertising or propaganda nor we need it. We have launched our product with due permissions and registration from the government authorities concerned. Even Ayush ministry, in its letter to us, has praised us for the Covid-19 management Patanjali has done with its drug. We have launched the product for not any profit but in the service of the society. I do not know what action the Maharashtra government is talking about.”State home minister Anil Deshmukh had last week warned that the government would not allow Coronil’s sale in Maharashtra. According to section 4 of the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, “If the advertisement of any drug contains false impression about the true characters of the drug or makes false claims for the drug the company manufacturing the drug is liable for the action.”Patanjali launched Coronil on June 23 by saying that it has shown 100% favourable results during the trials on Covid-19 patients. Taking cognisance of the advertisement, Ayush ministry on June 24 said the company’s claims were not known to the ministry and added that Patanjali can sell Coronil only as an immunity booster. Patanjali, on Wednesday (July 1), said that it never claimed that Coronil could cure Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fda-minister-warns-patanjali-no-false-claims/story-aNenL51q2L4HGmEZuIJgnK.html

04-07-2020||Delhi||Centre first opposed, then copied Delhi’s isolation rules: AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday alleged that the new home isolation guidelines issued by the Union Central government were “a word-to-word copy” of the Delhi government’s guidelines on the same topic.AAP’s national spokesperson and MLA Raghav Chadha said the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government at the Centre has advised implementation of telephonic consultancy to Covid-19 patients under home isolation, which will now be implemented across India. “Significantly, the same BJP government scrapped the same telephonic consultancy provisions for home isolation patients in Delhi. Now the question arises, that if this system of the Kejriwal government can be applicable for the whole country, then why did the BJP government scrap it in the Capital?” Chadha asked. The Union health ministry did not comment on the matter.Chadha said without any proper framework, the BJP-ruled Central government had passed arbitrary politically motivated orders through lieutenant-governor (L-G) Anil Baijal. “I believe the BJP government has only one goal, which is to create trouble for the citizens of Delhi by passing orders through the L-G, who reports to the Union home ministry. The BJP government neither had any plan nor any kind of framework to pass these orders. But, it did so only to create hurdles for the people,” he said. The L-G office did not comment on his charges.Last week, the L-G restored the Delhi government’s old module of home isolation where teams of district surveillance officers (DSO) visit the homes of new Covid-19 patients for their medical assessment and to inspect if their homes are fit for isolation.The Delhi government had appointed a private firm to do the follow-up process with patients under home isolation through tele-consulting. But the contract of the company was cancelled by the L-G. The Delhi government opposed this, saying it was hampering patient care.“I request the Union government to cooperate, and not create chaos in Delhi,” Chadha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/centre-first-opposed-then-copied-delhi-s-isolation-rules-aap/story-nOzHV0F41TMK8K4zSv0XWN.html
04-07-2020||Delhi||Rapid testing moves out of Covid-19 containment zones to other areas||All 11 districts in Delhi have started conducting rapid antigen tests beyond the containment zones, as part of the city-state government’s plans to scale up Covid-19 testing across the city.District administrations have set up testing centres in government schools, dispensaries, community centres as well as in medical vans, senior government officials said on Friday.Delhi government had last month procured 600,000 rapid antigen test kits, which were distributed among all 11 revenue districts in the city, with the foremost priority to test residents in Delhi’s containment zones, a senior government official said.As of Friday, the national capital had 445 containment zones.Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Friday told HT, “We have scaled up tests across all districts in the city and rapid antigen tests are a major part of that strategy. Antigen tests help reduce time of the suspect period [the time taken between sample collection and results to arrive] of a person. So, rapid action can be taken in every positive case.”So far, under the rapid antigen test initiative, district administrations have covered around between 60% and 70% of the containment zones in their jurisdictions, with over 150,000 people tested till Friday. After the progress in these areas, around 40 antigen test centres were set up on Friday in localities outside containment zones, including in Greater Kailash, Kalkaji, Shahpur Jat, Mehrauli, Saket, Hauz Rani and Rajouri Garden, among others. These exclude the 167 antigen testing centres that were previously operational inside or close to containment zones.The government is yet to summarise data on the total number of people outside containment zones who went through antigen tests and how many among them tested positive.According to the Delhi government’s daily health bulletin, 24,165 were tested across the city on Friday, of which 13,588 were tested via the antigen method.The government earlier this week placed orders for another 500,000 antigen test kits, which are likely to arrive by Monday, following which they will be distributed among all district authorities.Rapid antigen tests are non-confirmatory tests for the Sars-Cov-2 virus, using a nasal swab, where the results take less than 30 minutes to come. While every positive is considered an accurate positive, individuals with negative results may have to undergo an RT-PCR test for reconfirmation. Chief secretary Vijay Dev said: “Currently, we are conducting antigen tests both within and outside containment zones, under ICMR protocols. Such tests not only help identify people infected earlier, but also provide a sense of the burden of the disease. It also helps in early detection and surveillance of positive cases which assists in controlling the pandemic.”WHO CAN GET TESTEDIn a standard operating procedure issued last week, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) had given district administrations a free hand to decide who can be tested under the rapid testing initiative.HT on Friday spoke to several officials and found that three districts have prioritised health care workers, sanitation staff, police personnel, civil defence volunteers and others engaged in the management of containment zones. Another two districts had prepared a list of “high-risk” individuals that mostly comprised fruit and vegetable sellers, milk vendors, grocery shop owners, pharmacists and other essential goods and services providers who worked in full capacity when the city was recording around 3,000 new daily cases of Covid-19 regularly. Most other districts on Friday, however, tested anyone who walked in, on a first-come-first-served basis.A senior official in the revenue department said a uniform strategy for all districts is likely to be ready by Monday. By then, all districts are also expected to set aside some portion of the test kits in their quota for government hospitals under their jurisdiction.Jugal Kishore, head of community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital, said: “It is a good strategy to expand the ambit of the antigen test initiative. When it comes to prioritising, the first category of persons who should be tested is contacts of Covid cases who haven’t got themselves tested so far, health care workers and individuals who interacted directly with covid patients in hospitals, covid centres or their residences.” “Second should be elderly citizens with severe acute respiratory infections and influenza-like illnesses. The third category should be individuals with ailments related to heart, kidneys, liver, etc. And the fourth category should be people who worked outside when the cases peaked. The last category may include the police, civil defence volunteers, etc.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rapid-testing-moves-out-of-containment-zones-to-other-areas/story-lrmhRSjBxFOoP5Rn5lspAM.html
04-07-2020||Delhi||Charak Palika Hospital to be converted to Covid-only facility soon||The Delhi government is likely to convert Charak Palika Hospital in Moti Bagh, run by the New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC), into a Covid-19 dedicated facility soon. The New Delhi district administration has convened meetings with NDMC officials to work out a plan to declare the hospital a Covid-only facility. The district administration has also sought details from the municipality about the health infrastructure available at the hospital.Officials from the government and NDMC confirmed that talks are on to covert the Charak Palika Hospital in south Delhi into a dedicated Covid hospital. “We have held several meetings with the health department officials of NDMC and Charak Palika Hospital regarding its conversion into a Covid-19 dedicated facility. We have asked them to submit information about health infrastructure available at the hospital so we have an idea about additional logistical support required before converting it into a Covid-only facility. They are yet to submit details. We will make the declaration in a few days after completing the due process,” a senior official of the New Delhi district, who is engaged in the procedure, said on the condition of anonymity.Civic body officials confirmed the development. “The process is on. Even after a formal declaration, it takes 4-5 days to turn a hospital into a Covid-19 dedicated facility. So we hope that by next week, the hospital functions as a Covid-19 dedicated facility,” an NDMC official said.Charak Palika Hospital is NDMC’s largest healthcare facility in Moti Bagh area. The total bed strength of the hospital is 156. It has six ICU beds and three ventilators. It caters to the medical requirements of people, mostly government employees, living in neighbourhoods such as RK Puram, Moti Bagh, Sarojini Nagar, Laxmibai Nagar and parts of Chanakyapuri.Another official of the district administration said that since the number of Covid-19 cases is exploding, there is a need to create more healthcare facilities, apart from setting up beds in schools and community centres. “In such a scenario, hospitals being run by municipalities can play a vital role as they have basic health infrastructure which can be augmented further for special treatment. Even though there is a less number of ICU beds, we are not worried because we can create temporary ICU units on simple beds with the help of additional machinery,” he said.The official added that once a hospital is declared Covid-only facility then the state, as well as central government, provide it with logistical support.A senior official of NDMC’s health department said that the hospital has around 27 doctors and provides around-the-clock emergency services. “We have already created an isolation ward of six beds for any emergency. The condition of NDMC hospitals and dispensaries is better than other municipal hospitals in the city. The nearest hospitals treating Covid patients in the area are AIIMS and Safdarjung hospitals, and both remain crowded. If Charak Palika Hospital is converted into a Covid-19 dedicated facility, it will be of great service in the pandemic,” the NDMC official mentioned above said.At present, only two municipal hospitals have been declared Covid-only facilities—Hindu Rao Hospital of North Delhi Municipal Corporation and Tilak Nagar Super Speciality Hospital of South Delhi Municipal Corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/charak-palika-hospital-to-be-converted-to-covid-only-facility-soon/story-B9IniBmO43IwhLFql0WFGJ.html
04-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi revises home isolation guidelines to include asymptomatic patients||The Delhi government on Friday revised its guidelines to allow asymptomatic coronavirus disease (Covd-19) patients to remain in home isolation in line with the union health ministry revised guidelines a day ago. “In supersession to the guidelines issued earlier on home isolation of very mild/ per-symptomatic Covid-19 cases, revised guidelines for home isolation of very mild/ pre-symptomatic/ asymptomatic Covid-19 cases, is enclosed,” read the order from Delhi’s Director General of Health Services Dr Nutan Mundeja.The guidelines also state that the city’s districts have to ensure that every Covid-19 patient who is under home isolation receives a pulse-oximeter. “The records pertaining to the indent and distribution of pulse-oximeter is to be maintained by each and every district. The same is to be shared with the concerned authorities on a daily basis,” the order read.The guidelines specify that immunocompromised patients – such as persons with HIV, those who have undergone a transplant, or are receiving cancer therapy – will not be eligible for home isolation. People over the age of 60 and those with co-morbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, chronic lung, kidney and liver disease will also not be eligible.The revised Delhi guidelines also mention that mechanisms will have to be put in place to shift anyone who needs hospital-based treatment or violates isolation.Patients will be discharged after ten days.The union health ministry guidelines from a day ago read, “In view of large number of asymptomatic cases being detected, the current guidelines have been extended to asymptomatic positive cases also besides very mild and pre-symptomatic cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-revises-home-isolation-guidelines-to-include-asymptomatic-patients/story-PdceHzpQpGw9GYQl0aBA5M.html

They said that the result of his first test at the hospital after admission on June 12 was negative. The SI was posted to the district commissioner of police (north-west district) office at Ashok Vihar.He was admitted to Kailash super speciality hospital in Noida for bypass surgery. At the time of admission, he tested negative for Covid-19. On June 22, he had bypass surgery and since then he had been in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), DCP (north-west) Vijayanta Arya said.“On Thursday, the hospital authorities informed Singh’s family that he was Covid-19 positive and today (Friday) early morning, they informed his family that he had passed away,” DCP Arya said.Singh’s son Rohit Khatri said, “My father’s death certificate, issued by the hospital, mentions that Covid-19 is also among the causes of death. He must have contracted the virus from someone in the hospital, as he was there since his admission on June 12.”Kailash hospital authorities could not be contacted for their comment on the SI’s death; calls and text messages sent to them remained unanswered.Joint commissioner of police (northern range) Manish Kumar Aggarwal said, “We have lost a member of the Delhi Police family. His family is entitled to compensation as per the protocol regarding the death of any police officer during service.”Before Singh, 10 personnel from the city police, including a gallantry award winner Inspector Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, lost their lives to Covid-19. More than 2,000 personnel have been tested and nearly 1,300 of them have recovered and resumed their duties so far.According to Khatri, his father joined the Delhi Police in 1984 as a constable. Singh is survived by his wife and two children—a son (Khatri) and a daughter. The family lives in outer Delhi’s Narela.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-cop-has-heart-surgery-tests-positive-dies-five-days-later/story-djw9cCdgCMfDXMBFmVTLMM.html
04-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram man held for conspiring to murder father-in-law||A man was arrested for allegedly planning the murder of his father-in-law, and offering Rs1 crore for it. Two other men were also arrested on Thursday by a team of crime branch, Palam Vihar.According to the police, on January 26 last year, 48-year-old Harpal (identified only by his first name) was shot dead by two motorcycle-borne assailants when he was walking in Badshahpur. He was rushed to a private hospital, where he was declared dead-on-arrival. Police on Friday said Harpal’s son-in-law, 30-year-old Naresh (also identified by a single name), was arrested for possession of an illegal weapon. In jail he met a man named Vikas Yadav (32), also accused of illegal possession of a weapon .In June 2018 Naresh got bail and had an argument with his wife when she refused to come to his grandmother’s funeral. In the incident, Harpal along with some villagers had allegedly beaten up Naresh. Police claimed Naresh also held a grudge against Harpal for interfering in his divorce.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime, said, “Naresh vowed revenge and offered Vikas Yadav Rs1 crore in cash or property to carry out the murder. He told Yadav that he had some ancestral property and he would usurp more land registered under his father-in-law’s name after his death. Yadav then roped in two associates, Rahul and Jaiveer, who shot Harpal.”Police said that after the shooting, Naresh was unable to arrange the Rs1 crore and instead tried to transfer his family’s property to Yadav. There was a dispute between the two over the issue.During the course of the investigation, police said they arrested Naresh, Vikas Yadav and Jaiveer were arrested from Pachgaon near Kundli-Manesar-Palwal expressway on Thursday and their questioning revealed the sequence of events. The fourth suspect, Rahul, is yet to be arrested.A case was registered against the suspects under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code and The Arms Act at Badshahpur police station, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-held-for-conspiring-to-murder-father-in-law/story-trIF2ua50cmdKHWUwThOqJ.html
04-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt to begin e-ticketing system for its buses to minimise contact||The Delhi government will launch an e-ticketing system for its buses to ensure minimal contact between passengers and conductors, in an effort to stem the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in public transport, state transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Friday.To this effect, the state transport department on Thursday started a trial run of the contactless ticketing system in a few Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) cluster buses. The model being trialled involves upgrading the operational ‘One Delhi’ mobile application with an e-ticketing system for purchasing bus tickets either in advance or in buses. The government is also working on expanding the ticket-issuing service to other, privately-run firms.“Even though we are allowing only 20 passengers per bus, there is a huge demand for buses these days because the Delhi Metro is still not operational. Our aim is to use technology to ensure minimum or zero contact between people inside buses,” Gahlot said.“We are hopeful of rolling out the contactless ticketing system in a month or two,” a transport department official.Rajan Girsa, a research associate at the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Delhi, who is working on the project, said that in the upgraded app, passengers will have an option to pay either based on the fare or by the destination. DTC and cluster bus fares in Delhi range from ₹5, ₹10, ₹15 and (for AC buses) ₹25.“One will also have to enter the bus and bus route numbers, which will be available in a drop-box format. In our first trial on Thursday, we faced some teething issues, but it was very promising overall. A few more trials will be conducted in the coming days. Our system is an API (application interface) which can be integrated with any app — for example PayTM, Flipkart, Ola or Uber. To make this fully successful, we will also have to feed in data of every bus number and route in the app, as well as enable maximum GPS tracking of each bus,” Girsa said. At present, all cluster buses have GPS trackers, but a majority of DTC buses do not.Delhi has a total of 6,487 buses, including DTC and cluster buses.On Thursday, a field trial was conducted in an air-conditioned DTC bus at the Indraprastha bus depot. It was done on a 30-km route (number 763), plying from Nizamuddin railway station to the Uttam Nagar bus terminal. The next trials will be conducted in DTC buses, Girsa said.Gahlot has also constituted a special task force to conduct these trials. An order issued by the minister on Thursday stated that the task force, led by deputy commissioner (cluster), has been constituted “for timely coordination and implementation of exploring the options of contactless mobile ticketing inside DTC and cluster buses so that no physical contact between the conductor and commuter takes place due to exchange of cash or ticket”.The task force has officials from the DTC and the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transport System Limited (DIMTS). It also has researchers from IIIT Delhi and experts from World Resources Institute, India.Officials in the DTC said they are currently plying over 1,000 buses for public transport across the city, while around 1,600 are deployed for transportation of health workers and to maintain law and order. The cluster is plying another 1,000 buses for public transport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-to-begin-e-ticketing-system-for-its-buses-to-minimise-contact/story-zSGvCfxZzMIyT2mtec1vUN.html

The land, meant for industrial use, is worth at least Rs 15 crore, as per the estimate of the authority. Officials said action was taken after they received complaints about it.“We have been receiving complaints about illegal construction on village land during Covid-19 pandemic, as our staff is engaged in Covid-19 related duties. But we are acting tough on complaints after issuance of notices to those who are engaged in such illegal activities,” said Santosh Upadhyay, officer on special duty of the Noida authority, who is handling the land department.As per rules, no person can carry out construction on land outside the village boundary without having the building map sanctioned from the Noida authority. However, as per complaints received by the authority, many people in several villages have been carrying out illegal construction, thereby damaging the planned city character of this industrial town.Upadhyay led the demolition drive that was started at 9am in Basai village. With the help of an earth mover machine, the authority’s team demolished four shops and iron structures built on 3,000 sqm of land. The team was accompanied by the police personnel led by inspector DP Singh to maintain law and order. Officials said the authority will continue its action against such activities.“We will keep addressing complaints and carry out demolition to free up land and stop illegal construction,” said Upadhyay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-authority-frees-up-3-000-square-metres-of-encroached-land-worth-15-crore/story-g8klWrnPKbqA0ZJUs6ZP7H.html

04-07-2020||Dehradun||In a first, Rajaji Tiger Reserve sets up ‘elephant gym’ to de-stress captive elephants||In a first, Rajaji Tiger Reserve Park has set up an elephant gym in the reserve’s Chilla range to de-stress captive elephants that are used for patrolling and monitoring in the reserve, said forest officials.Amit Verma, field director Rajaji Tiger Reserve said the gym has been set up to ensure that the six captive elephants, who don’t move much compared to their wild cousins, get some good exercise, remain healthy and cheerful.“In this gym, we have started many activities. We have kept big pipes with holes in it. We keep food like bananas in these big pipes and elephants have to search for the food in them. We have also kept tyres hanging from ropes, big hanging balls and small balls on the ground for three baby elephants,” Verma said. Watch | Elephants enjoy mud bath, play with balls in Uttarakhand’s ‘elephant gym’ He added that the elephants like to play with these hanging tyres and balls. “We have also set up a mud bath heap for these elephants, which they enjoy a lot. Through these activities, we want to ensure that these captive elephants remain active and get some good exercise,” Verma said.“Such playful activities will ensure that these elephants don’t feel boredom and don’t have to live a sedentary life compared to wild elephants in their natural habitats,” he saidDr Aditi Sharma, veterinarian at the reserve said, of the six elephants, three are baby elephants who love playful activities like mud baths and playing with balls.“Separated from their herds, these captive elephants feel boredom and stress in captivity. Because of this, many captive elephants starting moving their heads a lot while standing. With these activities, we want to ensure they move a lot and remain cheerful and active,” Dr Sharma said. “We have started activities like keeping fruits or fodder in baskets and keep them high on the tree branches. Also, elephants love mud bath heaps, especially in summers. So we have also developed a mud bath heap for them in this gym,” she said.Dr Sharma added that plans to introduce more activities like wooden toys for the elephants are also in the works. “We will get them prepared from Saharanpur area in Uttar Pradesh, which is known for good woodwork,” she saidWildlife expert Ritesh Joshi, who is a scientist at conservation and survey division of union ministry of environment and forests and author of ‘Secret Life of Elephants’ said elephants live in matriarchal groups where they take care of each other, especially their young ones.“When elephants are taken captive and get separated from their matriarchal families, they definitely get affected and stressed in varying degrees. Against this backdrop, I think it is a good experiment that has been started by the management of Rajaji National Park. I hope providing such spaces and introducing them to playful activities helps these gentle giants to get de-stressed”, said Joshi, who has spent many years as a researcher in Rajaji landscape studying elephants. There are two main elephant bastions in the state-Rajaji and Corbett landscape.

As of July 2, the city has 6,695 active cases out of which 56 are on ventilators and 288 are on ICU beds. As the civic body plans to ramp up testing, the number of positives are also likely to rise and so are the number of critical patients who will need an ambulance. The estimated projection of the number of active cases by July end is likely to cross 19,500. Currently, the civic body has 54 PMC ambulances and 58 from the collector’s office and so, a total of 112 ambulances are available for Covid-19 services.The civic body also has six vehicles for Covid-19 cremation and two non-Covid cremation vehicles.The civic body has provided ambulances for the transfer of dead bodies to Sassoon general hospital which has seen the maximum deaths due to Covid-19.Two ambulances have been provided to the police department, one emergency response vehicle with oxygen and a first-aid facility is provided to the fire brigade.The PMC has also pooled in PMPML buses for Covid-19 services. There are 85 four-wheelers and 36 PMPML buses which are put into Covid-19 services.Shekhar Gaikwad, PMC commissioner said, “We have asked for 50 more ambulances from the divisional commissioner possibly with oxygen supply. We could also use oxygen cylinders in case we get regular ambulances. We have also converted a few of our PMPML mini buses into hearse. There would be no shortage of ambulances in future and we will ensure it. Also with regards to manpower, we have over 9,000 PMPML drivers who are sitting idle and can be used for these extra vehicles.” As the number of cases keeps rising in rural areas, the district administration is trying to increase the ambulance capacity for rural areas.Dr Bhagwan Pawar, district health officer said, “We have about 96 ambulances for primary health services which are used for routine services and we are in the process of procuring more ambulances for the rural areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-district-health-office-to-procure-50-more-ambulances-to-meet-projected-rise-in-covid-cases/story-zLW0dmhYbnpHDIHFpOozFL.html
04-07-2020||Pune||Source of Covid-19 infection undetected in 21.35% of cases||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) identified over 3,866 Covid-19 positive persons through random testing in the one-kilometre radius from where a positive person was traced who were not the first contact of the person but were either living in a nearby area or had come voluntarily to the flu clinic upon experiencing Covid-19 symptoms.As the number of cases kept rising, the civic body could not exactly trace the source of infection in these cases. However, despite repeated incidents wherein the source of infection could not be traced, the state insists that there is no community transmission in the state.Among the 18,105 positive Covid-19 cases reported as of July 1, a major chunk which is 78.45 per cent or 14,204 cases were first contact or index cases while 35 positive were foreign travellers. In these cases, it is confirmed that the source of infection could be foreign traveller or a high-risk contact of the positive case. While in the case of the remaining 3,866 cases, the positives could be detected only through random testing or when they voluntarily showed upon witnessing Covid-19 symptoms. PMC additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal who is in charge of the health department said, “It is not that the source of infection is not known in these cases. Most of the cases detected through home survey, mobile ambulances or flu clinics are those who come from containment zone. So they are most likely to have come in touch with any positive case. The essential services workers too or the PMC staff which was infected was either living in the containment zone or working in the containment zones. The health workers, policemen and such other categories are also included who interact with multiple people on a daily basis and so they might have come in contact with any positive person.” In the 1,261 cases that were detected through mobile ambulances, 541 were detected by home surveys and 82 through flu clinics. While 194 were PMC employees and 254 were essential service providers working in essential services. In 1,534 cases, there were other reasons. While community transmission means that the exact source of infection is not known and is the third stage of the pandemic, the government is still maintaining that there is no community transmission in the country yet. The state health minister, Rajesh Tope while talking to the media on Thursday reiterated that there is no community transmission in the state and in most cases the source of infection for Covid-19 could be found. The PMC is currently tracing over eight close contacts for per positive patient, which were only three contacts at the beginning of April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/source-of-covid-19-infection-undetected-in-21-35-of-cases/story-BO4wquDDvg5x4ouLYHSa0I.html

A major chunk of them were from Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal and Uttar PradeshThe migrant workers at different labour camps and construction sites were registered online after completion and verification of their documents. The special planning took place under the direct supervision of commissioner Bishnoi and nodal officers were assigned to execute the task with precision and in a time-bound manner. Buses were provided by the PCMC and police personnel escorted the labourers from their spot of residence to the railway station and bus stop.The police officials listed each of the passengers for each of the train and their details according to the official format.Explaining the details behind the few infections in the PCMC police force, Bishnoi said “We ensured that all the policemen were tested and screened in the very beginning which led us to get a grip over the situation. Special focus was given to policemen who were over fifty years in age and those with ailments like hypertension. Our infection rate is very low and PCMC police rank amongst the least infected police force in the state of Maharashtra,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pcmc-police-facilitated-the-return-of-52-805-migrant-workers/story-bp95fMlQBoyAAGkvNgJc2J.html

When we approached the school for admission process in the last week they didn’t respond well. I had to go to school repeatedly, get the documents verified in which they pointed minor mistakes and delayed the process.””Two days back after a lot of efforts I got the admission. It is not right to trouble parents who are already tensed due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic crisis,” said Khapre.This year in Pune district a total of 16,949 RTE seats were declared in 972 schools and 62,919 applications were received. Out of these applications in the first lottery declared in March 16,617 admissions were confirmed.“This year the document verification process is done at the school level due to the lockdown restrictions. Earlier there were separate verification centres where education department officials would check the documents,” said Prof Sharad Jawadekar, national convenor, Akhil Bharatiya Samajwadi Education Rights Sabha.“While the procedure is underway staffers are pointing out small mistakes like incorrect spelling of name, printing mistake in the form, incomplete information or scratched information written in the form among others. And this is resulting into denial of admission by the schools,” said Jawadekar.“We are daily getting complaints regarding the issue where parents who normally come from a below poverty line are worried about their children admissions. We have requested the primary education department to look into this matter immediately and help the parents” said Jawadekar.“The RTE admissions lottery was declared in March but due to countrywide lockdown the admission process got delayed. As per the guidelines issued by the education department schools were supposed to call the parents on a given date, verify the documents and on that basis give admission to the students. But schools are not calling the parents for admission process, when parents themselves go to school the staff points out mistakes in documents,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rte-admissions-parents-complain-of-delay-in-verification-process-lack-of-response-from-schools/story-l5j8BcAwbcCnFDwCdpcHxN.html

The PCB is in a financial crisis has been fund deficient since 2019.Requests have also been made for medical staff to the state government and the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) here in Pune.Kumar said, “Nobody was ready to work for the project during the lockdown. We even approached the AFMC for their assistance and are awaiting their response. No intensivist was ready to come at the salary proposed by us as they are in demand, and get higher salaries at other hospitals. Moreover, we wanted full manpower in place before we began. We cannot play with the lives of the people. We can sustain the running of the ICU expenses now for three months only; our financial condition is such.”The Maharashtra government will provide 16 armed security personnel for the ICU facility, Kumar said, adding that the board would pay Rs 3.50 lakh per month as salaries to the staff.As of June 2020, the PCB has a bank balance of Rs 5 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-cash-crunch-pcb-to-start-icu-centre-on-july-10/story-N30qPbn28hrA22rIry91sJ.html

But, testing camps were set up at the Deehpali village falling under Paliganj block and out of 259 samples that were collected, 95 tested positive. Subsequently, all those found infected were sent to isolation centres while an inquiry was ordered by District Magistrate Kumar Ravi to look into any violation of norms at the wedding ceremony. “It was found that more than 50 people had attended the ceremony and social distancing and wearing of masks was not ensured. Accordingly, BDO Chiranjeev Pandey has lodged an FIR against Chaudhary at Paliganj police station under relevant provisions,” the statement added.The deceased groom was a software engineer based in Gurugram who had returned home in the last week of May to get married.

04-07-2020||World||Coronavirus cases in US cross 50K-mark again, Donald Trump Jr’s girlfriend infected||Kimberly Guilfoyle, the girlfriend of the US president’s eldest son and a top fundraiser for his re-election campaign, was among the new Covid-19 infections reported on Friday, which logged yet another single-day high of more than 50,000 cases, and seven states saw their own record daily spikes.Confirmed cases are climbing in 40 states, and the US set another record Friday with 52,300 newly reported infections, according to Johns Hopkins University, reported news agency Associated Press.Miami county of Florida declared an indefinite night-time curfew and shut down some businesses and many states around the United States scaled down their July 4 Independence Day celebrations, as mass gatherings have emerged as one of the leading causes of this second flare-up.Guilfoyle tested positive just ahead of the Mt Rushmore pre-celebrations on Friday. She had travelled to the celebrations with Donald Trump Jr, but not reportedly on Air Force. She is the third person with possible proximity to the president to test positive, after a personal valet and a member of the vide-president’s staff tested positive in the past.The Trump re-election campaign said Guilfoyle was asymptomatic but has been “immediately isolated” to prevent exposure to others and will be rested. The president’s son, who has tested negative, went into self-quarantine for 14 days, the usual period, and has cancelled all public events.The number of new cases went up by 52,104 Friday to nearly 2.8 million fatalities by 631 to 129,438. Public health officials have warned that daily cases could as high 100,000 because of this new round of infections and deaths could climb to 148,000 towards the end of this month.Seven states, all in the south, reported record single-day spikes Friday: North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alaska, Missouri, Idaho and Alabama. Florida and Texas, two of the total of 16 southern states in the grip of tis new surge, also continued to report high number of infections and hospitalisation.Florida reported close to 9,500 new cases on Friday, a day after record surge of 10,000, indicating grimmer situation by the day. Eileen Marty, a leading public health expert, told a local news organization, that Florida was “heading a million miles an hour in the wrong direction”.At least one of its counties, Miami-Dade, the state’s most populous, has moved to change the course. Mayor Carlos Gimenez ordered a night-time curfew from 10 pm to 6 am, beginning Friday and it will be in place indefinitely. He has also shut down casinos, strip clubs, movie theaters and other entertainment venues.“This curfew is meant to stop people from venturing out and hanging out with friends in groups, which has shown to be spreading the virus rapidly,” Gimenez said in a statement.As with the rest of the country, infections are shooting up in US prions and went past the 50,000 mark in June according to an AP report citing the Marshall Project. At the end of last month, the total number of cases among prisoners had reached at least 52,649, an increase of 8 per cent from the week before.Evidence of human to animal transmission of the virus surfaced as well after a dog in Georgia was found infected. The six-year-old mixed breed canine was showing signs after its owners fell ill of the virus. Two New York city cats were the first pets to test positive in April. A tiger at a NewYork zoo was the first case of an animal reported infected in the US — it caught the virus from a member of the staff. Three more tigers and three lions were also reported infected shortly at the same facility. They have all since recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-cases-in-us-cross-50k-mark-again-donald-trump-jr-s-girlfriend-infected/story-3xmPhnUrWMCQ37HKYaSOHL.html
04-07-2020||World||Trump rails against ‘angry mobs’ in pre-July 4 speech||President Donald Trump on Friday delivered a dark and divisive message in a pre-Independence Day speech standing before the Mt Rushmore monument in South Dakota, warning about a “merciless campaign” by “angry mobs”, as he referred to antiracism protestors and demonstrators.“Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values, and indoctrinate our children,” Trump said, reading from a teleprompter. He was referring to the removal of statutes of figures of the confederacy that seceded from the US to protect and continue slavery, and slave owners and also those that subjugated the indigenous people.“Angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our Founders, deface our most sacred memorials, and unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities,” Trump said.The president spoke to a packed audience of around 3,700 people with very few of them wearing masks. The seating at the venue was in complete violation of social distancing norms that his own experts have mandated for such gatherings. Public health officials have repeatedly urged people to avoid large gatherings to slow the spread of coronavirus disease. Objecting to demonstrations over racial inequality in America and viewing them as threat to the foundations of the US political system, Trump said, “Make no mistake, this left wing cultural revolution is designed to overthrow the American revolution.”“Our children are taught in school to hate their own country,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-rails-against-angry-mobs/story-rtr7mTIMSiHFCZLPKtY1PN.html

By the grace of Allah, I feel strong and energetic. I will continue to carry on my duties from home. Please keep me in your prayers,” he said in a tweet.Qureshi has been moved to Combined Military Hospital in Rawalpindi, the Geo News reported on Saturday, citing sources.Two weeks ago, Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) leader and Federal Minister for Information Technology and Telecommunications Syed Aminul Haq had tested positive for the coronavirus, while a week earlier than that PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb said she had tested positive.Railways Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) MNA Jai Prakash, former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, Minister of State for Narcotics Shehryar Afridi and PTI’s chief whip in the National Assembly Aamir Dogar have also been diagnosed with COVID-19.In June, Member of the National Assembly (MNA) Munir Khan Orakzai died, days after recovering from the coronavirus.Eight members of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly have been infected with the coronavirus. National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser was also infected but recovered.Pakistan reported 3,387 new coronavirus infections and 68 deaths on Saturday, taking the total number of cases in the country to 225,283.

04-07-2020||World||Sex workers lack food for taking HIV drugs during Covid-19||As the coronavirus spreads in Africa, it threatens in multiple ways those who earn their living on the streets — people like Mignonne, a 25-year-old sex worker with HIV.The lockdown in Rwanda has kept many of her customers away, she said, so she has less money to buy food. And when she doesn’t eat, the antiviral drugs she takes for HIV can bring on pain, weakness and nausea, or even make her pass out.“Yet it’s equally dangerous when you don’t take the drug,” Mignonne said in an interview. “You will die.”Similar challenges exist elsewhere in Africa, which has the world’s highest burden of HIV.Studies have shown that food insecurity is a barrier to taking the drugs daily and can decrease their efficacy, affecting not only sex workers but anyone where food — or the money to buy it — is scarce.Among sex workers in Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare, “most who are living hand-to-mouth have been lamenting that it’s making it difficult to adhere to treatment,” said Talent Jumo, director of the Katswe Sistahood, an organization for sexual and reproductive health.That’s a danger as many sex workers around the world are excluded from countries’ social protection programs during the Covid-19 pandemic, researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and elsewhere wrote in a new commentary for The Lancet.“Sex workers are among the most marginalized groups,” they wrote, adding that “it is crucial that disruption to health services does not further reduce access to HIV treatment.”Rwanda, which offers free antiretroviral therapy to all, has been widely praised for its progress in controlling HIV. The country has kept HIV prevalence at 3% for more than a decade and the number of new infections has dropped.But sex workers and health experts warn that those gains could be lost.More than 45% of the estimated 12,000 sex workers in the East African country live with HIV. Not taking the antiretroviral therapy risks spreading the virus, said Aflodis Kagaba, a medical doctor and executive director of Health Development Initiative, a local organization that promotes better access to health care.The organization has been giving some sex workers food, hand sanitizer and hygiene materials and is talking with the government about budgeting aid for sex workers.“Sex workers are part of the society and they deserve to live a healthy life,” Kagaba said.In Migina, an entertainment area in the capital, Kigali, Mignonne acts as a leader of 60 sex workers, reminding colleagues with HIV to take their antiretroviral therapy and visit health centers every month.“Now many are telling me they cannot take the drug because they don’t have food. It’s understandable and I don’t know what to do,” she said. She, like other sex workers, gave only her first name for her safety.Rwanda was distributing food to households under lockdown but stopped after three months. It has since lifted lockdown restrictions for some businesses, but others such as bars are still closed.Now Covid-19 cases are rising more quickly, prompting authorities to impose a nighttime curfew. As of Saturday, the country had more than 1,000 confirmed coronavirus cases.“We are seeing sex workers in Africa being denied the support others are given, like food,” UNAIDS chief Winnie Byanyima said this month. “Some are being shamed and run out of their homes and called the source of corona.” Her organization and the Global Network of Sex Work Projects have called for sex workers to be included in countries’ Covid-19 social protection programs.UNAIDS is also warning about possible shortages of medication for millions of people with HIV in the next two months, especially in developing countries. Lockdowns and border closures are slowing the drugs’ production and distribution.A World Health Organization survey of 99 countries found 32% already reporting disruptions to established antiretroviral therapy, Meg Doherty, director of the U.N. agency’s department of HIV, hepatitis and STIs, said this week.“We are engaging in unsafer sex practices because we can’t be able to access prevention tools or to drugs that we are used to,” Grace Kamau, a Kenya-based coordinator with the African Sex Workers Alliance, told a Covid-19 global webinar for sex workers last month.Agnes, an HIV-positive sex worker in Kigali, said new stigma also hurts.Before the coronavirus it was easy to make money, she said. Now “you cannot dare go on the streets, yet back in communities we are treated like outcasts,” the 26-year-old told The Associated Press. “During the lockdown, when local leaders distributed food, my family was skipped on account that I was a sex worker.”Local officials have denied discriminating against sex workers.Like many others, Agnes quickly consumed her small savings she had intended to use on running a business selling tomatoes. Now, like many others, she has no lifeline.Deborah Mukasekuru, the coordinator of the National Association for Supporting People Living With HIV, called it a “difficult situation.”“We try to mobilize food for sex workers, but they are many and we cannot feed all of them,” she said. “You cannot blame the government because corona caught the government unaware.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sex-workers-lack-food-for-taking-hiv-drugs-during-covid-19/story-hYHFcIT5TIkw9b22WJs9JO.html
04-07-2020||World||Donald Trump’s ‘strong wall’ to block Covid-19 from China had holes||President Donald Trump has repeatedly credited his February ban on travelers from mainland China as his signature move against the advance of the coronavirus pandemic -- a “strong wall” that allowed only U.S. citizens inside, he boasted in May.But Trump’s wall was more like a sieve.Exempted were thousands of residents of the Chinese territories of Hong Kong and Macau. Efforts to track U.S. residents returning from mainland China were riddled with errors and broken communications.An analysis of Commerce Department travel entry records and private aviation data obtained by The Associated Press shows that nearly 8,000 Chinese nationals and foreign residents of Hong Kong and Macao entered the U.S. on more than 600 commercial and private flights in the first three months after the ban was imposed.When U.S. residents flying from mainland China arrived at U.S. airports, the system meant to flag and monitor them for the development of symptoms lost track of at least 1,600 people in just the first few days the ban went into effect, according to internal state government emails obtained by the AP.Trump’s continuing travel restrictions on China, which he followed with a ban on travel from European nations in March and a new prohibition on entry from virus-plagued Brazil last month, remain the administration’s first line of defense against foreign sources of the pandemic.“We did a great job on CoronaVirus, including the very early ban on China,” Trump tweeted last week. “We saved millions of U.S. lives!”Trump on Jan. 31 announced the original travel ban on any non-U.S. residents who had recently been in mainland China. His action came weeks after Chinese officials acknowledged a new highly contagious and deadly virus was spreading through the city of Wuhan.Travelers from Hong Kong and Macau were exempted from that ban, and they did not face the same enhanced screening and quarantine procedures required of Americans and others returning from Wuhan and China’s mainland.Flight records provided to the AP by FlightAware, an international aviation tracking company, show that more than 5,600 Chinese and foreign nationals from the two administrative zones flew to the U.S. in February. Those totals dropped to 2,100 in March and just 150 in April, Commerce Department travel entry records show.There is no clear evidence that the small but steady flow of people from Hong Kong and Macau introduced COVID-19 cases inside the U.S. in January or in the four months since, but the exemptions “certainly undercut the purpose of the ban,” said Dr. Ronald Waldman, a professor of Global Health at George Washington University.Waldman, who dealt with international quarantines as a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official during a cholera outbreak in Africa in the 1990s, said travel bans can temporarily hobble the pace of a surging virus. Such moves “slow down the transmission and buy you time, but they have to be structured properly and followed with other strong measures,” he said.Hong Kong had struggled to quell influenza outbreaks earlier in the 2000s, but has won praise for strict health precautions in recent months that minimized its virus caseload in the wake of Wuhan’s flare-up. But when it exempted Hong Kong from the China travel ban, Trump administration officials had no way of knowing whether Hong Kong’s anti-virus regimen would succeed or if any infected travelers entered the U.S. from the Chinese territory.None of the agencies involved in crafting and announcing the China ban -- the National Security Council, the State Department, the CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services -- would comment publicly to the AP about why Hong Kong and Macau were exempted. In a brief statement, the State Department said it would not “comment on internal policy decisions,” and deferred to the White House.The White House did not respond to repeated requests for an explanation.Officials familiar with the internal discussions that took place in late January before the China ban was announced cited concerns that a ban that was too broad might jeopardize trade talks and harm the travel industry. One official said the intent was to craft a ban that was “surgical” and would limit disruption.A second administration official noted that the decision to impose a travel ban came after hundreds of thousands of travelers had entered the U.S. from China in January. That same month, more than 12,700 people entered the U.S. from the two Chinese territories, Commerce records show.The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.Hong Kong and Macau have long been given preferential economic and trade treatment from the U.S. because of their financial importance and their status as independent enclaves within China’s orbit.A 2019 State Department report on Hong Kong said more than 1,300 U.S. firms operated there, including nearly every major U.S. financial company, “with hundreds of billions of dollars in assets under management.” Macau is a world-renowned island of casinos, some owned by U.S.-based companies.Former Ambassador Richard Boucher, who was Hong Kong consul general in the 1990s, said that under the Hong Kong Policy Act passed by Congress in 1992, “we are obligated to treat Hong Kong as a special jurisdiction as long as it functions independently.”When Trump’s China travel restrictions went into effect on Feb. 2, at least 15 cases of the new coronavirus had already been detected in Hong Kong, along with one death, and seven more cases had been found in Macau. All the initial Macau cases were later traced to the outbreak in Wuhan.As of this week, the former British colony had registered 1,248 cases and seven deaths and Macau had 46 cases. Even with those low totals, Hong Kong has struggled with at least three spikes of COVID-19 cases: one in late February. another in mid-March, and a surge of 130 cases over the past two weeks.Hong Kong’s virus surges led both the CDC and the State Department to issue a series of warnings to Americans considering flights to Hong Kong -- actions that would appear to be at odds with the continuing travel ban exemptions allowing travelers from Hong Kong and Macau to enter the country.“Once we see that there is significant human to human transmission so it’s not just, hey, there is something going on there we go to what is called a level one. And right now that’s Hong Kong,” the CDC’s director, Dr. Robert Redfield, testified during a House hearing on Feb. 27.The CDC’s warnings on Hong Kong and Macau have since been raised to the agency’s highest alert level, urging Americans to “avoid all nonessential travel.” Separately, a less-heightened warning from the State Department urges Hong Kong travelers to “exercise increased caution.”Since that time, there has been a turnabout. Hong Kong has banned U.S. citizens and other international travelers from arriving by air, as more than 2.7 million Americans have tested positive and more than 128,000 have died of COVID-19.If the flow of Americans going to Hong Kong and Macau was stifled, the stream of Americans and others coming back to the U.S. from mainland China was unabated. And the program to screen them had real problems.Federal health officials planned to funnel the thousands of people returning from China through 11 airports for health screenings over the several weeks. Those with symptoms would be quarantined by the CDC. Others would be allowed to go on their way, but be monitored by state and local health departments, who would be responsible for contacting the travelers within 72 hours to advise them to isolate themselves for two weeks and to monitor whether they developed symptoms.The system was flawed to begin with. States could opt out of receiving passenger information from the CDC, and six did so: Georgia, New Jersey, Oregon, North Carolina, Arizona and Illinois. For the opt-out states, CDC simply disabled notifications. Any passengers from mainland China coming to their state would do so without being flagged or tracked.At the time, a robust testing and contact tracing effort might have been able to curb the spread of any virus arriving with travelers from mainland China, according to a CDC postmortem of mistakes that led to the virus’ early spread in the U.S.But the effort immediately ran into problems.“Hearing word of people already leaking through screening system and ending up in states without the funneling airports,” a CDC employee wrote to several local health officials on Feb. 6, soon after the program began, according to an email obtained by the AP through a public records request. “Knew it would not be perfect but it has begun.”“One flight did not receive any screening,” said another email between New Hampshire officials stated on Feb. 7.The CDC said it had no record of any complete flights not being screened. But it said if the Department of Homeland Security failed to send the CDC that information, it would not know whether whole flights were missed.New Hampshire state officials soon began getting calls from people who had recently returned, but that they hadn’t been notified about, according to a Feb. 10 email.New Hampshire officials said the individuals who called were proactively reaching out to self-report their travel based on their understanding that local health departments would monitor them. They noted “it took a period of time” to establish the process of passing along traveler information to states.CDC spokesman Scott Pauley said the agency didn’t get enough information from customs officials with Homeland Security, who were responsible for gathering passenger data at airports.“The records were poor quality, and the data wasn’t complete enough for anyone to be able to do anything with,” Pauley told the AP.The CDC said some 26,000 travelers from China were screened in all of February. The agency acknowledged that data problems contributed to thousands of notifications not being sent to state health departments. Because of these problems, the CDC has since issued a rule requiring airlines to report passenger data directly to the agency during public health crises.Despite the breakdown in notifying states, the CDC pointed out that at the time, travel screening was just one of a number of infection control measures in effect. There was a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all travelers from Wuhan city, and for those with known exposure to the virus.But even when notifications were sent to states, the information wasn’t reliable, frustrating local officials worried about getting in touch with them quickly enough to prevent any spread.“There was lots and lots of bad information,” said Fran Phillips, Maryland’s deputy secretary for public health services.The data was plagued by bad telephone numbers, erroneous itineraries, and people claiming they had never even been to China. Because the CDC wasn’t able to verify the information, the agency told local officials that they were trusting that people were telling the truth, according to internal notes shared among California state health officials.In New Mexico, officials were left scrambling after a woman who had just returned from China appeared on the television news. The state got no warning from the CDC and couldn’t reach her. They were left to judge her condition based on the TV segment.“Fortunately, she appears healthy, without cough,” wrote the state’s chief of epidemiology to others in the health department in an email.Public health experts and state officials have criticized the administration for failing to quickly follow up the travel restrictions with social distancing, ample testing and other anti-viral measures. Researchers have shown that virus-borne travelers flying in from European nations also stoked infections in New York and other cities during February and March before the administration suspended travel from Europe.___Dearen reported from Gainesville, Florida.

04-07-2020||World||Fact check: From coronavirus threat to Iraq war, here’s what Donald Trump claims||“We have it totally under control,” President Donald Trump said in late January. A month later: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA.”April and May brought the deadliest stretch of Covid-19 to date. And this past week, the number of new coronavirus cases per day hit an all-time high of 50,000.Trump persisted in his empty assurances. The virus is “getting under control,” he said Wednesday. His press secretary described the surge in many parts of the country as “embers.” The president acknowledged “flames” here and there.They cast word confetti over a pandemic that has killed more than 128,000 people in the U.S., while the president talked up a July Fourth fireworks celebration on the National Mall and told those who come Saturday to wear masks if it makes them feel good.A sampling of recent statements and how it compares with reality:VIRUS THREATTRUMP, describing the Covid-19 threat as “getting under control”: “Some (places) were doing very well, and we thought they (the virus) may be gone and they flare up, and we’re putting out the fires.” — remarks Thursday on a jobs report.TRUMP: “I think we are going to be very good with the coronavirus. I think that, at some point, that’s going to sort of just disappear, I hope.” — interview Wednesday on Fox Business Network.THE FACTS: “The virus is not going to disappear,” says Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert. Nor can it be considered “under control” as cases have been surging to fresh daily highs.The number of confirmed cases in the U.S. per day has roughly doubled over the past month, hitting 50,000 on Wednesday, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University. That is higher even than what the country experienced from mid-April through early May, when deaths sharply rose.Fauci warned this past week that the increase across the South and West “puts the entire country at risk” and that new infections could reach 100,000 a day if people don’t start listening to guidance from public health authorities to wear a mask and practice social distancing.During one of the biggest weekends of the summer for July Fourth, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised Americans to wear face coverings at the beach, though not in the water.Arizona, California, Florida and Texas have recently been forced to shut down bars and businesses as virus cases surge. The U.S. currently has more than 2.7 million known cases and many more undetected.Fauci has said there “certainly” will be coronavirus infections in the fall and winter.___VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: “While we’re monitoring about 16 states that are seeing outbreaks, it represents about 4 percent of all the counties in this country.” — interview with CBS aired Sunday.THE FACTS: That’s a misleading portrayal of the virus threat. More than 20% of Americans actually live in those relatively few counties.The White House provided The Associated Press with the full list of U.S. counties that reported increases in Covid-19 cases as of a week ago, when Pence and other administration officials repeatedly cited the low county tally. The list showed 137 of the 3,142 counties in the U.S. that were under a higher alert — indeed, about 4% in that snapshot of time.But measured by population, those counties represent a vastly higher share — more than 1 in 5 people in the U.S.Altogether there are 68.3 million people living in those 137 counties, while there is a total U.S. population of 322.9 million. That means 21.1% of U.S. residents actually live in the virus “hot spots” identified in the list.___TRUMP ON BIDENTRUMP: “Biden was asked questions at his so-called Press Conference yesterday where he read the answers from a teleprompter. That means he was given the questions.” — tweet Wednesday.THE FACTS: Biden did not read answers off a teleprompter. Nor did The Associated Press, which asked the first question at the briefing, submit questions in advance.Biden used a teleprompter to read prepared remarks that took aim at Trump’s handling of the coronavirus, before the questions and answers started, at which point the teleprompter appeared to have been turned off.Biden’s campaign gave him a list of news organizations to call on and he answered questions from reporters on that list as well as some he chose spontaneously. That’s not an uncommon practice when officials give news conferences.Video footage shows that during nearly 30 minutes of questions and answers, Biden often looked directly at the reporter, not at the teleprompter. His answers were at times long-winded, without the practiced pauses typically heard in prepared speeches.Biden campaign national press secretary TJ Ducklo called Trump’s allegation “laughable, ludicrous and a lie.”Trump’s accusation reflected his tactic of trying to stir doubts about Biden’s mental acuity.___TRUMP: “He wants to defund and abolish police.” — interview Wednesday on “America This Week.”THE FACTS: Biden does not join the call of protesters who demanded “defund the police” after George Floyd’s killing.“I don’t support defunding the police,“ Biden said last month in a CBS interview. But he said he would support conditioning federal aid to police based on whether “they meet certain basic standards of decency, honorableness and, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community, everybody in the community.”Biden’s criminal justice agenda, released long before he became the Democrats’ presumptive presidential nominee, proposes more federal money for “training that is needed to avert tragic, unjustifiable deaths” and hiring more officers to ensure that departments are racially and ethnically reflective of the populations they serve.Specifically, he calls for a $300 million infusion into existing federal community policing grant programs.That adds up to more money for police, not defunding law enforcement.Biden also wants the federal government to spend more on education, social services and struggling areas of cities and rural America, to address root causes of crime.___WAR IN IRAQKAYLEIGH MCENANY, White House press secretary: “You have this President who, when Washington was unanimous in saying, ‘We’re going into Iraq,’ this President said, ‘No, that’s not the right decision.’” — news briefing Tuesday.THE FACTS: That’s false. Trump voiced support for going into Iraq, as much as he and now his press secretary insist otherwise. And Washington was not unanimous in supporting the invasion.On Sept. 11, 2002, when radio host Howard Stern asked Trump whether he supported a potential Iraq invasion, Trump said: “Yeah, I guess so.”On March 21, 2003, just days after the invasion, Trump said it “looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint.”Later that year, he began expressing reservations.More than 150 members of Congress voted against the 2002 resolution to authorize President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq. That is not unanimity.___MEMORIALSTRUMP: “We are tracking down the two Anarchists who threw paint on the magnificent George Washington Statue in Manhattan. ... They will be prosecuted and face 10 years in Prison.” — tweet Tuesday.TRUMP: “Since imposing a very powerful 10 year prison sentence on those that Vandalize Monuments, Statues etc., with many people being arrested all over our Country, the Vandalism has completely stopped.” — tweet Sunday.THE FACTS: Trump does not have the authority to impose prison sentences — a president is not a judge. Nor can he toughen penalties on his own.Trump signed an executive order last week to protect monuments, memorials and statues, calling on the attorney general to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law any person or group that destroys or vandalizes a monument, memorial or statue.The order basically instructs the attorney general to enforce laws that already exist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fact-check-from-coronavirus-threat-to-iraq-war-here-s-what-donald-trump-claims/story-5e2wvXCtLSdW7I8iO48SUO.html
04-07-2020||World||‘People aren’t stupid’: Why Mike Pence’s optimism on coronavirus tests credibility||Vice President Mike Pence has long played the straight man to Donald Trump, translating the president’s bombast into more measured, calming language.His job has become even more difficult. As coronavirus cases spike across large parts of the country despite months of lockdown, Pence has spent the past week trying to convince the American public that things are going very well, even though they’re not.“Make no mistake about it, what you see today is that America is going back to work and the American people are finding a way every day to put this coronavirus farther in the past,” he told CNBC the same day the country reported more than 55,000 new virus cases, a daily record.For public health experts, the optimism has been unmoored from reality.“It’s almost laughable because it doesn’t pass any test of credibility when we’re seeing spikes in cases, spikes in hospitalizations,” said Larry Gostin, who specializes in public health at Georgetown University Law School. “The American people aren’t stupid. They can see spin when there is spin.”The most important thing Pence can do, Gostin said, “is to be honest with the American public. ... They need to be told the truth and then they need to be told what America is going to do to turn this around.”It’s not the first time Pence has been forced to put his own credibility on the line as he serves as Trump’s most loyal soldier. It may be the most consequential.While Trump has tried to distance himself from what he calls “the plague” as he pursues reelection, Pence has emerged as the public face of this phase of the outbreak, traveling frequently to virus hot spots, coordinating with governors and leading the administration’s coronavirus task force.The role, according to those close to him, is a natural fit for Pence, a former Indiana governor who sees it as his job to defend the president and reopen the country as safely as possible. But allies are keenly aware that Pence’s political future will hinge on whether Trump wins a second term.If Trump loses, and Pence makes his own run at the presidency in 2024, he probably would face many candidates from a new generation of politicians. That could include Nikki Haley, former ambassador to the United Nations and South Carolina governor, and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark.Robert Blendon, a professor of health policy and political analysis at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said Pence faces a “real dilemma” because Trump’s reelection depends so much on an economic rebound predicated on states reopening during the pandemic.From a public health perspective, “We’re actually losing again. It’s getting worse. We’re gong to have to cut back in the economy,” he said.After spending time on the road highlighting reopening efforts, Pence traveled this past week to Arizona and Florida, states where cases are surging. He tried to make the case that the country is in a far improved position now than it was early on in the outbreak when testing capacity was dismal and doctors and nurses were desperate for basic protective equipment.“The American people deserve to know that we’re in a much better place today, thanks to the whole-of-government approach, the whole-of-America approach that President Trump initiated at the very outset of the coronavirus pandemic,” Pence said Tuesday during a task force briefing held not at the White House but at the U.S. Public Health Service headquarters in Rockville, Maryland.White House officials and allies stress there are positive signs beyond the flow of supplies, with deaths remaining down and several therapeutics on the market. The point of the lockdowns, they stress, was to flatten the infection curve to avoid overwhelming hospitals, not eliminate cases.To further push that message, Pence is expected to resume campaign travel soon. Campaign officials met by phone on Thursday to map out media markets where they feel he could be beneficial.While Trump favors large-scale rallies, Pence will continue to focus on more intimate settings, inducing diner visits, bus tours and smaller speaking engagements, especially in front of groups such as white evangelicals and suburban families who may be more receptive to a less hyper-political message.Pence will focus on swing states by stressing local issues and trying to show voters how the administration has affected their lives for the good. He’s expected to spend plenty of time in states such as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, as well as Arizona and North Carolina, talking about bringing back manufacturing jobs. It’s a promise Trump made in 2016 that has been largely unmet.At the same time, however, Trump’s campaign recently disbanded a team of staffers dedicated to Pence, including his communications director, spokesperson and the director of vice presidential operations. Strategy and planning are now being handled by Marty Obst, a longtime Pence adviser who served as his campaign manager in 2016, and Marc Short, his chief of staff.While some described the move as a natural transition given the vice president already has a full staff at the White House, others said it suggested a diminished role on a campaign that sees Pence more as a surrogate than a principal.Trump campaign spokeswoman Ali Pardo dismissed that suggestion, saying Pence “has played an integral role in promoting and implementing President Trump’s ‘America First’ agenda across the country.”Pence has made clear he feels this is Trump’s campaign and he has every right to run it how he wants.Barry Bennett, a longtime Republican strategist who worked for Trump in 2016, praised Pence’s performance.“He has a very tough job. But so far I think he’s managed to do it with compassion and integrity,” he said. “He’s probably the only that’s come out of the pandemic experience with positive results.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/people-aren-t-stupid-why-mike-pence-s-optimism-on-coronavirus-tests-credibility/story-w8SmgAG6VHrPfVKc2fAKnN.html
04-07-2020||World||Much of US scales back on holiday, but Donald Trump plans to go big||As coronavirus cases spike, public health officials are pleading with Americans to avoid large crowds and hold more muted Independence Day celebrations, but subdued is not President Donald Trump’s style, and he aimed to go big, promising a “special evening” in Washington that could bring tens of thousands to the National Mall.Trump’s “Salute for America” celebration on Saturday evening was to include a speech from the White House South Lawn that he said would celebrate American heritage, as well as a military flyover over the city and an enormous fireworks display that could pack people downtown.The president kicked off the holiday weekend by traveling to Mount Rushmore in South Dakota for a fireworks display Friday night near the mountain carvings of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. In his remarks, he accused protesters who have pushed for racial justice of engaging in a “merciless campaign to wipe out our history.”In a presidential message Saturday on the 244th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, Trump acknowledged that “over the past months, the American spirit has undoubtedly been tested by many challenges.”His participation in big gatherings comes as many communities have decided to scrap fireworks, parades and other holiday traditions. The goal is to try to prevent further spread of the coronavirus, which large gatherings could spur. Confirmed cases are climbing in 40 states, and the U.S. set another record Friday with 52,300 newly reported infections, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.For the Mount Rushmore event, GOP Gov. Kristi Noem, a Trump ally, insisted social distancing wasn’t necessary and masks were optional. Trump spent little time in his Mount Rushmore address reflecting on pandemic, which has killed more than 129,000 Americans.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cautions that mass gatherings like the one scheduled for Washington present a high risk for spread of the virus.Trump’s surgeon general, Jerome Adams, who has stepped up his call for Americans to wear a mask in public, sidestepped when asked during an interview Friday whether he would caution a loved one from attending such large gatherings. “It’s not a yes or no,” Adams told NBC’s “Today Show.” “Every single person has to make up their own mind.”Trump has been aching to see the nation return to normalcy, and has been willing to push the envelope further than many state and big city mayors are willing to go.Last month, he held his first campaign rally since early March in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Trump is accustomed to jam-packed crowds, but the BOK Center was only about one-third full for the president’s first rally of the coronavirus era. Days later, he addressed a packed megachurch for a Students for Trump event in Arizona. Few attendees at either event wore masks.Interior officials said they would hand out 300,000 face coverings to spectators who gather on the National Mall. Interior Department Secretary David Bernhardt said visitors would be encouraged to wear masks and keep a six-foot distance from one another. There was no indication that would be mandatory, despite the recommendations of health officials.Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, who said she didn’t have the right to shut down the holiday spectacle because it’s on federal land, warned the federal government about the obvious dangers of such a large crowd. On Friday, she urged the city’s residents to be smart about how they spend the holiday. “Just because someone invites you to a party doesn’t mean you have to go,” Bowser tweeted.In other holiday weekend developments:—California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, warned counties that they risked losing state money if they failed to enforce health orders heading into the holiday weekend. He urged residents not to gather with people they don’t live with and to avoid crowds. Fireworks shows in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and elsewhere in the state were canceled.—Gov. J.B. Pritzker, D-Ill., said he would not hesitate to close down businesses that don’t abide by capacity requirements, and he encouraged people to avoid large crowds.—Beach closures in prime locations are a pandemic fallout. Florida’s most populous county, Miami-Dade, was closing down again, imposing a curfew and shuttering the sand. In California, beach closures went from Los Angeles County northward through Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. To the south in Orange County, hugely popular beaches such as Huntington and Newport were affected.—Even with large public festivities scrapped, sales of consumer fireworks have boomed. Some officials are concerned about fires and injuries with more pyrotechnics going off in backyards and at block parties. At Casey’s Fireworks Friday in Columbia, South Carolina, mostly masked shoppers wove through aisles. The shop, like many around the country, has been an unexpected beneficiary as more Americans have decided to put on their own shows. “This whole COVID thing has been really bad all around,” said Forest Casey, a fourth-generation fireworks salesman at the family-owned shop. “But for whatever reason it makes people really want to buy fireworks.”—Four East Coast cities were to get their own mini-displays of air power before the extensive U.S. military air show over Washington, The “Salute to the Great Cities of the American Revolution” involves flyovers in Boston, New York City, Philadelphia and Baltimore.—About 150 preachers, rabbis and imams intended to frame holiday sermons around “What to the Slave is the Fourth of July” on the 168th anniversary of that speech by Black abolitionist Frederick Douglass. The former slave gave his speech at an Independence Day celebration on July 5, 1852, in Rochester, New York. The address challenged the Founding Fathers and the hypocrisy of their ideals with the existence of slavery on American soil.—-Associated Press writers Michelle Liu in Columbia, South Carolina, and Sara Burnett in Chicago contributed to this report..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/much-of-us-scales-back-on-holiday-but-donald-trump-plans-to-go-big/story-GnAh6sNplvqtw1WfZq8CjI.html
04-07-2020||World||US envoy forges ahead with troubled Taliban peace deal||Washington’s envoy to Afghanistan on Saturday emphasized the economic benefits of the peace deal with the Taliban, forging ahead with an agreement that has run into new political obstacles in the U.S. and the region.Zalmay Khalilzad was wrapping up a week-long trip that included stops in Uzbekistan, Pakistan and the Gulf state of Qatar, where Taliban negotiators are headquartered.Accompanying Khalilzad for the first time was an economic development team led by U.S. International Development Finance Corporation Chief Executive Officer Adam Boehler.Khalilzad offered no details about the kinds of economic projects being envisioned to jump-start an economy battered by widespread corruption and currently 75% funded by international donations. However, he did suggest joint economic projects involving Qatar and Pakistan, possibly on infrastructure and trade.The U.S. signed a peace deal with the Taliban in February to end 19 years of war in Afghanistan.Khalilzad has sought to stress the economic benefits of the peace deal throughout his tour. In a series of tweets early Saturday, the U.S. envoy said he met with the Qatar Investment Authority and the Taliban’s chief negotiator Mullah Abdul Ghani, in the tiny Gulf state’s capital of Doha.“We agreed development plans in support of peace can never start too early,” Khalilzad tweeted.However, Washington has recently become embroiled in a controversy over intelligence reports that Russia was paying money to insurgents with links to the Taliban to kill American and NATO soldiers.The identity of the insurgents who took the bounty money is still vague but the payments have been traced to an Afghan drug lord, Rahmatullah Azizi, who is living in Moscow, according to Afghan officials who spoke with The Associated Press.The officials said the money was delivered through Azizi’s brother Wahidullah, who was the go-between for those facilitating the attacks on U.S. troops.The New York Times first reported the U.S. intelligence claiming the payment of bounties as well as Azizi’s involvement.Added to the uncertainty and delays swirling around the U.S-Taliban peace deal, the Pentagon released a report Wednesday that questioned the Taliban’s commitment to end its ties with Al-Qaida. The peace deal calls for the Taliban to fight against terrorist organizations and ensure Afghanistan would not be used again to attack U.S. interests or its allies. Critics of the deal say the militants can’t be trusted.Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied contacts with Al-Qaida in the Indian subcontinent, saying the insurgents were committed to the peace deal.Khalilzad embarked on his tour of the region last weekend, even as the rate of coronavirus infections in the United States soared and countries worldwide struggled with the dangers of re-opening.He did not travel to Afghanistan, citing the dangers of the pandemic, and instead held videoconference calls with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his government partner, Abdullah Abdullah.Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi tested positive for COVID 19, just 48 after meeting with with Khalilzad. Both had been pictured wearing masks during their meeting on Wednesday in the Pakistani capital of IslamabadQureshi said he developed a fever on Friday and tested positive to the virus. But he promised to “carry on” his official duties from home.Even as Khalilzad winds up his latest diplomatic mission, there was no date for crucial intra-Afghan negotiations that bring the Taliban together with the Afghan government and other local actors. Khalilzad called for a quick resolution of outstanding issues so those negotiations could begin.The biggest hurdle has been the release of prisoners. The peace deal called for the Afghan government to free 5,000 Taliban prisoners in exchange for the Taliban releasing 1,000 government personnel. So far, the government has freed 4,015 and the Taliban has freed 669, according to the Afghan government..Ghani earlier this week suggested that his government had a problem with some of the names on the Taliban’s list of prisoners to be released and said alternative names would be given.It seems unlikely that the Taliban will accept anyone not on the list agreed upon during negotiations with the U.S.Suhail Shaheen, Taliban political spokesman in Doha, called the Afghan government reasons for delaying prisoner releases “phony excuses” and the reason for the delay in beginning intra-Afghan talks.As of Saturday, Afghanistan had recorded 32,600 confirmed cases of coronavirus, but international non-governmental organizations say the rate is much higher and have warned that the country’s war-ravaged health care system risks collapsing.Seemingly indicative of the lack of health care facilities in Afghanistan to deal with the virus, Ghani’s special envoy for economic development, Yosuf Ghaznafar, went to Turkey when he became ill with COVID-19. On Friday he died of the disease, according to a statement from the presidency. Ghaznafar is the senior most Afghan official to die of the virus.Afghanistan has so far recorded 826 deaths from the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-envoy-forges-ahead-with-troubled-taliban-peace-deal/story-kkVci7puk7GRCvgI44xtQL.html

04-07-2020||World||Pubs and restaurants reopen in England as lockdown eased||England is embarking on Saturday on perhaps its biggest lockdown easing yet as pubs and restaurants have the right to reopen for the first time in more than three months.In addition to the reopening of much of the hospitality sector, couples can tie the knot once again, people can go and see a movie at their local cinema and many of those who have had enough of their lockdown hair can finally get a trim. In all cases, social distancing rules have to be followed.Though the easing of the lockdown will be warmly welcomed by many, there are concerns that the British government is being overly hasty, even reckless, in sanctioning the changes, given the country’s still-high coronavirus infection and death rates.On Friday, another 137 virus-related deaths were recorded across the U.K., the large majority in England, taking the total to 44,131, by far the highest in Europe and third behind the United States and Brazil.Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the decision to ease the lockdown is based on the scientific evidence that people are “appreciably less likely now to be in close proximity” with someone with the virus than at the height of the pandemic.“Let’s not blow it now,” he said.In other countries, the reopening of bars and restaurants has been blamed for a spike in infections.The four nations of the U.K. — England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — are easing the lockdown at different speeds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pubs-and-restaurants-reopen-in-england-as-lockdown-eased/story-8M5fswSYLuvZhweufwdKjM.html
04-07-2020||World||Russia announces coronavirus deaths exceed 10,000||Russia on Saturday said that it recorded more than 10,000 deaths from the coronavirus pandemic, a toll that is still far lower than in other countries with major outbreaks.The number of deaths has now reached 10,027, the government information website said, up by 168 from Friday. Russia has confirmed 674,515 cases, the third largest total in the world, although the daily infection rate has been falling over the last month.The country’s death toll is much lower than in other countries with large outbreaks, raising questions over possible underreporting of deaths.Russia has acknowledged that the death figure on the government website only includes cases where the virus was classed as the main cause of death on the death certificate.The official statistics agency has released national death data for April alone, where the toll -- of 2,712 -- is more than double the government’s total of 1,152 for that month. That is because it uses a broader definition on the basis of World Health Organization recommendations and includes cases where the victim tested positive but the virus was not classified as the main cause of death, or where there was no positive test but an autopsy ruled the virus was the main cause of death.Moscow city health department also released data on deaths in May using this method of classification, showing 5,260 virus-related deaths that month.By contrast, the government website still says that some 3,929 people in total have died so far from the virus just in Moscow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-announces-coronavirus-deaths-exceed-10-000/story-alSvvYQXYkVFvjvAK5irSN.html
04-07-2020||World||Ghislaine Maxwell’s case will unearth secrets Epstein took to his grave||The death of Jeffrey Epstein in a New York prison cell last summer robbed his accusers of a chance for justice and shut down the tantalizing possibility that the secrets of a sordid life spent among the rich and powerful might be revealed.Thursday’s arrest of Ghislaine Maxwell -- almost exactly a year after Epstein was arrested -- suggests a fuller accounting of his acts might yet come.The charges paint Maxwell as a central figure in Epstein’s criminal enterprise. She spent years at his side. He described her as his “best friend.” She was his girlfriend for a time, though their relationship truly deepened in the years Maxwell was organizing his affairs, an arrangement that included running his households and piloting his helicopter.And she stood at the very center of the web of wealthy and powerful figures surrounding Epstein. The network she inherited from her billionaire father, the late British publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell, gave Epstein access to the highest echelons of society. She even introduced Brooklyn-born Epstein to Britain’s Prince Andrew, whose connection to the pedophile has forced the British royal from public duties.What did she see? Whom might she incriminate? Those are just some of the questions a trial might explore. While Maxwell has repeatedly asserted her innocence, investigators and Epstein’s victims say she was the ringleader of the operation that coordinated years of sexual abuse in Florida, New York and beyond.Read More: Jeffrey Epstein Found Dead in Jail, Raising ‘Serious Questions’Epstein’s high-powered network means there’s potential for a public reckoning that could tarnish top figures on Wall Street, in corporate America and in Washington. Perhaps more important, a trial would at long last give victims a chance to face at least one of their alleged tormentors.“There is no way for prosecutors to present a case against her without going into all the evidence they had against Epstein, because the charges here are intertwined,” said Jessica Roth, a former federal prosecutor who teaches at Cardozo School of Law in New York. “The original indictment against Jeffrey Epstein made it clear that he didn’t act alone and that the government had evidence that other people were also involved.”Maxwell, a onetime British socialite, was arrested at home in Bradford, New Hampshire, and could face as long as 35 years behind bars if convicted. A judge ordered her held in jail at least until she appears in court in New York, where she is charged. Her lawyer declined to comment.Prosecutors described Maxwell as one of the “villains” at the center of Epstein’s exploitation of girls, saying she lured them into his clutches. She helped “normalize” the sexual abuse by her presence as a mature woman and by feigning interest in and friendship with the girls, Audrey Strauss, the acting U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said at a news conference.‘Critical Role’Maxwell played a “critical role” in helping Epstein identify, befriend and groom minor victims for abuse, Strauss said.The investigation is “ongoing,” she added.Where that investigation will lead is uncertain -- at least to the public. Maxwell may choose not to fight the charges and could agree to cooperate in the U.S. probe, opening up new avenues of inquiry for the government.Prosecutors may also turn their sights on others. Investigators in New York still seek to interview Andrew, whom Maxwell introduced to Epstein; the prince’s lawyers have rejected U.S. claims that he’s refusing to talk, and Andrew denies any wrongdoing.U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the U.S. hasn’t asked for an interview, but declined to comment on whether Britain would comply with such a demand. “No such approach has been made,” he said in an interview on LBC Radio on Friday. “It’s a matter for the Royal Family.”Read More: Prince Andrew’s Lawyers Say He Tried to Help Epstein ProbeShould Maxwell take her case to trial, the government will be forced to disclose much of the evidence it’s amassed. Epstein’s death last year in prison, which authorities ruled a suicide, appeared at the time to put an end to such a possibility.Now, as the case against Maxwell moves forward, at least some of the questions will be answered.Is Maxwell innocent, as she’s repeatedly said? If not, why did she aid Epstein -- and how? How many girls and women did Epstein abuse? Did his scheme have help from lawyers or accountants? Did he or others try to buy the victims’ silence? What went on at Epstein’s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands?There are other mysteries. Why did federal prosecutors in Florida in 2008 allow Epstein to plead guilty to relatively minor felony charges of procuring an underage girl for prostitution and soliciting a prostitute? That plea deal, which they’ve defended as appropriate, came after the government identified dozens of girls he was suspected of abusing.And why are prosecutors from the public-corruption unit in the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office now assigned to the case? That suggests a public official may be under investigation, said former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti.‘Feared Epstein’“I hope that the investigation turns up additional evidence that has not come to light,” said Josh Schiffer, an Atlanta-based attorney who represents Epstein’s victims in civil cases. “I look forward to reviewing the evidence.”For victims, a trial would provide the chance to be heard.“For years, I feared Epstein and his ring,” Jennifer Araoz, who says she was raped by Epstein at 15 after being recruited to visit his Manhattan townhouse as a high school freshman in 2001, said in a statement Thursday. “Maxwell was the center of that sex-trafficking ring. Now that the ring has been taken down, I know that I can’t be hurt anymore.”In coming days, Maxwell will be transported to New York, where she will appear in court, likely seek to be released on bail and probably begin to fight the charges. As she does, some of the mysteries surrounding the Epstein case may begin to be revealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ghislaine-maxwell-s-case-will-unearth-secrets-epstein-took-to-his-grave/story-rbQA3w2oGhAKkZMWSkzYtN.html
04-07-2020||World||Covid-19 pandemic tanks Russian economy, plunges families into crisis||As countries across the globe has been facing the worst collective economic downturn since the Great Depression, Russia seems to be particularly hard hit by the twin blows of the coronavirus pandemic as well as the collapse in oil prices.Russia relies on taxes from the oil and gas sector for 40 per cent of its budget.The Washington Post reported that Russian charities and non-profit organisations, since March, experienced a surge in the kind of clients they have not had before -- families that had never been in financial crisis, but are now desperate. Some of them were unable to buy even food. Some were left homeless.According to Russian federal statistics agency, Rosstat, an estimated 4.5 million people were out of work at the end of May -- a number that has soared 85 per cent since March. Before the double crises hit, Russia had 1.3 million people listed as unemployed, according to official figures.The jobless rate now stands at 6.1 per cent, compared with 5.8 per cent in April. In the United States, the unemployment rate in June was 11.1 per cent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported, down from a peak of 14.7 per cent in April.In May, Russia’s industrial output slumped by 9.6 per cent compared with May 2019 as restrictions on oil production under a deal with OPEC hit home. The auto-manufacturing industry was particularly hard hit, down by 42.2 per cent in May compared with the same period last year.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects the Russian economy to contract by 5.5 per cent this year. The Russian Central Bank said that it could shrink by up to 6 per cent. In comparison, the US economy shrank at a 5 per cent rate in the first quarter of this year, the Commerce Department reported in late June.Thousands of small businesses in Russia have gone bankrupt. The government was slow to respond and belated, patchy measures left millions of people adrift.“You are on your own,” said Ivan Molchanov, a welder who spent 20 nights on the streets after his employer suspended operations and stopped paying both his 75,000-ruble monthly salary (about USD 1,070) and his accommodation in a cheap workers’ hostel.Yekaterina Gorbunova, her husband, Alexander and their four children lost nearly everything. She even wrote to President Vladimir Putin and the office of Moscow’s mayor asking for help getting an apartment. But no help came in time.“We feel absolutely abandoned. It is as if you are in a boat and it is sinking. No one will come to rescue you,” she said after her husband lost his job and the family was evicted from their apartment.“Nobody pays any attention to the people in need. Instead of doing good, no one cares,” she added.As Russia has eased its isolation period, some people have returned to work, including the beautician and the chef. But many small businesses have closed and many jobs have been lost.Putin has often promised to support families with many children, but many feel abandoned. During the crisis, families have received payments of 10,000 rubles (USD 142) per month for each child younger than 16, but Gorbunova said that the payment does not cover a week’s worth of expenses, even without rent.“All families with many children feel that way,” she said.“President Putin is a nice person. But as very often happens, a fortress is broken on the inside. There are worms burrowing inside the fortress,” she added.The number of Russians filing for bankruptcy protection in the first quarter increased 68 per cent over the same period last year, according to RBC news, with at least one million Russians predicted to declare bankruptcy in coming months.But even as many middle-class families and small businesses struggle, it is tougher for vulnerable families, homeless people and low-income people, many of whom do informal work in the “gray economy,” a category excluded from government help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pandemic-tanks-russian-economy-plunges-families-into-crisis/story-Zr9h80gpwqCdXjXVge6Y8O.html

Meanwhile, the Pakistan government said it would reopen four border checkpoints with Iran from Sunday to facilitate the movement of goods. The border was sealed earlier in the year after the coronavirus outbreak in Iran. Last month, a phased reopening of the border had begun. In a notification, the Ministry of Interior said the crossings at Gabd, Mand, Katagar and Chedgi will be opened. The decision was taken after Minister for Planning and NCOC chief Asad Umar said the infection spread was slowing. “The border posts will remain open seven days a week from morning to evening only for trade as per mutually agreed understanding between both the countries,” it said. According to the notification, there will be no limit to truck movement if Covid-19 standard operating procedures are followed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-reports-3-387-new-covid-19-cases/story-pXDdX5sYbaUrQ6P1rrJCHK.html
04-07-2020||World||Pakistan reiterates its commitment towards ‘One China’ policy||Pakistan and China have a tradition of “mutual support to each other in the face of common challenges”, foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has said against the backdrop of the India-China border standoff.Qureshi made the remarks during a phone conversation with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Friday, during which they discussed bilateral and regional issues. Qureshi also contended that India’s “belligerent posture and expansionist policies were imperilling peace in the region”, according to a statement from Pakistan’s Foreign Office.The conversation was held amid the months-old standoff between Indian and Chinese border troops. China has deployed additional troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) even as three rounds of talks between Indian and Chinese military commanders has not resulted in substantial efforts to de-escalate the situation.During the phone conversation, Qureshi said Pakistan and China are “all-weather strategic cooperative partners” and had preserved a “tradition of expressing solidarity, mutual assistance and mutual support to each other in the face of common challenges”.Without referring to the border standoff with India, Qureshi also said Pakistan is committed to the “One-China policy” and firmly supports China on its “core interests including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet and Xinjiang”. He added that disputes in the region should be resolved through peaceful means and agreed mechanisms rather than “resorting to unilateral, illegal and coercive measures” that he claimed were reflected by India’s decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in August last year.Qureshi contended that the regional security situation was deteriorating and “underlined that India’s belligerent posture and expansionist policies were imperilling peace in the region”. “Apart from committing egregious violations of human rights in [Jammu and Kashmir], India was seeking to change the demographic structure of the occupied territory,” he said.He also briefed Wang on what he described as “repeated violations” by India along the Line of Control (LoC) and said Pakistan was exercising restraint. Wang briefed Qureshi on the regional situation and lauded Pakistan’s efforts to promote peace and stability. Wang also thanked Pakistan for the support it has extended to China during “difficult and challenging times”.Both sides said they would support each other at multilateral institutions. The two foreign ministers also said they would promote peace and development in Afghanistan. They hoped the next meeting of the China-Afghanistan-Pakistan foreign ministers dialogue will take place at the earliest. Both sides also said they would take steps for the earliest possible economic recovery in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. Qureshi said the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will become the hub of trade and economic activity and sustainable development. Pakistan and China are taking steps to help the timely completion of CPEC projects, he added.Wang said CPEC is a flagship project of BRI and its second phase will complement Pakistan’s efforts aimed at job creation, enhancing agricultural productivity, reducing poverty and massive economic recovery. He thanked Pakistan for supporting China’s idea of a “Health Silk Road” to address the region’s social and economic needs.Both sides said they would implement consensus reached by the leadership of the two countries to deepen strategic consultation and coordination to promote shared goals of peace and stability. The ministers also decided to have a face-to-face meeting soon to discuss challenges facing the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/committed-to-one-china-policy-pak-foreign-minister-assures-chinese-counterpart/story-fZsNFNTuCTlg29qVAkQHZO.html
04-07-2020||World||WHO team to visit China next week to investigate origins of coronavirus||Amid global concerns that China delayed giving information regarding the novel coronavirus outbreak, a team of WHO (World Health Organisation) will visit the country next week to investigate the origins of the virus and its spread to human beings.The visit will take place more than six months after the WHO’s Country Office in China picked up a statement from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on cases of ‘viral pneumonia’. WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus spoke in January about an agreement with China for sending a team of international experts “as soon as possible” to work on increasing the understanding of the outbreak. Covid-19 has killed over 500,000 people in the world and cases and deaths are increasing by the day.In an exclusive interview with ANI, Dr Soumya Swaminathan, Chief Scientist, WHO said that a “thorough investigation” needs to be done into the origins of the virus.She said that the WHO has been working with the Chinese government for the visit. “A team is going to China next week to investigate the origins of the virus,” Swaminathan told ANI.“What is needed now is a good investigation going back before December to find out where and how it jumped from animal to human. Was there any intermediate animal or not or it directly jumped from bat to humans which are also possible? Bats have been implicated in other viral diseases -- Nipah for example. It is possible it came directly. It is also possible that there was an intermediate animal-like in the case of SARS. That thorough investigation still needs to be done,” she said.Dr Swaminathan said that the Chinese government had reported an outbreak of “typical pneumonia cases” from Wuhan on December 31.“Our WHO country office in China picked it up and on January 1, WHO activated its international mechanisms which we do as part of international health regulations whenever there’s any new signal gets reported. It is conveyed to everyone so that the whole world knows about it,” she said.Dr Swaminathan said that sequences show that the virus causing Covid-19 is very similar to bat viruses.“We do not know more than that in the sense where and how it originated. We know from the virus sequences that it is very similar to bat viruses. A lot of studies have been done in South-East Asia to show that bats have lots of coronaviruses. There are over 500 types of coronaviruses. There are also previous studies showing that populations living in southern China and even in other countries of South-East Asia have antibodies to coronaviruses,” she said.The pandemic has grown to more than 10 million cases and has caused over 500,000 deaths across the world.The WHO Director-General had talked on January 29 of his agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping that the organisation would lead a team of international experts to China “as soon as possible” to work with the government on increasing the understanding of the outbreak and to guide global response efforts.On December 31 last year, WHO’s Country Office in China picked up a media statement by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission from their website on cases of ‘viral pneumonia’ in Wuhan. The next day, WHO requested information on the reported cluster of atypical pneumonia cases in Wuhan from the Chinese authorities.WHO reported on January 9 that Chinese authorities have determined that the outbreak is caused by a novel coronavirus. The organisation said on February 11 that the disease caused by the novel coronavirus would be named Covid-19.There have been reports of China delaying information and warning concerning the novel coronavirus which could have helped in containing its spread in the initial days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-team-to-visit-china-next-week-to-investigate-origins-of-coronavirus/story-3AGI2UhcQ4ASfB9g5SNYuL.html
04-07-2020||World||Not welcome: Japan’s Shinzo Abe could cancel state visit by China’s Xi Jinping||Chinese president Xi Jinping’s state visit to Japan, initially scheduled for April but put off due to the coronavirus pandemic, is set to be scuttled by Tokyo after loud protests within Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Xi’s state visit would have been the first by a Chinese President since 2008.Tensions have been simmering between China and Japan for some time but the latest provocation for LDP lawmakers to formally ask the government to reconsider Xi’s visit is China’s imposition of the national security law over Hong Kong. Japanese lawmakers are deeply concerned about China’s clampdown in Hong Kong. Japan fears the sweeping Chinese security law that came into effect this week would undermine the rights of Japanese people and companies in Hong Kong.Also Read: Indo-China stand-off: Global support for India growsJapan has accused China of exploiting the coronavirus pandemic to push its aggressive diplomacy and tighten its grip over Hong Kong, a global financial hub where Japan has significant interests. About 1,400 Japanese companies have a presence in Hong Kong, which is the world’s largest importer of Japanese agricultural goods. The Japanese business community is concerned that the Chinese national security legislation would shake the foundations of Hong Kong. Also Read: PM Modi’s surprise visit to Ladakh is a game-changer: ExpertsJapan has strongly criticised the move, saying it erodes Hong Kong’s freedom and goes against the promise of allowing a high degree of autonomy in the former British colony for 50 years after its return to China in 1997. Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi issued a statement of regret over the legislation in which he urged China to respect the rights of Japanese people and companies operating in Hong Kong.China’s Territorial Hunger The visit by Chinese leader could have helped to smoothen bilateral ties long frayed over wartime history and territorial issues. In recent weeks, however, China has continued to send ships to waters near the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. Since April this year, Japan has spotted 67 Chinese Coast Guard ships near these waters, heightening the already tense situation brewing over the mishandling of coronavirus pandemic by China. Japan’s Defence Minister Taro Kono said China’s behaviour over the East China Sea Islands was jeopardising peace in the region. The statement came amid long-simmering tensions between the two countries over the Senkaku Islands in Japan and Diaoyu in China which falls in the East China Sea.Also Read: Japan opposes any ‘unilateral attempt to change status quo’ on LACRhetoric has risen in recent days, with Japan reporting increased activity from China in the area. Japan had scrambled fighter jets after the Chinese military flew near Japanese airspace. If Japan retaliates, the move could trigger a massive military conflict in the region which can involve the United States in the matter as Washington is bound to defend Tokyo in pursuant of the defence treaty between the two countries.At a recent news conference, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga stressed that the Senkaku Islands “are under our control and are unquestionably our territory, historically and under international law. We think it is an extremely serious matter that these activities continue”.“We will respond firmly and calmly to the Chinese side,” the top Japanese official said. China’s claims that the Diaoyu Islands and its affiliated islands are an inherent part of China’s territory and it is Beijing’s “inherent right” to carry out patrols and law enforcement activities in these waters. Communist Party of China’s mouth-piece, The Global Times wrote that the “Japanese conservatives disrupt recovering China-Japan ties by hyping the Diaoyu Islands dispute”.The chain of uninhabited disputed islands lie east of the Chinese mainland and south-west of Japan’s Okinawa Island. They are close to strategically important shipping lanes and offer rich fishing grounds with vast reserves of oil and natural gas in this swathe of the sea has made these islands that barely covers an area of 7 square kilometre coveted by both Japan and China. In 2012, the Japanese government bought three of the islands from their private Japanese owner who have held them since the 1930s, a move which sparked a new row and protests in Chinese cities. Since then, Chinese ships have been sailing in and out of what Japan says are its territorial waters, prompting fears of a clash.Amid the growing domestic disquiet over China’s behaviour and heightened security concerns, Japanese Defence Minister Taro Kono also sounded a cautious note about welcoming Xi, saying that the security situation facing Japan should be taken into consideration. “As Defence Minister responsible for security, I will make my voice heard within the government,” he said in a press conference held last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-targets-japan-xi-s-visit-comes-under-cloud/story-XjDtPWmoLYEgL9Nzrmp0GL.html

04-07-2020||World||Trudeau faces probe for $664 million Canada charity contract||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing a probe over his government’s decision to award a contract worth more than C$900 million ($664 million) to an organization that he and his family have ties to.The Canada Student Service Grant was awarded to the WE Charity to set up a program that would pay students to earn funds for tuition and expenses during the pandemic as employment options dried up. The plan was to pay students a one-time grant between C$1,000 to C$5,000 to take part in service activities.The Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner received requests from two lawmakers this week asking that the federal watchdog examine Trudeau’s conduct. An investigation is underway, it said, adding that the premier has been informed.The prime minister and his mother have appeared at a number of WE Day events, while his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, hosts a podcast for the group called “WE Well-being,” the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported.WE Charity and the federal government announced Friday they were ending their partnership. WE Charity, which operates in 130 school districts and agencies, had agreed to help run the program after being approached by officials in late April, and said it had successfully launched the program. It decided to withdraw amid the growing controversy, it said, adding that it would waive all costs associated with setting up the program and plans to return all funds earmarked for it.“We will collaborate with the Ethics Commissioner’s investigation and will answer all questions he may have,” Ann-Clara Vaillancourt, a spokesperson for Trudeau, said in an email.The prime minister has already been reprimanded twice by the country’s ethics watchdog: for a secret vacation in 2016 at the private island of the Aga Khan, a spiritual leader of Ismaili Muslims, and for breaking conflict of interest laws by pressuring his former attorney general to help SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. settle corruption charges out of court.Conservative politician Michael Barrett said that Trudeau’s ties to the charity and his wife’s involvement with the organization has contravened his obligations under the Conflict of Interest Act.“I have considered your request and am of the view that it satisfies the requirements set out in subsection 22(2) of the act,” Mario Dion, commissioner of the watchdog, said in a statement.Another Member of Parliament, Charlie Angus, also requested a review into Trudeau’s conduct on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trudeau-faces-probe-for-664-million-canada-charity-contract/story-HTxStWM0beaEvaXExImsqL.html

Donald Trump Jr was tested negative, but as a precaution is also self-isolating and is cancelling all public events.”Guilfoyle is the third person close to the US president to return a positive Covid-19 test, US media reported.Others include Trump’s personal valet and the US vice president’s press secretary.The pandemic has claimed nearly 130,000 American lives and a recent resurgence “puts the entire country at risk,” top infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-junior-s-girlfriend-coronavirus-positive/story-3S9rEQTmp6sC7FKC53vElK.html
04-07-2020||World||New outbreaks push inmate coronavirus cases past 50,000||The number of prison inmates testing positive for the coronavirus soared well past the 50,000 mark last month, as recent outbreaks threatened to undo control measures put in place earlier in the pandemic.At the end of June, the total number of coronavirus cases among prisoners had reached at least 52,649, an increase of 8% from the week before, according to data compiled by the Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization focusing on criminal justice, and The Associated Press.Of those, at least 35,796 have recovered, and at least 616 inmates have died, the data showed.Among staff, more than 11,180 cases of coronavirus have been reported, including 43 deaths.As of June 30, only Wyoming and Hawaii still had not identified any confirmed cases of coronavirus among prisoners.New cases in prisons began to drop last month, with less of the rapid growth seen in the spring when Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas and other states began mass testing of prisoners, the data shows.But by the end of June, new outbreaks in Arkansas, California and Texas began to push the numbers up again.The rising cases in prisons is mirroring a large increase in cases across the US, where there have been some 50,000 total per day over the past few days and hot spots are exploding in multiple states, including Arizona, Florida and Texas.Prisons have been of specific concern because of social distancing worries, and the fear that outbreaks inside crowded facilities can affect surrounding communities as employees and vendors come and go.The federal Bureau of Prisons recorded the most inmate deaths at 94. Ohio led states with the most deaths, with 86 reported through the end of June. More than 5,000 federal inmates have tested positive.Coronavirus outbreaks in prison are an indictment of mass incarceration in the US, with many systems warehousing people in situations that make social distancing impossible, said Nicole Porter, director of advocacy for The Sentencing Project.Porter said the response by governors has been inadequate, with only minimal releases of inmates in most states in an effort to free up space. At the very least, authorities should be moving to release all inmates scheduled to get out this year, she said.In Louisiana, for example, a state panel tasked with examining up to 1,100 inmates for release ultimately approved just 100, of which 63 will be released, The Advocate reported.“A global pandemic creates a level of urgency that people should not be kept in prison one day longer than necessary,” Porter said. “Many of those people pose absolutely no threat to public safety and their liberty would have been restored anyway this year.”California saw a setback this week in its efforts to control the virus, when a third of the 3,500 inmates at San Quentin State Prison near San Francisco tested positive after officials transferred 121 inmates from the heavily affected California Institution for Men in Chino on May 30 without properly testing them for infections.Gov. Gavin Newsom has defended his administration’s handling of the pandemic in prisons, noting that he has ordered about 3,500 early releases, plans about 3,500 more, and halted transfers from local jails to create more space in prisons for social isolation.Six states — Arkansas, Connecticut, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Tennessee — now have infection rates higher than one of every 10 inmates, according to the Marshall Project data.In Ohio, cases have now been reported in nearly all prisons, but two account for the majority of cases: Pickaway Correctional Institution in central Ohio, which includes a medical wing, and Marion Correctional Institution in north-central Ohio, where virtually all inmates tested positive.Thirty-six inmates died at Pickaway and 13 at Marion, according to the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction.Prison advocates in Ohio are using the pandemic to promote legislation working its way through the Statehouse that would reduce the number of people sent to prison for drug crimes.“They could save lives by reducing the prison population as the Covid-19 death toll continues to rise behind bars,” said Piet van Lier, a researcher for Policy Matters Ohio.The state says it reduced Ohio’s prison population by 3,170 inmates — a 6.5% drop — since March through several measures, including releasing inmates early, the normal expiration of sentences, and temporarily suspending intakes of male prisoners from county jails, though that policy has since ended.The population of around 47,000 is now the lowest since 2006. The Ohio prison system’s goal in responding to the pandemic “was to reduce the prison population in a manner which maintained public safety,” spokeswoman JoEllen Smith said Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-outbreaks-push-inmate-coronavirus-cases-past-50-000/story-tZTTYGEZwm2XYz7oMnrdbI.html

04-07-2020||World||America supports India against Chinese aggression: US Senator||An influential American Senator on Friday said that the US stands with India against the Chinese aggression in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control, commending the Indian government for the continued efforts to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the boundary issue. Republican Senator Rick Scott, in a letter dated July 2 to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, expressed his condolences on the loss of lives of 20 Indian soldiers in the Galwan Valley. “The United States stands with India as you fight against the Communist China’s aggression and I commend your continued efforts to negotiate a peaceful resolution,” Scott said in the letter tweeted on Friday. “Unfortunately, we know Communist China never lives up to its commitments. The tyrants of Communist China continue to steal technology and refuse to open their markets to foreign goods as required by their agreement to be part of the World Trade Organisation,” he wrote. China, he alleged, continues to attack religious freedom by detaining more than one million Uyghurs in internment and reeducation camps and have not lived up to the agreement to give Hong Kong autonomy and freedom, he said. Scott said that China is militarising the South China Sea, even though it had promised former president Barack Obama not to do it, and now it continues to try to assert its military dominance in its quest for world dominance. “Communist China believes that in order for them to be strong, America, India and other freedom loving countries must be weaker. They are cracking down on freedom and autonomy in Hong Kong, and continue to threaten Taiwan and India,” he said. If it continues down this path, Communist China’s neighbours will have no choice but to treat it as a serious threat that uses military force against peaceful democratic powers, he wrote in the letter. “As you continue to stand against Communist China and General Secretary of the Communist Party Xi (Jinping), I want to offer help in any way I can to the Republic of India, the world’s largest democracy and our ally. The United States will always defend our allies and those fighting for freedom,” Scott added. The Indian and Chinese armies are locked in a bitter standoff in multiple locations in eastern Ladakh for the last seven weeks. The tension escalated manifold after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent clash in Galwan Valley on June 15. The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/america-supports-india-against-chinese-aggression-us-senator/story-JHjzoCfJ31HEGKZpRoVFMM.html

The UN health agency did not however specify who had notified it.WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference on April 20 the first report had come from China, without specifying whether the report had been sent by Chinese authorities or another source.But a new chronology, published this week by the Geneva-based institution, offers a more detailed version of events.It indicates that it was the WHO office in China that on December 31 notified its regional point of contact of a case of “viral pneumonia” after having found a declaration for the media on a Wuhan health commission website on the issue.The same day, WHO’s epidemic information service picked up another news report transmitted by the international epidemiological surveillance network ProMed -- based in the United States -- about the same group of cases of pneumonia from unknown causes in Wuhan.After which, WHO asked the Chinese authorities on two occasions, on January 1 and January 2, for information about these cases, which they provided on January 3.WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told a press conference on Friday that countries have 24-48 hours to officially verify an event and provide the agency with additional information about the nature or cause of an event.Ryan added that the Chinese authorities immediately contacted WHO’s as soon as the agency asked to verify the report.US President Donald Trump has announced that his country, the main financial contributor to WHO, will cut its bridges with the institution, which he accuses of being too close to China and of having poorly managed the pandemic.The WHO denies any complacency toward China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-first-alerted-to-coronavirus-by-its-office-not-china/story-9bgDMmKpLKjpkRNiajuAVN.html

04-07-2020||World||Global coronavirus cases rise to more than 11 million||Global coronavirus cases exceeded 11 million on Friday, according to a Reuters tally, marking another milestone in the spread of the disease that has killed more than half a million people in seven months.The number of cases is more than double the figure for severe influenza illnesses recorded annually, according to the World Health Organization.Many hard-hit countries are easing lockdowns put in place to slow the spread of the coronavirus while making extensive alterations to work and social life that could last for a year or more until a vaccine is available.Some countries are experiencing a resurgence in infections, leading authorities to partially reinstate lockdowns, in what experts say could be a recurring pattern into 2021.The United States reported more than 55,400 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, a new daily global record as infections rose in a majority of states. Several U.S. governors halted plans to reopen their state economies in the face of a surge in cases. Almost a quarter of the known global deaths have occurred in the United States - nearly 129,000. A recent surge in cases has put President Donald Trump’s handling of the crisis under a microscope and led several governors to halt plans to reopen their states after strict lockdowns.Latin America, where Brazil has 1.5 million cases, makes up 23% of the global total of people infected. India has become the new epicenter in Asia, rising to 625,000 cases. Asia and the Middle East have around 12% and 9% respectively, according to the Reuters tally, which uses government reports.In some countries with limited testing capabilities, case numbers reflect a small proportion of total infections. Health experts caution that the official data likely does not tell the full story, with many believing that both cases and deaths have likely been underreported in some countries.Worldwide, there have been more than 520,000 fatalities linked to the disease so far, roughly the same as the number of influenza deaths reported annually.The first death linked to the new coronavirus was reported on Jan. 10 in Wuhan in China, before infections and fatalities surged in Europe, then the United States, and later Russia.The pandemic has now entered a new phase, with India and Brazil battling outbreaks of over 10,000 cases a day, putting a major strain on resources.Countries including China, New Zealand and Australia have experienced new outbreaks in the past month, despite largely quashing local transmission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-coronavirus-cases-rise-to-more-than-11-million/story-1hp3ZGHvZzL6YbVpr6iQaP.html
04-07-2020||World||French government ministers investigated over Covid-19 crisis||A special French court ordered an investigation Friday of three current or former government ministers over their handling of the coronavirus crisis.Covid-19 patients, doctors, prison personnel, police officers and others in France filed an unprecedented 90 complaints in the Court of Justice of the Republic over recent months, notably over shortages of masks and other equipment as the virus spread across Europe. The court usually only sees a few complaints a year.The court, which deals with cases against top officials,said in a statement Friday that it threw out 44 of the 90 complaints, and is still studying 37 of them.The nine it deemed worth investigating target former Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, who resigned hours before the court’s announcement, Health Minister Olivier Veran or the former health minister, Agnes Buzyn.They are accused of “failing to fight a disaster,” and could face up to two years in prison and fines, if tried and convicted.That was the only charge the court retained among multiple accusations in the 90 complaints, which included allegations of manslaughter and endangering lives. A conviction on those charges carries the potential for heavier prison terms.Ten of the cases were closed because they didn’t provide enough justification for an investigation, according to a judicial official. The court said another 34 cases, targeting different government ministers, were thrown out for technical problems.President Emmanuel Macron and his government have acknowledged mask shortages and other missteps in the virus crisis. France was also short of testing capacity and criticized for not imposing confinement measures earlier.Macron himself cannot be targeted by lawsuits while in office because sitting presidents have immunity from prosecution.On Friday, the French leader named as the new prime minister a longtime civil servant who coordinated France’s strategy to reopen and recover economically from a two-month nationwide lockdown.No mention was made of the investigation or legal troubles when Philippe resigned earlier in the day. Macron said he was reshuffling the government to focus on setting a “new path” for the remaining two years of his presidential term.The Court of Justice of the Republic is the only French court where government ministers can be tried for their actions while in office, and was created in the wake of a major health scandal in the 1990s.The new investigation is separate from dozens of lawsuits filed in other French courts against nursing homes or others accused of mismanaging the virus crisis.France has reported the fifth-highest number of coronavirus deaths worldwide, for a total of 29,893 in the pandemic. About half took place in nursing homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-government-ministers-investigated-over-covid-19-crisis/story-Z0nzthQ9uftTfJEkbHc3FP.html

04-07-2020||World||Canada suspends extradition treaty with Hong Kong over new security law||Canada has suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong, as part of a series of measures precipitated by the enactment of a national security law by China that threatens the autonomy of the city-territory.During a press conference in Gatineau, Quebec, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also announced that “effective immediately” Canada will prohibit the sale of sensitive military items to Hong Kong. Till date, ties between Canada and Hong Kong were treated separately from those with China, but that has changed with the passage of the controversial legislation by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China. Concerns in Ottawa have also heightened because nearly 300,000 Canadians live in Hong Kong.Trudeau said that Canada is “a firm believer” in the ‘one country, two systems’ framework that applied to Hong Kong after its handover to China by the British.Canada expressed its “serious concern” over the passage of the national security law that will sabotage Hong Kong’s democratic tradition. It also issued a new travel advisory for Hong Kong which said that Canadians going there “may be at increased risk of arbitrary detention on national security grounds and possible extradition to mainland China.”In a statement, Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, criticized the move by Beijing, as he said, “This legislation was enacted in a secretive process, without the participation of Hong Kong’s legislature, judiciary or people, and in violation of international obligations.This process demonstrated disregard for Hong Kong’s Basic Law and the high degree of autonomy promised for Hong Kong under the ‘one country, two systems’ framework. Hong Kong’s role as a global hub was built on that foundation. Without it, Canada is forced to reassess existing arrangements.”The suspension of the extradition pact and imports of military equipment are among the initial changes. Canada is also contemplating steps related to immigration for impacted Hong Kongers.Relations between Canada and China are already at their worst in decades, after Beijing arbitrarily arrested two Canadians, including a diplomat, days after the detention of senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver, where is facing trial that could lead to extradition to the United States in a case related to defrauding a bank to bypass sanctions against the Iranian regime. The two Canadians were recently charged with spying, and Ottawa has accused Beijing of using them for ‘hostage diplomacy.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-suspends-extradition-treaty-with-hong-kong-over-new-security-law/story-r6EfWMe9AH38F4BgmfRxbO.html
04-07-2020||World||`Huge bummer’: US will test Americans’ discipline||The US headed into the Fourth of July weekend with many parades and fireworks displays canceled, beaches and bars closed, and health authorities warning that this will be a crucial test of Americans’ self-control that could determine the trajectory of the surging coronavirus outbreak.With confirmed cases climbing in 40 states, governors and local officials have ordered the wearing of masks in public, and families were urged to celebrate their independence at home. Even then, they were told to keep their backyard cookouts small.“This year is a huge bummer, to say the least,” said Ashley Peters, who for 14 years has hosted 150 friends and relatives at a pool party at her home in Manteca, California, complete with a DJ, bounce house, water slide and shaved-ice stand. This time, the guest list is down to just a few people.Pulling the plug on the bash, she said, was a “no-brainer” because so many of those she knows are front-line workers, including her husband, a fire captain. “I woke up and told my husband I wish it was just July 5,” she said.Health experts agree this will be a pivotal moment in determining whether the nation slides into a deeper mess. The fear is that a weekend of crowded pool parties, picnics and parades will fuel the surge.“We’re not going to be arresting people for having gatherings, but we’re certainly going to discourage it,” said Dr. Jeff Duchin, public health director for Seattle and King County.Those who decide they must gather with a small group of family members need to be careful, he said: “Don’t share utensils, don’t share objects, don’t pass them back and forth, because you’re passing that virus around as well.”The warnings were sounded after a Memorial Day weekend that saw many people emerge from stay-at-home orders to go to the beach, restaurants and family gatherings. Since then, confirmed infections per day in the US have rocketed to an all-time high, more than doubling.The US set another record on Friday with 52,300 newly reported cases, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.The picture was bleak around much of the country. In Arizona, the number of people in the hospital with a suspected or confirmed case of Covid-19 eclipsed 3,000 for the first time. Alabama reported more than 1,700 new confirmed cases, its highest single-day count yet. New York state, which has largely tamed the virus, recorded 918 new cases, the most in at least three weeks.Despite it all, there will still be fireworks and community events scattered across the nation, with many taking social distancing into account. In Ohio, Upper Arlington’s July Fourth parade will take a much longer route through its neighborhoods so residents can watch without crowding the streets.“We’re calling it the front porch parade,” said organizer Sam Porter. “We can’t just not do something.”Fireworks will be launched from four spots across Albuquerque, New Mexico, so that people can ooh and aah from home instead of gathering in a single place.Willie Nelson’s annual Fourth of July Picnic will carry on at his Texas ranch outside Austin, but this year the concert portion will be virtual.President Donald Trump traveled to South Dakota on Friday for a fireworks show at Mount Rushmore before returning to the nation’s capital for military flyovers Saturday and a mile-long pyrotechnics display on the National Mall that his administration promises will be the biggest in recent memory. Up to 300,000 face masks will be given away but not required.The big party will go on over objections from Washington’s mayor.“Ask yourself, do you need to be there? Ask yourself, can you anticipate or know who all is going to be around you? If you go downtown, do you know if you’re going to be able to social distance?” Mayor Muriel Bowser said.Beaches that had been open for the traditional start of summer over Memorial Day weekend will be off-limits in many places this time, including South Florida, Southern California and the Texas Gulf Coast.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised Americans who do go to the beach to wear face coverings, though not in the water.With professional pyrotechnic displays canceled, authorities are bracing for wildfires and injuries caused by Americans shooting off fireworks at home. Sales of fireworks have been booming in what some sellers say may reflect a desire for a little excitement among people cooped up for so long.Jamie Parrott, a pediatric neurologist in Columbia, South Carolina, said he intends to stay home with his grandchildren, setting off fireworks and eating hamburgers, because that’s the safer course for older people like him.“We’ll muddle through,” he said.Delaware’s governor ordered bars in some beach towns to close, saying people were getting complacent about masks and social distancing. The Lake Erie resort village of Put-in-Bay in Ohio canceled its fireworks after a small number of coronavirus cases were linked to bars on the island. And the New Jersey resort town of Wildwood did the same.Still, many people are expected to pack the beaches, boardwalk restaurants and amusement parks up and down the Jersey shore.South Carolina’s Myrtle Beach is one of the nation’s worst hot spots for Covid-19, and officials in several other states blame their outbreaks on vacationers returning from the resort city. On Thursday, the city passed a mask requirement.“I hate the perception that people have right now, as any city would,” said Mayor Brenda Bethune.After hearing Michigan’s governor warn about the need to be smart amid an uptick of cases, Mary Halley of Jonesville said her family canceled plans for a weekend outing on Lake Michigan.“We had some disappointed kids, but we knew as a family we couldn’t do that,” she said. The problem, she said, is that too many people aren’t listening to the experts. “Even in my small, little town, there are lot of people who didn’t comply with the orders,” she said.Dr. Don Williamson, head of the Alabama Hospital Association, said he is “really, really worried about the Fourth of July.”“I think that will likely determine the trend for Alabama for the rest of the summer,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huge-bummer-us-will-test-americans-discipline/story-9v0ACxVnha0RK6YduVv47J.html
04-07-2020||World||Trump plans fiery Rushmore rally amid Covid-19 threat, protests||President Donald Trump planned a fiery Mount Rushmore speech Friday night including denunciations of protesters he says are trying to “tear down” the nation’s history. He’s adding the condemnation of those who pull down statues to a big fireworks show and his more traditional July Fourth praise of America’s past and values.Hours before the event, protesters blocked a road leading to the monument. Authorities worked to move the demonstrators, mostly Native Americans protesting that South Dakota’s Black Hills were taken from the Lakota people against treaty agreements.One group parked three vans across the road and took the tires from two of them to make it more difficult to remove them. Several demonstrators climbed on top of the vans chanting “Land back!” Police warned the protesters to disperse but didn’t take any immediate action against them.The sheriff’s office said attendees had been told to arrive early so should have been past the roadblock.The president has spoken forcefully against other protesters in Washington, D.C., and other cities who have tried to topple Confederate monuments and statues honoring those who have benefited from slavery, planned to target “the left wing mob and those practicing cancel culture,” said a person familiar with his remarks and describing them only on condition of anonymity.The president was to preside over a fireworks display at an event expected to draw thousands, even as coronavirus cases spike across the country.Trump was expecting a South Dakota show of support, with the state Republican Party selling T-shirts that feature Trump on the memorial alongside George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln. But concern about the coronavirus risk and wildfire danger from the fireworks, along with the Native American groups’ protests were also present.Republican Gov. Kristi Noem, a Trump ally, has said social distancing won’t be required during the event and masks will be optional. Event organizers were to provide masks to anyone who wanted them and plannedto screen attendees for symptoms of Covid-19.The Republican mayor of the largest city near the monument, Rapid City, said he would be watching for an increase in cases after the event, the Rapid City Journal reported.Enthusiastic attendees were unlikely to disqualify themselves “because they developed a cough the day of or the day before,” Mayor Steve Allender said.The small town of Keystone, which lies a couple of miles from the monument, was buzzing with people Friday hoping to catch a glimpse of the fireworks and the president. Many wore pro-Trump T-shirts and hats. Few wore masks.“This is going to rank up in the top Fourth of Julys that I talk about,” said Mike Stewhr, who brought his family from Nebraska.Mike Harris of Rapid City said he was a Republican but wore a mask and waved an anti-Trump flag. He also was sporting a handgun on each hip. He said he was worried the event would spark a Covid-19 outbreak.“I think it’s a bad example being set by our president and our governor,” Harris said.Robin Pladsen, director of the Keystone Chamber of Commerce, handed out face masks and hand sanitizer from a tent. She said the tourist influx would help businesses pay back loans they had taken out to survive the economic downtown but acknowledged the health risk for the town.Leaders of several Native American tribes in the region also raised concerns that the event could lead to virus outbreaks among their members, who they say are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 because of an underfunded health care system and chronic health conditions.“The president is putting our tribal members at risk to stage a photo op at one of our most sacred sites,” said Harold Frazier, chairman of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.Some Native American groups used Trump’s visit to protest the Mount Rushmore memorial itself, pointing out that the Black Hills were taken from the Lakota people.More than 100 protesters, many Lakota, lined the road leading from Keystone to the monument holding signs and playing Lakota music in 95-degree heat. Some held their fists in the air as cars loaded with event attendees passed by. Others held signs that read “Protect SoDak’s First People,” “You Are On Stolen Land” and “Dismantle White Supremacy.”“The president needs to open his eyes. We’re people, too, and it was our land first,” said Hehakaho Waste, a spiritual elder with the Oglala Sioux tribe.Security for the event itself was tight. The governor’s spokesperson, Maggie Seidel, would not say whether the South Dakota National Guard was being deployed, but said organizers are making sure it is a safe event.Several people who once oversaw fire danger at the national memorial have said setting off fireworks over the forest was a bad idea that could lead to a large wildfire. Fireworks were called off after 2009 because a mountain pine beetle infestation increased the fire risks.Noem pushed to get the fireworks resumed soon after she was elected, and enlisted Trump’s help. The president brushed aside fire concerns earlier this year, saying, “What can burn? It’s stone.”Trump made no mention of the fire danger in fresh comments Thursday.“They used to do it many years ago, and for some reason they were unable or unallowed to do it,” he said. “They just weren’t allowed to do it, and I opened it up and we’re going to have a tremendous July 3 and then we’re coming back here, celebrating the Fourth of July in Washington, D.C.”Trump has presided over a several large-crowd events — in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and at an Arizona megachurch — even as health officials warn against large gatherings and recommend face masks and social distancing. He plans a July Fourth celebration on the National Mall in Washington despite health concerns from D.C.’s mayor. Trump and first lady Melania Trump plan to host events from the White House South Lawn and from the Ellipse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-plans-fiery-rushmore-rally-amid-covid-19-threat-protests/story-7sdFUiQ0laGFE0J30KtTrO.html
04-07-2020||World||July 4th celebration to feature air show over Washington DC, 4 other cities||President Donald Trump’s July Fourth celebration will feature an extensive US military air show over Washington, DC, but four other cities will get mini-versions of the air power display on Saturday,The “Salute to the Great Cities of the American Revolution” will feature military flyovers in Boston, New York City, Philadelphia and Baltimore. While the flights will likely be visible from a number of locations in the cities, they are taking place as Americans deal with surging cases of Covid-19 and mixed messages on the need for masks and social distancing.Trump has been criticized for pushing to go ahead with large rallies and other public gatherings, like the upcoming holiday event, despite the increased risks of infection.The flyovers will start in Boston at about 4 p.m., with Air Force and Marine Corps jets flying over in five waves. The show will be kicked off by the Air Force Thunderbirds, followed by B-1, B-2 and B-52 bombers, F-15 and F-22 fighter jets and US Marine Corps F-35 fighters.In Boston, they’ll go over the center of the city, approaching from the northeast and flying over the USS. Constitution and Fenway Park.They will then fly on to New York City, heading down the Hudson River at about 5 p.m., passing just east of the Statue of Liberty. The aircraft will get to Philadelphia at about 5:15 p.m., flying over Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell, then they’ll head to Baltimore, where they will reach Fort McHenry around 5:30 p.m., and then continue south toward Washington, DC. The jets will be flying at about 1,000 feet.They will then join the larger air show in the nation’s capital, which will begin at about 6:30 p.m. with a demonstration by the US Army Golden Knights Parachute Team and a 21-gun salute by the military’s 3rd Infantry Regiment, known as The Old Guard.The air show will follow at 7 p.m., and will begin with a flyover by Air Force One. The aerial show will include a wide range of military fighter jets, bombers, helicopters, cargo and tanker aircraft, And it will finish with the military’s elite demonstration teams, the US Navy Blue Angels and Air Force Thunderbirds.The aircraft will approach the city from Arlington National Cemetery in northern Virginia and fly directly over the Ellipse.The Army, Navy, Marines Corps and Air Force bands will play.According to the Pentagon, the shows will not cost taxpayers much because the aircraft crews are using the flyovers to meet routing training and proficiency requirements that would normally be conducted at other locations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/july-4th-celebration-to-feature-air-show-over-washington-dc-4-other-cities/story-e5VAFygy3zlzu6TUuYPSJP.html
04-07-2020||World||Canada suspends extradition with Hong Kong over China’s security law||Canada on Friday suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong to protest the tough new national security law China has enacted in the financial hub.Canada is also halting exports of sensitive military gear to Hong Kong and updating its travel advisory for the city so Canadians will know how the law might affect them, the foreign ministry said.“Canada is a firm believer in the ‘one country, two systems’ framework,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, referring to the semi-autonomous model adopted after Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997.“We’re extremely concerned about the situation in Hong Kong,” he told a press briefing.Trudeau said the “one country, two systems” principle was important not just for the city’s 7.5 million people, but for the 300,000 Canadians who live there. “That is why we are going to continue to look at steps we can take to ensure the safety of its citizens,” he said, mentioning possible new “immigration” measures, without any specifics.The Chinese legislation enacted this week outlaws acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and colluding with foreign forces.Beijing has faced a groundswell of criticism, primarily from Western nations, over the law, which radically increases China’s control over Hong Kong.China’s leaders say the suite of powers will restore stability after a year of sometimes violent protests and will not stifle freedoms. But police have already begun arresting people for possessing protest flags and banners, and the government in Hong Kong has made clear certain political views, especially calls for independence, are now outlawed.The law was enacted in a secretive process, without the participation of Hong Kong’s legislature, judiciary or people, and in violation of international obligations, said Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne.“This process demonstrated disregard for Hong Kong’s Basic Law and the high degree of autonomy promised for Hong Kong under the ‘one country, two systems’ framework,” the minister said.“Hong Kong’s role as a global hub was built on that foundation. Without it, Canada is forced to reassess existing arrangements.”Relations between Canada and China have been tense because of extradition proceedings under way against an executive of the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, who is wanted in the US on suspicion of violating sanctions against Iran.Trudeau recently rejected calls for him to intervene and trade that executive, Meng Wanzhou, for two Canadians held in China on espionage charges.Meng was arrested in Canada in December 2018 at the request of US authorities. The two Canadians -- former diplomat Michael Kovrig, and Michael Spavor, a consultant and businessman -- were arrested in China just days later.Their detention is considered in the West as retaliation for Meng’s arrest -- a claim Beijing has repeatedly denied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-suspends-extradition-with-hong-kong-over-china-s-security-law/story-eBNYqxEYxBKTAO5b4wQCMN.html

There are 83,295 active cases in the state.Of the 295 deaths added on Saturday, 124 occurred in the last 48 hours – 68 of them in Mumbai. Of remaining deaths, 163 deaths in Thane district took place over the last three months but were recorded as Covid-19 fatalities only on Saturday.Mumbai recorded 1,163 new cases, taking the tally in the financial hub to 83,237.Amit Deshmukh, Maharashtra’s medical education minister, said that the state health infrastructure was ready to tackle the rising of cases. “With antigen, antibody tests taken to every district and plasma banks being set up across the state, the virus spread is expected to be contained in next one month. We have augmented the health infrastructure across the state and are ready to take on the spread. The rise in the cases is because of the opening up of the activities and compromised social distancing norms. There is rise in numbers of few districts besides Mumbai Metropolitan Region, but we are taking care to reduce the spread. We have set up task force in every district and expert advice by epidemiologists and virologists is being made available to the rural patients with co-morbidities,” he said.He said that July and August are crucial months and the government expects a decline in the cases to begin in a month. “We have already witnessed decline in the cases in Mumbai. Similar will be the trend in other parts and there will be flattening in the next two months,” he said.Dr Om Shrivastava, infectious diseases specialist and member of the 11-member task force appointed by the state government for the clinical management of critically ill patients, said: “The rise in the number of cases is the result of the aggressive testing by the authorities. Same is the reason for the positivity rate… The virus spread is expected to stabilise now in the next few weeks and we should not worry about the rising cases since our infrastructure is ready to take up the load.”Public health consultant Dr Sanjay Pattiwar said that the future pattern of the curve was very difficult to predict. “We should not be worried about the rising numbers if we are ready with health infrastructure. State authorities should go for aggressive testing and tracing, besides sensitising people about following social curbs and personal-community hygiene. We should learn to live with the virus at least for the next few months; it’s the only way out,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-tally-crosses-200k-after-biggest-spike/story-Jlc8ugfM3lkG3ZjRdBt8rL.html

His tweet came after the Indian Army termed as “malicious and unsubstantiated” criticism in some quarters about a medical facility in a military hospital in Leh where Prime Minister Modi interacted with soldiers injured in the Galwan Valley clashes with Chinese troops. Pictures worth a million words. pic.twitter.com/ifC4La8Izj In a statement, the Army said “it is unfortunate that aspersions are being cast on how our brave Armed Forces are treated. The armed forces give the best possible treatment to their personnel.” Following release of photographs of Modi’s interaction with the injured soldiers, there were comments on Twitter that the facility did not look like a hospital as there were no medicine cabinets, I V (intravenous) stand, and other medical equipment. Earlier, when Congress leader Kapil Sibal was asked about Modi’s visit to the hospital, he said, “What is happening in the last six years is marketing. The truth is different and something else is being shown.” “I laud them as this is their strong point -- of showing dreams and hiding the truth. That is the truth and this is their politics,” Sibal said, referring to the ruling BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chidambaram-replies-to-modi-s-leh-visit-with-manmohan-singh-s-photos-says-pictures-worth-a-million-words/story-PjbYjwuYvH8yUykfXqlVML.html

The tension escalated manifold after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent clash in Galwan Valley on June 15. The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details. India has been insisting on restoration of status quo ante in all areas of eastern Ladakh to restore peace and tranquillity in the region.India and China have held several rounds of diplomatic and military talks in the last few weeks to ease tension in the region. However, there was no visible sign of end to the standoff though the two sides agreed to initiate disengagement of the forces from the region.India on Thursday said it expected China to ensure expeditious restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas in sync with provisions of relevant bilateral pacts. Following the Galwan Valley clashes, the Army has sent thousands of additional troops to forward locations along the border besides moving in heavy weapons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-ramping-up-deployment-in-key-bases-along-border-with-china/story-lw8WgBEU1pc7dU6zByb7TP.html
04-07-2020||India||Fighting for existence, BJP taunts Congress over protests against fuel price rise in Uttarakhand||The Opposition Congress in Uttarakhand has decided to intensify its protests against fuel price hike but the ruling BJP dismissed the protests saying the grand old party was fighting for its existence.In the last one week, Congress has held several protests led by its senior leaders including former chief minister Harish Rawat and present party president Pritam Singh. On Saturday too, it held a cycle rally led by Singh in Raipur area of Dehradun in protest of rising fuel prices across the country. Countering the protests, the BJP state president Bansidhar Bhagat termed them ‘mere drama’ during the Covid-19 pandemic and Congress’s fight for existence. Singh retaliated by saying, “If they think raising voice on relevant issues pertaining to common man is drama, then we will continue it. Apart from these protests we will now hold symbolic protests in fuel stations every Monday demanding the govt to curb fuel prices,”Singh said the fuel price hike has come as a double whammy during the pandemic.“The prices of petrol, diesel and cooking fuel have increased by the Centre at a time when the price of crude oil at the international market is at its lowest. This cruel move by the government has broken the back of the common man as they are struggling with pandemic as well as rising inflation due to increased fuel prices,” he said.Bhagat said the Congress was just trying to save itself from oblivion.“Congress is fighting to save its existence in the state with these protests. It is not raising the voice for the common man but rehearsing for playing the Opposition for next 20 years,” he taunted.He also took a swipe at the Congress for alleged infighting in the party. “It is also fighting for the existence of its senior leaders. Who is bigger in the party? Singh, Harish Rawat or Leader of Opposition Indira Hridayesh?” he asked.Congress state president Singh hit back saying, “He should rather control the internal politics in his own party.”“There is no coordination among the ministers of his own govt. Also, the chief minister is not ready to listen to the issues of his own party MLAs. He should restrain from throwing stones at others when his own house is made of glass,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fighting-for-existence-bjp-taunts-congress-over-protests-against-fuel-price-rise-in-uttarakhand/story-dmbtNk3TJqEblYrOHhaTKM.html

The chief minister has, however, asked residents not to be complacent despite the number of active Covid 19 cases coming down in the state. “Our recovery rate has crossed 80% and with active cases reducing, there should be no laxity from the administration. Special attention has to be paid to reduce the death rate. District magistrates and chief medical officers should keep a constant watch on serious cases themselves. In such cases, an immediate response should be ensured,” CM Trivendra Singh Rawat said during a meeting to review disease containment work done so far.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesOn Saturday, 45 fresh Covid-19 cases were reported from Almora (2), Bageshwar (6), Dehradun (8), Haridwar (1), Nainital (4), Pauri Garhwal (1), Tehri Garhwal (1), Udham Singh Nagar (17) and Uttarkashi (5).Six fresh cases were contacts of earlier detected Covid-19 positive patients and one was a healthcare worker with travel history to Delhi.The others found positive over the last 24 hours had returned to the state from places like Delhi-NCR, West Bengal, Mumbai, Rajasthan, Bengaluru, Chandigarh and Uttar Pradesh.21 patients were discharged from hospitals in the state on Saturday including 19 from Pauri Garhwal, and one each from Almora and Tehri Garhwal.The rate of doubling of cases based on the last seven days’ numbers, stands at 47.18 days and the recovery rate is at 80.89%.Villagers in Uttarakhand fell more than 500 trees during lockdown periodDehradun with 742 cases is the worst affected city in the hill state followed by Nainital, which has 530 cases and Tehri Garhwal with 421 cases.

04-07-2020||India||ICMR says following globally accepted norms to fast-track vaccine; wants to ‘cut red tape’||As experts cautioned against rushing the process for developing a Covid-19 vaccine after the ICMR stated it plans to launch one by August 15, the apex health research body on Saturday stressed that it is acting in accordance with the globally accepted norms to fast-track vaccine development for diseases of pandemic potential. The ICMR said that the letter by Director General of ICMR Dr Balram Bhargava to principal investigators of the clinical trial sites was meant to cut unnecessary red tape, without bypassing any necessary process, and speed up recruitment of participants. Bhargava had on July 2 written to principal investigators of select medical institutions and hospitals to fast-track human clinical trial approvals for the vaccine candidate ‘Covaxin’ being developed in collaboration with Bharat Biotech.  All other vaccine candidates across the globe have been similarly fast-tracked, it said, adding that the Drugs Controller General of India has accorded permission to conduct phase 1 and 2 (human) clinical trial of ‘Covaxin’ based on in-depth scrutiny of the available data from pre-clinical studies. Just as red tape was not allowed to become a hindrance in the fast track approval of new indigenous testing kits or for introducing in the Indian market potential Covid-19 related drugs, the indigenous vaccine development process has also been sought to be insulated from slow file movement, it said. “The aim is to complete these phases at the earliest, so that population-based trials for efficacy could be initiated without delay,” ICMR said in a statement. After intense characterization and review of all data from BBIL, ICMR said it is supporting the clinical development as the vaccine candidate appears to be promising. In the larger public health interest, it is important for ICMR to expedite the clinical trials with a promising indigenous vaccine, the statement stated. Faced with the unprecedented nature of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the consequent dislocation of the normal life, all other vaccine candidates across the globe have been similarly fast-tracked, it said. “ICMR’s process is exactly in accordance with the globally accepted norms to fast-track the vaccine development for diseases of pandemic potential wherein human and animal trials can continue in parallel,” it said. Underlining ICMR was among the world’s most reputed organisations in the field of medical research and its track record of facilitating India’s globally respected and acknowledged vaccine and drug industry speaks for itself, the research body said trials will be done following the best practices and rigour. They will be reviewed, as required, by a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). “While issues raised in public domain from time-to-time by commentators are welcome, as they form an important part of feedback loop, the best of India’s medical professionals and research scientists should not be second guessed for their professionalism or adherence to the highest scientific rigour,” the statement stated. “ICMR is committed to treat the safety and interest of people of India as a topmost priority,” it said. The Indian Council of Medical Research(ICMR) has identified 12 clinical trial sites, including medical institutions and hospitals, and has asked their principal investigators to ensure that the subject enrolment is initiated no later than July 7. Noting that this was the first indigenous vaccine being developed by India, Bhargava in his letter to principal investigators of the 12 sites said that it is one of the “top priority projects which is being monitored at the top-most level of the government”. “It is envisaged to launch the vaccine for public health use latest by August 15 after completion of all clinical trials.... “You have been chosen as a clinical trial site of the BBV152 Covid vaccine. In view of the public health emergency due to Covid-19 pandemic and urgency to launch the vaccine, you are strictly advised to fast track all approvals related to initiation of the clinical trial and ensure that the subject enrolment is initiated no later than July 7,” the letter stated. The letter further warned that any non-compliance will be viewed very seriously. “Kindly note non-compliance will be viewed very seriously. Therefore, you are advised to treat this project on highest priority and meet the given timelines without any lapse,” the letter stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-says-following-globally-accepted-norms-to-fast-track-vaccine-wants-to-cut-red-tape/story-tLApaYmbqIjGvs9jk0sKCO.html

The American-origin attack chopper along with its heavy-lift counterpart Chinook have played an important role in the area after the Chinese Army started building up along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh in May this year.The entire base is seeing a flurry of activity and is playing a crucial role in enhancing the combat preparedness of the country along the China border.“This base plays a very important role in undertaking operations in this area. It is cleared for all contingencies and all combat and support operations to be undertaken in this area,” said a Flight Lieutenant when asked about the importance of the forward airfield.A Wing Commander, who is playing a crucial role in ensuring preparedness at the airbase, said, “The Indian Air Force is fully prepared for operations and is ready to meet all challenges. Air power is a very powerful aspect of war-fighting and more relevant today,” he said.Asked how the Air Force was readying itself in view of tensions following Galwan Valley clash, he said, “Air Power will play an important role in this area in both combat and support roles. We have all the resources in terms of men and equipment to meet all the challenges.”“The Indian Air Force is ready in all aspects to undertake all operational tasks and providing the requisite support for all military operations,” the Wing Commander added.The Chinook heavy-lift helicopters along with the Russian fleet of the Mi-17 V5 helicopters deployed at the base are carrying out regular sorties to take Army and ITBP troops to forward locations.To prepare for a long haul, Chinook helicopters could be loaded with important equipment for being delivered to forward bases as China has also dug in heels all along the LAC in this area.The air activities in the Ladakh area and other places along the China border had gone up extensively soon after the Chinese started building up and went up further after the Galwan valley clash on June 15 in which 20 Indian Army personnel lost their lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-air-force-geared-up-for-combat-role-in-china-border-area/story-bo1QFkr5MLip0u7Amf0GBI.html
04-07-2020||India||Kerala CM writes to PM Modi seeking trial in Italy of marines who killed 2 fishermen||Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday urging that the government should make “earnest efforts to build international pressure to ensure a fair trial in Italy” for the two Italian marines who shot and killed two Indian fishermen off the Kerala coast in 2012.“It is quite shocking that such a grave crime committed against our citizens is not being brought to justice in our country. The matter definitely deserved a more sensitive and cautious handling from the beginning and during the proceedings in the ITLOS (International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea), as it involved the loss of life of two innocent Indians,” Vijayan wrote. On Thursday, the Permanent Court of Arbitration Tribunal in The Hague upheld the conduct of the Indian authorities in the Enrica Lexie case in which the marines were accused of killing two Indian fishermen.The tribunal stated that India was entitled to get compensation in the case but ruled that the marines cannot be prosecuted due to their official immunity.Vijayan also sought Modi’s intervention in getting just compensation to the families of the fishermen, who had lost their lives while they had put out to sea to earn their livelihood.As two valuable lives have been lost without any provocation from the victims we need to bargain for an exemplary amount, the CM said.“We should also keep our options of approaching ITLOS within the stipulated time of one year if getting compensation is not possible through negotiations,” Vijayan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-writes-to-pm-modi-seeking-trial-in-italy-of-marines-who-killed-2-fishermen/story-F2z8IN4U8nuKr5V50dho1O.html

Officials also said the autopsy report corroborated initial findings that the criminal had used the police weapons to kill them. Doctors took out AK-47 cartridges from the body of constable Jitendra Kumar, according to the post-mortem report. The AK 47 rifle was one of the five weapons looted from the policemen during the failed raid on Dubey’s house. The others were an INSAS rifle, a Glock pistol and two 9 mm pistols. The autopsy showed the bullets went through the bodies of four constables, indicating that they were shot from extremely close range, forensic experts said. In addition, the doctors retrieved pieces of .315 and .312 bore bullets, which were fired from rifles and single or double barrel guns, the experts added.The maximum seven bullets hit sub-inspector Anoop Kumar Singh, the experts said. Deputy SP Devendra Mishra was shot in the head, chest and legs from close range as doctors found carbon deposits around the wounds, said officials who were part of the investigation. As a result, his head was blown off and the ‘neck was reduced to half’, they said, adding there were deep gashes on his leg and below the waist. Bullets hit constable Jitendra Kumar, who was shot five times, in the hands, chest and waist region. Two bullets went through his body.Mahesh Yadav, Shivrajpur station officer, was shot in the face, back and chest five times, according to the post-mortem findings. Four bullets were found lodged in the body of sub-inspector Nebulal.The autopsy also showed that constable Babloo Kumar was shot in the temple and the chest while the body of Rahul Kumar had four gunshot wounds, they said. Constable Sultan Singh was shot five times. Brajesh Shrivastava, Superintendent of police (Rural), said the rounds and their pieces recovered during the autopsy were being sent for forensic analysis.The forensic experts on Friday had collected a number of empty bullet casings of different bores from the ground and terraces of houses to get an understanding of weapons the criminals used to fire at the cops.“They used rifles, guns and country-made-weapons and fired from pistols and big weapons such as AK-47,” said an official, adding a live AK-47 round was found on the spot with 9mm rounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-cops-out-on-raid-were-killed-by-their-own-weapons-says-autopsy-report/story-LWsMgypFEQ4o96NrcE9zmN.html
04-07-2020||India||A positive Covid statistic makes Kejriwal shoot a congratulatory tweet||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday congratulated corona warriors noting the rise in recoveries from Covid 19 infections had taken the recovery rate in the capital past the 70% mark and said that the city needed to work more to comprehensively beat the deadly coronavirus contagion.“The effort made by Delhi’s two crore population is bearing fruit. Congratulations to all corona warriors, since Delhi’s recovery rate has crossed the 70% mark. We have to continue working to defeat coronavirus,” Kejriwal tweeted, while tagging a similar congratulatory tweet form his deputy Manish Sisodia.Sisodia, in his tweet, cited data to reflect on the positive turn in capital’s Covid situation after fears, driven by a rapid rise in positive cases in early June, of the situation possibly going out of hand by the end of July. “Delhi’s corona recovery rate has crossed 70% for the first time to arrive at 70.22%). This means 70% of all Covid 19 patients have already been cured. 68,256 people out of the total 97,200 patients have been cured,” Sisodia’s tweet said.Delhi records 2,505 new Covid cases, total tally a step away from 1 lakh-markHe also pointed out that the positive rate in the capital had decreased dramatically to 10.58%.“ Positivity rate has (meaning the number of people turning positive out of total people tested) reduced to 10.58% after reaching 36.94% at one time,” the latter part of his tweet said.The trend of reduction in the number of daily cases registered in Delhi continued on Saturday with 2,505 new Covid-19 cases. The total number of coronavirus cases in the national capital has reached 97,200 including 3,004 deaths caused by the disease.The city, however, has recorded 68,256 recoveries from the disease, which translates to over 70% recovery rate, nearly 10% more than the national recovery rate of 60.81%.Sisodia and Kejriwal were referring not only to the healthy recovery rate but also to the drop in percentage of people who are found positive among those tested on a daily basis despite a remarkable rise in the number of tests being conducted daily.A total of 23,673 tests were conducted in the capital in the last 24 hours including 13,748 rapid antigen tests and 9,925 RT-PCR tests. The total number of tests conducted since the outbreak earlier this year stand at 62,0368. Experts have suggested that the continuance of this trend of drop in the average number of fresh cases reported daily in Delhi, observed over the past one week, could lead to the city going past the disease peak in early August.It was not so long ago on June 23, when the national capital reported the highest single-day spike of 3,947 cases and since then, the city registered over 3,000 fresh cases daily till June 26, when the daily infections reported over a course of 24 hours, stood at 3,460.From June 27 to July 3, the average cases per day came down to 2,494, which was significantly lower than 3,446 average daily cases recorded the week before.Covid-19: All districts to start surveillance and tele-medicine hubsExperts, however, have warned of a fresh surge in cases if containment measures such as social distancing and other restrictions imposed by authorities are not adhered to.AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria has attributed the surge in cases that began in early June and sustained till most of the month to complacency after lifting of lockdown measures.“A lapse on someone’s part somewhere...could lead to a spike,” Dr Guleria was quoted as saying by PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-positive-covid-statistic-makes-kejriwal-shoot-a-congratulatory-tweet/story-5DfQcS1dnDrZP6t9ekKxKP.html
04-07-2020||India||India’s first Covid-19 vaccine races to meet mid-August target||India has set an ambitious timeline for its first potential coronavirus vaccine -- from human trials to general use in six weeks.Bharat Biotech International Ltd., an unlisted Indian vaccine maker, received regulatory approval to start human clinical trials for its experimental shot earlier this week and it already has India’s apex medical research body expediting the process.The under-development vaccine is “envisaged” to be rolled out “for public health use by Aug. 15 after completion of all clinical trials,” Indian Council of Medical Research, or ICMR, said in a July 2 letter to clinical trial sites, which was seen by Bloomberg News. It “is one of the top priority projects which is being monitored at the topmost level of the government.”There’s been no evidence yet that Bharat Biotech’s vaccine is safe for use on humans, not to mention effective. The envisioned timeline is markedly shorter than other front-runner vaccine efforts from American and Chinese drugmakers, most of which started human clinical trials months ago and are now entering the last of three stages of testing.The bid underscores India’s urgent need for a way to halt the coronavirus, which has sickened more than 640,000 people and killed over 18,600 in the Asian nation -- the world’s fourth-largest outbreak. In its letter, ICMR urged the trial sites to enroll volunteers by July 7.The speediness has alarmed some in the medical fraternity. “Such an accelerated development pathway has not been done EVER for any kind of vaccine, even the ones being tried out in other countries,” Anant Bhan, a medical researcher at India’s Manipal University, said in a Twitter post. “Even with accelerated timelines, this seems rushed and hence, with potential risks.”After abandoning a costly lockdown that caused tremendous economic suffering without slowing the virus’s spread, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is anxious to project control over the outbreak.Political PressureThe Aug. 15 deadline for Bharat Biotech’s vaccine may reflect that political pressure: that’s the day India celebrates independence from the British, marked by a nationwide address by Modi.The letter to investigators of clinical trial sites was meant to cut unnecessary red tape, without bypassing any necessary process, and to speed up recruitment of participants, the ICMR said in a statement on Saturday.“ICMR’s process is exactly in accordance with the globally accepted norms to fast-track the vaccine development for diseases of pandemic potential wherein human and animal trials can continue in parallel,” according to the statement. “Our trials will be done following the best practices and rigour, and will be reviewed, as required.”Bharat Biotech plans to enroll 375 people in the first phase of clinical trials and 750 people in the second phase, an ICMR spokesperson said. Whether the vaccine will be approved for general use depends on the outcomes of those trials, he said. A spokeswoman for Bharat Biotech declined to comment on the Aug. 15 timeline in ICMR’s letter.“They can’t do that,” said Jayaprakash Muliyil, chairman of the Scientific Advisory Committee in National Institute of Epidemiology, referring to the targeted timeline of the vaccine launch. Developing a vaccine is a complicated procedure that involves proving its effectiveness and safety, he said.While Bharat Biotech’s timeline is ambitious compared to other efforts, India’s mature medical manufacturing sector and its large population, from which human trial volunteers can be easily found, are factors that could help accelerate the usual vaccine development process.The trial will start “most probably” by Monday, said C. Prabhakar Reddy, a professor in Hyderabad’s Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences -- one of the trial sites that received ICMR’s letter. “We are all working day and night to meet the deadline but still it will be neck to neck race,” he said, adding that he doesn’t anticipate any shortage of volunteers “in the current scenario.”A vaccine ready for public use will allow the safe reopening of schools, offices and factories to revive India’s economy, which is hurtling toward its first contraction in more than four decades. It will also tie in with self-reliance -- a motto Modi has repeated often in recent weeks.Developing nations are eager to pare their dependence on other nations and foreign drugmakers in securing vaccines. Called Covaxin, the “inactivated vaccine” candidate has demonstrated safety and immune response in preclinical studies, Bharat Biotech said in a June 29 statement that cited the firm’s “track record in developing vero cell culture platform technologies.”It has developed vaccines against polio, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and Zika, according to the statement.Bharat Biotech “is working expeditiously to meet the target, however, final outcome will depend on the cooperation of all the clinical trial sites involved in the project,” the ICMR letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-first-covid-19-vaccine-races-to-meet-mid-august-target/story-jRVsx7Y08IKvTnUvZ1rspL.html

The decision was taken to reduce the burden on the state exchequer. “Non-Sikkimese people returning to the state would have to pay Rs 3,500 for RT-PCR test and Rs 2000 for Truenat testing,” said a notice issued by Keshree Rai, principal director of health services of Sikkim on Friday.Non-Sikkimese, are those who do not have Sikkim Certificates of Identity and Sikkim Subject Certificates. Sikkim was a separate kingdom till 1975 and some of its old rules are still preserved under article 371 (F) of the Constitution.“Many non-Sikkimese, particularly those working in pharmaceutical companies and universities and hydro power companies, have already started returning to Sikkim,” Pempa Tshering Bhutia, director general cum secretary of state health and family welfare department said.The decision was taken in a meeting held by the chief minister PS Tamang on June 30 at Gangtok. All Covid-19 tests in Sikkim are done at the state-run STNM Hospital. Till Saturday 11,242 swab samples were tested.“As we were mandatorily carrying out Covid-19 tests free for all the returnees, it has put a burden on the state exchequer. From Saturday, the government has decided to charge from non-Sikkimese returnees,” said Bhutia.It is also mandatory in Sikkim for all returnees to stay in quarantine for 28 days – either in a state-run facility, a private paid facility or at home.Sikkim was the first state to close international borders with China, Nepal and Bhutan and two of the five border points with West Bengal. It had also banned the entry of tourists and migrant labourers. The state had zero Covid-19 cases till the time there was no movement of people. The state now has 103 cases.The first Covid-19 case was reported on May 23 when a 25-year-old man had returned from Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sikkim-to-charge-non-resident-returnees-for-covid-19-tests/story-bEZ7P9tUZhkVKMhYYiWjtJ.html

A worried Indian Medical Association (IMA), Kerala chapter has asked the state government to enforce a strict lockdown in containment areas and restrict movement of people to avert community spread.Saturday’s tally is the biggest single-day spike in the state since the outbreak in January. The total number of cases registered so far in the state has gone up to 5,204. 3,050 of these patients have recovered leaving 2,129 active cases. The state has recorded 25 deaths to the disease so far, said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s office.Kerala not in favour of withdrawing the case against Italian marines: CM VijayanThe fact that the source of infection is unknown in many cases has worried the state government. The CM said that since the disease was spreading both in urban and rural areas, stricter cubs will be needed to contain it. The government is toying with the idea of enforcing a targeted confinement and triple lockdown in some of the worst-hit areas to check the spread of the contagion. Triple lockdown, a measure considered stricter than curfew allowing only police personnel’s movement, did wonders in containing the spread of the disease in Kasaragod in north Kerala earlier.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe IMA has asked the government to enforce ruthless lockdown in containment areas as the number of secondary infections has risen alarmingly. “We have to increase tests immediately. In many cases epidemiological links are not known. The state will have to take more proactive measures to check the contagion,” said IMA state president Dr Abraham Varghese.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/241-covid-cases-trigger-highest-single-day-spike-in-kerala-govt-mulls-triple-lockdown/story-ppueZKU84gch6QnGOdMhuI.html

Therefore, arrangements will have to be limited to this number,” he said while chairing a meeting of the sub-committee constituted by the Supreme Court for Shri Amarnathji Yatra.He underlined that nine out of 10 Kashmir districts are in red zone and the entire medical system is already fully stretched in handling the Covid-19 pandemic.The Yatra this year is likely to be held from July 23 to August 3 from the shorter Baltal route.Subrahmanyam also informed that Baba Amarnath’s Aarti this year will be telecast live on Doordarshan.The chief secretary emphasised that adequate arrangement should be made to ensure unhindered telecast of the Aarti.Divisional Commissioner, Kashmir, Deputy Commissioners and SSPs of Ganderbal and Anantnag districts, Additional CEO, Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board (SASB) besides other senior functionaries of the departments involved in the Amarnath Yatra attended the meeting through video conference.Subrahmanyam said that in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the State Executive Committee constituted under the Disaster Management Act has issued SoPs which among other things prescribe 100% RT-PCR test for all persons travelling into Jammu and Kashmir. Anyone travelling to J&K will have to be sampled, tested and quarantined till they are reported to be negative.He also said that camping facilities earlier utilized for Yatris, especially at entry points are currently being utilized as quarantine centres.The chief secretary pointed out that the SoPs for testing of persons entering J&K shall apply to Yatris as well while social distancing norms would further strain the holding capacity of the quarantine centres. “Keeping in view these constraints, the Yatra this year, would have to be undertaken in a restricted manner,” he said.Subrahmanyam also reviewed strengthening of foot bridges and routine works such as installation of bailey bridges, milestones, upgradation of remaining 1.25 km of road from Baltal Base Camp to Domel by laying pre-cast concrete blocks and laying of tiles on remaining 95 meter stretch of alternate road from Neelgrath to Baltal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-chief-secy-says-sops-for-amarnath-yatra-to-be-strictly-enforced-amid-pandemic/story-N3GxyV78B7RapJkPlQynVI.html

04-07-2020||India||ICMR defends fast tracking Covaxin amid allegations of chasing glory with Independence Day launch||India’s premier medical research body has defended fast tracking of clinical trials of the Covid-19 vaccine candidate being developed by Indian company Bharat Biotech International Ltd and said it was in line with the current global trend to accelerate efforts to procure a medical response to contain the spread of deadly coronavirus disease, that has taken over half a million lives worldwide so far.ICMR’s clarification comes amid criticism by experts questioning the rationale behind the council’s decision to fast-track clinical trials of Covaxin to time its launch with the Independence Day on August 15.“In the larger public health interest, it is important for ICMR to expedite clinical trials with a promising indigenous vaccine. Faced with the unprecedented nature of the Covid 19 pandemic, all other vaccine candidates across the globe have been similarly fast-tracked,” ICMR said in an official press release on Saturday.The controversy erupted after ICMR wrote to the 12 institutes selected for conducting human trials for Covaxin, ordering them to secure necessary approvals from internal committees by July 7 and disclosed that it aimed to launch Covaxin on August 15, potentially making it the world’s first Covid-19 vaccine. The body had also warned institutes that non-compliance with its instructions will be viewed very seriously.ICMR sets August 15 deadline for world’s 1st Covid-19 vaccineThe letter was followed by criticism, with experts questioning the safety of such expedited trials that generally require months to complete and opposition political parties, including the Congress, attributing a political motive to ICMR’s bid to fast-track the vaccine candidate’s launch.On Saturday, senior Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan alleged that the launch of a coronavirus vaccine by August 15 was aimed only at enabling Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make a big announcement from the Red Fort.The ICMR has rejected the allegations of rushing through the process and said its programme was in accordance with globally accepted norms to fast track the vaccine development.“ICMR’s process is exactly in accordance with globally accepted norms to fast-track the vaccine development for diseases of pandemic potential wherein human and animal trials can continue in parallel,” the council stated in its official releaseBharat Biotech International Ltd and Zydus Cadila are two Indian companies that have already won approvals from the drugs controller general of India (DCGI) for conducting human clinical trials of their vaccine candidates developed indigenously to check the spread of Sars-Cov-2, the virus which causes the coronavirus disease.The Hdyerabad based company claims the results from pre-clinical studies, done in two months time, have been promising and the vaccine shows extensive safety and effective immune response. The human clinical trials of its vaccine will start sometime in July. The vaccine is being developed in collaboration with ICMR and National Institute of Virology (NIV).Bharat Biotech is among seven Indian firms working on Covid-19 vaccines. It was the first to get the regulatory nod to begin phase 1 and phase 2 human trials.More than a dozen Covid-19 vaccines from over 100 candidates globally are currently being tested in humans, and some have shown potential in early-stage trials. However, no vaccine has yet been approved for commercial use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-defends-fast-tracking-covaxin-amid-allegations-of-chasing-glory-with-republic-day-launch/story-TUpypfGyxKZMfjLqOKdwKO.html
04-07-2020||India||13 pvt labs in Telangana under govt scanner for reporting abnormal Covid-19+ cases||The Telangana government on Saturday served notices on 13 private laboratories in Hyderabad which have been reporting abnormal testing results for Covid-19 and lacking adequate infrastructure and trained manpower.State director of public health G Srinivasa Rao told reporters that the health department had noticed huge discrepancies in the testing conducted by some of these private laboratories. “For example, on Friday, one of these private laboratories reported 2,672 positive cases against 3,726 total samples tested, which means the positivity rate was 71.7% which is highly unlikely,” he said.He said usually, the positivity rate for a typical government or private laboratory was around 20- 25%. “We suspect the test results could have been contaminated and that’s why we held back those results, which will be studied in detail by an expert committee and released,” Rao said.At present, there are 23 private diagnostic laboratories that have received Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) permission to conduct Covid-19 diagnostics in Telangana. A majority of these private laboratories in Hyderabad had National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) certification that enabled ICMR to issue permission to take up Covid-19 tests.Last week, four expert teams from the Telangana medical and health department inspected these private labs and found large scale violation of norms in conducting Covid-19 tests. The teams examined various aspects like infrastructure, human resources, infection control measures and other facilities including general hygiene.The teams went through the registers and data uploaded by the labs into ICMR and Telangana state portal and found a lot of discrepancies in the data. Many of the labs were not taking safety measures such as staff not wearing personal protection equipment (PPE), safety cabinets not being available and lack of proper hygienic conditions. The staff conducting the tests for Covid-19 has not been trained properly in RT-PCR testing.The inspection report pointed out that there was possibility of contamination of samples leading to high positivity rate because safety measures and protocols are not followed meticulously.“We have given sufficient time to these laboratories to rectify the defects. Some of them rectified and some others are still doing it. If laboratories do not follow ICMR guidelines and do not correct discrepancies, then their recognition will be cancelled,” the health director said.He said four more government laboratories including Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Adilabad, Government General Hospitals in Nizamabad, Suryapet, and Area Hospital in Gadwal have now received permission to conduct Covid-19 testing through CBNAAT machines, which are also utilised for TB diagnosis.Stating that adequate measures were being taken to contain the spread of Covid-19, Rao said so far, more than 12,000 patients were being treated in home isolation and another 785 patients were in hospitals. “The cases were increasing alarmingly during the Unlock period,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/13-pvt-labs-in-telangana-under-govt-scanner-for-reporting-abnormal-covid-19-cases/story-6ZOiq6IPiRPhdeskz2lEXN.html

04-07-2020||India||HC raps Maharashtra for inaction against vendors who sold spurious soyabean seeds to farmers||The Bombay High Court has rapped the Maharashtra government for not taking action against vendors supplying spurious soyabean seeds to thousands of farmers that led to crop failure.In an order of June 26 uploaded in the high court’s website on Friday, it said the Aurangabad bench of the court took suo motu cognizance of news reports about complaints of 2,000 farmers who had purchased soyabean seeds for sowing during the ongoing Kharif season but the seeds did not sprout and led to the farmers suffering losses. The court observed that though the farmers in Marathwada and Vidarbha region are poor and such a fraud by the soyabean seed vendors was detrimental to their survival, the government did not show any haste in taking action against such vendors. A division bench of justice T V Nalawade and justice D Kulkarni on June 26, heard the petition initiated after news reports that farmers from districts like Nanded, Latur, Parbhani, Hingoli and Ahmednagar had complained to the authorities that soybean seeds they purchased recently for sowing did not germinate. The court directed that a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) be registered suo motu to ensure that action is taken against the shop owners and the companies, if any, who had pushed such bogus seeds in the market. The court appointed advocate P P More as Amicus Curiae to assist the court.Referring to the stand taken in this regard by the minister for agriculture of the state on June 25 when he said that there are no provisions under the Seeds Act, 1966 for taking action against the vendors concerned and the state will try to see that farmers are given other seeds the court said, “It can be said that the Government, the concerned department has no intention to take criminal action against the vendors and producers of the bogus seeds, even when they have duped the farmers and they have caused huge loss not only to the farmers, but to the country.”The court then observed that as farmers incurred huge expenses while sowing the seeds and such incidents occurred frequently the matters cannot be closed only by supplying more seeds to the farmers by the State. “This season is more peculiar as due to the pandemic of Covid-19 peculiar circumstances are created. These peculiar circumstances are used by the traders and so, the offence committed by them is more grave in nature,” the court observed.It said that the failure of the seed inspector to take action against vendors supplying bogus seeds under section 420 of the IPC prompted it to pass directions to the state.The court directed the state to provide details of the date and number of complaints received by the police, nature of complaints, action taken by seed inspector at tehsil level, number of routine visits to shops selling seeds and seizure and testing of seeds and number of similar complaints received by agriculture department in last five years.The matter had been posted for hearing on July 3 but was adjourned to July 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-raps-maharashtra-for-inaction-against-vendors-who-sold-spurious-soyabean-seeds-to-farmers/story-arhxxoXGFF8anl0ROLMH4O.html

The locals claim that the proposed bill is discriminatory towards women and will dent the age-old ‘Roti-Beti’ relationship between the people of the two countries. Villagers on the Indian side of the border said if the bill is passed, they would stop marrying off their daughters in Nepal.On June 21, Nepal’s parliamentary committee had endorsed the proposed bill mandating a seven-year probation period for women marrying Nepalese men.Nepal’s citizenship amendment bill is the latest in a series of recent developments to impact ties with Uttarakhand’s bordering villages. There’s already an uncertainty clouding trade with Nepal in the border areas amid the pandemic and ongoing tension over conflicting territorial claims between the two countries.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe residents in bordering areas claim that if the proposed citizenship amendment bill is passed, the people in border areas of India would stop marrying off their daughters to men in Nepal.“If the law gets implemented then will be a major and upsetting development for us because we have not just trade but strong cultural ties with people in border areas on the Nepal side,” said Gopal Singh, village head of Khumti village in Pithoragarh, about 15 km away from Nepal border.Pithoragarh is among the three Uttarakhand districts including Champawat, and US Nagar, that share borders with Nepal. Banbasa, a border town in Champawat district, is the major border crossing point in the state.“If our daughters will get Nepalese citizenship after seven years of marrying a Nepalese man, then why would we marry them to a Nepalese man? She would have no rights there and is likely to be a stateless person despite living there,” Singh said, adding that marriages between people of Khumti and those across the border is an old tradition.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19There have been reports of protests in some parts of Nepal against this seven-year naturalization provision of the proposed citizenship amendment bill. Nepali Congress, Samajbadi Party Nepal and Rastriya Janata Party Nepal have also opposed the proposed bill, according to government officials who quoted sources in Nepal. Vinod Kala, a social activist in Banbasa town in Champawat district said, “It will definitely affect the ‘Roti-Beti’ relationship between the people of two countries and would further dent the bilateral ties.”Kala claimed that “at least 90%” of the locals in Banbasa would be affected by the amendment. “Only the remaining 10%, who are of Nepalese origin and have settled here, would be able to marry their daughters in Nepal,” he said.He also claimed that the law, if enforced, would further hamper the border trade which is “already under a cloud of uncertainty”.“The border trade with Nepal has already hit a low in Banbasa. And if this law comes, then it will probably hit the dead-end because the nationalistic sentiments of the people might get hurt,” said Kala.However, some people in border areas of Nepal think the proposed law will not hurt the cultural ties between the people of the two countries as it was a ‘political matter’. Madhav Prasad Joshi, a prominent and influential trader in Kanchanpur town of Nepal near the border said, “The matter is a political one but the ties are cultural which have been there for centuries...The law is not for just Indian women but every non-Nepalese women marrying Nepalese men,” said Joshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/roti-beti-tie-with-india-under-threat-by-nepal-s-citizenship-amendment-bill/story-niXKssw3mptzehjQwvIEIM.html

04-07-2020||India||US supercarriers in South China Sea, ambitious Beijing stretched on multiple fronts||The US Navy is deploying its two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers - USS Nimitz and USS Ronald Reagan - to conduct exercises in the South China Sea, piling pressure on an ambitious Beijing that has opened multiple fronts including one with India along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh. The US supercarriers are reported to be crossing Luzon Strait, the strait between Taiwan and Luzon island of the Philippines that connects Philippine Sea to the South China SeaThe US deployment comes after Beijing’s People’s Liberation Army Navy conducted military drills in the contested waters, provoking a sharp reaction from neighbouring states and Washington. The US navy has said its operations in the South China Sea were designed to “support free and open Indo-Pacific”.“The purpose is to show an unambiguous signal to our partners and allies that we are committed to regional security and stability,” Rear Admiral George M Wikoff commander of the strike group led by USS Ronald Reagan told Wall Street Journal, which first reported the exercises.China claims 90% of the South China Sea through which about $3 trillion of trade passes each year. Over the last decade, Beijing has gone ahead to build man-made islands and set up military installations including military-grade airfields in several areas.Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also lay claim to parts of the South China Sea, setting up many of the 21 disputes that an aggressive Beijing is embroiled in.For now, the most serious crisis is on the India-China border where armies of the two countries are locked in standoffs at multiple points in Ladakh. India has deployed its soldiers along with 1,597 km-long LAC along the entire stretch of the border in East Ladakh, prepared for any eventuality.But the LAC isn’t the only part of China’s border where it has been attempting to bulldoze its way through to expand its territory.China’s military drills in the disputed waters have been sharply criticised by its neighbours. Philippines and Vietnam had last week spoken of growing insecurity in southeast Asia at an ASEAN event last Friday amid concerns that China is using the cover of the coronavirus pandemic to step up its presence in the disputed waters.China’s PLA Navy had started the five-day military drills on July 1, prompting Vietnam to file its formal protest to the Chinese foreign ministry. China’s drills are being held near the Paracel Islands claimed by Vietnam and Philippines.In its strongest statement yet, the Philippines has said the exercises are being held in waters claimed by Vietnam.“Should the exercises spill over to Philippine territory, then China is forewarned that it will be met with the severest response, diplomatic and whatever else is appropriate,” Philippines foregn ministry said in a statement, according to news agency AP. The Philippines has a defence cooperation pact with the US.The US naval exercises come a day after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressed solidarity with China’s neighbours. “The PRC’s (People’s Republic of China) military exercise in disputed waters of the South China Sea is highly provocative. We oppose Beijing’s unlawful claims. Period,” Pompeo tweeted on Friday.Pompeo has been outspoken in his criticism of China’s expansionist approach, describing Beijing as a “rogue actor” for escalating tensions with India and other countries. Last month, he had underlined the degree to which the US is deploying its considerable military might with an almost single-minded determination to contain China.Shinzo Abe’s Japan, which had been looking at improving ties with China till some months back, is set to cancel a state visit by Xi Jinping that had been deferred from April this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Japan, which has raised its deployment around its Senkaku Islands that China eyes, has been upset with Beijing over its practice of sending its ships to the Senkaku Islands. Since April this year, Japan has spotted 67 Chinese Coast Guard ships near the islands in the East China Sea.The 8 uninhabited islands and rocks in the East China Sea controlled by Japan have a total area of about 7 sq km and lie north-east of Taiwan and east of the Chinese mainland but are important because they are close to important shipping lanes and lie near potential oil and gas reserves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-supercarriers-in-south-china-sea-ambitious-beijing-stretched-on-multiple-fronts/story-9TGe3YDqJgi6A304oVo7MM.html

All three hit the man with a heavy iron object and placed his body at a well-known supermarket owned by the family. They claimed that the man accidentally fell off a 7 feet ladder and died. During the postmortem, Kopri police officials found something suspicious and investigated the matter leading to the arrest of the three men.The deceased was identified as Mahesh Chawla, 48, while the accused, who was his younger brother, was identified as Anil Chawla, 45.

The tragedy was foretold. I offer my condolences to the families of the unfortunate victims,” tweeted Chidambaram. In a withering criticism, the Congress leader shared his disappointment with the state that Congress last ruled 30 years ago. In a stinging swipe, the leader said the state, which sends the maximum number of MPs to Parliament, has become “backward” in every respect.“UP is so backward in every respect that those who rule UP must hang their heads in shame. Congress was last in the government in UP in 1985-1989, that is 30 years ago. The BJP cannot blame the Congress and is wondering who can be blamed,” said Chidamabaram in another tweet.  UP is so backward in every respect that those who rule UP must hang their heads in shame.Congress was last in the government in UP in 1985-1989, that is 30 years ago. The BJP cannot blame the Congress and is wondering who can be blamed.Director general of police Hitesh Chandra Awasthi, who visited the ambush site along with other top officials, said the policemen fell victim to a conspiracy. “An earthmover machine was put there deliberately to stop their way and in the darkness; they were attacked. This incident would not have happened without a well-planned conspiracy.”The state government faced stinging criticism from the opposition leaders over the sorry state of affairs.The Samajwadi Party called Uttar Pradesh “Hatya Pradesh (land of murders)”, where criminals “patronised by those in power” killed policemen. It said this “connection” must be exposed.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said criminals in the state did not have any fear. “From the common man to policemen, no one is safe,” she added. Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati termed the incident “shameful and unfortunate”.According to local police officials who did not want to be named, the team came under attack from three sides. Taken by surprise, as they ran for cover, criminals on the ground accosted them and snatched their weapons, they said.By the time a wounded policeman escaped the site and raised an alarm, the criminals — believed to be around 20 in number — escaped, prompting a coordinated search operation involving about 3,000 personnel and the sealing of borders in all six districts in the Kanpur division.A police spokesperson said the weapons snatched in Bikru included an AK-47 rifle, an INSAS rifle, a Glock pistol and two .9mm pistols.Dubey, whose criminal records date back to 1993, was linked to the killing of BJP leader Santosh Shukla inside a police station in 2001.

To these challenges, lasting solutions can come from the ideals of Lord Buddha. They were relevant in the past. They are relevant to the present. And, they will remain relevant in the future,” PM Modi said.Buddhism, he said, teaches respect for the poor, women, peace and non-violence and therefore, the teachings of Buddhism are the means to a sustainable planet.PM Modi said the eight-fold path highlights the importance of compassion and kindness and added that the teachings of Lord Buddha “celebrate simplicity both in thought and action”. “In his very first sermon in Sarnath and his teachings after that, Lord Buddha spoke on two things - hope and purpose. He saw a strong link between them. From hope comes a spirit of purpose,” he said.The Prime Minister said he is “very hopeful” about the 21st century and it comes from the youth. “If you want to see a great example of how hope, innovation and compassion can remove suffering, it is our start-up sector led by our youth,” he said.“Bright young minds are finding solutions to global problems. India has one of the largest start-up eco-systems. I would urge my young friends to also stay connected with the thoughts of Lord Buddha. They will motivate and show the way ahead,” he added.PM Modi also highlighted his government’s focus on connectivity to Buddhist sites and pointed out that the cabinet had announced that Kushinagar airport will be an international one.“This would bring so many people, pilgrims and tourists,” he said.The Union ministry of culture is celebrating Asadha Poornima on Saturday as Dharma Chakra Day. The day commemorates the Buddha’s first sermon to his first five disciples in the present-day Sarnath near Uttar Pradesh’s Varanasi. It also celebrated by Buddhists all over the world as the day of Dharma Chakra Parvattana or “Turning of the Wheel of Dharma”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-guru-purnima-pm-modi-talks-of-hope-and-purpose-in-buddha-s-teachings/story-hnHEUBk7q0XKevPHGITTwO.html

04-07-2020||India||India records over 20,000 new Covid-19 cases in a row, tally tops 6.48 lakh||India recorded another spike in the cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) after 22,771 fresh infections were reported from across the country in the last 24 hours, which have taken the tally to 648,315, Union health ministry’s data showed on Saturday.The country reported more than 20,000 Covid-19 cases for the second day in a row after 20,903 infections on Friday morning.The recovery rate further improved to 60.80% as 14,335 patients were cured of the viral disease between Friday and Saturday morning, according to the health ministry’s Covid-19 dashboard.So far, 394,226 people have been discharged from hospitals across the country.The number of active cases stood at 235,433 and the death toll reached 18,655 after 442 patients succumbed to the coronavirus disease in one day.The Union health ministry’s data showed Maharashtra, India’s worst-hit state, has 192,990 Covid-19 cases and 8,376 fatalities so far. The state is witnessing an increase in cases owing to targeted testing, senior government officials said on condition of anonymity. These officials and independent experts said though there has been an increase in cases, the tally isn’t rising exponentially.Tamil Nadu is now the second state with more than 100,000 Covid-19 cases. The southern state has 102,721 infections and its death toll has reached 1,385.The high infection numbers in Tamil Nadu must be seen in tandem with its testing numbers. A total of 1.27 million people have been tested in 91 testing facilities as of Friday, the highest in the country.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has said 95,40,132 sample has been tested so far and out of which 2,42,383 samples were tested on Friday. According to experts, the high infection numbers can also be attributed to the movement of people after Unlock 1 from June 8.In Delhi, there are 94,695 Covid-19 cases and the national capital has seen more fatalities than Tamil Nadu at 2,923 till date.Public health experts have said that the coronavirus pandemic will enter its post-peak period in Delhi in the first week of August if the Capital maintains a steady decline in cases.According to the experts, the reduction marks a definite flattening in the new Covid-19 cases curve but does not yet classify as a “reversal” of a peak because an untapped cluster or lack of precautions by people could still lead to a spike that pushes the daily cases higher than they have been so far. It can be said that the peak has passed if the same trajectory continues and new Covid-19 cases fall to about 1,500 a day for at least a week before falling further.The number of coronavirus cases has exceeded 11 million and killed more than half a million people since it was first reported from China’s Wuhan city in December last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-over-20-000-new-covid-19-cases-in-a-row-tally-tops-6-48-lakh/story-DygqKcvCwe0vdKK0F3egiM.html

It was the first to get the regulatory nod to begin phase 1 and phase 2 human trials.ALSO WATCH | Why most of us won’t need Covid vaccine: Oxford prof explains | On The RecordMore than a dozen Covid-19 vaccines from over 100 candidates globally are currently being tested in humans, and some have shown potential in early-stage trials. However, no vaccine has yet been approved for commercial use.The number of cases of the coronavirus disease in India is more than 625,000 and the country’s death toll is above 18,000.Here what you need to know about the two vaccine candidates:* Bharat Biotech had claimed on Monday to have successfully developed India’s first Covid-19 vaccine, Covaxin, and said it has the permission from the drug controller to start human clinical trials.* The Hyderabad-based biotechnology giant has said that the human clinical trials of its vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) will start from July.* The company said the vaccine was developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Institute of Virology (NIV).* The strains of Sars-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19 was isolated by ICMR-NIV and transferred to Bharat Biotech in May. Scientists have managed to isolate and culture 11 strains that can be used to develop vaccines and aid research.* Bharat Biotech completed comprehensive pre-clinical studies in two months after receiving regulatory approvals. It said results from these studies have been promising and show extensive safety and effective immune responses.* On Friday, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said that it is attempting to launch the world’s first Covid-19 vaccine on August 15. * The plan was disclosed in a letter by the country’s topmost medical research body to 12 institutes where human trials are to be held for Covaxin, ordering them to secure necessary approvals from internal committees by July 7 with a warning that “non-compliance will be viewed very seriously”.* Zydus said on Friday that its potential vaccine showed a “strong immune response” in animal studies and the antibodies produced were able to completely neutralize the wild type virus.* “In animal studies the vaccine was found to elicit a strong immune response in multiple animal species like mice, rats, guinea pigs and rabbits. The antibodies produced by the vaccine were able to completely neutralize the wild type virus in virus neutralization assay indicating the protective potential of the vaccine candidate,” Zydus, part of Cadila Healthcare Ltd, said in a statement to stock exchanges.* The company said it will begin human trials this month in more than 1,000 subjects in multiple sites in India. It also plans to ramp up its production capacity for the vaccine contender to serve Indian and global demand, it added.* It said there were no safety concerns for the vaccine candidate in repeat-dose toxicology studies. In rabbits, up to three times the intended human dose was found to be safe, well-tolerated and immunogenic.* It intends to rapidly ramp up the production capacities of ZyCoV-D at “multiple sites and facilities to cater to Indian and global demand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-vaccines-ready-for-human-trials-all-you-need-to-know-about-covaxin-and-zycov-d/story-Vbwg9CT9z93jE8etUx8xqL.html

04-07-2020||India||Kanpur firing: Prime accused notorious for taking policemen head-on||History-sheeter Vikas Dubey, 48, who along with his shooters killed eight cops during an ambush in Bikru village in Kanpur Dehat early on Friday never allowed the police to raid his village where he lives in a sprawling house surrounded by his supporters.Whenever the police attempted a raid, it faced stiff resistance and had to beat a hasty retreat from the village.This is not the first time Vikas Dubey has taken the police head-on.In the past two decades, there have been four major encounters when the police were fired upon indiscriminately or were taken captive and released after the interventions of Dubey’s political bosses who always walked an extra mile to save him, said those who know him and his working.In 2005, in a similar incident, Dubey and his men surrounded a raiding circle officer Kalyanpur, Abdul Samad, fired at his team and then held him captive. It was Dubey’s mother who convinced him to release the men as she feared the cops would avenge this humiliation.Such was his political clout that the complaint of the circle officer was not registered at Shivli police station. Not only this, Vikas Dubey slapped the visiting DIG (prisons) in Kanpur jail after the officer rebuked his boss Ranga Yadav and him in 2000 when he was arrested for murder of a principal Siddheshwar Pandey, recalled a police officer who pursued him. Then he had the entire Kalyanpur police station gheraoed when by chance sub inspector Hari Om Sharma arrested him.Not only the people, two MLAs sat on a dharna outside, seeking his release.With nearly three decades of criminal history Dubey, 48, harboured criminals on the run in his fortress established in Bikru village, patronised young shooters and provided them illegal firearms, said police officials aware of his past history.The officials said Dubey used this force of criminals to grab land, influence local elections and extort money from property dealers and businessmen as well as eliminate his rivals. Dubey remained associated with several politicians of the region, they added.A senior police official at DGP headquarters said although Dubey had remained involved in crime since teenage, the crime record available with the police had as many as 60 criminal cases against him since 1993. “His crime record reads that he had over 11 cases of attempt to murder and six cases of murder but he had remain involved in over 20 murders directly or indirectly and harboured shooters involved in different murders in the region,” he said.The official said Dubey’s house in Bikru, termed as his fortress, had a campus of over 10,000 square ft. The house was designed in such a manner that one could easily keep watch for up to 500 metres from the rooftop, he said. Moreover, he had informers in the entire village.The official said, “His bravado can be gauged from the murder of politician Santosh Shukla, who had a post equivalent to minister of state, in 2001. Dubey chased Shukla and shot him inside Shivli police station when the latter tried to hide there.”Later, Dubey was acquitted in the case after all witnesses, including police personnel, turned hostile, he said.When Vikas Dubey was a student of class nine in Rasoolabad Inter College he carried a country-made-pistol in his school bag, recalls a classmate living in Kanpur Dehat. He was asked to leave the school.In 2006, he was arrested in Saharanpur on charges of possessing drugs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kanpur-firing-prime-accused-notorious-for-taking-policemen-head-on/story-jnyZXbtUQ6chzHHcBiDWeP.html

04-07-2020||India||4.7-magnitude quake in Alwar; tremors in NCR||An earthquake of 4.7 magnitude occurred in Alwar, Rajasthan around 7pm on Friday evening. The depth of the earthquake was approximately 35km. “Its intensity was 4.7, so tremors were felt in Delhi-NCR as well. We are getting details on the faults near the epicentre,” JL Gautam, head (operations), National Center for Seismology, said.The occurrence of earthquakes of small magnitude in Delhi-NCR do not indicate a bigger earthquake is coming, a recent official statement by the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology read.But the institute also clarified that the vulnerability of a region can be understood from its past seismic activity, the calculation of strain and the mapping of active faults. Delhi-NCR is in the second-highest seismic hazard zone (Zone IV) in the country, the institute said.Sometimes a vulnerable zone remains quiet, experiences earthquakes of small magnitude that do not indicate a bigger earthquake, but they can also receive a sudden jolt by a big earthquake with no warning, the statement read.There are many weak zones and faults in the Delhi-NCR: Delhi-Haridwar ridge, Mahendragarh-Dehradun subsurface fault, Moradabad fault, Sohna fault, Great boundary fault, Delhi-Sargodha ridge, Yamuna river lineament, Ganga river lineament and others. Delhi is also vulnerable to earthquakes because of its proximity to the Himalayas. There are many faults, ridges, and lineaments transverse to the Himalayan arc. A major earthquake in the Himalayan seismic belt may also be a threat to Delhi-NCR, the institute had said.About 22 earthquakes ranging in magnitude from 1.8 to 4.7 have occurred in and around Delhi-NCR since May 1 till date in the vicinity of the Delhi Aravalli range.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-7-magnitude-quake-in-alwar-tremors-in-ncr/story-yhaJKf5st8OXMhc3zD4WpL.html

She then went to the isolation ward.Ajay Swain, the medical officer, said the staff at the isolation ward had tried to stop her.“It was really tragic. The couple had got married one-and-a-half year ago,” said Swain. The police seized both the bodies and sent them for a postmortem examination.In a similar case, a 73-year-old man in Ganjam district died of cardiac arrest soon after hearing that his son had tested positive for Covid-19.Officials said a jeweller in Kabisuryanagar area had tested positive for the coronavirus disease after which he was sent to a Covid-19 hospital in an ambulance. The jeweller’s father collapsed and died when he was being taken away. Even as the news about his death spread, no one from his community turned up at his home apprehending that he had died from the infection.“The body lay for hours but no one turned up to take the body to the cremation ground for the final rites till a teacher of a local private school with the help of an employee of the Kabisuryanagar NAC and four local youths cremated the body wearing PPE suits,” Mohan Sundar Dash, a resident, said.Ganjam has seen more than 1,800 Covid-19 cases, the highest in Odisha, in just about a month after two lakh migrant labourers came back to the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wife-found-dead-after-husband-dies-in-covid-19-isolation-ward-in-odisha-s-jagatsinghpur/story-3qLwsRi6rUJty8uFCn9DPL.html
04-07-2020||India||Faces of terror: Why India banned 9 Khalistan-linked terrorists in 5 countries||The Centre moved this week to designate nine men accused of promoting terrorism in Punjab as terrorists under India’s anti-terror law amended last year letting the Union home ministry ban individuals and not just organisations. The nine, the ‘nasty nine’ as one Punjab Police officer described them, have been trying to revive militancy in Punjab from their homes in five countries including Pakistan.The provision was first invoked last September to designate Jaish-e-Mohammed founder Maulana Masood Azhar, Lashkar-e-Taiba founder Hafeez Saeed, its operational commander Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi and Dawood Ibrahim, as terrorists under Indian law. That order was more symbolic. The four have already been designated as terrorists by the United Nations Security Council; Hafiz Saeed as far back as in 2008.“Monday’s notification is important because this is the first time that this provision of the anti-terror law has been invoked to initiate a crackdown on promoters of Khalistan living in foreign countries,” a senior counter-terror official told Hindustan Times. Since the terrorists are operating from foreign countries, he said, the police would seize any assets that can be linked to them in India and ask their counterparts abroad also to act against them.The security establishment got down to work soon after. Punjab Police has filed FIRs against one of the nine, Gurpatwant Singh Pannu and his associates in Amritsar and Kapurthala for sedition and secessionism. Pannu is legal adviser to the US-based Sikhs for Justice that was designated a terror group last year. A third case was registered by Haryana Police in Gurugram, adjacent to national capital Delhi.The group has launched a campaign on the internet called Referendum 2020 that asks people to vote for carving out a sovereign Khalistan out of India. The group has announced that registration would start from today. The campaign, according to the police, has been engineered and backed by Pakistans’ ISI that has been working for years to revive terrorism in Punjab.Here is why the government has designated them as terrorists.GURMEET SINGHBased in Hamburg, GermanyGurmeet Singh aka Bagga, 50, is a close associate of Pakistan-based Sikh radical Ranjeet Singh alias Neeta. Bagga is a former Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF) terrorist and is wanted in three cases of shipment of a huge quantity of explosives from Pakistan to Punjab to carry out terror strikes. He has lately been instrumental in smuggling weapons from Pakistan, often using Chinese-made drones that carry a payload of firearms weighing around 10 kg across the fenced border into border villages of Punjab. Bagga was also sentenced to a 4-year prison term by a German court for assassination attempt on Radha Swami Beas Chief, Baba Gurinder Singh Dhillon in Vienna.RANJEET SINGHBased in Lahore, PakistanRanjeet Singh alias Neeta is the chief of Khalistan Zindabad Force. According to the Union home ministry, he is involved in numerous cases of murder, smuggling of arms and fake currency. He is believed to be closely linked to a fake Indian currency smuggling network operating out of Sialkot and Kasur areas of Pakistan. He is also alleged to be the mastermind behind smuggling firearms into Punjab via drones.Ranjeet Singh is also in touch with Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists and is believed to have been a prime supporter of links between ISI-backed Khalistani elements and other jihadi outfits in Pakistan that target India.Ranjeet Singh continues to maintain close association with radical elements of the community based in the UK, USA, Canada and European countries and motivate them for carrying out anti-India propaganda and militant activities in IndiaHARDEEP SINGH NIJJARBased in Vancouver, CanadaVancouver-based Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who immigrated to Canada in 1995-96, claims to have a day job, running a small plumbing business. But he has been on the radar of Indian security agencies for years for links with the Khalistan Tiger Force. According to his dossier, he has been the mastermind and key conspirator of many terrorist acts including bomb blasts in India. Besides, he has been accused of promoting terrorist activities in India by talent spotting and arranging training of recruits.Nijjar became the operational head of Khalistan Tiger Force after the arrest of its chief Jagtar Singh Tara in 2015. Tara , an accused in the ex-chief minister Beant Singh assasination case, had broken out of a Chandigarh jail in 2004, moved to Pakistan, before landing in Thailand’s Bangkok where he was arrested and brought back.Nijjar was introduced to Tara in 2011 who mentored him during Nijjar’s visit to Pakistan in April 2012, teaching him how to operate firearms and explosives. A red corner notice was issued against Hardeep Singh Nijjar in 2014 for his involvement in raising terrorist modules at the behest of then KTF chief Jagtar Singh Tara.BHUPINDER SINGH BHINDABased in Frankfurt, GermanyBhupinder Singh Bhinda is associated with Pakistan-based Ranjeet Singh Neeta of Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF). Besides, remaining in regular telephonic contacts with Ranjit Singh, Bhinda is also in contact with his Punjab-based Sikh terrorists to foment trouble in Punjab.Bhinda was earlier sentenced (Dec. 2012) to jail for 4 years and 7 months by a Frankfurt Court for involvement in conspiracy to kill the Head of Radha Soami Beas Dera, Baba Gurinder Singh during the latter’s visit to Germany in July 2010.WADHAWA SINGH Based in Lahore, PakistanWadhawa Singh, also known as Dharam Singh and Chacha, is the Babbar Khalsa International chief, who was involved in several crimes including those committed back in the 1980s. According to police records, Wadhwa Singh was part of the six-member Babbar Khalsa team that shot inspector Pritam Singh Bajwa and a constable who raided their hideout in Ludhiana’s Daheru village. The terror group had later gone on to blow up an Air India plane on its way to Montreal, Canada from Delhi, that killed 329 people, mostly Canadians.He also maintains links with Pak-based Islamic terrorists and maintains close association with radical elements based in the UK, USA, Canada and European countries.In Lahore, Wadhwa Singh also runs a construction business and owns several shops in Lahore.His son Jitindervir Singh and son-in-law Satnam Singh, who are based in Germany, are active members of BKI-Germany. Wadhawa Singh is also closely associated with other BKI affiliates in other countries, particularly in the United Kingdom.LAKHBIR SINGH RODEBased in Lahore, PakistanLakhbir Singh Rode, the nephew of radical Sikh preacher Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale who advocated carving out of Khalistan, has been described in police records as a hardcore terrorist associated with several terror attacks in India. Currently, police say he runs a business of import and export of food grains and edible items in Lahore, besides involvement in drug trade.Lakhbir Singh Rode’s son, Bhagat Brar, based in Canada, is actively involved in anti-India activities. He frequently visits Pakistan for meeting radical community leaders based there besides the ISI officials for organising and coordinating anti-India activities abroad. Lakhbir Singh continues to keep close association with radical elements in the UK, Canada and other European countries for revival of terrorism in Punjab.PARAMJIT SINGH PANJWARBased in Lahore, PakistanParamjit Singh Panjwar is the chief of Khalistan Commando Force-Panjwar. He was involved in multiple terror cases during 1988-1990 and had negotiated with Afghan Mujahideens based in Peshawar for supply of arms and ammunition and training of Sikh militants. He is also involved in smuggling of drugs.Now, Panjwar mostly appears to play an advisory role, radicalising young men of the community and helping them carry out anti-India and pro-Khalistan activities.PARAMJIT SINGH PAMMABased in Birmingham, UKParamjit Singh aka Pamma is UK-based Babbar Khalsa International activist. A red corner notice was issued against him after his role surfaced during investigations into the murder of Rashtriya Sikh Sangat head Rulda Singh in Patiala in July 2009. Pamma was arrested in Portugal when he was on a visit from the UK but he managed to secure his release from Portugal on the ground that the British authorities had already granted asylum to him, according to the police records. Officials say he has been brazen about his pro-Khalistan activities after his release by Portugal and has been conspiring with the ISI and Sikh terrorists based in Pakistan, particularly Wadhawa Singh Babbar.GURPATWANT SINGH PANNUNBased in New York/California, USAGurpatwant Singh Pannun is associated with the banned organization ‘Sikhs for Justice’, as legal adviser. Pannun has been leading a campaign “Punjab Referendum 2020 for Khalistan”, launched in a rally in June 2014 in New York. NIA DIG Sonia Narang told a UAPA tribunal last year that the SJF is presently propagating ‘Referendum 2020’ in a very big way on the social media as well as on ground by holding meetings across USA and other countries where Sikhs are in large numbers. Activities of the SFJ have been held to be unlawful, disruptive and threaten the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of India by the tribunal that confirmed the ban under India’s anti-terror law. The judge said there was enough evidence that SFJ works in collusion with anti-India entities and forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/faces-of-terror-why-india-banned-9-khalistan-linked-terrorists-in-5-countries/story-aR4fHIdFA3SCe74rAB4mtM.html
04-07-2020||India||Odisha to provide Rs 1,040 crore loans to sharecroppers through joint liability groups||Odisha will provide crop loans worth crores to seven lakh landless sharecroppers in the state through joint liability groups (JLGs) in the next two years through a new scheme, officials said.The scheme, Balaram Yojana, is a sequel to the Kalia scheme announced last year just before the polls for small and marginal farmers and would enable sharecroppers to get loans of around Rs 1,040 crore.Asit Tripathy, the state’s chief secretary, said sharecroppers would be given credit facility on the basis of “social collateral” through joint liability groups. Around 140,000 such groups would be formed with each group comprising five farmers. Around 70,000 groups will get farm loans under the scheme this year.A joint liability group is an informal group comprising preferably 4 to 10 individuals who come together to avail a loan from a bank either singly or through the group mechanism against the mutual guarantee.Its members offer a joint undertaking to the bank that would enable them to avail loans. The credit assessment of the group could be based on the available cultivable area by each member. All members would jointly execute the document and own the debt liability together and severally.Ashok Meena, the state finance secretary, would mobilise the banking sector through State Level Bankers Committee for the loans to JLGs. The chief secretary directed every bank branch in the state to provide at least 10 farm loans this year. In rural areas and small towns in the state, there are around 7,000 branches of banks and Primary Agricultural Cooperative societies.In April this year, the Odisha government had framed draft legislation to recognise the rights of sharecroppers in the state.The draft legislation “Odisha Agricultural Land Leasing Act”, would help a sharecropper into a written lease agreement on mutually agreed terms and conditions, with a landowner for the cultivation of agricultural produces.Once passed by the assembly, the legislation would mark a change of fortunes for millions of sharecroppers in Odisha where sharecropping was banned following an amendment in Orissa Land Reforms Act in 1974. Despite the ban on sharecropping, more than 70 per cent of land is cultivated through sharecropping.As per the draft legislation, the lease agreement between the sharecropper and the landowner would contain several details, boundaries, location and area of leased out land, duration of the lease expressed in months or years.Apart from a written agreement, there will a provision for oral lease. Both sharecropper and landowner have to apply before the revenue officer and the matter will have to be discussed in a gram sabha, as per the draft legislation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-provide-rs-1-040-crore-loans-to-sharecroppers-through-joint-liability-groups/story-FxBjsPuOxShNqQkD3L5zNL.html

04-07-2020||India||Left in lurch with ban, TikTok stars stare at a grim future||The best jokes about India banning Tik-Tok were on Tik-Tok, but people not on the popular Chinese app probably wouldn’t have got them. The jokes contained not only funny lines but also music, dance, acting, emojis and a whole lot of wackiness. Thousands of those went viral in the 12-odd hours that the app was functional on Indian smartphones after the government banned it, citing cybersecurity worries. Scores of users had already uninstalled the app in the name of patriotism since border tensions escalated between India and China earlier this month, but many refused to hit delete. As a popular creator said in her latest video while spinning on her heel: “They are making Tik-Tok videos to order us to delete Tik-Tok. No chance!” Also read: After TikTok, now LinkedIn is snooping on iOS Users through Clipboard, fix coming soonOn Tuesday morning, the company voluntarily disabled the app that opened up social media celebrity to millions of people in small-town and rural India but also sparked concerns about mass surveillance and large-scale transfer of data to the Chinese government. By then, many Tik-Tok stars had already posted videos urging their fans to follow them to rival platforms such as Instagram or YouTube. But as some of them pointed out themselves between sobs and sniffles, it won’t be the same. They would need talent for YouTube, coolness for Instagram, irony for Snapchat. “It may be just an app for some people, but for me it translates to four years of sweat. Hundreds of apps like this can come and go, but this is where I could make 6.8 million people laugh,” said a comic star in his goodbye video. He will never know if it was the quality of his jokes that attracted 6.8 million followers, but what made TikTok special was that being bad at something could make you as popular as being good at it.No one knew what worked, so everyone had a chance, and millions went for it regardless of looks, location and language skills. Israil Ansari was one of them. In 2018, the then 18-year-old posted his first TikTok, a 15-second video of himself dancing to a Bollywood song with the rice fields of his Uttar Pradesh village in the backdrop. Ansari looks funny dancing, as he is happy to admit, but that didn’t stop his video from becoming viral — or perhaps that’s what did it. “Hanse toh phanse (laugh and you are hooked)” is how he explained his wild success on the platform. Since 2017, when he left his village and his job at the local hardware store to move to Lucknow and then Mumbai, Ansari, a school dropout, has earned more than two million followers and over Rs 1 lakh in monthly income from public appearances and brand endorsements. All he had to do, he says, was stay true to his character. Now that TikTok’s gone, he is trying his best to brave it out. “Koi dikkat nahin hai (no issues). The public knows me, and that’s what matters. I will find another platform from where I can earn an income,” he said. Also read: China holds out WTO threat over ban on 59 mobile apps. India bursts the bubble“The fact that someone like Shilpa Shetty or Riteish Deshmukh has to do duets with this dancer from a village in order to be popular on TikTok explains its appeal to users,” says Sheikh Khalfan whose Mumbai-based online channel tracks TikTok celebrities. He now spends his entire time consoling them. “The stars are in a frenzy trying to build their presence on YouTube or Instagram. But they are too used to the rhythm of TikTok,” Khalfan said. “A 30-second video is all it took to get famous overnight so people put out all their creativity into it, whether it was comedy or karaoke. And even after they earned followers, that’s how they approached every video. That habit will be hard to break out of it,” he said. For the followers, too, it won’t be an easy switch from TikTok to another video entertainment platform. “On TikTok, you like something and it keeps giving you more and more of that. I like dance videos, for example, and my feed never runs out of it. The platform understands the human brain,” Khalfan said. He is not wrong. TikTok users spend most of their time on the app going through a feed made for them via artificial intelligence. The AI-system offers them a random stream of popular videos when they sign up and studies how they react to each one, from the time they spend watching a video to the speed with which they swipe up or down, besides reading the obvious signals such as likes, comments and follows. The more time users spend inside the app, the better it becomes at predicting what they will like. To be sure, experts have long questioned this system, saying the data collected on users was not only being transferred to third-party businesses but also possibly to the Chinese government. Moreover, TikTok was found last month to have intercepted personal data of users by logging their keystrokes in an attempt to circumvent end-to-end encryption. The effect of its algorithm was often addictive. Through most of India’s months-long coronavirus-sparked lockdown, TikTok remained the country’s most downloaded app as people sought an escape from the reality. Now, they will have to find another distraction. To Sabira Khan, a popular creator known for posting sad videos, this feels like an end. “The news has broken me. I have been crying since I heard. I had just reached a million followers, and it had taken me a lot of hard work through these months of lockdown,” said the creator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/left-in-lurch-with-ban-tiktok-stars-stare-at-a-grim-future/story-sg14NqNNhYZJvNInpTGsdM.html
04-07-2020||India||CAPF okays transgender persons’ hiring||In what can be seen as a major move towards the inclusion of the transgender community into the mainstream after the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act was notified earlier this year, officials of the Border Security Force (BSF), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) on Friday told the Union home ministry that they will recruit transgender persons to the officer cadre post of assistant commandants.“The CRPF already has a gender-neutral work environment. In view of impending policy guidelines of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), we shall make it further compatible as per the need,” director general A P Maheshwari said. Indo-Tibet Border Police (ITBP) chief S S Deswal, who also holds additional charge as director general BSF, said, “We have no objection,” speaking for the latter paramilitary force. The ITBP and the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) Centre are expected to respond t in the next few days, officials familiar with the matter said.The home ministry on Wednesday sought the views of central paramilitary forces (CAPF) to add transgender as the third gender category in relevant application forms ahead of the annual examination for recruiting assistant commandants to be held in December. The comments of all the central paramilitary forces would be shared with the Union Public Service Commission which conducts the exams, officials aware of the matter said.The home ministry’s letter, first sent out on in June and again on July 1, followed a circular issued by the Department of Personnel Training in April, which directed all central government departments to include transgender as a separate category for recruitment for all posts, including civil services.There is currently no provision to hire transgender persons in the central paramilitary forces. Vidya Rajput, a member of the Chhattisgarh Transgender Welfare Board said that while the move was welcome, additional seats for transpersons must be created across all government posts. “A socially supportive structure is very important.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/capf-okays-transgender-persons-hiring/story-epFM5affqQjBqH6y12VqFM.html
04-07-2020||India||Several US states post record Covid-19 cases, curfew ordered in Miami||Alabama and several other states reported record increases in coronavirus cases on Friday as Florida’s most populous county imposed a curfew ahead of the Independence Day weekend and Arkansas joined a push towards mandating mask-wearing in public.North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Alaska all saw new daily highs in cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, while Texas hit a new peak for hospitalizations, with one doctor calling for a “complete lockdown” in the state to get the virus under control. The recent surge, most pronounced in southern and western states, has alarmed public health officials, who urged caution ahead of a July 4th holiday weekend to celebrate the Declaration of Independence of the United States in 1776.North Carolina reported 951 hospitalizations and 2,099 cases, both record highs.Bill Saffo, mayor of Wilmington, North Carolina, said many infections had been traced to large gatherings and predicted a further jump after the holiday weekend as people flouted guidelines on social distancing and masks. “We know that the spread is going to happen. We know probably in about two weeks we’ll see a spike from the July 4th weekend,” Saffo told CNN.Despite the jump in infections, the daily death rate in the United States has remained relatively flat, a reflection of the growing proportion of positive tests among younger, healthier people who are less prone to severe outcomes.However, US Surgeon General Jerome Adams warned that the impact on fatalities from the recent surge, which started in mid-June, had yet to be seen. “Deaths lag at least two weeks and can lag even more,” he told “Fox & Friends” on Friday.His remarks came hours ahead of a trip by President Donald Trump to Mount Rushmore in South Dakota where he is expected to give a speech to thousands of supporters in which he will rail against the “left wing mob” and view a fireworks display at the landmark depicting four US presidents in stone.The visit has drawn criticism from Native Americans, who say the remote area is sacred to them, as well as health experts who discourage large congregations of people.Trump, whose handling of the pandemic has come under harsh criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, has repeatedly sought to dismiss the jump in cases as a function of more tests and again this week predicted the virus would “disappear.”MORE MASKSCoronavirus cases are rising in 37 of the 50 US states including Florida which had 9,488 new cases on Friday, according to the state health department. Florida’s 10,109 cases on Thursday was a record for the state and more than any European country’s daily peak at the height of the outbreak there.Evidence the surge is not simply due to expanded testing, the percentage of tests coming back positive in Florida has hit 16%, up from 4% a month ago, according to a Reuters analysis. The World Health Organization says a rate over 5% is concerning.Against that backdrop, Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez imposed an indefinite nightly curfew starting Friday and halted the reopenings of entertainment venues such as casinos and strip clubs. Earlier this week, Miami-Dade and neighboring Broward County, the state’s two most populous counties, required residents to wear face coverings in public. Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson on Friday authorized the state’s cities and towns to enact a “model ordinance” requiring the wearing of face coverings if they choose to do so, becoming the latest Republican to relent to pressure on the issue. The move came a day after Texas Governor Greg Abbott ordered that face masks be worn in most public places, reversing his stance following an alarming rise in infections in the state, which on Friday marked a new high for hospitalizations at 7,652.Owais Durrani, a resident at University Hospital in San Antonio, said nearly all the patients coming into the emergency room tested positive for COVID-19 - even those admitted for unrelated issues such as gall bladder infections. “We, in my opinion, need to go into a complete lockdown and we’re still going to see an increase in all of those metrics for two to three weeks and then maybe we turn a corner,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/several-us-states-post-record-covid-19-cases-curfew-ordered-in-miami/story-TB7js4EQFLa6tLgUieGjpN.html
04-07-2020||India||BJP units to present Covid work before PM Modi||On Saturday, each state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will make a presentation before Prime Minister Narendra Modi on their initiatives in line with the government’s gareeb kalyan schemes for those in need in the aftermath of the corona pandemic.BJP general secretary Arun Singh said on Friday said that party units will put out the details of the work, such as, supply of cooked food and ration, masks and sanitisers during the lockdown that was imposed to check the spread of the virus in March.“The party provided food to 22 crore people during the lockdown, and distributed 80 lakh sanitisers and 2.5 crore face covers,” he said, addressing the media.Apart from PM Modi, the digital presentation will also be attended by party president J P Nadda, union ministers Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadkari.The party has also been organising virtual rallies to highlight the achievements of the government’s first year in office during the second term at the Centre.“The party organised over 61 virtual rallies to mark the first anniversary, and 11.49 crore people attended them. Party workers contacted over 5.41 crore people through door-to-door contact programmes,” he said.To a separate question on PM Modi’s visit to Ladakh and the situation there, Singh said people have faith in the Prime Minister’s leadership, and that he has already made it clear that those eyeing India’s territory will be given a befitting reply.The BJP leader also dismissed allegations that law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh had deteriorated under the Yogi Adityanath government.“During the Samajwadi Party’s regime, those in power were involved in crime. Now the BJP government has gone after criminals,” he said, reacting to SP’s criticism of the Yogi government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-units-to-present-covid-work-before-pm-modi/story-WjQK9Q27hPF9UEz07X2kWL.html
04-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||In 1963, Merck scientist Maurice Hilleman cultured the mumps virus from the throat of his ill daughter and used the weakened strain to create a vaccine. The company’s Mumpsvax vaccine was introduced in 1967. It took a little less than four years from start to finish; of this, the human trials lasted two years. When it comes to vaccine development, this is a record that stands to the day. For some time, it looked like a vaccine for the Zika virus could beat the record, but that looks unlikely now.Vaccine development can be broken into two phases — a pre-clinical study, and the clinical study. Once the pre-clinical study phase is done (and it is preferable that the results are published even if they aren’t peer-reviewed), the clinical study phase starts. This is the time-consuming part of vaccine development which, by its very nature, is a risky business.The Zika example highlights this — even three-and-half years ago, when work on the first Zika vaccines started, there were fears that the disease wouldn’t be relevant by the time the vaccine was developed. Vaccine development is an expensive proposition costing billions, and no company wants to back research for a vaccine that will not have a market (or a viable one) when it is eventually ready.Also read: ICMR sets August 15 deadline for world’s 1st Covid-19 vaccineGenerally, the clinical study of a vaccine has three phases, which measure safety, immune response, efficacy, and try and figure out the correct dosage as well as the schedule of vaccination.The first phase could last between one and two years, and involves administering the vaccine to a few people to see if it is safe and provokes an immune response in them (all vaccines work by doing this). There’s a growing opinion that the timeline for Phase 1 can be crashed to months, which is what many of the vaccine candidates for Covid-19 have done.The second phase, which normally lasts anything between two and three years, is a so-called randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study. In such studies, test subjects are randomly assigned to a so-called control group to which placebos are given, and another group (called the intervention group) to which the candidate vaccine is administered. Neither the researchers nor the subjects know who is getting what (that’s why it is called double blind). Phase 2 usually involves testing the vaccine on hundreds of subjects who have the condition (in this case Covid-19) but do not suffer from any other conditions. The results are studied for safety and efficacy, but also to understand the correct dosage of the vaccine, and how and when it should be given. Typical Phase 2 studies do not measure clinical outcomes.The third phase, which could last for anything between two and four years, involves another (but much larger) randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study. In this, the vaccine is administered to thousands (sometimes tens to thousands) of subjects who are representative of the larger population. The two most important parameters studied in this are safety and efficacy. Phase 3 trials measure clinical outcomes, and at the end of this trial, the researchers should have enough data to show that the “benefits outweigh the risks” as the US Food and Drug Administration puts it.Most vaccine candidates for Covid-19 are crashing timelines by combining Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials. The opinion among experts is that the time involved can be reduced to around a year, although the researchers behind some of the candidates have more aggressive targets.Also read| Coronavirus: After govt nod, Delhi hospitals start antigen testingThe Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) now wants to reduce the time it takes to conduct Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 trials for a vaccine candidate of Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech to 45 days. This is a vaccine based on an inactive virus, but while pre-clinical studies have been carried out, they are yet to be published. ICMR wants the clinical study phase on this vaccine, called Covaxin, to start soon. Its urgency perhaps comes from news reports about other vaccine candidates in the pipeline launching combined Phase2/3 trials. Indeed, CanSino Biologicals and China’s PLA have decided that even as they proceed with Phase 3 trials for their candidate vaccine, it has shown enough success to be approved for military use.But can ICMR’s deadline of 45 days be met without sacrificing any of the integrity of each phase of the trial?We will know on August 15, but a fragment from a widely reported June 22 call vaccine maker Sanofi’s CEO Paul Hudson had with reporters is worth highlighting. He said his company couldn’t “move faster than the biology” of its processes. It will be interesting to see if Bharat Biotech can.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-aj1T4Ovac5Ct5ujQ8LSidL.html
04-07-2020||India||No job cuts but profiles of employees may change, says Railways||The Railways on Friday said certain job profiles of its employees might change in the coming days but asserted that there will be no job losses, a day after the national transporter issued a letter, asking its general managers to slash 50 per cent vacancies and freeze creation of new posts. In an online briefing, Director General (HR) Railway Board, Anand S Khati said the Railways will be “rightsizing and not downsizing”. He said due to technological interventions in the national transporter, certain job profiles might change, wherein the personnel will be re-skilled, but there will be no job losses.“We will be rightsizing and not downsizing. Let there be no doubt that the Indian Railways will remain the largest employer in the country. We will move from unskilled to more skilled jobs,” he said. He said the order (sent on Thursday) was to surrender non-functional, non-safety vacant posts which would help in creating additional safety posts for new railway infrastructure projects already underway. He asserted that all ongoing recruitment drives for various categories of posts will continue as usual, adding that those posts which have been notified or advertised will not be impacted in any way.The Railways currently has 12,18,335 employees and spends 65 per cent of its income on payment of salaries and pension.Since 2018, the Railways has notified 72,274 vacancies in safety category and 68,366 in non safety category, taking the total number of vacancies notified to 1,40,640. The letter to the general managers, approved by the Financial Commissioner, Railways said the freezing of new posts, review of posts created in last two years and surrendering of 50 per cent of existing vacancies was part of “an action plan for economic measure and rationalisation of expenditure.” The letter led to speculations that the Railways was geared up to downsize its staff. While Khati maintained that there would be no job losses in the national transporter, in a letter dated June 19, the financial commissioner of the Railways had told the general managers of all the zones that the traffic earnings of the national transporter dropped by 58 per cent at the end of May, as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year and that there was a “need to explore new areas of expenditure control and enhancement of earnings”.The financial commissioner had also proposed a slew of austerity measures -- freeze in the creation of new posts, rationalisation of manpower at workshops, shifting outsourced work to CSR, moving ceremonial functions to digital platforms and cutting down on use of stationary by 50 per cent. In the letter, the financial commissioner had also advised the zones to control expenditure by reducing staff cost, rationalising staff and also by making them perform multiple tasks. It had also asked the zones to review contracts, reduce energy consumption and cut cost in administrative and other areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-job-cuts-but-profiles-of-employees-may-change-says-railways/story-scTOgwe2rD7zN4UVBW9SoL.html
04-07-2020||India||Maha sees another record spike of 6,364 cases; toll up to 4,762||Maharashtra recorded more than 6,000 new Covid-19 infections and a record 24-hour spike in cases for the second consecutive day on Friday, as the state’s tally rose by 6,364 to 192,990. The state reported 198 fatalities, including 48 from previous weeks, taking its toll to 4,762. Mumbai, the worst-hit city in Maharashtra, recorded 1,338 new cases, taking its case count to 82,074. The state health department reconciled data for Sangli and 37 patients who were earlier recorded there were added to Mumbai’s tally. The city reported 73 deaths in the past 48 hours, taking its toll to 4,762. Senior government officials, on condition of anonymity, said the state is witnessing an increase in cases owing to targeted testing. These officials and independent experts said though there has been an increase in cases, the tally isn’t rising exponentially. State health minister Rajesh Tope said the state’s case curve could flatten by August. Tope said several changes have been made in guidelines for testing and that no inferences can be made based on the positivity rate. “Earlier, tests included immediate contacts, neighbours, etc. Therefore the strike rate from these tests was lower. Now our tests are targeted and so the percentage is higher. We have augmented testing capacity across the state and are still adding laboratories. We expect the numbers to flatten by early August,” Tope said.In the past 14 days, the positivity rate in the state has been ranging between 19% and 27%. In the first three days of July, the positivity rate of the state has been 21.09% (July 1), 22.90% (July 2) and 22.01% (July 3). The overall positivity rate in the state stands at 18.39%.One of the officials said the state has not yet reached its peak. “There is no denying that the infection has spread widely. It is also true that we have not reached the peak yet as there are newer hot spots mushrooming. There are multiple reasons for the high positivity rate [of late]. We have increased our daily testing from 13,000 per day on June 22 to 27,000-28,000. We do targeted testing as per ICMR guidelines,” said the official.The state has 115 testing laboratories, including private laboratories, and has the capacity to test 38,000 samples daily. On June 22, the state tested 13,554 samples and reported 3,721 cases which is a positivity rate of 27.45%. From June 24, the daily tests increased and more than 20,000 samples have been tested every day since then.A senior state bureaucrat dismissed speculations that the state is not utilising its testing capacity fully as it could lead to more numbers. The bureaucrat said tests will have to remain “targeted”. “Our testing capacity is 38,000 samples per day, but testing will have to remain focused on high-risk contacts and other immediate contacts. Random testing is not in the guidelines and it won’t yield any result. Contact tracing is lax in several parts. Our goal is 1:15 (15 contacts for one Covid-19 patient), but data shows we do not go beyond four to five high-risk contacts,” the bureaucrat said. Dr Om Shrivastav, an infectious diseases expert with Jaslok Hospital, said, “The principle of the World Health Organization (WHO) and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has been more tests will lead to more cases. Therefore, we are seeing more cases being reported. However, the positivity rate is not a concern as much as the mortality rate is.” Dr Lancelot Pinto, an epidemiologist from Hinduja Hospital, said the increase in positivity rate is not alarming. “As of today, it does not seem that there is a huge spike waiting for us around the corner. We have not down-turned that’s a fact, but we are not ascending rapidly as well. The increase in positivity rate could also be a reflection of relaxation in testing parameters by the government,” he said.Tope said there are two lacunas that he had found in all interactions with collectors and commissioners. “One is tracing; we only get 1:6 as against our target of 15 contacts per patient. The second issue is home quarantine in slums. They need to have an institutional quarantine facility to stem the spread in densely populated areas. I visited Bhiwandi and Badlapur and have instructed the local administration on similar lines,” said the minister. Currently, Maharashtra has 5,89,448 patients in home quarantine and 42,371 in institutional quarantine facilities.The state’s testing capacity is also being further augmented. Looking at the sharp spike in cases in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the state has decided to add one laboratory each in Bhiwandi, Badlapur, Ulhasnagar, Mira-Bhayander and in Thane district, said Tope. “Testing has increased in several cities. Mumbai daily tests around 4,500, while Pune tests about 6,000 samples daily. Jalgaon, which was testing 100 samples earlier, now tests 500, similarly Nagpur, which was 400 samples a day, now tests 1,500 daily,” an official from the health department said.Meanwhile, 3,515 people were discharged on Friday which took the total count of recovered patients to 104,687. The recovery rate in the state stands at 54.24%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-sees-another-record-spike-of-6-364-cases-toll-up-to-4-762/story-Sr7hZL5dLhAUynIdUOE1hJ.html
04-07-2020||India||Parliament’s Monsoon session may be shorter, a digital-physical hybrid||The Monsoon session of Parliament may begin after August 15, be shorter than usual, and lawmakers may be spread across different buildings to attend hybrid — a mix of physical and digital — proceedings as lawmaking adjusts to the new normal inflicted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Officials familiar with the matter said that while some members may sit in the two houses — on designated seats with social distancing, and in different galleries on the first floor — others may attend the proceedings digitally from Parliament’s library building, which is situated next to the main building. The online platform of the National Informatics Centre (NIC) can accommodate up to 600 visitors. The officials cited above said on condition of anonymity that the plan on who will be allocated space where is likely to be drawn based on the strength of different parties in the Upper and Lower houses. Also read: First House panel to discuss preparedness to tackle Covid-19An earlier plan to shift the Lok Sabha to the larger Central Hall, and the Rajya Sabha to the Lok Sabha, was junked, the officials added, saying it was proving difficult to safely accommodate all the members . With a rise in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks the authorities are also considering a shorter session. “There’s not much business to transact. The priority of the government is to clear the ordinances promulgated in the past few months and the Opposition might press for debates on Covid pandemic and Indo-China border conflict,” said an official involved in the preparations. He said that the session may start only after Independence Day. Last year, the Monsoon session ran from June 17 to August 6.The Narendra Modi government has, in recent months, brought three ordinances to redefine the legal framework of India’s agricultural markets as a part of its Covid response. It amended the Essential Commodities Act, brought a new legislation on contract farming, and changed the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) laws to allow farmers sell their produce freely.The government also promulgated the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 to bring the large network of co-operative banks under the purview of the Reserve Bank of India.Even as the government will take a final call on the session’s schedule, Rajya Sabha chair, Vice President Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla are busy preparing the ground for a session amid the risks posed by Covid-19.“The broad position that emerged was to enable seating of members of Rajya Sabha in the chamber and the galleries of the House in conformity with the norm of physical distancing. And to enable virtual participation of other members from either the Central Hall or Balayogi Auditorium in the Parliament House premises,” said a second official.Naidu, the official added, wants to enable the participation of the members from within the House to the extent possible. The main chamber and the galleries of Rajya Sabha can accommodate 127 members (out of 245) if social distancing norms are adhered to. “All the galleries except the media gallery will be utilised for MPs.

04-07-2020||India||Criminals shoot 8 cops on raid in UP, hack one with axe before killing him||Criminals owing allegiance to a dreaded gangster in Uttar Pradesh sprayed a volley of bullets on a team of policemen who went to raid their village in Kanpur Dehat district on Thursday night, killing eight including a deputy superintendent in a chilling 15-minute ambush, officials said.The killings prompted a massive hunt for 48-year-old Vikas Dubey, a hardened criminal who faces 60 cases and carries a reward of ~25,000, and his group after they escaped Bikru village in the dark. Hours later, security personnel gunned down two people suspected to be from the gang. Operations were underway to apprehend Dubey, who allegedly killed a senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader in 2001.“None of those responsible for this heinous act will be spared, and the sacrifice of the slain policemen will not be allowed to go in vain,” chief minister Yogi Adityanath said, facing criticism from opposition leaders over the law and order situation in the state. Director general of police Hitesh Chandra Awasthi, who visited the ambush site along with other top officials, said the policemen fell victim to a conspiracy. “An earthmover machine was put there deliberately to stop their way and in the darkness; they were attacked. This incident would not have happened without a well-planned conspiracy.”The ambush on the 13-member police team began after they reached Bikru around 1:20am on Friday, a day after Rahul Tiwari, a resident of the village, filed an attempt to murder case against Dubey.Officials found the road leading to Dubey’s fortified one-storey house blocked by an earthmover machine. They got off their vehicles and decided to walk, but criminals began firing at them from the roofs of Dubey’s residence and the houses nearby, according to Dinesh Kumar P, Kanpur senior superintendent of police. The ambush continued for 15 minutes, killing the eight policemen and wounding seven people including a civilian.According to local police officials who did not want to be named, the team came under attack from three sides. Taken by surprise, as they ran for cover, criminals on the ground accosted them and snatched their weapons, they said.The four constables and a sub-inspector took shelter in a small toilet. They were the first to be killed. Devendra Mishra, a deputy superintendent of police and the officer leading the team, tried to hide in a house, which belonged to a relative of Dubey. He was attacked with an axe and then shot dead. Two police sub-inspectors were shot five times, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.By the time a wounded policeman escaped the site and raised an alarm, the criminals — believed to be around 20 in number — escaped, prompting a coordinated search operation involving about 3,000 personnel and the sealing of borders in all six districts in the Kanpur division.“There was retaliatory firing, but criminals were at a height...eight of our men died,” said Jai Narayan Singh, Kanpur additional director general of police (ADG).Around 7am on Friday, the police cornered two people — Dubey’s uncle, Prem Prakash Pandey, and his close aide, Atul Dubey — in the jungles of Kaashi Ram Nivada village, about 3km from Bikru, and shot them dead in a gunfight. Two personnel were wounded and a pistol said to have been looted in Bikru was recovered in this operation. A police spokesperson said the weapons snatched in Bikru included an AK-47 rifle, an INSAS rifle, a Glock pistol and two .9mm pistols.Inspector general (special task force) Amitabh Yash said the weapon used in the initial attack was a rifle seized from Dubey by the police when they arrested him in Lucknow’s Krishna Nagar in 2017, according to news agency PTI. The automatic rifle was released into the custody of someone else by a court, PTI reported. Forensic teams from Kanpur and Lucknow visited the crime scene and collected samples. Late in the evening, police announced a Rs 50,000 reward for information leading to Dubey’s arrest. A first information report (FIR) was filed against Dubey and 20 others.Dubey, whose criminal records date back to 1993, was linked to the killing of BJP leader Santosh Shukla inside a police station in 2001. He was acquitted in the case after witnesses turned hostile. Dubey, a former member of Kanpur Dehat zila panchayat, was last arrested in October 2017 for illegal possession of arms and sent to the Kanpur Dehat district jail. He got bail in May 2019, according to officials working in the case.CM Adityanath visited Kanpur to pay tributes to the slain policemen and offered condolences to their families. “The government will provide an ex-gratia of ~1 crore to the kin of each deceased,” he said, while also promising government job for a member of each of the eight families and pension. Opposition leaders criticised the government over law and order. “Another proof of ‘goonda raj’ in UP. When police are not safe how can the people be?” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted in Hindi.Party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said criminals in the state did not have any fear. “From the common man to policemen, no one is safe,” she added.The Samajwadi Party called Uttar Pradesh “Hatya Pradesh (land of murders)”, where criminals “patronised by those in power” killed policemen. It said this “connection” must be exposed.Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati termed the incident “shameful and unfortunate”.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/criminals-shoot-8-cops-on-raid-in-up-hack-one-with-axe-before-killing-him/story-oMIm1oerNJaFoSlZ1tExnO.html
04-07-2020||India||‘Era of expansionism over’: PM’s warning to China on Ladakh visit||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday declared that the “era of expansionism” is over, sending a strong signal to China about India’s determination to defend its borders, on a surprise unscheduled visit to Ladakh, the theatre of the tension between the neighbours.In a speech to the troops, relayed live on television, the prime minister asserted that India has always wanted peace but this peace will come from strength; and paid glowing tributes to the bravery and courage of soldiers in the frontlines of the stand-off at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), with a particular reference to those who laid down their lives in the Galwan Valley clash on June 15.Analysts described the visit as a clear message to Beijing, and one that would motivate troops.Asserting that all of Ladakh was India’s pride and that people of Ladakh were patriots, and claiming that India had, for centuries, given a strong response to “aggressors” and had emerged stronger after each attack, Modi said that “enemies” had seen both the “fire and fury” of Indian soldiers.The PM also spoke of the raft of decisions that had been taken to strengthen India’s defence apparatus and border infrastructure in recent years; quoted a wide range of Sanskrit, Tamil, and Hindi sayings to convey determination and resolve; and highlighted Buddha’s emphasis on courage as conviction and compassion.Friday’s surprise visit came in the backdrop of the two-month long stand-off at the LAC, where China has attempted to change the status quo by intruding into Indian territory; engaged in a military build-up; and expanded its territorial claims, particularly over the Galwan Valley. India has matched the military build-up with additional deployment of troops and equipment. Three rounds of military-level talks have taken place between the two counties, besides dialogue at the diplomatic-level, but commitments on de-escalation have not yet resulted in tangible action on the ground with Chinese troops staying put.Accompanied by the chief of defence staff Bipin Rawat and army chief Manoj Mukund Naravane, Modi visited Nimu, surrounded by the Zanskar range, where he was briefed by military commanders on the situation. He also interacted with personnel of the army, the Indian Air Force, and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP).HT learns that the decision on Modi’s visit was taken on Thursday evening with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval working out the details with Gen Rawat.PM stressed in his speech, without naming China, that the “era of expansionism is over” and this was the “era of developmentalism”, which is both an opportunity and will serve as the basis of the future.“In centuries gone by, expansionism has tried to destroy humanity. Whenever an expansionist mindset has dominated someone’s worldview, it has posed a threat to world peace. But history is also witness that such powers have got destroyed, or have been forced to mend their ways. This has been the collective global experience. And on the basis of this experience, the world has made up its mind. Today, the world is committed to developmentalism and welcomes competition for development.”Modi has called out expansionism as a threat in the past, but only once before in his official capacity as PM.During an election rally before the 2014 polls, while asserting that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of India, Modi — then a PM candidate — had asked China to leave “its mindset of expansion”. As PM, during a visit to Japan — another country which has faced Chinese aggression in recent years — in 2014, he had warned of the dangers of “18th century style expansionist attitudes” such as encroaching into other countries and intruding into seas. But given the current stand-off with China, his remarks assume renewed importance. They also come in the wake of Chinese projection of power in the South China Sea, East China Sea, and internal moves to push through repressive legislations, for instance in Hong Kong.Shyam Saran, former foreign secretary and senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, said that the PM adopted a “more defiant posture” in his speech. “His remark about this not being an age of expansionism but of development is clearly directed at China though it has not been mentioned by name. This presages a tougher posture towards China and preparedness to confront its challenge for the long haul.”Saran added that this may also reflect the fact that the “diplomatic and military engagement between the two countries” being undertaken to defuse the situation and return to status quo ante may not have made progress so far. “His visit underlines the seriousness of the security threat India faces and conveys a sense of confidence that the country is more than capable of dealing with it.”The PM spoke, repeatedly, of the bravery of Indian soldiers. “Your courage, your bravery, and your commitment to protect the honour of India is incomparable...Till the security of the country is in your hands and strong intentions, not just me, but the whole country has complete faith. The message that you and your brave friends have just given has sent a signal to the whole world about India’s strength.”Modi also visited those injured in the Galwan valley clash in a military hospital during the visit, where he told soldiers engaged in the clash that they gave a “befitting reply” and their valour and the blood they shed would inspire people for a long time to come. The world, he said, was eager to know about the young men, their sacrifice, their training and their excellent level of commitment. “The bravehearts who left us, have not gone without a reason. Together, you all also gave a befitting reply (karara jawab bhi diya hai),” he told the injured soldiers.In his address to the troops, Modi said that India recognised the value of peace and friendship for the progress of both the nation and humanity, but that peace cannot come from weakness. “The weak cannot strive for peace. Strength is a precondition for peace. If India — in land, air, seas, and space — is increasing its strength, the objective is human welfare. India is now producing modern weapons. It is getting modern technologies for the army. The sentiment behind it is the same. If India is building modern infrastructure, the sentiment is the same...we have always worked to defend humanity.”When it came to decisions on national security, Modi said he thought of two mothers — Bharat Mata (Indian motherland) and the mothers of brave soldiers. “On this basis, for your honour, for your family’s honour, and for national honour, the country gives top priority to security.”Commenting on the visit, Lieutenant General (retired) DS Hooda said it was a “clear message to China” that India was taking “very serious note” of what has happened at the LAC and that the continuing stalemate in de-escalation was “unacceptable”. “The PM would also have got a firsthand account of the events that have happened and the operational readiness of the Indian Army. This is absolutely essential when India considers its future options.”Commodore (retired) C Uday Bhaskar, director of the Society for Policy Studies, too said that the speech exuded a “distinctive resolve” in relation to China and the tensions at LAC.“The speech is multi-layered and addresses different constituencies. While the domestic audience comprises the troops in Ladakh and the Indian army in general, it also seeks to assuage national sentiment which is bruised post-Galwan. In relation to China, it is firm about not blinking with the window of peace and diplomacy kept open.” The speech, Bhaskar suggested, marks the “beginning of the reset in India’s China policy”.Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram, in a tweet, asked why the PM had not named China as the aggressor. “For the third time in a week, PM did not name China as the aggressor, why? What is the purpose of talking about an unnamed ‘enemy’ to the people of India and the jawans in Ladakh?”“PM has still not answered our questions about where the violent clashes took place on June 15-16 between Chinese and Indian troops and if the Chinese have intruded into Indian territory at several points,” the former Union minister added.BJP president JP Nadda said the PM’s speech will act as a morale booster for the forces. He tweeted: “Hon PM @narendramodi’s words give words to the emotion of 130 crore Indians and acts a great morale booster for our armed forces! True leadership in action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/era-of-expansionism-over-pm-s-warning-to-china-on-ladakh-visit/story-TkzT7OPD2wxW53EjUR63pO.html
04-07-2020||India||Kanpur incident: A 15-minute nightmare in Uttar Pradesh||The criminal records of Vikas Dubey, one of the most dreaded gangsters in Uttar Pradesh, date back to 1993, according to a senior police official at the DGP headquarters in Lucknow. At 48, he faces 60 criminal cases.“His crime record reads that he has had over 11 cases of attempt to murder and six cases of murder,” the official said.He said Dubey, born in Bikru village of Kanpur Dehat district, was popular among criminals in the region who believed police could not act against them if they were under his protection. “He recruited youngsters, invested on them by giving them a monthly payment and pushed them into crime...”Dubey was an accused in the 2001 murder of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Santosh Shukla inside a police station. “He was acquitted in the case after all witnesses, including police personnel, turned hostile during the court trial due to his fear,” the official said.He said Dubey’s name terrorised people in Shivli, a town near Bikru, and the region around Kanpur after four sensational murders — that of Shukla, a college principal, and a cable operator and his cousin between 2000 and 2002. Dubey was arrested a couple of times in the past two years, but got bail. Also read| ‘Won’t be spared’: Yogi Adityanath takes a vow to nab Kanpur gangstersThe official said Dubey’s clout increased so much in the region that he won the election of Zila Panchayat member in 2005 as an Independent while he was in the Kanpur jail.After Thursday’s ambush, about 3,000 members were combing several districts to arrest Dubey, whose accomplices shot dead eight policemen in Bikru before escaping in the dark. The operation was being led by director general of police (DGP) HC Awasthy; additional DGP (law and order) Prashant Kumar; and UP special task force (STF) inspector general (IG) Amitabh Yash. The police sealed borders of all six districts in the Kanpur region, namely Kanpur, Kanpur Dehat, Auraiya, Kannauj, Etawah and Farrukhabad. Additional DGP Kumar said the attack was the deadliest targeting the police force in “many years”. In 2007, dacoit Ambika Prasad, alias Thokia, killed six policemen and an informer in Chitrakoot to avenge the death of brigand Shiv Kumar Dadua.

The police said Dubey’s house was found locked, and his wife and two children, who lived there, were missing. The house was later sealed.Deepak Kumar Singh, assistant commissioner of police (ACP) of Sarojininagar, said a police team visited Dubey’s brother’s residence in the same locality, but he was not at home.“...I knew that one day the entire family would have to suffer for the wrongdoings of Vikas,” Sarla Devi, 73, who stays with Dubey’s younger brother, told reporters outside her residence. She said she would have no regrets if Dubey was gunned down. Devi said Dubey’s relationship with the family was under strain, and added that Dubey did not come to Lucknow since the Covid-19 lockdown was imposed in March-end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-15-minute-nightmare-in-up/story-Flpey5Ez23tWhqLt39edGI.html
04-07-2020||India||NIA terms Chhattisgarh police move illegal in Jheerum Ghati case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) was planning a “major action”, including choking funding to top Maoist leadership, as part of an ongoing legal process when the Chhattisgarh government in May claimed jurisdiction in the probe into the 2013 Jheerum Ghati attack in which top leaders of the Congress (then the party in power in the state) were among 27 killed, the anti-terror agency’s officials familiar with the matter said. Former Union minister Vidya Charan Shukla was among those killed when Maoists ambushed a convoy of Congress leaders in Jheerum Ghati. NIA took over the probe into the case two days after the attack . The officials said the state government’s move has put the brakes on NIA’s probe . They added the issue can be resolved when the Chhattisgarh police stops the parallel investigation. NIA has called the Chhattisgarh police’s refusal to hand over a new First Information Report (FIR) registered in the case in May to the federal agency “illegal”. The two sides are staring at a long legal battle over the issue.The agency has told a Jabalpur NIA court that a charge sheet was filed in the case against nine people in September 2014 and has sought directions to the Chhattisgarh police to hand over the new FIR. It has said a trial was going on and 45 prosecution witnesses have been examined since a supplementary charge sheet was filed against 30 people in September 2015.NIA has told the court about searches at residential premises of 25 accused with the help of local police and the Central Reserve Police Force. HT has seen the court documents. The officials cited above said that they are working on taking the action against Tippiri Tirupati alias Devji, a Central Committee member of the Maoists and in charge of the South Regional Unified Command, Paka Hanumanthu alias Ganesh Uwike, head of ther South Regional Unified Committee, Soma Sodhi, secretary, Darbha Division, and Barse Sukka alias Deva, absconding since planning the attack.An NIA official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the agency named all main perpetrators in the two charge sheets and efforts were going on to arrest them. “We have information about their properties and their activities; our probe is in an advanced stage and we announced rewards on all absconding persons. It is a massive investigation which takes time and evidence. Our investigations are not on the basis of hearsay. The Chhattisgarh police’s FIR has no legal basis. They should handover the FIR to us,” the official said.The agency told the court the Chhattisgarh police were violating the NIA Act’s Section 6 by not handing over the FIR. The section prohibits state governments from proceeding with investigations into cases entrusted to NIA.Chhattisgarh police inspector general (Bastar) P Sundarraj said the police have registered the case on the basis of a complaint from a local resident and they will be investigating it. “We have already submitted our view in the court,” added Sundarraj.Jitendra Mudaliyar, the son of Congress leader Uday Mudaliyar, who was killed in the attack, filed the fresh FIR in May.The state government has maintained NIA did not probe the conspiracy angle to the attack in which almost the entire state Congress leadership was wiped out. The Congress returned to power in Chhattisgarh in December 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-terms-chhattisgarh-police-move-illegal-in-jheerum-ghati-case/story-21BuJlJ7qEF3U0K2w7zKlO.html
04-07-2020||India||India to follow UN court order in Italian Marines case, Supreme Court told||The Centre has asked the Supreme Court to dispose of the proceedings related to the 2012 killing of two Indian fishermen by Italian marines off the Kerala coast, saying it has agreed to accept a UN tribunal’s ruling in this regard.The five-member arbitral tribunal under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea has ruled India is entitled to compensation in the case but said the marines are entitled to immunity and that India is “precluded from exercising its jurisdiction”.The marines, Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, moved the Supreme Court against a May 2012 judgment of the Kerala high court, which held the state government had the jurisdiction to try them. The high court ruled the marines enjoyed no state immunity since their act of shooting at the fishermen, Ajesh Binki and Valentine Jalastine, was neither in the defence of the vessel nor the state.The matter is pending before the Supreme Court, which granted the marines conditional bail and allowed them to return to Italy in 2016.The marines were guarding an oil tanker when they killed the two Indians on a fishing boat and took India-Italy ties to an all-time low. Also read| Kerala not in favour of withdrawing the case against Italian marines: CM Vijayan“The Republic of India has taken a decision to accept and abide by the award passed by the Tribunal which would have the bearing on the continuance of present proceedings before this Hon’ble Court. The applicant [central government) is, therefore, placing the award on record with a prayer that the proceedings with regard to the incident dated February 15, 2012, be disposed of in conformity with the Award passed by the Tribunal,” the Centre said in its plea on Thursday.The tribunal’s ruling was uploaded online on Thursday. It said the marines enjoyed immunity since they were exercising official functions in their capacity as Italian state officials when the incident occurred. The tribunal, therefore, ordered India to stop criminal proceedings against them.The tribunal said Italy violated India’s right to navigation by firing at the fishing boat St Antony and will have to compensate for the loss of life and damage to property. “The Parties are invited to consult with each other with a view to reaching agreement on the amount of compensation due to India,” the order said.The row over the killing of the fishermen disrupted bilateral ties for years.

04-07-2020||India||Nagaland govt bans import, trade and sale of dog meat||Nagaland government on Friday banned import, trading and sale of dog meat in the state. The move follows a similar decision taken by Mizoram government in March this year. “The state government has decided to ban commercial import and trading of dogs and dog markets and also the sale of dog meat, both cooked and uncooked,” Nagaland chief secretary Temjen Toy tweeted after the decision was taken at a cabinet meeting. While there was not much clarity on what prompted the decision, there has been a recent online campaign against sale of dogs and dog meat in Nagaland by several organizations including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisation (FIAPO).“We are again hit by shock and horror at recent images that have emerged from ‘animal bazaar’ markets in Dimapur (Nagaland) where dogs are seen in terrified conditions, tied up in sacks (gunny bags), waiting at a wet market, for their illegal slaughter, trade and consumption as meat,” FAIPO had said in an appeal to Nagaland government on July 2 urging it to put a ban.In a statement issued on Friday, Humane Society International and People For Animals, two other organisations demanding end to dog meat sale in Nagaland, welcomed the Nagaland government move as a ‘major turning point’ to end cruelty against dogs.“The decision by the cabinet will end the import, trade and sale of live dogs and dog meat. We welcome this decision as a major turning point in ending cruelty of India’s hidden dog meat trade,” the statement read.According to HSI and PFA estimates around 30,000 dogs are smuggled annually to Nagaland where they are sold in live markets and “beaten to death with wooden clubs”.Dog meat is consumed by some sections of Nagaland population. Stray dogs caught from neighbouring states and even West Bengal, are routinely smuggled to the state for sale as meat in Dimapur, the commercial hub of Nagaland, and other places. Since the trade is unregulated, there is no detail on how much dog meat is consumed annually in the state. “This is a progressive move. In today age, positive social media activism and advocacy has enormous impact on policy makers. Congrats and thanks to all,” Abu Metha, advisor to Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio, tweeted. The government decision, however, has met with some opposition by civil society groups and eminent persons who termed the move as an infringement on food habits. “Government may have some reasons on why they decided to impose the ban. But it will have an impact on food habit as dog meat is consumed by common people. I have no idea how government will restrict food habits and implement the ban,” said Theja Therieh, secretary, Naga Tribes Council. “I am a dog lover and don’t consume dog meat. But consumption of dog meat has been part of our culture, so instead of taking a hurried decision based on a campaign, mostly from outside the state, the government could have talked to stakeholders first,” said popular musician Alobo Naga. In March, the Mizoram assembly passed the Animal Slaughter Bill, 2020 removing dogs from the list of animals suitable for slaughter, effectively imposing a ban on sale and purchase of dog meat in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-govt-bans-import-trade-and-sale-of-dog-meat/story-0cVivTmo8dt91fynaqTSVM.html
04-07-2020||India||PM Oli’s policies among reasons for hold-up in key Nepal study||Nepalese Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli’s anti-India policies are among the reasons why an Eminent Persons Group formed in 2016 to revisit the 1950 Nepal-India Treaty of Peace and Friendship is yet to submit its report to the governments of the two countries despite it being ready almost two years ago, peoplefamiliar with the matter said. The group was formed following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with Oli in 2016 to suggest ways for consolidating and transforming the India-Nepal relationship. The treaty is the basis of the free cross-border movement between the two countries as well as their collaboration including on matters of defence.Also read: Under pressure to resign, PM Oli cabinet prorogues parliament’s budget session“It [the report] was supposed to be submitted to PM Modi first [in 2018] and then to the Nepalese side. But there were too many issues that cropped up,” said a government functionary who spoke on condition of anonymity. A second person aware of the matter said, also on condition of anonymity, that the group suggested a revision of the treaty “in line with the changed context” and with more focus on “the social and cultural linkages”.Oli on Sunday accused India of conspiring to topple him for publishing Nepal’s new map that depicts Lipulekh, Kalapani, and Limpiyadhura (all part of India’s Uttarakhand)as part of the Nepalese territory. The map has triggered tensions between the two countries with India calling the move an “artificial enlargement of territorial claims”. India has maintained the onus was on Nepal to create a positive atmosphere for talks to resolve the border row.Oli’s accusation came amid factional rivalry within the ruling Nepal Communist Party.Asked whether the group had specific recommendations about the border issue, the second person said the group’s mandate did not cover it. “ The idea was to ensure that the borders are open, allowing for more people-to-people contact. The idea was to insulate ties from political vicissitudes.”Also read: Imran Khan to join Xi Jinping to shore up Nepal’s PM Oli against IndiaJawaharlal Nehru University professor Mahendra P Lama, who was a member of the group, said the recommendations in the report were arrived at through consensus and there was no controversy. “The report addresses the aspirations of both the nations and covered a gamut of aspects such as cross open border engagement, trade, transit, investment, climate change, natural resources, culture, institutions, financial cooperation, national security, migration, trafficking, water, energy, and even a pandemic situation,” he said. “It all aimed at consolidating and transforming the relationship to suit the requirements for the 21st century.” Lama confirmed the report was finalised in July 2018.The other members of the group from India included former Uttarakhand chief minister Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who is now the Maharashtra governor, former ambassador Jayant Prasad, and the late B C Upreti, who was then a senior fellow with think-tank Vivekananda Foundation.Members from Nepal include Thapa, Nilambar Acharya, Suryanath Upadhyay and Rajan Bhattarai. V K Singh, the then minister of state for external affairs, told Parliament in July 2018 that the group was yet to submit its report to the two governments. He added it was to submit its recommendations at the end of its two-year term. Singh said the group had held nine meetings since July 2016 and last met in Kathmandu in June 2018. Singh’s successor, V Muraleedharan, echoed the former in Parliament in December 2019.The external affairs ministry did not respond to questions on the status of the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oli-s-policies-among-reasons-for-hold-up-in-key-nepal-study/story-e7QRlFyUqIrPaFGfCqp3gM.html
04-07-2020||India||JEE, NEET postponed again till September in wake of Covid-19||The HRD ministry on Friday postponed the medical entrance examination NEET and the engineering entrance test to September after an expert committee felt it was not feasible to hold these competitive exams amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “Keeping in mind the safety of students and to ensure quality education we have decided to postpone the JEE and NEET examinations. The JEE-Main examination will be held between September 1 and 6, while the JEE-Advanced exam will be held on September 27. The NEET examination will be held on September 13,” said Union HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’.Following the announcement of a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, the competitive exams for engineering and medical admissions were first postponed on May 5. The medical entrance exam National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) was scheduled for July 26, while the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE)-Mains for admission to engineering colleges was to be held from July 18-23.The JEE-Advanced, conducted for admission to Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), was earlier scheduled for August 23.Parents and students have been signing online petitions and conducting social media campaigns, requesting the government to postpone the engineering and medical entrance exams as well. Parents of nearly 4,000 NRI students based in West Asia also filed a petition in the Supreme Court Wednesday demanding that NEET be postponement. Around nine lakh aspirants have registered for the JEE (main) exam, while 16 lakhs have registered for the NEET-Undergraduate exams. Raising concern over the worsening of the pandemic, candidates across the country have been demanding the postponement of the exams.According to HRD Ministry officials, the committee, headed by National Testing Agency (NTA) chief Vineet Joshi felt that delaying the exams was inevitable since many test centres were located in containment zones.The delay, however, is likely to impact the academic calendar. According to sources, the counselling for the two crucial exams will begin in October and freshers may begin classes by November end or December first week. However, a definite plan has not been drawn yet.Significantly, the move comes at a time when the HRD ministry is already deliberating moving the entire academic year further.

The agency, however, confirmed it had on June 28 been the target of ransomware — a type of cyber attack carried out usually by groups looking to make money.Details about the leak were shared with HT by Singapore-based cybersecurity firm Cyfirma, which said in its initial assessment that “the data compromised includes tax information, audit reports, passport copies, identity cards, assessment reports, and many other PII (personally identifiable information) and financial records”.The data was in two files about 1.8GB in size, which the hackers said was 5% of the total information they had. The files, seen by HT, included copies of personal identity documents of a former NHAI chairman Raghav Chandra, included his passport and government ID card.According to Cyfirma’s assessment, the hackers used the Maze ransomware, and the leaks may have been meant to force the NHAI to pay a ransom in order to stop more data from being exposed. “This is how Maze hackers work. They release in batches as they attempt to extort their victims,” said Kumar Ritesh, CEO of Cyfirma, in an email to HT.HT reported the breach on June 29, and NHAI officials at the time denied losing any data. On Thursday, representatives of the agency declined to comment on questions about the new disclosure or if they were negotiating with the hackers.“As NHAI is going digital, it is advancing its security posture further by adopting world’s best cyber security measures at all levels. It is also adopting more proactive measures towards improving the end users IT skills too by adopting tool based user awareness training where user’s IT skill improvement can be monitored and measured,” said Akhilesh Srivastava, chief general manager (IT), of NHAI in response to the questions sent by HT.Chandra, who retired in 2018, said he did not think the leak of his personal data would be a security risk. “I don’t think anyone should be in a position to blackmail. But we need to find out the source of the attack. Tendering documents are slightly of vulnerable nature, the process is sacrosanct... NHAI needs to ensure it builds a strong security system to be able to thwart such attacks”.NHAI “should ensure such malware attacks don’t happen in the future given the question of our national image especially in the light of what is happening politically”, the former chairman said.While it was not clear how much ransom may have been sought by the hackers, Ritesh said that typically, “Maze hackers are known to ask in excess of hundreds of thousands of dollars to millions”.Cybersecurity research agencies have not yet indicted any particular group for using Maze, but, according to Ritesh, the techniques overlap with groups based in Russia, China as well as North Korea.“As of now our attribution shows Russian hackers are behind Maze but this is quickly evolving and same techniques are being used by Chinese and Korea cyber criminals groups,” he said.NHAI is responsible for building and maintaining the country’s highways. The agency manages contracts worth millions of rupees in a year, and its network systems are used for sensitive data, including toll management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hackers-post-nhai-data-online-say-there-s-more/story-3UGZ79xViYGogEaolSt5PP.html
04-07-2020||India||GST regime may undergo 2 major reforms this year||The Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime is expected to see two major reforms in its fourth year--rationalisation of tax rates based on prudence rather than political considerations, and further easing of compliance--people aware of the matter said.The people said three-slab GST rates instead of four could be considered--8%, 18%, and 28% in place of current slabs of 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%. They said the GST Council is also considering correcting duty distortions for sectors like textile, furniture, and fertiliser, where taxes on inputs are more than the finished goods.Also read: Late fee for monthly GST returns capped till July at Rs 500“Both the reduction in tax slabs and correction of inverted duty structure would lead to both increase and decrease in tax rates of some items. As the economy is still recovering from nationwide lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, the council may take a decision on rate rationalisation at an appropriate time so that both businesses and consumers would not be adversely affected. But ease of compliance is an ongoing process and it would continue,” one of the persons said on condition of anonymity.GST was launched in 2017 as India’s biggest-ever tax reform to replace more than a dozen federal and state levies. Officials said it has evolved and stabilised with a robust system and that 10 million GST returns are filed and almost Rs 1 trillion crore collected monthly. They added now the time has come to finetune it and make it more efficient so that tax collection increases and the system is more accessible for taxpayers.“The matters will, however, be decided by the GST Council,” the person said.The Union finance minister-led GST Council is an apex federal body that decides all matters related to the indirect tax. State finance ministers are the council’s members and its decisions have conventionally been unanimous.Experts, businesses, and some council members have said GST appeared to be complicated for the taxpayers even three years after it was introduced. West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra on Wednesday told CNBC TV18 that it was difficult for a common businessman to comply with GST as about 140 circulars and 165 forms related to it have been issued in three years. He added in effect they have 24 returns to fill. Mitra’s comments coincided with GST’s third anniversary.A second person cited above said the indirect tax reform was massive that brought uniform structure after merging a plethora of local levies. “In itself, it is the ease of compliance for taxpayers. Yes, it is a dynamic system that is constantly improving. Therefore, [there is a] need to issue circulars, which are issued as per the direction of the GST council. Hence, no state member should say that the decision was imposed on them,” the person aware of the council’s decisions said, requesting anonymity.Also read: PMI, GST data indicate economic recovery“In fact, everything pertaining to GST is an outcome of collective decisions. Therefore, the responsibilities are also shared. Even West Bengal has issued 127 circulars. In one of the meetings of the council, it was decided that states will also issue circulars similar to the Centre. So whenever a circular is issued, the Centre shares it with them.”The finance ministry did not respond to queries related to the matter.Commenting on the third anniversary of GST, Abhishek Jain, a tax partner at consultancy firm EY India, said the government has achieved two basic objectives--uniformity and elimination of cascading impact of taxes.Mahesh Jaising, a partner at Deloitte India, said, “Starting with the fourth year of GST, the regime now embarks on the next phase of maturity. The largely faceless, contactless, and cashless indirect tax regime has been a classic example of how technology-driven policy or system makes a regime effective and efficient,” said Jaising.“It is paramount that a more simplified assessment and audit framework emerges, as we move to the phase of tax audits by tax authorities. We expect a finer relook into the categorisation of commodities and GST rate rationalisation to meet the challenges arising out of the new economic order or say, the new normal,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-regime-may-undergo-2-major-reforms-this-year/story-6T1vs7DSWJs6X1HsdZEqNM.html
04-07-2020||India||Congress writes to EC, objects to provision of postal ballots||The Congress on Friday alleged that the government had not consulted any political parties, other than the ruling party, to amend the poll conduct rules ahead of the Bihar election. The ministry of law and justice amended the conduct rules on June 19, on the recommendation of the Election Commission (EC), to allow senior citizens over the age of 65 to vote using postal ballots in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.“The manner in which this decision has been taken demonstrates a complete non-application of mind and a shocking circumvention of any consultation process with the key stakeholders (i.e; any other political parties other than the ruling regime). Even upon a cursory examination, the numerous legal deficiencies in this decision become apparent,” the party said in its representation. The move comes after CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury had said that extending the postal ballot would give the ruling party an edge. The EC had responded to Yechury on Wednesday, stating that the chief electoral officer of Bihar had held consultations with various political parties before the decision was taken.Senior leaders Ahmed Patel, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Kapil Sibal, KC Venugopal and Randeep Surjewala submitted the Congress representation. They have asked the EC to invoke its powers under Article 324 of the Constitution of India to withdraw the amendment. The party has argued that the government has “failed to consider” that the allowing the exercise of postal ballot will violate the basic tenet of secrecy of the vote, increase the risk of Covid-19 transmission and expose voters to administrative influence. “This Commission has lent its support to an amendment which exposes a high percentage of voters to organized administrative influence or influence by the Government or the ruling party or their agents or any number of individuals who shall be able to identify these individuals in advance (with ease) and influence how they vote without the protection of the secret ballot. Endangering the integrity of the voting process and undermining its sanctity in this fashion on a potentially massive scale is simply unacceptable,” states the representation. EC officials told Hindustan Times that they had heard the party representation with an “open mind” and will consider their representation. “Everyone is entitled to a viewpoint,” an official said on the condition of anonymity. “State and district-level talks were held before the decision was taken. This is an enabling provision.”The official further added that same practice had been tested in the Jharkhand and Delhi elections. “No one opposed it, why now,” said the official. Former chief election commissioner Vikram Sampath countered the Congress claim that extending the postal ballot will compromise the secrecy of the vote. “The Commission will take adequate precautions to maintain the sanctity of the election,” he told HT. “There is nothing to fear.”Sampath added that the EC visits a state that is going to polls three to four times before the elections are conducted. “They take the feedback of the political parties and only then issue any directives. No decision is taken arbitrarily.” BJP spokesperson Sanjay Mayukh said, “The Congress has a habit of complaining. The EC is an independent body, they know what they are doing. The people of this country who have voted for Narendra Modi also have an independent view and have made an informed choice. Will the Congress complain against them too?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-writes-to-ec-objects-to-provision-of-postal-ballots/story-b1TnArHvT2zvz4iOrEp8YM.html
04-07-2020||India||Covid-19: Tamil Nadu becomes 2nd state to cross 100,000-mark||Tamil Nadu on Friday became the second state in India to cross one lakh cases, with a total of 102,721 people infected with Covid-19 disease in the state where five districts, including Chennai, are under an intense lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. However its high case load must be seen in relation to another important figure: its testing numbers. As of Friday, a total of 1.27 million people have been tested in 91 testing facilities, which is the highest in the country in absolute numbers. Between June 19 and June 30, when the state announced a hard lockdown in Chennai, Kancheepuram, Thiruvallur, and Chengalpattu (Madurai was put under lockdown on June 23, and the lockdown was extended to July 5 earlier this week), 327,214 people were tested across the state. Since June 20, there has been a spike in testing, with over 30,000 people tested everyday on average.Health department officials say that high caseload shouldn’t scare people as it is a result of Tamil Nadu’s strategy of “aggressive and increased testing” and that the state’s focus is to reduce its fatalities. The state has a case fatality rate of 1.3%, which is low when compared to the national average of 2.9%. Experts said the high numbers can also be attributed to the movement of people across the state post Unlock 1 which started on June 8. Also read: Delhi logs 2,520 fresh Covid-19 cases, capital’s count swells to 94,695“We have a free hand in high testing which we will continue and allow cases to come down organically,” TN health secretary J Radhakrishnan told Hindustan Times. “Even if a person has a single symptom of fever, sore throat, cough or body pain, they can get tested now.”The state government initially announced a 12-day intense lockdown in Chennai and three of its adjoining districts from June 19 allowing people to commute for only medical emergencies, airports, train stations and walk for essentials like groceries. On June 23, Madurai district also came under a lockdown to arrest the spike in cases in the district. On Monday, Tamil Nadu extended the lockdown, even though the expert health panel appointed to advice it in dealing with the pandemic felt that improved public health measures were the need of the hour rather than a lockdown.However, the state felt that the lockdown was warranted, as officials found that even symptomatic people were avoiding getting tested because they didn’t want to be in quarantine. Besides this, people were also not following norms of social distancing or wearing masks while in public. The intense lockdown was meant to address all of this. “Because of less movement we are able to identify people and test the same day very close to their homes through mobile and static sample testing facilities. Earlier they had to wait for 2-3 days to be tested even if they had symptoms,” Radhakrishnan said. Experts agree that Tamil Nadu was able to scale up testing – it had started sending samples to the National Institute of Virology in Pune in March itself -- owing to a robust public health infrastructure that had been in the making since the AIDS epidemic, and the H1N1 outbreak in 2010, when Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing facilities, widely used to test Covid-19 samples, came up across several districts. Chennai with 64,689 cases accounting for 62.9% of the total case load in the state had scaled up testing to 10,000 per day during the most recent lockdown period. Though the state health department hasn’t shared district-wise testing data, health officials said that Chennai was testing in the range of 3,000 to 5,000 people per day in May and June respectively.Also read: Coming soon, women cops on bikes across Kerala on Covid-19 dutyThe Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) increased fever camps from 300 in May to 520 camps currently across Chennai’s 200 wards. Between May 8 and July 2, a total of 29, 051 swabs haven taken at these fever camps and 33,090 people with detected with influenza like illness (ILI) symptoms. In June, the GCC also recruited over 4000 volunteers, called Friend of Covid Person Under Surveillance (FOCUS), to assist the existing Covid-19 network of health workers. The job of the volunteers was two-fold: watching families under home quarantine, and helping them with essential services. These volunteers are paid Rs 500 a day and have been recruited till September.The civic body came up with a new strategy pegged on home quarantining even those who were likely to be infected to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease. Called the home quarantine and isolation monitoring system (HQIMS), it focused on 18 categories of people include those awaiting Covid-19 test results, positive patients undergoing home treatment, discharged patients, international and domestic passengers coming via flights, trains, road or sea, family and extended contacts, and people with influenza-like illness.Most people in these categories were already mandated to be in 14-day isolation, but the strategy widened the net on who must undergo isolation.This new system was developed to keep up with the evolving situation of the pandemic. “In April, all positive patients were treated at the hospital. The concept of home quarantine for treatment progressed at a later stage,” GCC deputy commissioner for revenue and finance, Meghanathan Reddy who is overseeing this project, told HT.Surveyors had already been going door-to-door checking people for symptoms since May and during the lockdown they were armed with thermal scanners. Anyone with fever, cough or any other symptoms, would be asked to visit the nearest fever camp. “We are in a better position now in terms of testing and surveillance compared to April. Corporation has also home quarantined a large number of people who are likely to infect others. All these measures and the current lockdown has reduced transmission in Chennai. We can reassess that in two weeks. But when we open up again transmission will increase which we can manage through mask compliance and continue surveillance, testing and isolation,” a member of the expert panel said on condition of anonymity, adding that specific restrictions like suspending public transport and large gatherings in Chennai and other districts, should continue after the lockdown is lifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-becomes-2nd-state-to-cross-100-000-mark/story-NwwtyMPtjvnPN4wvewOCtN.html
04-07-2020||India||HT Salutes: UP’s trio that gives dignity to dead||At a time when the country was grappling with deaths caused due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a poet, a social worker and a state government employee based in Lucknow have been helping the underprivileged in a manner that no one else has.Between March and June, the trio cremated 15 unclaimed bodies in Bhaisakund crematorium, the largest of the three crematoriums in the city which handled close to 800 bodies a month in pre-pandemic times. The city has 23 shelters for homeless people, but government estimates put the number of street dwellers at 3000. Unclaimed bodies – usually of street and pavement dwellers, whose families cannot be traced – are routinely cremated here, said Surya Vikram Singh, incharge of electric crematorium in Lucknow Municipal Corporation. Between March and May, 161 such bodies were cremated. For Verma, 45, a published poet, and her partners, Deepak Mahajan, 60, a clerk in the rural engineering department, and Mohammad Azhar Hussain, 26, a social worker, this work isn’t new. They have been working with the underprivileged in the city since 2018, and helping the police cremate unclaimed bodies. However, during Covid, their work became all the more significant. Special guidelines on the handling bodies of infected persons during the pandemic were issued by the Centre even as instances reports of families refusing to accept bodies of their kin, and communities refusing to allow burial of bodies in neighbourhoods emerged from around the country. And though the Uttar Pradesh state government has not issued specific guidelines on cremating uninfected persons -- the trio only cremates such bodies -- Verma ensures that they all wear personal protective gear like masks and gloves. “I decided to continue doing this work at a time when no one wanted to touch those bodies fearing the spread of coronavirus,” Verma said. “I used to see a lot of [homeless] people suffering. If they fell ill, there was no one to take care of them. [The three of us] decided to work for those who often end up dying on the road in the absence of proper medical care,” she said. All unclaimed bodies are usually sent to a mortuary for post-mortem before cremation, chief medical superintendent of Civil Hospital Ashutosh Dubey said. “Versha is known for her work of bringing the underprivileged to the hospital for treatment. It’s the duty of police to cremate such bodies but sometimes they call Versha when they are busy.”Police inspectors Kuldeep Singh and Raj Bahadur, who are attached to the mortuary of the government-run KGMU hospital said that they often call upon Verma when their workload is high.“We started cremating bodies of deprived about two and half years ago. We are in constant touch with police, and ask them to let us know when we can help,” Verma said.Shraddha Saxena, chairperson Ansh Welfare Foundation and a well-known social worker in the city said, “When cremated by police, the bodies are usually taken in an open rickshaw packed in a cloth, but people like Versha arrange for a bus and bring the body to the crematorium with respect.”Mahajan pointed out that they do the work using the funds of the Divya Sewa Foundation, which they set up to do social work, in 2017.Since Bhaisakund is located on riverfront of Gomti, Verma and her colleagues immerse the ashes of the bodies they cremate.“I feel satisfied when I respectfully perform the cremation and immerse the ashes in Gomti, I don’t want anything in return, I just want eternal peace and calm [for them],” Verma said.Verma’s husband, Rakesh is an engineer in state public works department. He recalls feeling fearful when Verma continued to do her work during the lockdown as well. “I was worried about her health especially when it comes to handling of bodies.”.Verma is a role model for her 14-year-old daughter, Nandini, who wants to grow up to be just like her mother: a social worker.Hindustan Times and Facebook have partnered to bring you 15 stories of HT Salutes.

04-07-2020||India||First House panel to discuss preparedness to tackle Covid-19||The Jairam Ramesh-led science and technology committee will be the first parliamentary panel to debate India’s preparedness to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, when it meets on July 10. In its first meeting after the pandemic emerged, the standing committee will discuss the broad topic of “Preparedness to deal with Covid and other pandemic in future”. While the panel will briefly look back at how the country has tackled the disease, primarily to draw important lessons, “we will also look at the post-Covid situation as well (future) preparedness for such pandemics,” said a member of the panel who asked not to be named. The focus will sharply remain on boosting India’s research and technological capabilities to fight pandemics.After the budget session of Parliament abruptly came to an end on March 23, no department-related standing committee has met due to lockdown restrictions. India imposed a 68-day lockdown, in four phases , starting March 25. It ended on May 31. Some panels have consulted members through email for presenting reports and a few committee meetings have been scheduled in the next few days but their agenda is not directly related to Covid.The science and technology panel will look into various aspects related to the pandemic. “It will take an overall look at the country’s capabilities to tackle a pandemic which will also include the research on vaccine and production of personal protection equipment,” said the member cited above. The panel may also stress on the need to strengthen India’s vaccine programme so that the country might be in a better position if a new virus arrives at Indian shores.The panel will not focus so much on health, said the member, because Parliament has a separate committee on health affairs.Meanwhile, the Lok Sabha secretariat issued guidelines for committee meetings on Friday that said not more than five officials should be called for deposition and if more officers come, they will have to sit outside and wait for their turn. There will not be any verbatim reporting service and no papers will be circulated physically. The members have also been advised to use hand sanitizer and adhere to social distancing norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-house-panel-to-discuss-preparedness/story-eBfTFisyhLb09bt90qCoIO.html
04-07-2020||India||ICMR sets August 15 deadline for world’s 1st Covid-19 vaccine||India’s topmost medical research body ICMR said on Friday that it is attempting to launch the world’s first Covid-19 vaccine on August 15, triggering disbelief among scientists who say the process requires painstaking trials and analysis and cannot reliably be completed in the six weeks that remain for the deadline. The plan was disclosed in a letter by the Indian Council of Medical Research to 12 institutes where human trials are to be held for the vaccine, Covaxin, ordering them to secure necessary approvals from internal committees by July 7 with a warning that “non-compliance will be viewed very seriously”.The vaccine has been jointly developed by ICMR and Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech (BBIL), with the latter itself previously indicating that a vaccine could take more time. In an interview to The New Indian Express on Wednesday, Bharat Biotech chairman and managing director Krishna Ella said that if clinical trials of Covaxin met safety and efficacy standards, the vaccine could be available for mass use by early 2021. Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayBut ICMR has other plans as evident in the do-or-die tone of its letter. “It is envisaged to launch the vaccine for public health use latest by 15th August 2020 after completion of all clinical trials. BBIL is working expeditiously to meet the target, however final outcome will depend on the cooperation of all clinical trial sites involved in this project,” said the letter signed by Balram Bhargava, the director-general of ICMR. Clinical trials include a clutch of tightly monitored inoculation among sets of volunteers to test whether a vaccine is safe and works – a process that on average has taken over 10 years. In a pandemic, this timeline can be compressed, but most experts believe that is still likely to take 12-18 months – making India’s plans on Covaxin scientifically implausible.“I would have understood if the company had made such claims but DG-ICMR making this unscientific claim doesn’t make sense. Anyone who has even basic knowledge of how clinical trials work, would know this is completely unscientific,” said an official at one of the institutes selected for the process, asking not to be named.Criticised for setting an unreasonable deadline that would affect safety, efficacy and quality, ICMR later suggested that it was only making an effort to put out trial data by August 15. “Request has been made to fast track the vaccine trials,” said Dr Rajnikant Srivastava, spokesperson, ICMR, in a text message. No order was issued.Experts pointed out that even this objective seemed improbable for the August 15 deadline. “Developing an effective vaccine is a time-consuming process. Recruitment of participants in itself can take months even if we try to expedite everything like we are doing for Covid-19. Each of the phases — one, two and three — should take at least a few months as it is not just one centre but multiple centres that are involved in conducting trials to determine safety and efficacy of a vaccine,” said Anant Bhan, a researcher in bioethics and global health.“In one month, it is possible to determine immediate safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a candidate vaccine. This is sufficient to determine whether the approach has some promise or not. However, promising at this stage means just that, not effectiveness in preventing infections,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, CSIR- Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Delhi.Covaxin is yet to enter the clinical trials phase, a stage that 18 vaccine candidates across the world have already raced to. The earliest any of these expect to determine safety and efficacy is not until second quarter of next year.Also read: Delhi logs 2,520 fresh Covid-19 cases, capital’s count swells to 94,695ICMR’s position also surprised experts because data about the vaccine’s preclinical performance has not been made public yet. “It is very ambitious and probably unprecedented. You can’t rush science. It is one thing to do something and another to do it properly. It is not possible to do it properly in such a short span of time,” Bhan said. One expert said while it usually takes four to five years, human trials can be finished in a year in the case of Covid-19. “Normally for phase 1, 2 and 3 human trials, it takes about four to five years, but this is an unprecedented situation where everyone is talking Covid so the process can be finished in about a year,” said Dr NK Mehra, ICMR chair and former head, transplants immunology and immunogenetics department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIIMS).Another doctor at AIIMS, which is one of the institutes were the trials will be held, said: “We are waiting for the ethics committee clearance and unless I get that I cannot comment on that. I don’t know how much time it will take for the approvals; could be 15 days or probably a month. I can’t say,” said Dr Sanjay Rai, professor, community medicine department, and one of the trial conductors.Bharat Biotech is among seven Indian firms working on Covid-19 vaccines. It was the first to get the regulatory nod to begin phase 1 and phase 2 human trials on Monday.A Bharat Biotech spokesperson declined to comment on the letter, but said pre-clinical studies of the vaccine showed “extensive safety and effective immune responses”..The Sars-CoV-2 strain that causes Covid-19 was isolated in ICMR-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, and transferred to Bharat Biotech on May 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-sets-aug-15-deadline-for-world-s-1st-covid-vaccine/story-ihgC6NFhEVeLFPBj9CLjHO.html
04-07-2020||India||Delhi may go past Covid peak in August if cases keep falling: Experts||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic will enter its post-peak period in Delhi in the first week of August if the Capital maintains a steady decline in cases — which have averaged at 2,494 a day over the past week compared to 3,446 daily cases the week before — according to public health experts.The experts said that the reduction marks a definite flattening in the new Covid-19 cases curve, but does not yet classify as a “reversal” of a peak because an untapped cluster or lack of precautions by people could still lead to a spike that pushes the daily cases higher than they have been so far. If the same trajectory continues, and new cases fall to about 1,500 a day for at least a week before falling further, then it can be said that the peak has passed, they added.Also read| Centre first opposed, then copied Delhi’s isolation rules: AAPActive Covid-19 cases, or the number of people currently infected in Delhi has averaged around 26,000 for the past three weeks despite testing going up three times from 6,130 tests on May 31, to 18,586 on June 30 -- which indicates an encouraging levelling off.Delhi’s current positivity rate is 15.9%, down from 37% on June 13, when one in three people being tested for Covid-19 were diagnosed with the infection, which has infected 94,695 and killed 2,923 since it was first reported in the Capital on March 2.“There has been a flattening, no doubt, with Delhi recording less than half of the numbers projected by the state government three weeks ago. If containment measures stay at the same levels, we would see a reduction by the end of the month and we will be over the peak in beginning of August. We can say the peak is over only after new cases have more than halved over a sustained period, say, from 3,000 a day to 1,500 day for at least a week,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, professor of pulmonology and director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).Other public health experts and epidemiologists agreed that the number of cases will fall by July-end, and accounting for slip-ups in containment, Delhi may get over the peak in early August.“With very energetic household surveillance and increased testing, case count will rise for a few weeks. If this is accompanied by effective contact tracing and isolation, the case count should start falling by late July or early August and daily death count a fortnight later,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India.Daily deaths on average declined marginally to 62 this week, from last week’s average of 66. Since corresponding reduction in deaths get reflected around two weeks days after a decline in infections, there is likely to be a fall in daily deaths in Deli in another week to 10 days, the experts said.“A fall in daily deaths over 10 consecutive days is a more stable indicator of decline in new cases as it accounts for undiagnosed cases as well. Deaths should be assessed accurately, both in and out of hospital, through testing and symptom-based verbal autopsy,” said Dr Reddy. Verbal autopsy is a public health tool relies on extensive interviews of health workers and caregivers to identify the cause of undiagnosed death symptomatically at the community or population level.“It’s difficult to predict peaks, whether it is in Delhi or Tamil Nadu, because a lot depends on human behaviour and the protective measures taken after opening up. Cases go up as restrictions lift, which makes it important to widen testing to detect and contain,” said Dr Manoj Murhekar, director, Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai.Also read| Coronavirus: After govt nod, Delhi hospitals start antigen testingThe average daily testing is at its peak in Delhi so far, with an average of 19,000 samples being tested a day over the past one week -- the highest per million population anywhere in India -- compared to 16,000 a week ago, and 7,000 a week before that.A post-peak period signifies that pandemic activity appears to be decreasing, but countries need to be prepared for additional waves, according to World Health Organisation (WHO). “Pandemics have been characterised by waves of activity spread over months... Pandemic waves can be separated by months and an immediate ‘at-ease’ signal may be premature. It is important to maintain surveillance and update pandemic preparedness and response plans accordingly,” according to a WHO document on pandemic phases .Dr Guleria cited the United States, where authorities thought they had a hold on the pandemic when cases fell after the New York peak and opened up too soon, leading to a second wave of infection. “The same happened in Bangalore, where cases rose after falling because the state opened up and people became complacent,” he said.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also warned against complacency in a web briefing on Thursday. “Experts are commenting on social media that Delhi’s peak has come and gone. Don’t listen to them. Wear masks, maintain social distancing, wash hands regularly, don’t make a mistake,” he said. “We have managed to bring the situation under control after a concerted effort. There is a saying, hope for the best, prepare for worst. That’s what we have to do.”Cases continue to rise in the rest of the country, however. India crossed 20,000 cases in a day for the third time on July 3, for a total tally of 649,425 at a doubling rate of 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-may-go-past-covid-peak-in-aug-if-cases-keep-falling-experts/story-nUyp7Wt3nYIjqdUTyby3DP.html
04-07-2020||India||Congress attacks PM Modi for not naming China||The Congress on Friday questioned when will India look Beijing in the eye while criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not naming China in his address to soldiers in Ladakh amid a military stand-off between the two countries in the region. In a tweet, Congress’s chief spokesperson, Randeep Singh Surjewala, asked why is “the Prime Minister of a strong India so weak?” He referred to Modi’s June 28 monthly radio broadcast, address to the nation two days later, and Friday’s speech in Ladakh and noted none of them mentioned China. “How long will he desist from taking China’s name?”Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi took a swipe at Modi, asking “who took our land” along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the de facto border with China. “Ladakhis say: China took our land. PM says: Nobody took our land. Obviously, someone is lying,” he tweeted with a short video tagged to it.The Prime Minister’s Office on June 20 clarified Modi’s remarks at an all-party meeting a day earlier that no intruder was on Indian territory across LAC with China and that no Indian military post had been captured were being given a “mischievous interpretation”. The clarification came after the Congress attacked Modi for surrendering Indian territory in the face of Chinese aggression.Modi, whose visit to Ladakh came days after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a clash with Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley on June 15, emphasised the time for expansionism is over. He added India is becoming stronger and its commitment to peace should not be seen as a sign of weakness.Another Congress leader, Manish Tewari, earlier referred to late former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s visit to Ladakh before the 1971 war that led to Bangladesh’s creation and added China was also then massing troops along the border there to take the heat off Pakistan. “After she [Indira Gandhi] visited Leh she sliced Pakistan into two. Let us see what he does?” Tewari tweeted. He tagged a picture of Indira Gandhi’s address to soldiers in Leh in 1971.“[Chinese] PLA [People’s Liberation Army] was massing troops in Galwan Valley to take heat of their ally Pakistan. 4th July 1971 Leh visit was a message to them to lay off. Like she never blinked when [US president Richard] Nixon sent the Seventh Fleet into the Bay of Bengal,” he said in another tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-attacks-pm-modi-for-not-naming-china/story-mlrdF1pr2voDZ4MC52MNkO.html
04-07-2020||India||Time not right to add to tension, says China||Beijing on Friday asked New Delhi to avoid any “strategic miscalculation on China,” and complications of tensions along the India-China border hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Ladakh amid a stand-off between Indian and Chinese troops there. Modi’s visit to Ladakh came days after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a clash there with Chinese troops on June 15. Speaking in Ladakh, Modi emphasised the time for expansionism is over. He added India is becoming stronger and its commitment to peace should not be seen as a sign of weakness.“India and China are in communication and negotiations on lowering the temperatures through military and diplomatic channels. No party should engage in any action that may complicate the situation at this point,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, said at a regular briefing on Friday.Modi’s visit is being closely monitored in China as New Delhi begins a calibrated response, including economic measures, to the standoff.Also read| ‘Expansionism era over, your fire and fury seen’: PM to soldiers in LadakhWhen asked about a possibility of a ban on Chinese companies from building roads in India, Zhao said New Delhi should focus on “common interests in bilateral relations”.“Certain politicians in India have been issuing remarks that are detrimental to our bilateral relations... Our bilateral relations need to be held with concerted efforts. The Indian side should work with us towards the same goal, to uphold the general picture of our common interests in bilateral relations,” Zhao said.“Setting artificial blocks to our concrete and practical cooperation will also harm India’s interest. We will take the necessary measures to uphold the legitimate rights of Chinese businesses in India.”Zhao sidestepped a question about India’s security-related concerns that prompted it to ban 59, mostly Chinese mobile applications, on Monday.“…we should also be aware that India and China are major developing countries; accelerating the renewal and development are historical missions for both of us. To this end, we have to respect and support each other. This is also in the long-term interest of both sides,” he said.Also read: Why is PM Modi talking about unnamed ‘enemy’ to Indians, jawans in Ladakh, asks Chidambaram“If we show misgiving and engage in conflicts, this is not the right way and also goes against the shared aspiration of our people.” He added India and China have to follow the consensus reached between the leaders of the two countries about bilateral relations. “The Indian side should not have strategic miscalculation on China. We hope it will work with China to uphold the overall picture of our bilateral relations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/time-not-right-to-add-to-tension-says-china/story-QKF8I7ysWVysCdqwMiWqkL.html
04-07-2020||India||Indo-China stand-off: Global support for India grows||Japan on Friday joined a list of countries that have backed India in its border stand-off with China in the wake of behind-the-scenes efforts by New Delhi to drum up support for its position opposing unilateral changes to the Line of Actual control (LAC).Here’s the position adopted by key players in the world community: The US: The White House on Wednesday unequivocally blamed Chinese “aggression” for the confrontation. Quoting President Donald Trump at a briefing, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said, “China’s aggressive stance along the India-China border fits with a larger a pattern of Chinese aggression in other parts of the world and these actions only confirm the true nature of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).” The US also welcomed India’s ban on Chinese apps, with secretary of state Mike Pompeo saying these apps “serve as appendages of the CCP’s surveillance state”.France:French defence minister Florence Parly conveyed “steadfast and friendly support” to her Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh in a letter on June 29, in which she also expressed “deep solidarity” over the death of 20 Indian soldiers in a violent-face-off with Chinese troops along the LAC on June 15.“This was a hard blow against the soldiers, their families, and the nation. In these difficult circumstances, I wish to express my steadfast and friendly support, along with that of the French armed forces,” Parly wrote, adding she was ready to meet Singh in India to follow up on their discussions. The move comes at a time when the French Navy is looking at ramping up joint exercises and patrols with the Indian Navy in the Indian Ocean region.Also read: PM Modi meets soldiers injured in Galwan Valley clash, says they make 130 cr Indians proudJapan:Japan on Friday backed India in the border standoff with China, saying it opposes any “unilateral attempt to change the status quo” on the LAC. Japanese ambassador Satoshi Suzuki tweeted about his country’s support following a conversation with Indian foreign secretary Harsh Shringla. “Japan also hopes for peaceful resolution through dialogues. Japan opposes any unilateral attempts to change the status quo,” he said in the tweet. The move was akin to Japan’s support to India during the 2017 Doklam stand-off with China. It came at a time when Japan is engaged in a row with China over Chinese vessels intruding into its territorial waters around the disputed Senkaku Islands.Australia:Prime Minister Scott Morrison referred to the India-China standoff when he launched Australia’s 2020 Defence Strategic Update and 2024 Structure Plan on Wednesday. “Tensions over territorial claims are rising across the Indo-Pacific region, as we have seen recently on the disputed border between India and China, and the South China Sea, and the East China Sea,” he said.The Indo-Pacific area is the epicentre of strategic competition and the risk of miscalculation and even conflict is growing, he said. While hiking Australia’s defence budget to $270 billion for a 10-year period, Morrison said it wouldn’t just be China and the US that will determine whether the region “stays on path for free and open trade, investment and cooperation”, but India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam too have choices to make and parts to play.The remarks came against the backdrop of Australia banning China’s Huawei from its 5G sector and blaming a “sophisticated state actor” for extensive cyber-attacks on the government, essential service providers and critical infrastructure.Asean:Though members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean)have been silent on the India-China standoff, the leaders of the 10 states in grouping recently rejected China’s claim to almost the whole of the South China Sea. They said the 1982 UN oceans treaty should be the basis of sovereign rights and entitlements in the disputed waters.The leaders took the position in a statement issued by Vietnam on behalf of the bloc on Saturday. “We reaffirmed that the 1982 UNCLOS is the basis for determining maritime entitlements, sovereign rights, jurisdiction and legitimate interests over maritime zones,” the statement said, referring to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which defines rights of nations to the oceans and demarcates exclusive economic zones. The move came as two US aircraft carriers began joint exercises in the Philippine Sea.The UK:Britain, which is having its own problems with China over a tough new security law for Hong Kong, said in reference to the India-China stand-off that “violence is in no one’s interest”. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday said China had committed a “clear and serious breach” of the agreement under which Hong Kong was handed over to Chinese authorities. Earlier, a British high commission spokesperson expressed concern about the stand-off with China and said, “We encourage China and India to engage in dialogue on issues relating to the border – violence is in no one’s interest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-support-for-india-grows/story-bnsZn2vwOoXFLLbnjxUHpO.html
04-07-2020||India||Tejashwi Yadav’s apology for ‘mistakes’ during RJD rule in Bihar election stunt: BJP||Leaders of the National Democratic Alliance in Bihar on Friday dismissed it as an “election stunt” the apology sought by RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav for “mistakes that might have happened” during his party’s 15-year-rule.Assembly elections in Bihar are due later this year.On Thursday, Tejashwi had said his party was in power for 15 years and there could have been some mistakes made.“ I seek forgiveness if our government made some mistakes during its 15-year rule. I was very young then and I do not know much about it. But I want to remind all that RJD chief Lalu Prasad ushered in social justice and nobody can deny it,” he said while addressing workers at the party office in Patna.The Bharatiya Janata Party and Janata Dal (United) have often called the Rashtriya Janata Dal’s reign as ‘jungle raj’. Tejashwi, on the other hand, has been seeking to corner the ruling alliance on “unabated migration, unemployment and other unfulfilled promises during 15 years of Nitish Kumar’s rule.Reacting to Tejashwi’s remarks, BJP state spokesperson Nikhil Anand called it an “election stunt”.“ Tejashwi seeking pardon for past mistakes in RJD rule is just an election stunt and a makeover attempt but people of Bihar will not fall in this trap. Just like the people of India will never forgive China and Pakistan for their anti -India activities and Congress would not be forgiven for Sikh riots and ruining Kashmir, people of Bihar will never forgive RJD for its mistakes,” Anand said. State minister and senior JD(U) leader Neeraj Kumar said the leader of the opposition should now acknowledge that his father and RJD chief Lalu Yadav and mother Rabri Devi were failures administratively and politically as they headed the government.“Tejashwi should now say who is responsible for the RJD government’s mistakes,” he said.“Tejashwi talks of ushering economic development. Isn’t he himself facing charges of corruption? The so-called claim of RJD of strengthening social justice is also a sham as several massacres took place during its government in which people from weaker sections were killed,” Kumar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tejashwi-yadav-s-apology-for-mistakes-during-rjd-rule-in-bihar-election-stunt-bjp/story-pySPtggcoPQRT0Kzfa9WRL.html
04-07-2020||India||PM Modi’s surprise visit to Ladakh is a game-changer: Experts||A range of experts and analysts believe that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Ladakh, and his speech to troops in the frontlines of the stand-off at the Line of Actual Control, is a possible “game-changer”, an expression of India’s “resolve” to beat Chinese aggression, a clear articulation of Indian redlines, and a message to China that since Beijing broke the relationship, it will have to fix it. Brahma Chellaney, a strategic analyst, suggested that after a period “a concerted government effort to downplay the Himalayan border confrontation and obscure China’s encroachments”, Modi’s visit to the Ladakh front had helped shine a spotlight on the “war-like situation” India confronts. “His speech underscores India’s resolve to beat back the Chinese aggression. And his reference to ‘expansionism’ echoes the mounting international concern over China’s imperial overreach under Xi Jinping, who has simultaneously opened multiple fronts.”Also read| Indo-China stand-off: Global support for India growsIn a reference to the PM’s speech at an all party meeting where he had appeared to suggest that there was no external intrusion (subsequently clarified by the Prime Minister’s Office as only pertaining to the situation in Galwan valley), Chellaney said, “By going to Ladakh, Modi has made amends for the confusion he sowed with his June 19 televised speech on the border situation.”Lieutenant General (retired) Syed Ata Hasnain said that the visit was a “game-changer”, and a part of India’s continuous “strategic messaging”.“Measures to convey a strong resolve through economic and other domains get hugely supplemented when the PM personally appears at the frontlines. The PM spoke of India’s pursuit of peace and development but that should not be construed as lack of resolve to defend its territorial integrity. Besides the morale boost to troops, the visit will force a Chinese review of its strategy of coercion it has adopted.” Hasnain added that it was a message to the world to stand up to “China’s hegemonistic ambitions”.The message of the speech, Sushant Sareen of the Observer Research Foundation said, was clear. “The door to diplomacy is open and every effort will be made to solve the situation peacefully. At the same time, a redline has been drawn. The PM’s address was a statement of resolve to not back down in face of Chinese bullying, threats and intimidation.” Sareen also saw a longer-term shift in India’s posture in the speech. “Most importantly, it is clear that the PM, who invested a lot in trying to win over China, has now given up. India-China relations are broken, even if this situation gets resolved. It will now take a lot to bring normalcy in the relationship and, as far as India is concerned, all heavy lifting will have to be done by China because it is responsible for damaging the relationship. They broke it, they must fix it.”Also read| ‘We’re bringing modern technology from around world for armed forces’: PM Modi at LadakhBut there were also voices which suggested that there must be a more cautious reading of the speech and what it represented. Christopher Clary, assistant professor of political science at the University at Albany, State University of New York and a scholar of South Asian security, said that the PM gave a “boilerplate speech”. “His praise for the sacrifice and bravery of India’s jawans, while heartfelt, was also the least he could do after the events of the last two months. His assertion that the age of expansionism was over perhaps suggests his earlier assurances that China had not expanded into Indian territory were incorrect.” But, he added, that by going to Leh, the PM made “a modest implicit commitment”. “While he did not promise to avenge the fallen, as he did after the 2019 Pulwama attack, his speech would make any further Chinese encroachments on the frontier somewhat more embarrassing. This was not a game changing speech, nor was it a concession that the game was over.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-s-surprise-visit-is-a-game-changer-experts/story-rQp6VUcjtCul8cTNcuGGFK.html
04-07-2020||India||To avoid large crowds amid Covid-19, TMC to take annual event to booth level workers||The ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal is planning to take its annual flagship show – the Martyr’s Day rally on July 21 – to the booth level this time to avoid any large gathering during the Covid-19 pandemic.“It would be a mix-and-match of ground level programs followed by a virtual address by party chief Mamata Banerjee,” said a senior Trinamool Congress leader.West Bengal chief minister and the party’s supremo Mamata Banerjee held a meeting with her party colleagues on Friday to decide on the campaign strategy for the annual event.“While small gatherings would be held at the booth level by leaders and party workers at on that day from 1 pm to 2 pm following all social distancing norms, Banerjee will virtually address the leaders and workers from 2 pm to 3 pm,” said another leader, who attended a meeting.This year, the July 21 rally is being perceived to be all the more important because Mamata could lay down the road map for the crucial Assembly polls next year.Banerjee had earlier said that this year’s Martyr’’s Day programme would be different in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak and the subsequent restrictions on social gatherings across the country.The July 21 Martyrs’ Day Rally has over the years become the Trinamool Congress’ flagship political event and is organized to commemorate the police firing in the state capital on July 21, 1993, in which 13 people were killed during a demonstration by the West Bengal Youth Congress. Banerjee was leading that demonstration.The state’’s ruling Trinamool Congress observes July 21 as Martyr’s Day every year in remembrance of the 13 people shot by the police in Kolkata during a rally organised by the state Youth Congress under Mamata Banerjee’s leadership in 1993, demanding that voter’s identity cards be made the sole required document for casting votes.The TMC’s biggest political adversary, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has already gone virtual with Union home minister Amit Shah holding an onlinel rally on June 9 to address party workers and supporters in Bengal.“The path of holding mega rallies virtually was shown by the BJP. Now they are following us. But it won’t be possible for them to organise it on such a mega scale as we did,” said Sayantan Basu, general secretary of the BJP’s unit in Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-avoid-large-crowds-amid-covid-19-tmc-to-take-annual-event-to-booth-level-workers/story-tjSU0FDHLE7DLxwY4JrJRM.html
04-07-2020||India||Govt asks Priyanka Gandhi to vacate bungalow by Aug 1||The ministry of housing and urban affairs on Wednesday cancelled the government accommodation provided to Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra at 56, Lodhi Estate, on the grounds that she is no longer protected by the Special Protection Group (SPG) and so was not eligible for living in the bungalow in the elite Lutyens’ Delhi .“Consequent upon withdrawal of SPG protection and grant of Z+ security cover by Ministry of Home Affairs, which does not have provision for allotment/retention of Government accommodation on security grounds to you, the allotment of Type 68 house No. 35, Lodhi Estate, New Delhi is hereby cancelled w.e.f 01/07/2020. One month concessional period on the same rent up to 01.08.2020 is allowed as per rule,” the letter sent by the ministry said.“Any stay beyond 01.08.2020 will attract damage charges/penal rent as per rules,” it added in the letter, a copy of which has been seen by HT.The ministry has also said that Priyanka Gandhi had accumulated dues of RS 3,46,677 towards the accommodation until June 30. “She has been issued noticed to clear these dues and rent for the period (till) she vacates the accommodation,” the ministry said.Hours after the order, Priyanka Gandhi paid what she owed for living in the house.“Ms Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has made online payment of balance amount due on her. Hence, now dues as on 30.06.2020 is Nil against her,” a spokesperson for the ministry of housing and urban affairs said.“The notice to clear Priyanka’s house shows the uneasiness of Modi ji-Yogi ji. We are not afraid of the frustrated decisions of the authoritarian government,” Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath. Priyanka Gandhi has been active on the ground in Uttar Pradesh and had a run-in with the local administration over organising buses to transport migrant workers stranded in other states back to Uttar Pradesh. She is a general secretary of the party in charge of the state. An aide said Priyanka Gandhi planned to move to Lucknow in February to handle her work. “She has readied a home (late Congress leader Sheila Kaul’s house) there, and if it wasn’t for the pandemic, she would have moved there already. Now, we don’t know whether she will move there, but it was the plan before coronavirus struck,” he said on the condition of anonymity.According to the current norms, there are no provisions for allotment or retention of government accommodation to those with Z+ security unless exceptions are made based on recommendations given by the home ministry. “Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has been assigned Z+ security with CRPF {Central Reserve Police Force} cover on all-India basis, which does not have any provision for allotment/ retention of Government accommodation on that ground. She is not a SPG protectee now. Persons with Z+ security cover are not entitled for Government accommodation. Exceptions can be made only by CCA (Cabinet Committee on Accommodation) based on security perception assessment by MHA on their recommendation,” a housing and urban affairs ministry official said on condition of anonymity.“In view of this, she is no longer entitled for Government accommodation and her allotment has been cancelled by the Directorate of Estates,” the official added.The Centre decided to take away the elite SPG protection from Congress president Sonia Gandhi, her son Rahul Gandhi and daughter Priyanka Gandhi in November last year. The family was given ‘Z+’ security by the CRPF. Prior to that centre had also withdrawn SPG cover of former prime minister Manmohan Singh.The SPG is a federal law enforcement agency under the Cabinet Secretariat charged providing proximate security to the Prime Minister of India, former Prime Minister and their immediate family members.Priyanka Gandhi was allotted 35, Lodhi Estate on February 21, 1997 on security grounds as an SPG protectee.“Cabinet Committee on Accommodation (CCA) in its meeting held on 07.12.2000 reviewed the guidelines on allotment of Government accommodation on security grounds and decided that in future no private person, other than those who are SPG protectees, shall be given government accommodation on security grounds. Such allotments were to be done at the market rate i.e. 50 times of normal rent,” the official cited above said.A the decision to modify the rules was formally taken by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government in 2015. Senior Congress leader and Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh, protested the move and urged the Centre to revoke the order, citing the perceived security threat to the Gandhi family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-asks-priyanka-gandhi-to-vacate-bungalow-by-aug-1/story-2dRI5W8BeaXrcvGdM2PSGJ.html

04-07-2020||India||India is planning to topple my govt over map row: Nepal PM||New DelhiNepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Sunday accused India of being behind a conspiracy to topple him for publishing the country’s new map that depicts Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepalese territory. India has traditionally claimed these, and Nepal’s new claim has worsened relations between the two nations.Oli made the remarks while addressing a meeting held in Kathmandu to mark the birth anniversary of late communist leader Madan Bhandari. The comments come at a time when Oli is facing intense criticism from within the ruling Nepal Communist Party for his governance and handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and there is a theory that, just like the map crisis that he precipitated, he may be creating a bogey of a coup to stay ahead.“A conspiracy is being hatched to remove me for releasing the country’s new map and getting it adopted through Parliament. In light of these discussions, the media reports from New Delhi, [the Indian] embassy’s activities and meetings in different hotels in Kathmandu, it’s not difficult to understand how people are openly active to topple me,” Oli said, speaking in Nepali.He added, “There is a race to remove me. It has been said people who commit such crimes should not be allowed to stay. Printing a map is called a crime.”There was no immediate reaction to Oli’s remarks from Indian officials. The Indian side has described Nepal’s new map as an “artificial enlargement of territorial claims” and said the onus is on the Nepalese side to create a positive atmosphere for talks to resolve the border row.On June 18, Nepal’s President Bidya Devi Bhandari signed the bill to give legal backing to the new map after it was approved by both houses of Parliament.During an ongoing meeting of the standing committee of the Nepal Communist Party, Oli has faced withering criticism from the faction led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”. A majority of members of the committee are with Prachanda and Oli skipped the committee’s session on Friday. Oli has also said several times that his stance on a nationalistic issue such as the new map will lead to efforts to oust him.“Nepal’s nationalism is not so weak that someone can dream of removing the country’s prime minister for publishing the new map and making it part of the Constitution...It is unthinkable,” Oli said on Sunday.Nepal hadn’t made a mistake as it has only asked for its own land back, and it has not claimed or tried to grab anyone else’s land, he said.Oli also contended he had been removed as the premier in 2016 for signing a transport and transit agreement with China. “Now, they’re having the same dream because the constitutional amendment has been passed and the map has been issued. They are upset on the inside for this crime being committed,” he said.He added that he didn’t covet the post but it was essential for him to remain. If he stepped down at this juncture, it would set a wrong precedent and any other premier who spoke in favour of Nepal would also be forced to quit, he said.The new map became a popular issue among the public and gained widespread backing from all political parties. However, experts said Oli himself doesn’t enjoy the same sort of popularity within his own party.Experts said Oli’s remarks pointed to bilateral ties hitting a new low. Constantino Xavier of Brookings India said in a tweet: “Whether he is right or not, PM Oli’s remarks reflect his internal weakness [and] concern [and a] total breakdown in ties with India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-is-planning-to-topple-my-govt-over-map-row-nepal-pm/story-4laWNuK5dMgbTpWJt1H4ZM.html
04-07-2020||India||KCR restores full salaries to employees and pensioners after three months of salary cuts||After facing salary cuts in the last three months, all the employees and pensioners of the Telangana government will get their full salaries from July1..A decision to this effect was taken by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao after a meeting with the officials of the finance department on Tuesday.“Since the state economy is getting better to some extent, the salaries of the state government employees and pensioners will be paid in full for this month,” an official statement from the chief minister’s office said.The Telangana government have been enforcing salary cuts ranging from 10 per cent to 75 per cent for all the government employees, all India service officials and elected public representatives with effect from March in view of the financial crisis arising out of lockdown imposed to contain Coronavirus spread.Now that the lockdown has been lifted and economic activity has picked up over the last one month, the financial position of the state has improved some extent. Accordingly, the employees and pensioners would get full salaries for the month of June to paid on July 1.Interestingly, it was only on June 17 that the KCR government promulgated the Telangana Disaster and Public Health Emergency (Special Provisions) Ordinance 2020 seeking to defer payment of salaries, pensions and other dues in the event of disaster and public health emergency in the State.The ordinance empowered the government to defer payment of monthly pay, pension or remuneration to the employee, pensioner or other persons to the extent not exceeding half (50 per cent) the total monthly payment during crisis period. Further, the ordinance mandates the government to pay the deferred amount within six months from the date of deferment. However, the State government may make amendments.This ordinance was challenged by a section of employees and pensioners in the high court, which served notices on the government to submit a counter explaining the reasons for imposing salary cuts. Even before the case came up for hearing, the state government has restored the full salaries for employees and pensioners from this month.Neighbouring Andhra Pradesh government led by Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy had already restored full salary to all its employees and pensioners with effect from May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kcr-restores-full-salaries-to-employees-and-pensioners-after-three-months-of-salary-cuts/story-M4ExaVfQfjFwosp4CCeGbJ.html

The police officer’s team also joins her in the video. “As we fight a continuous battle against Covid-19, we are working very long working hours with no break, so I thought of boosting my team’s morale with a dance. We could so relate to the song…when our loved ones ask, ke ghar kab aaoge,” says Pachisia, who is known as Lady Singham of her area.One day, Pachisia was talking to her team, and the pent up pain came out. “One day, I asked my team if they had any complaints, some said they were away from family for days, some were missing their mother who was alone, some had not seen their children, some had health issues. They were feeling low, so I thought of boosting their mood, and make them feel that we are family,” she says. She asked everyone to share to whatever talent they had. When nobody came ahead, she took the lead and started dancing and singing. Soon, her entire team joined her.Pachisia says such mood-lifting activities help them prepare for the spirit-sapping conditions that they face everyday. “We come across a lot of depressing incidents whole day..someone is starving, someone needs urgent medical care, some woman has been battered by her husband, taking advantage of the lockdown. In such circumstances, one needs to have nerves of steel. Unless we bond as a team, and keep our spirits really high, we will give in to gloom. Singing and dancing are great activities to build team spirit and heal the mind and the soul,” she says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/this-lady-singham-from-mp-is-beating-gloom-with-singing-and-dancing-with-her-team/story-3EyA9eWQxXPEGU9iKbHi7O.html
